 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, I rise today as the Senate begins  consideration of the nomination of Mr. Rex Tillerson to serve as the  69th Secretary of State of the United States of America. I thank Mr.  Tillerson for his willingness to serve our Nation and for his  participation in a lengthy, wide-ranging hearing before the Senate  Foreign Relations Committee, where I have the honor of being the senior  Democrat, the ranking Democrat on the committee.   Earlier today, I thanked Chairman Corker for the courtesies he showed  during the hearing process. However, as I stated yesterday, I remain  concerned that Mr. Tillerson's demonstrated business orientation in his  responses to questions during the confirmation hearing would prevent  him from being a Secretary of State who forcefully promotes the values  and ideals that have defined our country and our leading role in the  world for more than 200 years. I, therefore, will not be supporting his  nomination.   Given the events over the weekend, I believe it is important that I  begin today's debate by painting a picture for the American people of  the unstable, reckless foreign policy that Mr. Tillerson is going to be  asked to carry out under President Trump. It is painfully obvious that  when the President says ``America first,'' the cumulative result of his  vision would actually lead to America alone and America at risk.   From time to time, in our Nation's history, we have heard the calls  of isolationism, but isolationism did not work then and it will not  work now. It is an approach that our history has taught us, time and  time again, undermines our interests, makes us vulnerable to those who  wish us harm, betrays our values, and leaves us less secure and less  prosperous.   America's leadership, rooted in our values, makes the world a better  place for all, but the first 10 days of the Trump administration shows  that the President is intent on compromising our values, abandoning our  allies, and using a sledgehammer instead of a scalpel to conduct the  detailed, careful work of safeguarding our Nation. Some of his  supporters chalk it up to inexperience. My own chairman has said on  numerous occasions that he wishes the President had more flushed-out  ideas on foreign policy space.   What the American people witnessed in the last 10 days goes beyond  inexperience. There is a willful, dangerous campaign underway by forces  in this administration to bend or potentially even break the law. More  than ever, we need to reaffirm and adhere to the values that make our  country so strong and so stable, the city on the hill that others look  to for leadership.   In order to do that, we need leaders who will not shy away from our  values, who will sound a certain trumpet for human rights, the rule of  law, and bedrock American values.   Mr. Tillerson's timid equivocation on American values throughout his  confirmation process, his trumpet's uncertain sound was alarming  because he will be working for a President clearly willing to  compromise America's values at every turn. There are many individuals  who have served in both Republican and Democratic administrations who  recognize this Executive order for what it is.   I have in my hand a letter from over 100 former Cabinet Secretaries,  senior government officials, diplomats, military servicemembers, and  intelligence community professionals who have served in the Bush and  Obama administrations. The letter, to the heads of the Departments of  Homeland Security, Justice, and State, expresses deep concern that the  Executive order issued over the weekend jeopardizes tens of thousands  of lives, has caused a crisis here in America, and will do long-term  damage to our national security.   It strongly recommends the President rescind this order. I ask  unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record. There  being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the  Record, as follows:                                                   January 30, 2017.      Hon. John F. Kelly,      Secretary, Department of Homeland Security,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Sally Yates,      Acting Attorney General,      Department of Justice,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Thomas A. Shannon,      Acting Secretary, Department of State,      Washington, DC.        Secretary Kelly, Acting Attorney General Yates, Acting       Secretary Shannon: As former cabinet Secretaries, senior       government officials, diplomats, military service members and       intelligence community professionals who have served in the       Bush and Obama administrations, we, the undersigned, have       worked for many years to make America strong and our homeland       secure. Therefore, we are writing to you to express our deep       concern with President Trump's recent Executive Order       directed at the immigration system, refugees and visitors to       this country. This Order not only jeopardizes tens of  [[Page S507]]       thousands of lives, it has caused a crisis right here in       America and will do long-term damage to our national       security.        In the middle of the night, just as.we were beginning our       nation's commemoration of the Holocaust, dozens of refugees       onboard flights to the United States and thousands of       visitors were swept up in an Order of unprecedented scope,       apparently with little to no oversight or input from national       security professionals.        Individuals, who have passed through multiple rounds of       robust security vetting, including just before their       departure, were detained, some reportedly without access to       lawyers, right here in U.S. airports. They include not only       women and children whose lives have been upended by actual       radical terrorists, but brave individuals who put their own       lives on the line and worked side-by-side with our men and       women in uniform in Iraq now fighting against ISIL. Now,       because of actions taken by this White House, their lives       have been disrupted and they may even be in greater danger if       they are sent home. Many more thousands going through the       process will now be left behind. More broadly, tens of       thousands of other travelers, including dual citizens and, at       one point, legal U.S. residents face deep uncertainty about       whether they may even travel to the United States or risk       leaving and being barred reentry.        Many of us have worked for years to keep America safe from       terrorists. Many of us were on the job working for our       country on 9/11 and need no reminder just how vital it is to       destroy terrorist networks and bring partners to our side in       that global effort. Simply put, this Order will harm our       national security. Partner countries in Europe and the Middle       East, on whom we rely for vital counterterrorism cooperation,       are already objecting to this action and distancing       themselves from the United States, shredding years of effort       to bring them closer to us. Moreover, because the Order       discriminates against Muslim travelers and immigrants, it has       already sent exactly the wrong message to the Muslim       community here at home and all over the world: that the U.S.       government is at war with them based on their religion. We       may even endanger Christian communities, by handing ISIL a       recruiting tool and propaganda victory that spreads their       horrific message that the United States is engaged in a       religious war. We need to take every step we can to counter       violent extremism, not to feed into it by fueling ISIL       propaganda.        Perhaps the most tragic irony of this episode is that it is       unnecessary. We do not need to turn America into a fortress       to keep it secure. Since the 9/11 attacks, the United States       has developed a rigorous system of security vetting,       leveraging the full capabilities of the law enforcement and       intelligence communities. This vetting is applied to       travelers not once, but multiple times. Refugees receive even       further scrutiny. In fact, successive administrations have       worked to improve this vetting on a near continuous basis,       through robust information sharing and data integration to       identify potential terrorists. Since 9/11 not a single major       terrorist attack has been perpetrated by travelers from the       countries named in the Order.        The suddenness of this Order is also troubling. The fact       that individuals cleared for admission were literally in the       air as the Order went into effect speaks to the haste with       which it was developed and implemented. We are concerned that       this Order received little, if any scrutiny by the       Departments of State, Justice, and Homeland Security or the       Intelligence Community. Now that some of these individuals       are here in the United States, and thousands of others are       stranded, our government's response has appeared disorganized       and chaotic. As lawyers take steps to protect their clients       who have been detained here or stranded at many other       airports, the U.S. government will continue to face a flurry       of legal challenges, which could have been avoided.       Additionally, by banning travel by individuals cooperating       against ISIL, we risk placing our military and diplomatic       efforts at risk by sending a clear message to those citizens       and all Muslims that the United States does not have their       backs. Already, the international push-back has been immense,       and threatens to jeopardize critical counterterrorism       cooperation.        Fortunately, there is a way out of this self-made crisis.       We know that your agencies did not create this situation and       we particularly respect that many of you are working to       mitigate its damage. Effective immediately, you can apply the       discretion given to you under the President's Order to admit       into the country the men, women and children who are       currently still stranded in airports. The process for doing       this is well known to the security professionals within your       departments. We urge you to execute it. While it is good to       see the withdrawal of the application of the Order to legal       permanent residents of the United States, your Departments       can immediately work to allow other classes of people into       the country, and remove the discriminatory prioritization       implicit within the Order. Most critically, we urge you to       draw on the insight of the professionals in your departments       to recommend that the President revisit and rescind this       Order. Blanket bans of certain countries or classes of people       is inhumane, unnecessary and counterproductive from a       security standpoint, and beneath the dignity of our great       nation.

Mr. Tillerson needs to answer whether he supports Mr.  Trump's decision this weekend to ban Muslims, to keep green card  holders out of the country, and state his view on the chaos that ensued  from the terrible implementation of this terrible policy. We asked Mr.  Tillerson during the confirmation hearing whether he supported a Muslim  ban. He would not give us a clear answer, and he did not speak out  against an unconstitutional Muslim ban.   Just today, I have sent a letter, as the ranking Democrat on the  Senate Foreign Relations Committee, to Mr. Tillerson asking his  specific views on the President's Executive order, what impacts that  will have on America's credibility, what impact that will have on  America's ability to work with our strategic partners around the world.  I hope he will respond to us so we know his views on the President's  Executive order before we are called upon to vote on his nomination.   I ask unanimous consent that a copy of that letter be printed in the  Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                               United States Senate,                                  Committee on Foreign Relations,                                   Washington, DC, January 31, 2017.      Mr. Rex Tillerson,      CEO, Exxon Mobil Corporation,      Irving, TX.        Dear Mr. Tillerson: As the Senate Foreign Relations       Committee and the full Senate consider your nomination to       serve as Secretary of State, I write to seek your views about       the Executive Order, ``Protecting the Nation from Foreign       Terrorist Entry into the United States,'' signed by President       Trump on January 27, 2017. I am concerned that the text of       the Executive Order and its haphazard implementation over the       weekend run counter to our American values and the U.S.       Constitution, as well as our national security and economic       interests.        Do you support the Executive Order's indefinite denial of       entry to Syrian refugees and the 120-day suspension of the       entire U.S. Refugee Resettlement Program, which impacts       20,000 refugees and will, in practice, grind all refugee       processing to a halt for many months?        Do you agree with President Trump's assertion that our       country should give preference to Christians seeking to       obtain visas or admission to the U.S? If so, do you think       this action is consistent with our nation's bedrock       principles of liberty and religious freedom?        What process would you support to identify an individual's       religion prior to receiving a visa, admission, or other       immigration benefit?        In your view, what message does barring individuals that       have served our military in Iraq send to our partners abroad?       Does that policy harm our national security and bilateral       relationships?        Given this order's deliberate targeting of certain       countries and disproportionate impact on Muslims, what will       be the implications for our relationships with foreign       countries that are predominantly Muslim? Do you think this       order give fodder to ISIL's recruitment efforts in framing       the U.S. war against terrorism as really a war on Islam?        I urge you to be forthright and thorough in your answers.       Many thanks for your cooperation on this matter.            Sincerely,                                                Benjamin L. Cardin,                                             United States Senator.     Mr. President, it remains to be seen whether Mr.  Tillerson has the moral compass necessary to counsel the President  toward a coherent U.S. foreign policy that advances our national  security and embraces our values and ideals or if he will be another  yes-man, enabling the risky, chaotic whims of a demagogue President,  who is leading us on a march of folly.   The American people deserve to know because if the last 10 days are  any indication, the Trump administration is on a track to be the most  dangerous and divisive in history. Nothing so painfully illustrates  that point as Friday's Executive order banning refugees and certain  Muslim immigrants from entering the United States. As a citizen of this  great Nation, I am deeply offended by and ashamed of the President's  Executive actions.   When the news of this developed over the weekend, I happened to be  attending a family wedding in the Miami area, a city rich in its  immigrant character and its welcoming nature to people of many faiths  and backgrounds.   Miami was also the city where one of the most shameful episodes in  our history transpired, where in 1993, the St. Louis, filled with  Jewish refugees trying to flee the horrors of Nazi Germany waited for  days, seeing the lights of the city ashore, seeking shelter and refuge.  Shamefully, we turned the St. Louis away and condemned many of its  passengers to death in the Holocaust.   We say never again. Yet fear and uncertainty was palatable this  weekend in Miami and across the country. I have heard from constituents  who were temporarily detained and arrested or whose loved ones had  scheduled legal travel to the United States but were unsure if they  should board their planes for fear of being arrested or turned around  once they arrived.   I am aware of students studying legally here in the United States who  suddenly found their entire future in jeopardy because of their  nationality. Maryland is proud to host world-class universities like  Johns Hopkins and the University of Maryland, colleges that are  enriched by the contributions and perspectives of foreign citizens.   Permanent legal residents who endured a lengthy process to acquire  their green card and make the United States their home were suddenly  unsure if they belonged. I was particularly troubled when two Iraqi  citizens, who have played critical roles in supporting America's forces  in Iraq, and were traveling on valid visas, were denied entry into New  York. What do they get for helping our brave men and women with  translation and security services? A big ugly ``Not Welcome'' sign at  JFK Airport. Adding insult to injury, their immediate families were  already here in the United States.   The cumulative effect of this Executive order is enough to make your  stomach churn because what President Trump tried to do was legalize  discrimination based on religion and nationality. As President Trump  said, giving preference to Christians is going to be OK. As Trump  adviser Rudy  [[Page S509]]  Giuliani said, this is a way to legalize a Muslim ban.   So I was relieved when Federal judge Ann Donnelly issued a stay on  Saturday evening to stop the madness, at least temporarily. Other  judges around the Nation acted accordingly as well, affirming certain  rights of green card holders and legal permanent residents, but too  many innocent people remain in limbo. My staff's communications with  Cabinet agencies over the weekend were extremely troubling. The left  hand did not know what the right hand was doing in the Trump  administration. In the zeal to play politics and inflame the fears of  Americans who feel threatened, the White House revealed how little they  knew or cared about governing.   It was reported that Secretary Kelly did not have a proper  opportunity to view the Executive order before it was issued, a  sobering lesson I hope Mr. Tillerson has paid close attention to. The  Department of Homeland Security has now belatedly begun to engage on  issuing guidance, but I fear the damage has been done.   Clearly, the Department of Justice was not part of developing the  Executive order, as Acting Attorney General Sally Yates said, boldly,  that she was not convinced that the Executive order was lawful. As a  result, President Trump fired her--the Monday night massacre. Our voice  must be loud and clear. Mr. Trump, this is our country, a country that  stands for the highest principles, supported by the rule of law.   If Ms. Yates' firing is any indication as to how President Trump will  handle different views, our Democratic institutions of checks and  balances will indeed be challenged. The White House Press Secretary,  Sean Spicer, said that foreign service officers using the dissent  channel to express their views on the immigration Executive order  should ``either get with the program or they can go.''   The dissent channel was set up during the Vietnam war as a way for  foreign service officers and civil servants to raise concerns with  upper management about the direction of U.S. foreign policy without  fear of retribution. It is for ``consideration of responsible,  dissenting and alternative views on substantive foreign policy issues  that cannot be communicated in a full and timely manner through regular  operating channels or procedures.''   This process for the use of dissent channels was codified in the  Foreign Affairs Manual in 1971, which dictates that dissent cables are  sent to the Departments' policy planning directors who distribute them  to the Secretary of State and other top officials who must respond  within 30 to 60 days. There are typically about four or five each year.  Freedom from reprisal from dissent user channels is strictly enforced,  but the President's Press Secretary said they can go.   What type of free discussion do we want to have in this country?  Where are the checks and balances? Where is the willingness to listen  to different views?   The President also put a 4-month freeze in place on all refugees  entering the United States, singling out refugees from certain Muslim- majority countries for extra screening, failing to acknowledge or speak  about the thorough 18- to 24-month screening process that refugees from  dangerous countries, such as Iraq and Syria, already endure before they  come to our Nation. We have the toughest screening now. I am not sure  what the President is talking about when he says additional screening.  We already have the toughest screening. They already go through the  United Nations. They are already interviewed. Their background is  checked.   Moving forward, the number of refugees entering the United States  will fall by 50 percent. It is clear that the President of the United  States has a fundamental misunderstanding of America's leading role on  refugee resettlement. Today, I will meet with King Abdallah of Jordan,  a nation that has accepted 650,000 Syrian refugees. And President Trump  is holding our program to accept approximately 10,000 Syrian refugees,  placing it on hold.    Jordan is one of America's global partners in fighting extremism. It  will be interesting to see the reactions we get from our partners.   If we close our doors to refugees, we will not only close our doors  to U.S. humanitarian values but also severely damage America's global  credibility on universal values.   The United States is a nation of immigrants and refugees from all and  no faiths. We learned from our mistake with the St. Louis, and we are  the Nation that received refugees from the Holocaust after the Second  World War. We are the Nation that opened our doors to hundreds of  thousands of citizens fleeing conflicts and political oppression in El  Salvador, Cuba, Vietnam, and Cambodia.   The United States must continue to lead by example, but President  Trump's cruel Executive order on immigrants and refugees undermines our  core values and traditions, threatens our national security, and  demonstrates a complete lack of understanding of our strict vetting  process--the most thorough in the world. It is a dangerous and  shortsighted policy that erodes our moral leadership and harms our  national security as well as our alliances and partnerships worldwide.   This is not the kind of America that Americans deserve.   Also over the weekend, President Trump spoke with Russian President  Vladimir Putin. There has been perhaps no other issue that has so  pitted President Trump against the interests of the United States than  Russia. Reflexively, the President will not utter basic truths about  Mr. Putin's Russia, such as these: The annexation of Crimea, Ukraine,  is illegal; they committed war crimes in Syria; and they sought to  create doubt about and potentially influence the election that saw him  elected President, as our intelligence community has now overwhelmingly  confirmed.   There is no more fundamental interest that we have as Americans than  our democracy. Let's be clear: Just as with Pearl Harbor or September  11, in this past election, the United States was attacked by a foreign  power. President Trump does not even seem to care that we were attacked  or, worse, does not seem to believe that we need to stand up and defend  our democracy and our form of government. I find that unfathomable.   The phone calls this weekend came against the backdrop of President  Trump and his aides floating the idea of lifting our current sanctions  on Russia. So Russia has invaded Ukraine, has committed war crimes in  Syria, has attacked our free democratic system, and we are talking  about easing sanctions on Russia? It is such a miscarriage of justice  and accountability that they do not understand or won't acknowledge the  gravity of what Russia seeks to do here in our country and around the  world.   It is, therefore, incumbent on Congress to act. I am pleased to have  bipartisan support for my effort to impose additional sanctions on  Russia as well as require the President to seek congressional approval  before he rolls back current sanctions. Sanction relief can only come  when Russia has changed its behavior, and I see no indication that that  will come any time soon.   The unclassified reports released by the intelligence community  earlier this month says that Russia's intelligence tried to access  multiple State or local election boards. They also confirmed that  Russia has researched U.S. electoral procedures and related technology  and equipment, though they were clear in their assessment that there  was no evidence at this time that Russia interfered in the actual vote  tabulation.   An America that becomes passive or willfully blind to a resurgent  Russia is not the kind of America that the American people deserve, and  it is imperative that the administration understand this and act  accordingly. What the American people don't need is the White House  focusing on a trial balloon last week that fell like a lead ball.   Some in the administration thought it would be a good idea to bring  back the notorious black sites--secret prisons--from a decade ago,  where our intelligence picked up foreign nationals suspected of  terrorism connections, hid them, and, in some cases, tortured them or  allowed the prison's host country to torture them.   Perhaps nothing did more harm to our credibility and boost terrorist  recruitment during the early years of the Iraq war than the dangerous,  amoral  [[Page S510]]  practice of rendition, secret detention, and interrogation by torture.  We cannot go back to those practices if we value maintaining the  perception and the reality of the United States of America as a beacon  of justice, law, and human rights for the world.   Make no mistake, this approach, like the immigration Executive order,  endangers American citizens and personnel abroad and is a boon to ISIS  and like-minded groups. It validates their propaganda, aids their  recruitment and incitement of homegrown terrorism in the United States  and the West, and encourages attacks against America abroad. General  Mattis gets it; why can't the President?   President Trump must never let this Executive order see the light of  day. This is not the kind of America that the American people deserve.   Let me turn now to our relationship with our neighbors, our most  important international relationships.   Since entering the political arena 18 months ago, candidate Trump was  consistent in his treatment of Mexican immigrants and refugees,  referring to them on day one of his Presidential campaign as drug  users, criminals, and rapists.   So Mr. Tillerson's job was shaping up to be difficult enough. It got  even harder last week. In the last 5 days, President Trump has insulted  the Mexican President and people with his Executive orders on border  wall construction and the treatment of immigrants and refugees at our  border, as well as stoked fear throughout sanctuary and welcoming  cities in the United States that resources could be cut and innocent  people could be apprehended, breaking up and devastating families.   The President's new Secretary of Homeland Security said pointedly  that a wall will not work, and Mr. Trump missed a real opportunity at  the outset of his Presidency to advance both comprehensive immigration  reform and border security, which go hand in hand.   We did that a few years ago. That is what the President should have  come in with and used his Presidency to pass comprehensive immigration  reform, as we did. Instead, he wants to build a wall.   Turning away legitimate asylum seekers at the border or requiring  mandatory detention of families and children will do nothing to make  America safer. Such cruel actions will inevitably bring harm and  potential death to survivors of violence and torture, including many  women and children, while undermining America's values and damaging our  relationships with our allies.   Why the President would deliberately pick a fight with the President  of Mexico is truly puzzling.   Not to be outdone after being embarrassed by the President of  Mexico's cancellation of his visit to Washington, the President doubled  down and had the audacity to suggest that the cost of constructing a  border wall should be passed on to the hardworking American families,  not once but twice. The first is by inserting it in the budget. That is  taxpayer dollars paying to build a wall that won't work. The second is  through a tax on Mexican imports which will, in turn, be paid for by  American consumers. All the while, he continues to blow smoke and say  that we will continue to find a way for Mexico to ultimately pay for  this dream wall.   It won't happen. This is not the kind of America that the American  people deserve.   Lastly, I want to point out that, in his third day of office, just  one day after the 44th anniversary of the landmark Roe v. Wade Supreme  Court decision, President Trump reinstated the controversial global gag  rule that would cut off U.S. family planning funding to any nonprofit  group overseas that provides any information about abortion in their  health care services for women and families in need.   In other words, this is not about U.S. money supporting abortion  services. It is about working with organizations.   Now, Republican Presidents routinely reinstate this harmful rule, but  President Trump's global gag order is even more extreme. It massively  expands his already harmful policy to threaten all U.S. foreign aid  assistance to nonprofit groups engaged in health in the developing  world. That will significantly increase the jeopardy of cutting off  U.S. funding to international health efforts.   We are talking about millions of more women and families. Without  funding these organizations, we will not be able to provide HIV  prevention, care and treatment services to those in need, provide  integrated maternal health care with contraceptive services, or counsel  women on the potential risk of Zika infection, among many other  activities. This is very counterproductive to U.S. goals and interests.   This is not the kind of America the American people deserve. The  American people deserve leadership that will make them safer and more  secure, that will increase our prosperity, and that will advance our  values and serve as an example to the world. That America, Mr.  President, is also an America that can lead the world and that the  world will want to work with.   The state of world affairs has been precarious for some time now.  Almost single-handedly, President Trump is inflaming previously  simmering situations, while creating new problems where they previously  did not exist.   World leaders are chastising us. Innocent people are looking at us in  fear. Terrorists are gearing up to use Trump's hate-mongering in their  recruitment and anti-American propaganda. We will be less safe, not  safer. He will be putting Americans at risk here at home and those  traveling abroad.   As we do debate Mr. Tillerson's nomination, we cannot lose sight of  the fact that he will be carrying out the foreign policy of the most  dangerous, unstable, thin-skinned, and inexperienced President we have  seen on foreign policy issues and other issues.   Is he up to the job? Will he be a voice of reason and stability when  times call for reason and stability? Will he resist the forces of war  that so easily call out, rather than engage in the hard but necessary  work of diplomacy and negotiation?   These are critical questions that we must ask and seek answers to as  we debate and vote on the most important official in the President's  Cabinet.   It is clear to me that, unfortunately, Mr. Tillerson will not be that  voice of stability, reason, and diplomatic experience that the United  States so desperately needs at this time of uncertainty and  instability.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, as I indicated earlier, this afternoon I  had an opportunity to meet with King Abdallah of Jordan. During that  conversation with Members of the Senate, there was a good deal of  discussion about foreign policy challenges that are very much a part of  this debate on Mr. Tillerson.   It was interesting to listen to King Abdallah of Jordan talk about  his country's commitment to refugees. They have taken in refugees from  many parts of that region--from Iraq, Yemen, and other countries. They  have taken in over 600,000 refugees from Syria. I think King Abdallah  used a number. If you wanted to use a comparable number of refugees  coming into America, it would be equivalent to about 60 million  refugees coming into our country. Let me remind you that in Syria,  President Obama committed to 10,000. It is literally a drop in the  bucket compared to what Jordan has done in accepting refugees. It just  underscores even more how wrong President Trump's Executive order over  the weekend was, which put a hold on our refugee program and restricted  travel to the United States.   The vetting that goes forward in Jordan in regard to refugees is  under the auspices of the United Nations, and of those who are seeking  refugee status, a very small percentage--I understand it is less than  one percent--will actually ever get a chance to be considered for  refugee status here in the United States. Let me remind you that we are  talking about, generally, women and children who are fleeing  persecution, who have established themselves as refugees. They go  through several screening procedures. Their background is thoroughly  checked. They check all of the different indices as far as different  agencies are concerned to make sure that they have no concern. Then a  small percentage of that number actually ever gets to the United  States. It takes 18 to 24 months. To date, there hasn't been a single  episode of terrorism from a Syrian refugee. We have a pretty strong  vetting process--the strongest in the world--that very much puts  American security first.   It was disheartening for me to listen to King Abdallah talk about the  sacrifices his country has made. Of the 650,000 refugees that Jordan  has taken in from Syria, the King indicated that about 90 percent are  integrated into the Jordanian society. They are not in camps. They are  in their schools, in their communities. They have been able to make  sure that the refugees are well cared for. It is a huge part of the  budget. I think the King indicated that maybe 20 percent of the  Jordanian budget deals with refugees. That is a country that  understands their regional responsibilities and international  responsibilities.   The United States has been the leader in the global community,  recognizing that the flight of people--the refugees--represents not  only a humanitarian requirement for the global community but also  security issues. We have to have an orderly process for those who are  fleeing persecution, and the United States has always been in the  leadership. We have been in the leadership in opening our borders. We  are proud of the refugees that came to this country after World War II,  from Cambodia, Vietnam, and Cuba. There is a long list of those who  have escaped persecution coming here to the United States and helping  to build this great country. We recognize that diversity is our  strength. This made us the great Nation that we are.   For all those reasons, it was very disheartening to hear President  Trump's Executive order, where he really questions whether America is  committed to its traditional values, whether we are going to maintain  our international leadership, whether we are going to be  [[Page S517]]  credible when we deal with other countries around the world to take on  the responsibilities of dealing with the flight of people who are  escaping persecution.   I mentioned all this because the Secretary of State is the key  diplomat that we have for America and to use America's power of  persuasion, of using diplomacy, of using the tools at our disposal  under the Department of State, including development assistance for how  we can, in fact, promote those values. We need someone who is going to  be able to speak out about these policies that were announced over the  weekend because they weaken America. They make us less safe. I brought  this out: In reality what you are talking about is how do you engage  other countries around the world to help us in our war against terror  when we tell them that Muslims aren't really welcome here in America  and it is a majority-Muslim country? How does that work? How do we  protect Americans who are traveling abroad who may be subjected to  physical danger because of the statements that have been made by our  President? How do you protect this country from the concerns about  homegrown terrorism, which might, in fact, be encouraged by the  recruitment of terrorists as a result of what the President has done in  his Executive order?   For all those reasons, it is even more important for us to have as  the next Secretary of State a person who is committed to the core  values of this country--that it is part of their gut, and that they  will be a strong advocate for those issues. I have already indicated  during the questioning in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that  we did not see that moral clarity in regard to Mr. Tillerson and in  regard to those values.   The second issue that came up in King Abdallah's meeting was very  interesting. We had a long discussion about Russia and about Russia's  influence. We know about Russia's influence in Ukraine. We had a little  discussion about Russia's desires in regard to the Baltics and whether  the Baltics could be the next Ukraine, as far as Russia's aggression.  We know that Russia is already in Georgia. Russia is already in  Moldova. Russia is in Ukraine. Do they have their sights now set for  Lithuania or Latvia or Estonia or Poland, where there is a large  Russian-speaking population?   Interesting observations were made that if Russia sees that we don't  have resolve, they will use that opportunity to expand their influence.  We saw that in the Middle East. We saw how in the Middle East Russia,  which a few years ago had very little influence in the Middle East, now  has a growing influence in the Middle East--not only in Syria but in  other countries in that region where you see Russia's active  engagement. So this is not theoretical.   Russia's interests are different than our interests. Make no mistake  about that. They don't share our values. They are not our friends. They  are trying to compromise our democratic institutions. We have seen that  over and over--not only the attack on our election system here in the  United States, not only the attack on the system in Montenegro in  parliamentary elections, but the concern now in Western Europe, as they  are entering into the election season. We see over and over what Russia  has done in denying space for civil society, in compromising dissent in  their own country, in the way that corruption has been established as  part of government. All of that is just against the principles that we  believe in, that we believe the global community has accepted, and that  leads to the stability in nations and advances America's national  security interests.    I must tell you that there are Democrats and Republicans all talking  about the fact that we have to stand up to Russia. We have to be  stronger on Russia. Yes, we have been able--thanks to the leadership of  the Obama Administration--to take the sanctions that were passed by  Congress. We passed the sanctions. The leadership and Members of the  Senate and the House have brought about the stronger sanctions regime  here in the United States. I congratulate my colleague, Senator  Menendez, who was one of the principal leaders to get stronger  sanctions here in regard to Russia, and other members of our committee  who worked on that. We were able to get stronger sanctions. At the same  time, we were able to get Europe to join us in these sanctions, and  that helped us. But now there is a concern as to whether these  sanctions will remain.   President Trump at least has raised that question as to the  continuation of sanctions. The question becomes this: Should we be  maintaining those sanctions until Russia complies with the Minsk  agreement that are relevant to its invasion into Ukraine? But we should  also be strengthening those sanctions because of Russia's illegal  activities in attacking our country and in what they are doing in Syria  in perpetrating war crimes. We should be looking at stronger sanctions  against Russia.   I mention all of that because the person who can lead us in that  effort is our next Secretary of State. We look at Mr. Tillerson and his  record as the CEO of ExxonMobil, their relationships in Russia, and his  answers to questions as to whether we should consider additional  sanctions. Over and over he says: Well, there are multiple  considerations. To me, that was a red flag that indicated that maybe  there is some business interest here. Maybe, if there is a business  interest, we shouldn't let that be more important than the human rights  advancements and the other areas that we are concerned about.   In reality, we saw that in the way ExxonMobil lobbied against the  original sanctions that were imposed against Russia. They lobbied  against it because they said it didn't create a level playing field for  U.S. companies. The reason it didn't create a level playing field is  that the United States is always the leader on sanctions. We always set  the international bar as to what we need to do, and then the rest of  the world follows us. But if we take the lowest bar, we will never have  a tough enough stance against Russia.   We need, as the next Secretary of State, a person who is going to be  a leader in saying: We are going to use every one of our diplomatic  tools to isolate Russia if they continue this activity of interfering  with our elections, threatening to interfere with European elections,  interfering with humanitarian assistance in Syria, or if they continue  their illegal occupation of Crimea. We need that type of leadership.  That is one of the reasons we have been so much engaged in this debate.   There are many other issues about which we talked with King Abdallah  that dealt with foreign policy challenges, including moving forward  with broader coalitions against ISIS in the region. All of that  requires the use of all the power we have. We know that our military is  very strong. We are very proud of our Department of Defense and very  proud of the men and women who serve in the military. They are the  guardians of our freedom. We thank them every day for the sacrifices  they make on behalf of our Nation. We owe it to them to make sure our  military is only used as a matter of last resort, that we use all of  our diplomatic skills in order to prevent the unnecessary use of our  military, that we only use the military when it is absolutely essential  and it is a matter of last resort.   We must have as our chief diplomat a person who will carry out that  strong commitment to our diplomatic skills and agenda in order to make  sure that we only use the military when necessary.   We have heard this before. But it was General Mattis who said: If you  don't fund the Department of State, if you don't give them the  resources they need for development assistance, you are going to have  to give me a lot more soldiers.   Our diplomats can very much keep us safe, and they can do it with  less risk to our men and women who serve in the military and at less  cost.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Ernst). The clerk will call the roll.   The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.    Mr. President, I yield 15 minutes under my control to the  Senator from Massachusetts, Ms. Warren.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.   The Senator from Wisconsin.
