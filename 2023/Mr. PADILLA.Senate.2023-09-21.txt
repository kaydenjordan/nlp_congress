 Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the 2023  Little League World Series Champions, Southern California's own El  Segundo 12U All Stars.   Every year, communities from around the world gather their best youth  baseball players to assemble an All-Star team with dreams of one day  making it to the Little League World Series in Williamsport, PA. But  after local, State, and regional tournaments, only 20 teams earn such  an honor, 10 from the United States and another 10 from around the  world. In the end, only one team takes home the World Series title--and  it is no easy road.   For the El Segundo 12U All Stars in Williamsport, after an opening  game win thanks to back-to-back homeruns and a high-powered offense,  the team from Southern California hit a significant hurdle in just  their second game. They lost 3-1 to a Southwest Region team and were  quickly sent down to the elimination bracket, facing long odds and a  rocky road back to the finals, when even one loss would send them home.   But rather than shrink from the challenge, El Segundo trusted their  pitching and defense, their great power hitting, and their fearless  competitiveness to rattle off four straight wins to make it all the way  to the Little League World Series Championship. Their impressive streak  included returning the favor and defeating the team from the Southwest  Region in the U.S. Championship 6-1.   Finally, on the biggest stage, facing Curacao in the Little League  World Series Championship, El Segundo got off to an early start,  jumping to a 5-1 lead in the fourth inning. But the winds quickly  shifted after a Curacao grand slam tied the game heading into the sixth  and final inning. Yet again, El Segundo refused to back down.   Manager Danny Boehle turned to No. 14 Brody Brooks to shutdown a hot  Curacao offense and give El Segundo a  [[Page S4652]]  shot in the bottom of the sixth, which he provided with a standout  scoreless inning. Then, in the bottom of the sixth, as countless Little  League baseball fans will now remember for eternity, No. 19 Louis Lappe  stepped up to the plate--and the rest is history. A shot to deep left  field sent the crowd to their feet, Lappe around the bases, and a city  all the way across the country into pandemonium. Lappe's walk-off  homerun meant California, once again, was on top of the baseball world.   For one summer in 2023, kids in Southern California weren't just  imitating Mookie Betts' batting stance or dreaming of throwing across  the diamond to Freddie Freeman at first base. They were dreaming of  playing like Brooks and Lappe, Salazar and Green, Boehle and Keldorf,  Lee and Baker, McRoberts and Parks, O'Connor and Kalish.   My sincere congratulations to all the players, manager Danny Boehle,  coaches Tim Abrams and Eddie Lee, and all the parents and family  members who made this dream possible.   Congratulations--you have made California proud.                            ____________________     Madam President, I rise to speak in support of the  Opportunity to Address College Hunger Act, which I introduced today.   According to a 2018 GAO study, roughly 2 million at-risk college  students who were potentially eligible for Supplemental Nutrition  Assistance Program, SNAP, benefits did not report receiving them.  Millions of eligible college students across the Nation face steep  barriers to accessing these critical benefits due to a complex  application process and a lack of information-sharing from their own  colleges and universities.   In California alone, 127,000 college students received CalFresh  before the pandemic, despite upwards of 690,000 students being  potentially eligible. Through my conversations with California college  students, many have said that they wished their campuses told them they  were eligible for SNAP and how to access benefits.   That is why I am introducing this bill--to increase awareness of SNAP  for potentially eligible college students and to continue the fight to  tackle student hunger.   If enacted, this bill would require colleges and universities to  notify students participating in State or federally financed work-study  programs of their potential eligibility for SNAP benefits. Institutions  would also need to provide students with details about how they can  obtain more information about SNAP, confirm their eligibility for the  program, and access benefits.   This notification would be developed by the U.S. Department of  Education, in consultation with the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and  would be specific to the student's State of residence and provide  contact information for the local office where the student can apply  for SNAP.   The notification would also include an official document confirming  that the student participates in a work-study program and meets one of  the SNAP eligibility requirements for college students. This  documentation would help students overcome a common paperwork hurdle  they face when applying for SNAP benefits.   Finally, this bill would require the Department of Education and USDA  to provide guidance to States and institutions on how to better engage  with potentially eligible students.   While I support eliminating the restrictive work requirements that  limit access to critical nutrition benefits for millions of low-income  college students, this bill works to tackle barriers students face with  the eligibility requirements currently in place.   I want to thank Representative Suzanne Bonamici for introducing this  bill in the House and for her continued work to combat student hunger.  I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense legislation to help  improve student food security, health, and learning.                                  ______                                         By Mr. PADILLA:   S. 2898. A bill to amend the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of  2008 to authorize the Secretary of Agriculture to authorize the use of  certain grants to deliver peer-to-peer mental health support to  individuals who are engaged in farming, ranching, farm work, and other  occupations relating to agriculture; to the Committee on Agriculture,  Nutrition, and Forestry.    Madam President, I rise to introduce the Supporting Farm  Workers' Mental Health Act of 2023. This bill would ensure that the  Farm and Ranch Assistance Network serves the behavioral health needs of  farm workers.   The Farm and Ranch Stress Assistance Network is a transformative  program that addresses the mental health needs of farmers, ranchers,  and those engaged in agricultural occupations. While grants can be used  to serve farmworkers, farmworkers are not explicitly identified as  population of interest, despite their unique health needs.   Farmworkers face significant barriers to care, including a shortage  of culturally competent providers and low health literacy in addition  to the challenges associated with accessing healthcare in rural areas.  Nineteen percent of farmworkers reported symptoms of anxiety, and 14  percent reported feeling depressed, according to a recent University of  California, Merced study.   The Supporting Farm Workers' Mental Health Act of 2023 would amend  the Farm and Ranch Stress Act of 2023 would amend the Farm and Ranch  Stress Assistance Network to explicitly include farmworkers as an  eligible population and ensure peer-to-peer mental health services are  an allowable grant activity. Both changes will update the program to  reflect our agricultural workforce's behavioral health needs.   Farmworkers feed our Nation. It is our responsibility to ensure they  have access to behavioral health care they need.   I look forward to working with my colleagues to enact this important  initiative as quickly as possible.                                  ______                                         By Mr. PADILLA:   S. 2899. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to include  Middle Easterners and North Africans in the statutory definition of a  ``racial and ethnic minority group'', and for other purposes; to the  Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.    Madam President, I rise to introduce the Health Equity  and Middle Eastern and North African Community Inclusion Act of 2023.  This bill would ensure that Middle Eastern and North African  communities in the United States receive the Federal recognition they  need to receive targeted public health resources.   Too often, Federal data collection overlooks people in MENA  communities. This is true even at the Office of Minority Health, which  is tasked with the important work of improving health outcomes for  racial and ethnic minority populations. The office's definition of  ``racial and ethnic minorities'' does not currently include a Middle  Eastern or North African category, meaning that people in this  community are often misidentified as White. As a result, the unique  health concerns that Middle Easterners and North Africans face remain  underreported and unaddressed.   This bureaucratic oversight has a tangible impact on individuals'  abilities to live full and healthy lives.  [[Page S4658]]    The Health Equity and Middle Eastern and North African Community  Inclusion Act of 2023 would add a Middle Eastern and North African  category to the definition of ``racial and ethnic minorities'' used by  the Office of Minority Health. Additionally, it would direct the  Department of Health and Human Services to use this data to conduct a  comprehensive study of the unique patterns and health outcomes in MENA  populations.   I want to thank Representative Tlaib for joining me in introducing  this bill. I look forward to working with my colleagues to take this  important step to reduce health disparities.                                  ______                                         By Mr. DURBIN:   S. 2907. A bill to improve medical device recall notifications by  amending the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to establish an  electronic format for device recall notifications, and for other  purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.
