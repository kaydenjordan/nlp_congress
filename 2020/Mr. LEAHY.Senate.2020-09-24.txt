 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, in a few moments we are going to vote on  the motion to proceed to H.R. 8337, the Continuing Appropriations Act  of 2021 and Other Extensions Act of 2020.   I will speak a little bit about what is in there, but I will urge all  Members to vote aye.   The bill provides funding for the government through December 11 at  fiscal year 2020 funding levels. It will be under the same terms and  conditions contained in the fiscal year 2020 appropriations laws. These  were the laws that Chairman Shelby and I brought to the floor and have  been voted on.   It includes several authorization matters to extend programs that  otherwise would expire, including some important health and veteran  programs.   So as vice chairman of the Appropriations Committee, I support the  bill, but I am disappointed that it is needed at all.   As I have said many times, we had ample--ample time in the Senate to  complete our work on the 12 appropriations bills, but we didn't mark up  a single one. In June, July, we could have passed all 12 of them, but  the majority leader wouldn't even bring up a single one of them.   Apparently, he is more interested in confirming extreme rightwing  judges than moving legislation to address the needs of the American  people, including appropriations bills or critical legislation to  combat the COVID virus and its impact on families and the economy.   I chuckle, too, in a way ruefully because, of course, my friends on  the other side--especially if there is a Democratic administration--say  they must follow the Thurman rule, named after their revered former  President pro tempore from the Republican side, that you cannot have  any confirmations after the first of July. But, of course, they have  forgotten their own Republican rule when they have a Republican  President. We all know the facts on that, but I think what the American  people have to understand is that because of the time we spent on that,  because of the refusal to even allow 1--even 1--of the 12  appropriations bills to come up for a vote and allow everybody to  either vote for it or against it--and with Republicans having a  majority, if they didn't like anything in it, they could vote it down.  But saying that, no, we want to talk about it, but we are kind of  afraid to actually have to vote on it--I don't know why we are afraid  to vote. That is what we get elected to do.   I have cast over 16,000 votes in this body. Actually, I was told  today that is more than all but 1 of the nearly 2,000 Senators who have  served here.   But what we have done is we have conceded we can't do our most basic  job of completing appropriations bills on time, and in doing that, we  have failed to address an unprecedented health and economic crisis for  months.   Last week more than 870,000 Americans filed for unemployment benefits  for the first time. It is not 870,000 Americans who have filed in the  past; this is 870,000 Americans filing for unemployment benefits for  the first time. That is because of this pandemic.   Kitchen cabinets across the country are bare as families struggle  without enough to eat. Schools do not have enough resources to teach  our children at home or protect them inside the classroom.   This is infuriating. I think Senator Shelby and I could have gotten  those 12 bills. On some parts of them, some would vote for it; some  would vote against it. But we were ready to vote back in June and July.  In the meantime, we now have 200,000 Americans who have died, and we  have yet to vote.   I am afraid that what the President wants to do--and my friends on  the Republican side--is cast aside the desperate needs of the American  people in favor of government on autopilot.   Apparently, right now, they are more concerned with securing a  hyperpartisan Supreme Court than the health and safety of the American  people and are doing the most basic job of Congress. It is that simple.   I will have more to say about the continuing resolution in the coming  days as we move forward toward final passage. But the last thing our  country needs is a government shutdown in the middle of a global  pandemic and an unprecedented economic crisis.   I regret that leadership would not allow us to vote on these  appropriations bills because I am convinced we would have had enough  Republicans and Democrats who would have come together and passed all  12 of them if we had been allowed to vote, even though it means that  some would have to cast difficult votes, but that is what we are here  for.   For this one, while it is far from perfect, I will urge all Members  to vote aye on the motion to proceed   Mr. President, I see my distinguished colleague on the floor is ready  to speak, so I yield the floor.    Mr. President, agriculture has always been at the heart of  Vermont's economy. For generations, families across Vermont have made a  living through agriculture, tilling our rocky soil and raising  livestock on our hillsides. Farming in Vermont has always been a  challenging yet very rewarding way of life. Now more than ever, it is  clear to see the obstacles faced by farmers. I would like to take a  moment to recognize Gold Shaw Farm, a farm founded by a husband and  wife team in northeastern Vermont. Morgan and Allison Gold, the owners  of Gold Shaw Farm, have found a very interesting way to meet these  challenges, supplement their agricultural income, adapt their  practices, and share their work with the world.   Morgan and Allison Gold moved to Peacham, VT, and established their  farm in 2016. On their 150-acre plot, the Golds raise chickens, geese,  ducks, and sheep and cultivate a variety of vegetables and berries.  Soon after they started farming, the Golds began filming their daily  activities and posting them on YouTube. The farm may be small, but over  the years, Gold Shaw Farm has amassed a very large and loyal fan base  that tune in regularly to watch as Morgan and Allison collect eggs,  chase ducks, and play with their dog, Toby. Some of the farm's fans  have even driven all the way to Peacham to buy eggs and visit the farm.  With the help of their growing audience, the Golds hope to expand their  farm into a larger sustainable operation. Starting and maintaining a  farm is challenging work, but in the Golds' model, we see innovative  and creative ways to not only document farming experiences, but share  those experiences with the world and hopefully inspire a new generation  of farmers. I look forward to tuning in to watch their progress.   Earlier this year, the Golds were profiled in The New York Times, and  I ask unanimous consent that the article, ``In a Wistful Age, Farmers  Find a New Angle: Chores'' be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                  [From the New York Times, Aug. 7, 2020]             In a Wistful Age, Farmers Find a New Angle: Chores                              (By Ellen Barry)         Peacham, Vt.--The sweet smell of hay rose off the earth on       a recent evening, as Morgan Gold strode across his farmyard       in heavy boots. He crossed the paddock, scanning for new       eggs, water levels, infected peck wounds, rips in the fence       line.        But mainly--let's be honest--he was looking for content.        Though Mr. Gold sells poultry and eggs from his duck farm       in Vermont's northeast corner, most of what he produces as a       farmer is, well, entertainment.        Mr. Gold, who is short and stocky, with the good-natured       ease of a standup comedian, does his chores while carrying a       digital camera in one hand and murmuring into a microphone.        Then, twice a week, like clockwork, he posts a short video       on YouTube about his exploits as a neophyte farmer, often       highlighting failures or pratfalls. Keeping a close eye on       analytics, he has boosted his YouTube audiences high enough       to provide a steady advertising revenue of around $2,500 to       $4,000 a month, about eight times what he earns from selling       farm products.        This part of New England is rocky, hilly and isolated, and       generations of small farmers have cast about for new ways to       scrape out a living: the sleigh rides, the alpacas, the       therapy ponies, the pick-your-own hemp. It is a new thing,       though, to make farm life into reality TV.        Mr. Gold, 40, has learned the hard way--he tried to take a       month off last winter--that any gap in his YouTube       publication schedule results in a steep drop-off in audience.       So he keeps a running list of themes that could be fodder for       future videos. It reads, in part:        Should I Feed My Dog Eggs?        Don't Trust This Duck        My Homestead Is a Dumpster Fire        What Does My Guard Dog Do All Day?        He has learned, through trial and error, what works with an       audience. The sheepdog-mounted GoPro didn't work. (``People       were like, 10 seconds and I was puking,'' said his wife,       Allison Ebrahimi Gold.) Slow, sumptuous drone footage of his       sun-dappled 150 acres, land porn for wistful cubicle       dwellers--that definitely works.        Character development works, as demonstrated by Mr. Gold's       most popular video, ``Our Freakishly Huge Duck (This Is Not       NORMAL),'' which, as he would put it, blew the doors off.       Slow-motion footage of waggling goose butts, set to a bouncy,       whimsical orchestral soundtrack, works.  [[Page S5859]]         But few things compel audiences, he came to realize, more       than a real-life setback. He came to this realization last       summer when a mink broke into his duck hutch, leaving its       interior spattered with eggs and blood and feathers.        ``It was one of the most depressing days of my life,'' he       said, adding, ``but at the same time, I'm thinking, `How is       the audience going to react to this sort of thing?' ''        The next videos, which featured freaky night-vision footage       of the offending mink, helped boost Mr. Gold's YouTube       audience toward the 100,000-viewer threshold. And it helped       him understand his own place in the universe of farmer-      influencers, which tilts heavily toward the how-to genre.        ``The storytelling part is what I'm good at,'' he said.       ``I'm not that good at the farming part.'' It is a paradox       that the less financially viable small farming becomes, the       more that Americans want to experience it firsthand.        This idea is as old as the dude ranch; video streaming of       farm life is only the most recent iteration. Amy Fewell, the       founder of Homesteaders of America, said the number of       farmers who earn substantial income off YouTube channels is       steadily climbing, and now stands at around 50. Some of them       earn money through product endorsement deals, like Al Lumnah,       who posts videos five days a week from his farm in Littleton,       N.H.        It's a lot of work: Mr. Lumnah wakes up at 3:30 a.m. so he       can edit the previous day's footage in time to post new video       at 6 a.m., which his 210,000 regular viewers, who are       scattered as far as Cambodia and India, have come to expect.       ``People will say, it's lunchtime here in Ukraine,'' Mr.       Lumnah said.        Others, like Justin Rhodes, a farmer in North Carolina,       have parlayed a giant YouTube audience into a dues-paying       membership enterprise--he has 2,000 fans who pay annual fees       of up to $249 for private instruction and direct       communication, via text message. ``We don't sell a single       farm product,'' Mr. Rhodes said. ``Our farm product is       education and entertainment.''        Mr. Gold, who moved to Vermont and started his YouTube       channel four years ago, has not reached that point. He still       has a full-time job, as a marketing executive for an       insurance company, and so far has refused the endorsement       deals. He has built up his flocks of chicken, geese and ducks       to 100, and is hoping to add cows next spring.        He's certainly captured the interest of the farmers who       surround him in Peacham, said Tom Galinat, a neighbor whose       family farms 550 acres.        Farmers here struggle to eke out a living from a rocky,       uneven soil and hostile climate, and they are astounded--in       some cases a little jealous--to discover that Mr. Gold is       internet famous, he said.        ``He's found a way to way to monetize farming with less       physical labor,'' Mr. Galinat said. ``Some guys are like,       this is silly, since he's farming 20 ducks. But at the same       time, he's making more than other farmers who have 500 acres       of land.''        But Mr. Galinat, who is also Peacham's town clerk, counts       himself among a younger generation of farmers who are       learning from Mr. Gold.        ``He has taught me I am no longer selling hay, I am selling       a lifestyle,'' he said. ``He's really selling himself--his       emotions, his opinions, his downfalls, his successes. Boom!       That's it, that's the way forward.''        As Mr. Gold's audience has grown, he has at times been       taken aback by the enthusiasm.        Several dozen viewers have driven all the way to Peacham       and knocked on his door, hoping to buy eggs or talk about       ducks, something his wife described as ``really       distressing.'' ``Morgan is so vulnerable on film,'' she said,       ``that people assume they know us as people.''        Most of it is nice, though. Viewers send handcrafted       accessories for his outbuildings, like a plaque that says, in       elaborate lettering, ``Ye Olde Quack House.'' When one of the       Golds' barn cats was hit by a car recently, at least 50       viewers offered cash to cover her medical bills.        Samier Elrasoul, a nursing student in Howell, Mich., is so       devoted to Mr. Gold's videos that he got a vanity license       plate reading QUACKN, in honor of the catchphrase--``Release       the Quacken!''--that Mr. Gold exclaims when he frees his       ducks from their hutch in the morning.        Mr. Elrasoul, 34, says the videos inspire him because he,       too, has a dead-end job--he works as a supervisor at       Starbucks--and he, too, harbors a dream of changing his life.        ``Seeing some guy just like me, just dropping everything       and doing what he's passionate about, was very encouraging to       see,'' he said. ``I'm like, wow, he's living his dream.''        For others, Mr. Gold's farm has provided a haven in a       difficult time. Charlotte Schmoll, who is 6 and lives in       Portland, Ore., spent days at the beginning of lockdown       watching Mr. Gold's videos over and over. She announced last       month that she, too, plans to raise ducks in Vermont.        ``One of the questions that comes up when we watch shows       is, `Is this real? Did this happen?' '' said her mother,       Julie Schmoll. ``That's one of the things she liked about Mr.       Rogers, and maybe she likes about the duck farmer, that he is       also quote-unquote true, or real.''        Mr. Gold does wonder, sometimes, about what it means, in       the long term, to make his life into a story. When the cat       was hit by a car, he found himself reflexively converting the       event into a script, and stopped to ask himself who he was       becoming.        ``It's like, how much is the experience and how much is the       packaging of the experience, and how do you distinguish       between the two,'' he said. ``Because you almost go, `I had a       duck die, let me think about the first act here, and the       second act.' ''        And still, the show goes on. Late on a recent evening, Mr.       Gold was putting finishing touches on a video about his dog,       Toby, who has never quite grown into his intended role as a       duck herder.        Early drafts of the video had focused on how much the dog       had improved.        But there was something dishonest about that, Mr. Gold       realized that evening, as he and Ms. Gold flung themselves       around the paddock, trying to catch birds with string nets,       while the dog looked on placidly, thumping his tail.        Now, in the gathering dark, Mr. Gold was rewriting the       ending to one that emphasized his acceptance of the dog's       true nature.        It's always difficult to bring closure to a video, Ms. Gold       said. It was almost 9 o'clock, and she was hoping to go       inside.        ``You have to create an end,'' she said. ``Because the       truth is, we do this every day, so there's not really an       end.''        But Mr. Gold, for his part, was pleased.        ``I love it when a story has a good moral,'' he said.                            ____________________
