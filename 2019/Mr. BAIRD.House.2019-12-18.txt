 Madam Speaker, today marks a sad day for America. Instead  of getting to work to solve the issues of our time, the House Democrats  have decided to try to discredit President Trump and undo the results  of the 2016 election.   The facts here are clear. The President did not commit any crimes. He  did not break any laws. And there was no quid pro quo.   This has been a secretive, misdirected process from the very  beginning, and the American people see right through it.   I look forward to voting against this impeachment charade and getting  back to work to support the efforts of President Trump to continue  growing our economy, creating jobs, and improving the lives of all  Americans.    Madam Speaker, the totality of this process is just  another reminder that my colleagues across the aisle are more focused  on politics than policy. The American people deserve better. Our  Republic deserves better.   The brave men and women of our military, myself included, have fought  for freedom and democracy all around the world. Yet, today, my  colleagues are eroding those freedoms through a process that ignored  facts, abused power, and was shrouded in secrecy.   Those facts could not be more clear: The President committed no  crime, broke no laws, and there was no quid pro quo.   I look forward to doing the right thing, representing the Hoosiers in  my district, and voting against this impeachment charade. I stand with  President Trump and look forward to passing policies that continue to  move our country forward.                                time  1545
