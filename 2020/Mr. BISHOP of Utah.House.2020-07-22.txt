 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Let's get a couple of things very clear.   First of all, this is not about the Land and Water Conservation Fund.  We reauthorized permanently the Land and Water Conservation Fund in the  last Congress, and in doing that, in a House Republican bill, I might  add, we took the State-side projects--these are the kinds of things  like easements and picnic grounds and roads and parks that your  constituents are all telling you that they like, those are called the  State-side projects--and we actually increased the funding for those  programs.    We also put in that act a limitation on the amount of money that  could be used to buy more land. This bill is about that concept, the  limitation of land acquisition. The special interest groups have been  putting pressure on you and are giving you misinformation about this  particular thing. They simply want to circumvent the limits that were  pushed in that bill that was there earlier.   This is two bills merged together. The first one was the old H.R.  1225, the backlog maintenance bill that Mr. Grijalva referred to in his  speech. We  [[Page H3645]]  wanted to see if we could actually help parks and other public lands  who are having a maintenance backlog that is near $20 billion today.   Many people, 330 people, cosponsored that bill. Obviously, it was  popular. But for 1\1/2\ years, Democratic leadership failed and refused  to move that bill. One of their arguments was, this is key, there is no  offset for a bill that scored $7 billion. They refused to move it  because there was no offset.   That bill would fund parks' maintenance backlogs by taking excess  revenue from those that come from all the energy development, but  primarily oil and gas, off-coast as well as on land, and after we pay  our obligations, the first $1 billion of the excess would be used to  maintain our parks. That is still a decent bill.   You have added that, or the Democrats in the Senate have added that,  to a second bill that is mandatory $900 million of spending. That  mandatory spending will be from now until eternity, but the goal of  that is simply to increase the buying power to buy more lands, not to  create the State-side projects which we increased.   We are spending trillions of dollars on coronavirus emergency  spending. We still have to pay for that. If you really think that  mandatory increasing of our debt is the right policy, I think there is  a problem there because the CBO did say that this new concoction--bill  scores at $17 billion. And I want you to notice there is no offset for  that in this bill.   Both House Republicans and House Democrats have rules that they will  not bring a bill to the floor that is not offset. The Blue Dog  Democrats unanimously wrote a letter to their leadership saying, Do not  bring a bill to the floor that is not offset.   This violates the rules of both the Democrats and the Republicans  clearly and adds $17 billion to the debt, and the reason this is here  is, well, because.   Both LWCF, as well as what we want to do with park maintenance, is  paid for by royalties from those gas and oil explorations. The excess  was to go to parks. We already have obligations with those royalties.  GOMESA is an obligation. Historic preservation is an obligation. State  reimbursement is an obligation. Those are priorities.   Now, we are also saying in this bill, the $1 billion of money to buy  more land is now also a priority above and beyond what is happening for  the parks and what will get there for the parks, which may not in  normal times be a concern, but in this era, CRS has already certified  that we are 84 percent lower in the amount of activity and the amount  of royalties coming in from our energy development than we were a year  ago. That is 2 million barrels of oil a day less than we were producing  and getting royalties from them last year.   So if buying more land is the priority, the maintenance of our  backlog could be totally left out.   Now, this is not for wont of what we are trying to do. There were  amendments to try and fix this, but they were not allowed to be brought  to this floor. There are amendments in the Senate to fix these  problems, but they were not allowed to be brought to the floor. There  will be many on both sides of the aisle, some on our side, who will  support and defend this bill.   I will remind you we are having a heat wave here in Washington, D.C.  For the first time in four years we are coming close to 100 degrees,  but the heat index is well into three digits. There are a lot of people  suffering from heat stroke.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Idaho (Mr. Simpson) to explain why mandatory spending is good.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Ohio (Mr. Stivers).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman  from Indiana (Mrs. Walorski).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes.   This bill is actually extremely poorly drafted. It assumes basic  things. But if, for instance, as we said, the royalties don't show up  as we are anticipating, we don't have that $1 billion to buy more land.  How do you solve that? Do you prorate that money? Do you take it from  other sources? Do you put this mandatory spending above other mandatory  spending, like Social Security?   CRS said those are good questions, and they don't know because this  bill is silent on all those questions.   It says the President is supposed to come up with $900 million of  projects. What if he only comes up with $800 million? Who gets that  extra $100 million? Does that go to the Department of the Interior? Is  that a slush fund?   Once again, CRS said, Good questions, and no one knows because this  bill is silent on those types of questions.   BLM has no idea of how much money they have spent on this program or  where the land is. The State portion is actually--they are okay because  they are a percentage. But this is talking about a dollar figure.   So you are going to hear a lot of platitudes, but somebody, at some  time, has got to say how this money is going to actually be funded.   To help us with that, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Nebraska  (Mr. Fortenberry), a longtime member of this legislature, who can  address those things.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. Hurd).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Pennsylvania (Mr. Fitzpatrick).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from North Carolina (Mr. McHenry).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from New York (Mr. Zeldin).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from the State of Washington (Mr. Newhouse).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Oklahoma (Mr. Kevin Hern).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman  from Louisiana (Mr. Graves), who is an active member of our committee,  is ranking member of another committee, and who can actually  springboard on Mr. Richmond's comments about this particular issue.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ to the gentleman from  Idaho (Mr. Fulcher).    Mr. Speaker, the Dingell Act, 2 years ago, was  bipartisan. If this were bipartisan, we would not be here.   But to illustrate that, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Arizona (Mr. Gosar).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from California (Mr. McClintock), one of the ranking members  on the committee, who has spent a lot of time on our committee and  understands these issues.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I won't tell the gentleman from Utah that the Utah  Association of Counties is opposed to this and all the trails that he  is talking about come from the State's side of projects. That is beside  the point.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from California  (Mr. LaMalfa).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   We have talked about several of the problems with this particular  bill. With this particular bill, we have talked about how the poor  reckoning of its sources there do not say what is going to happen if  this money does not develop. I think Mr. Graves would be good to talk  about where this money is coming and how it is being used at the same  time. And we don't necessarily know what will happen with the lowering  of the royalties that we are experiencing this year from next year.   There is one other consideration I hope that people will understand,  especially for all those who are speaking about it who come from the  eastern coast. There was a conforming amendment put in the Senate in  this particular bill, a conforming amendment. In the good old days, we  used to call them earmarks, but it is a conforming amendment.   The original bill said that on Forest Service land that would be  bought, 15 percent of that had to come from west of the 100th meridian  and 85 percent had to come from east of the 100th meridian. That was  taken out, quietly and surely taken out. The end result of that means  that there is a siphoning of billions of dollars that should be and  could be going to Eastern States.   I mention that because one of the Democrat speakers did speak about  the need for urban recreation opportunities. That was what was supposed  to happen, and with this conforming amendment, that is what is taken  out of the bill.   In the 1960s, as this bill was being discussed, Orville Freeman was  the Secretary of Agriculture for Kennedy. He said at that time that the  Outdoor Recreation Resources Review Commission pointed out that the  greatest need for recreation opportunities lies in the areas adjacent  to the metropolitan centers in the Eastern States.   It would be our purpose under this bill to expand about 84 percent of  what would be available under it for acquisition in the eastern  national forest acquired under the Weeks Act.   In fact, that commission went on to say that outdoor opportunities  are most urgently needed near metropolitan areas. Much of the West and  virtually all of Alaska are of little use to most Americans looking for  a place in the Sun for their families on a weekend when the demand is  overwhelming.   At regional and State levels, most of the land is where people are  not. One-sixth is in the sparsely populated Alaska. Seventy-two percent  of the remainder is in the West, where only 15 percent of the people  live. The Northeast, where one-quarter of the people live, only 4  percent of the acreage is there.   But that language was not put in there by happenstance. There was a  reason for it. In one iteration of this particular act that we  introduced a long time ago, there was the idea of putting a specific  percentage that would go to urban recreation so there would be those  urban recreation concepts, as was originally designed in the bill. That  has been taken out.   What that will mean is that for you who live east of the 100th  meridian, basically east of Denver, there will be $1.19 billion less  dedicated to you than there would have been if this amendment had not  been put in there. That works out to an average of $32 million per  congressional district of those living east of Denver.   I am glad that all those who are for this, on whatever side, will  have a good time to explain to their constituents why they are in favor  of giving their area $32 million less in recreation opportunity simply  because you are going to confirm a conforming amendment that was  slipped into the Senate version of this bill that really hurts this  process and is not necessarily positive.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Louisiana (Mr. Graves).    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time I  actually have left here.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   We have heard all sorts of platitudes about this bill today. Whether  it passes or not is actually irrelevant. It is not bipartisan, and it  has all sorts of flaws. There are questions about the future source of  funding.   We have heard speaker after speaker come up and say: We are not  talking about taxpayers' money. This is only royalties that are off  there.   One of the problems we have to face is that all the royalties that  come from offshore development and onshore development from energy and  gas, those royalties are placed in the general fund. In fact, the  second largest source of funds that go into the general fund is from  these royalties, second only to the IRS taxes that go in there. If  these revenues weren't deposited in LWCF, they would be deposited in  the general fund of the U.S. Treasury. If that is not taxpayer money, I  don't know what is.   We have talked about the need for, actually, urban recreation areas.  We would like to do it, but unfortunately, this bill diminishes that  opportunity and puts it in limbo, which is not good.   I have heard speaker after speaker come up here with pretty pictures  about our national parks, reservation lands, BLM land, resource lands,  all these things that need to be helped. A lot of them talked about all  the wonderful programs that are on State lands, that are parks, roads,  picnic areas, and all those things which we are already doing.   When we permanently reauthorized the LWCF last Congress, that is when  we put more money into those types of things everyone says is  wonderful.                                time  1400    What we didn't put more money into is buying Federal land, buying  more land to put into the Federal estate. As everyone talks about how  important it is actually to now start putting money into park  maintenance, into maintenance of the backlog, what this bill does is  put that at the very lowest rung on priorities of where this royalty  money is spent.   You will spend it first on GOMESA. You will send it to the States. It  will go to historic preservation. You will spend it on buying up more  land before you ever come to anything that helps the parks and helps  the public lands. That is because we have disproportionately done this.   This bill is not about funding our public lands. This bill is about  circumventing the limitations that we put in in the last Congress on  buying more land. The only thing this bill is about is how we can find  another way to buy more property.   We can't even afford the property we already have. There is a $20  billion maintenance backlog. But what this is attempting to do is find  a way to put more money into buying more land so we can exacerbate that  problem.   Now, you can say all you want to about how wonderful it is, how good  it is, and, I am sorry, most of those platitudes were misstated. They  were talking about things that either already exist or are actually  being de-emphasized by this particular bill.   What this bill is about is: Are you going to put more money into  buying more land before you put more money into actually maintaining  the land we already have? That is really the only issue of this bill,  and that is why we are fighting this strongly about it.   Last year, when we did the Dingell Act, that was bipartisan. We had  worked together to come up with a lot of bipartisan stuff. This was not  a bipartisan bill. Mr. Kilmer, I appreciated his work with me on the  parks. That was bipartisan. This is not bipartisan. It is still about  how do we buy more land. That is the goal of this piece of legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
