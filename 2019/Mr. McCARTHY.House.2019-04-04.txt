 Mr. Speaker, I have a parliamentary inquiry.    Mr. Speaker, will the majority leader schedule S. 1, a  vote on this floor with his commitment to Israel and his commitment to  ending BDS?    Mr. Speaker, further parliamentary inquiry.    First, the gentleman did not answer my last. But this  one, Mr. Speaker, parliamentary inquiry.    Mr. Speaker, parliamentary inquiry.    The minority only has one ability to bring something to  the floor in an MTR. This body wants to have a vote on S. 1.   Will the majority leader schedule on this floor a vote on BDS?
