 Madam President, I rise to introduce the Supporting  Mental Health for Military Children Act. This legislation would  establish a routine mental-health and well-being checkup pilot program  in Department of Defense Education Activity, DODEA, Schools.   In response to the growing youth mental health crisis in America,  this bill would establish a biannual mental health screening program to  ensure students have the resources they need to support their mental  health, combat the stigmatization of seeking help, and promote healthy  lifestyles.   Our Nation's young people are facing an unprecedented mental health  crisis. An estimated 49.5 percent of American adolescents have had a  mental health disorder at some point in their lives, with 50 percent of  all lifetime mental illnesses beginning by age 14; 75 percent by age  24. This state of affairs was only worsened by the pandemic.   While these numbers are already staggering, military children are at  even greater risk of mental/behavioral health problems than the general  population given their unique vulnerability to adverse childhood  experiences. As such, early screening and treatment are essential to  decreasing the risk of suicide and improving management of/recovery  from mental health conditions amongst this vulnerable segment of youth.   The evidence is clear: Ubiquitous mental health screening and  education protocols, offered by 55 percent of U.S. public schools in  2019 to 2022, are well-tested, relatively low-resource, and high-impact  ways to swiftly diagnose and treat mental health conditions amongst  youth.   I would like to thank Congressman Moulton for his leadership and  efforts on the House side. I look forward to working with my colleagues  to enact the Supporting Mental Health for Military Children Act as  quickly as possible.                                  ______                                         By Mr. KAINE:   S.J. Res. 35. A joint resolution redesignating the Robert E. Lee  Memorial in Arlington National Cemetery as the ``Arlington House  National Historic Site''; to the Committee on Energy and Natural  Resources.
