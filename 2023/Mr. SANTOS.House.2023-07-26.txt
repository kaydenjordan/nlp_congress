 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to address an issue that we  can no longer ignore.   The Chinese Communist Party has manifested all over South America,  and, most importantly, overpowering the United States in every single  one of those relationships.   Today, I will be talking about Brazil, the largest economy in South  America, the 10th-largest economy in the world, and the 4th-largest  food producer in the world.   We have much to gain from our relationship with Brazil, but we still  need to act.   Now, the CCP has seized its opportunity to assert its dominance.  China is the largest trading partner of Brazil, Chile, Peru, and  Uruguay, and the second-largest trading partner for many other  countries.   According to the American Enterprise Institute's China Global  Investment Tracker, Chinese entities invested a total of $148 billion  in Latin America and the Caribbean countries between 2005 and 2022,  with Brazil accounting for 44 percent of those investments, a total of  $66 billion.   Energy projects accounted for 62 percent of the investments and metal  mining accounted for 21 percent.   The database also shows that the Chinese construction projects in  Latin America and Caribbean countries were valued at $68.6 billion over  the same period, mainly in the energy, 50 percent, and transportation,  which is another 30 percent--in those two respective sectors.   The CCP has metastasized to the extent that it influenced the 2022  Presidential elections in Brazil and successfully reinstated a  convicted criminal into the Presidency.   We must remember that China has even gone so far as to support a veto  of a 2019 U.S.-backed resolution in the United Nations calling for free  and fair Presidential elections globally.   Luisa Inacio Lula da Silva, also known as Lula, is the current  occupier of the Presidency as a direct result of the CCP's successful  attempt to destabilize Brazil.   Let's be clear: The honest Lula, is a man deemed unelectable by the  Brazilian courts due to his conviction for his involvement in one of  the most significant political corruption scandals in Brazil's history,  which subsequently led to the demise of the country's economy.   In doing so, he has weaponized the judicial system in Brazil to  launch an assault like never before, prosecuting political opponents,  silencing the media, and targeting everyday civilians.   Lula has shielded himself behind the nation's highest court, with his  ally, Justice Alexandre de Moraes, granting his every wish.   You see, most Americans are quick to judge Brazil as a third-world  country and pass up its value as an ally. This is only the beginning of  the end for Brazil, our once great ally.   I want to make sure that the American people understand that value;  however, being the first Brazilian American to serve in Congress, I  hope and hold that Brazil will stand firm.   When Americans fought in World War II, Brazil was the only South  American country to send troops; 50,000 men from Brazil fought  alongside U.S. ally troops.   I present that fighting spirit on the House floor today, Mr. Speaker.  I want to stress that Brazil's population yearns for a capitalist  market similar to ours and appreciates our world-leading example for  democracy.   Today, Brazilians suffer high inflation, arbitrary laws, and absolute  devastation regarding infrastructure and healthcare.   I am calling on my colleagues to urge President Biden to suspend all  foreign aid to Brazil until a review is conducted via the United  Nations to assess the humanitarian crimes taking place under the power  of Lula's tyrannical regime.   While we have an arrest warrant for Nicolas Maduro, the murderous  Venezuelan dictator, it should come as no surprise that Lula parades  him and hosts him with official visits legitimizing him while  undermining us.   With this kind of egregious behavior as an elected official, it is  only natural that we ask why Lula would align with some of the world's  most monstrous dictators presently in the crosshairs of U.S. sanctions  or conflicts.                                time  2030    Brazil is not the only country impacted by China's election  interference. The Maduro regime has become reliant on China for  disinformation campaigns and social control programs, including ID  cards that serve as scorecards of Venezuelan citizens loyal to the  regime.   When we examine who funds Venezuela, it is none other than China  through their insidious and smoke-and-mirror charade toward world  domination that the CCP has titled the Belt and Road Initiative, aka  the BRI, a lending gambit that grants China's over 140 allied countries  billions of dollars under the pretense of economic integration and  interconnected development.   It is only a matter of time before Lula leads Brazil down the same  path.   This is the perfect example of the kind of destabilization the CCP is  known for, preying on countries via unsustainable and corrupt lending  while ignoring global labor and environmental standards for their own  economic gain.   The CCP will stop at nothing to reach their goal of world domination,  and as time goes on, we have fewer opportunities to preserve Brazil's  achievability and viability as our number one trade partner and ally.   Lula is nothing more than a repressive and destructive tyrant who  aligns with underhanded puppeteers to make his case for power.   Lula is actively parroting CCP propaganda, saying we are prolonging  the Ukraine-Russia conflict for commercial gain, undermining us at  every single turn, not to mention the BRICS agreement created under  Lula's direction by former impeached President Dilma Rousseff, whose  main goal today is to undermine and replace the U.S. dollar as the  global currency.   Mr. Speaker, as the first Brazilian American elected to this Chamber,  I urge my colleagues to assist Brazil in restoring democracy and to  stop legitimizing the Lula regime today. We must  [[Page H4026]]  ensure that an honorable and bona fide government can be installed and  lead the country forward out of the clutches of the CCP.   This serves a great benefit to us Americans, all of us in this body,  all of us in this country, to keep a good relationship with our fellow  ally, Brazil.   (English translation of the statement made in Portuguese is as  follows:)   To my Brazilian friends, be strong. We are together in this fight.   A meus amigos brasileiros, forga Brasil. Estamos juntos nessa luta.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.
