 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Dr. Pam Mobley,  a physician from Knoxville. Dr. Mobley has been in the Bahamas since  September assisting with medical relief efforts in the aftermath of  Hurricane Dorian.   Dr. Mobley was on Green Turtle Cay in the Abaco Islands when  Hurricane Dorian began battering the Bahamas. The storm displaced the  local personnel on Green Turtle Cay, but Dr. Mobley decided to wait it  out. Once it was safe, she began providing medical assistance to those  injured in the hurricane.   Even though Dr. Mobley could have returned to the United States  months ago, she has remained in the Bahamas to care for the injured and  help with relief efforts. Her selfless actions are truly remarkable.   I applaud Dr. Mobley for her humanitarian efforts in the Bahamas and  thank her for being an excellent representative of the Knoxville  community.   I know I speak for many in east Tennessee when I say Pam is making us  all very, very proud, Mr. Speaker.                            ____________________
