 Madam Speaker, I rise today to talk about the Biden  border crisis, which continues to rage every single day. For months,  the Biden administration has had no answer for the hundreds of  thousands of illegal immigrants who have streamed across our southern  border.   Now we have learned that the President is actually considering a  payment  [[Page H6193]]  of $450,000 to illegal immigrants who were arrested during the previous  administration.   How on Earth is this acceptable in the United States of America? What  has happened to our basic understanding of the rule of law? I refuse to  allow a half-million-dollar handout of hardworking taxpayers' money to  those who came here illegally.   That is why I am proud to support the Illegal Immigrant Payoff  Prohibition Act, introduced by Congressman McClintock, which would  prevent the attorney general from making these payments.   It is very simple: illegal immigrants should not be rewarded for  breaking the law.                            ____________________
