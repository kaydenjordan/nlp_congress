 Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself 1 minute.   Mr. Chair, this amendment goes backwards in an area where we have  gone forward. This amendment takes us in the wrong direction. For  years, we have had people serving in the military who are openly gay,  lesbian, and transgender, and they have served, and served this country  well.   For a lot of years, we did not allow them to do so openly. We finally  repealed that for lesbians and gays, and now, just last year, we had  the Department of Defense say we are going to do the same thing for  transgender. So the people who have been fighting and protecting our  country will be allowed to do so openly. It does not harm readiness at  all. These people have served in  [[Page H5800]]  the military, served it honorably, and served it well.   As far as the costs, the military pays for people who have  addictions, who have alcoholism, who smoke. They pay for a lot of  things that are contained within the military.   This amendment would target one specific group, and very unfairly.  And most unfairly, it wouldn't just, first of all, target transgender  surgery, it would target some of the hormone drugs, which cost, like,  $100 a year, cost absolutely virtually nothing to the military.   The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself an additional 30  seconds.   Most importantly, this wouldn't just impact transgender people who  are serving, it would impact their children. If you are serving in the  military and you happen to have a child who is transgender, you would  now be cut off from this military service. All these other things,  alcoholism, drug addiction, smoking, all manner of different problems  would be served, but transgender people would be targeted to not be  allowed to provide healthcare for their children.   This isn't going to help readiness. This is a social agenda that has  no business being in the Defense bill. We didn't have it in committee,  we shouldn't have it here on the floor.   Let's focus on the threats that Mrs. Hartzler talked about, not make  this into a social agenda based on the ignorance of what transgender  truly is.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, there is no study whatsoever that  shows this is going to cost $3.7 billion. And this amendment is not  just about transgender surgery, it is about any treatment. Let's keep  that in mind.   Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California (Ms.  Pelosi), the distinguished minority leader.    Mr. Chair, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from New York (Mr. Sean Patrick Maloney).   Mr. SEAN PATRICK MALONEY of New York. Mr. Chair, I would note to my  colleague from California that perhaps the members of their family are  supposed to decide on all their future medical care, because this  relates to their healthcare, and not just to the servicemembers'.  [[Page H5801]]    Mr. Chair, I rise in strong opposition to the Hartzler amendment. No  one in the Pentagon has called for this. In fact, we know right now  Secretary of Defense Mattis is running a review of this issue. He does  not need to be micromanaged by Members of this body to advance their  own agenda.   Until last night, all of us had worked in good faith across the aisle  to keep this important Defense bill free from political booby traps and  land mines, but if you are feeling deja vu, well, don't worry, because  I am, too. You may remember that I stood here last year and fought  against a similar amendment, again to the Defense bill. That amendment  would have allowed Federal contractors to fire LGBT workers under the  pretense of religious observance.   I told you then that my dad was a disabled veteran, that he taught me  to support and honor the military, but also to speak the truth and know  the difference between right and wrong.   I told you that I had never voted against the Defense bill, and I  never imagined I would. And then, after a lot of twists and turns, 43  of our Republican colleagues joined with us to vote down that  discriminatory amendment, and I want to publicly thank them for their  courage.   Well, here we go again. The Hartzler amendment would single out and  rob a small group of military servicemembers and their families of  their healthcare merely because these folks or members of their family  experience gender a little differently.   Mr. Chair, it is that simple. We are talking about Americans who  right now are risking their lives to keep us safe, and we should not  undermine their military service.    Mr. Chair, I yield the balance of my time to  the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the distinguished minority  whip.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.   The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further  proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Missouri  will be postponed.    Mr. Chairman, I really want to follow up on  the committee chairman's remarks. He is absolutely right. In 2011 and  2012, I was actually very intimately involved in the process of trying  to update the AUMF, and I have all the bruises and scars to show for  it. It is a very difficult process.   The main thing I want to accomplish in my 2 minutes here is to  explain to everybody why we haven't updated it, because there are  actually very clear reasons. I am not sure they are good reasons, but  they are very clear. Everyone sort of acts like: Well, we just haven't  done it. Why are we twiddling our thumbs?   The reason is because, well, lawyers and how words are interpreted.  As we went through and tried to word it exactly correctly, and as we  negotiated with the Senate, we discovered that basically no matter how  you word it, two groups are going to oppose it for diametrically  opposite reasons. One side is going to say that it is too broad; it  gives the President way too much power for too long a period of time  and gives him too open a hand. Other groups will look at that exact  same language and say that this unfairly restricts the President; it is  going to make it more difficult.   You have these conversations those of us on the committee have with  the Pentagon as they are trying to figure out--I haven't had as many  conversations with the current administration as with the previous, but  I talked at length with the Obama folks about deciding what could they  do? Where could they commit a strike? Against which groups? It was a  very lengthy process to go back through and try to figure out whether  or not it was under the law allowed.   So if we change this, the lawyers on both sides are going to go  bananas saying that this new language proves that you can't do that or  it is too broad.   Now, all of that is not to say that we shouldn't do it. We should.  But I just want people to understand the difficulty of it and for our  House to actually be willing--and the Senate--to do the work we should  do.   Don't kid yourself that this is something, well, gosh, we could just  do it, it would be easy, and if everyone understands it, we are just  ducking it for no good reason.   It is going to be really, really hard. It is going to take  bipartisan, bicameral cooperation. But it is way past time for us to do  it. Yeah, when we do it, lawyers will interpret it, and there will be  some uncertainty. But there is uncertainty now as they try to, as the  chairman described, bootstrap the 2001 AUMF on to a whole bunch of  other things. We have an obligation to do this even if it is difficult.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment basically  unnecessarily ties the hands of our administration in terms of choosing  how best to spend Defense dollars.   Now, the gentlewoman mentions that this does not say anything about  reducing our submarine force or reducing our bomber force. It does,  however, lock in a certain amount of ICBMs that we have to have, and,  in that sense, it does impact all other choices in terms of our Defense  policy not just within the nuclear framework.    But within the nuclear framework, there is, as I keep emphasizing and  people keep resisting, a finite amount of resources available to fund  the Department of Defense. In fact, that is the central problem with  this whole bill, as I have mentioned.   We don't have a budget resolution. This is $72 billion over-the- budget caps that the House has shown no willingness to vote to lift. So  here we have $72 billion that we are just kind of hoping is going to be  there. So at some point we are going to have to make some choices. I  keep saying that. We keep delaying it--doing CRs. We even shut down the  government once.   We continue to sort of stumble forward with no clear plan, but  amendments like this are just another example of how we lock in a lack  of flexibility in terms of how we spend our money.   What is the best approach to our national security?   Now, it has been mentioned and I keep harping on the fact that we  don't have a national security plan yet. And it has been mentioned,  well, Presidents usually take awhile to deliver them. And okay, fine,  we will, you know, sometime in the next year hopefully get that plan.  But amendments like this trap that plan, restrict the ability of the  President to deal with a finite amount of resources to come with what  is the best approach.                                time  1845    And there are a lot of arguments that ICBMs are not the best approach  to nuclear deterrence. Do we need an absolute fixed amount? I don't  think so. I think we need greater flexibility, particularly as we await  the findings of the Nuclear Posture Review to figure out what our best  strategy going forward is.   So we have all these little parochial pieces where we make sure that  the piece that is closest to us, you can't touch that. We have to have  exactly the same number. That is not in the best interests of a  comprehensive National Security Strategy.   We need flexibility in this budget. We are not going to have as much  money as everybody seems to think that we are going to have. That is  just the fact. We are $20 trillion in debt, running up deficits of $700  billion a year. We have the budget caps. At some point, we are going to  have to start making choices. This amendment does not help in that.   The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.    As I like to quote: ``Gentlemen, we are out  of money; it is time to think.''   We are, in fact, running out of money--that is a Winston Churchill  quote, by the way--but we appear to not be willing to do the thinking  part about making choices on where we should not and should spend our  money.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs. Watson Coleman).   Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Chairman, I thank Mr. Smith for including my  amendment en bloc and for allowing me to speak on it today.   Mr. Chairman, among the amendments under consideration in this en  bloc measure is one that I have authored to address various challenges  to the Army, National Guard, and Army Reserve sexual assault prevention  and response programs.   While sexual assault among our Active Duty forces has been a frequent  topic of discussion, I rise today to draw attention to the same issue  that remains just as prevalent within our Reserve component forces.   More than half a million members currently serve in the Army Guard  and Reserve. Hundreds of incidents of sexual assault are reported each  year, and it is estimated that several hundred more go unreported.   The Reserve components of the Army continue to suffer from staffing  imbalances, poor budget management, and slow investigations that delay  access to care for hundreds of sexual assault victims. My amendment  directs the Department of Defense to take steps to address these  issues.   Sexual violence is a criminal behavior, and it has no place in our  military.   We must regain the trust of the servicemembers, who have been brave  enough to come forward to report those crimes, by bettering our  military justice system.   Congress has a responsibility to protect the servicemembers who make  immeasurable sacrifices to serve and protect our country. We must  foster a system that encourages servicemembers to seek help and care,  and that protects the very people who keep our Nation safe.   Mr. Chairman, I urge adoption of the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 4  minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Washington  and the gentleman from Texas for their leadership, making their way  through a very important action on behalf of the American people, and  that is the defense authorization. I thank them for the amendments that  were made en bloc, and I hope to speak quickly about these important  amendments.   I am very grateful. Over the years, I have consistently introduced  the triple negative breast cancer amendment because of the many women  in the United States military who benefit from the research necessary.   My amendment authorizes and encourages increased collaboration  between the DOD and the National Institutes of Health regarding  combating triple negative breast cancer.   It has a particular impact on African-American women, but it impacts  White women, Hispanic women, and others, as well. This is a serious  illness that affects between 10 to 17 percent of female breast cancer  patients and is more likely to cause death.   My amendment would help to save lives. I am delighted because this  would impact Active-Duty women, as well as veterans; but, in  particular, Active-Duty women with testing. It affects women under 50  years of age, and, therefore, women who would be in the United States  military.   I am very grateful for the acceptance of the South Sudan amendment.  My amendment directs the Department of Defense to prepare contingency  plans to assist relief organizations and delivery of humanitarian  assistance efforts in South Sudan and to engage in consultation with  South Sudan military counterparts to deescalate conflict.   Famine in South Sudan has been created by conflict. On February 20,  2017, famine was declared formally in two counties of Unity State.  100,000 people will be in jeopardy of dying from famine. It has come  about between the conflicts between the President and his former Chief  of Staff, or his former Vice President.   We need to have the engagement to save lives, and I thank the support  for this amendment.   Likewise, the North Korean ICBMs. As I was in Europe, during the  Fourth of July, my amendment, in particular, supports upholding the  goals of the 1963 Treaty Banning Nuclear Weapon Tests in the  atmosphere, in outer space, and under water; addresses the fact that  our Nation should take the next step in preparing for a nuclear North  Korea; and establishes that the stakes may be far greater.    We have all been discussing the question of North Korea and ICBMs. We  have to be studious in assessing it.   Let me also say, however, that I am disappointed that the amendment  dealing with the AUMF on North Korea did not get in. I believe it is an  important issue that we must be concerned about.   I want to continue to work with the committee on PTSD and ensuring  that, even though authorized, more funding can come. I had asked for  $2.5 million.   And then I want to indicate the importance of recognizing, in light  of the large footprint that Russia now has in its effort to undermine  the democracy in this country, that we be very concerned about  recruitment of college students by foreign agents.   I had an amendment for us to be concerned about that. I look forward  to working with the committee. I plan to introduce this as legislation  because a young man by the name of Glenn Shriver, an outstanding  college student, majoring in international relations at a college in  Michigan, while doing a study abroad in China, developed an interest in  Chinese culture, and he was sought after by the Chinese.   I also want to work with the committee on addressing the question of  elections for our soldiers.   And, finally, I want to make sure that we stop cyber attacks by  foreign entities into our elections.   But, I am asking support for my amendment on the Korea ICBMs, the  Triple-Negative Breast Cancer, and the support of helping humanitarian  aid get to South Sudan.   Mr. Chair, I thank the ranking member and chairman, and I ask support  for my amendments.   Mr. Chair, I want to thank Chairman Thornberry and Ranking Member  Smith for shepherding this legislation to the floor and for their  devotion to the men and women of the Armed Forces who risk their lives  to keep our nation safe.   I especially wish to thank the Chairman and Ranking Member for  including Jackson Lee Amendment No. 56 in the Chairman's En Bloc  Amendment to H.R. 2810, the National Defense Authorization Act for  FY2018.   This Jackson Lee Amendment authorizes and encourages increased  collaboration between the DOD and the National Institutes of Health  (NIH) to combat Triple Negative Breast Cancer.   ``Triple Negative Breast Cancer'' is a term used to describe breast  cancers whose cells do not have estrogen receptors and progesterone  receptors, and do not have an excess of the ``HER2'' protein on their  cell membrane of tumor cells.   This makes commonly used test and methods to detect breast cancer not  as effective.   This is a serious illness that effects between 10-17 percent of  female breast cancer patients and this condition is more likely to  cause death than the most common form of breast cancer.   Seventy percent of women with metastatic triple negative breast  cancer do not live more than five years after being diagnosed.   The Jackson Lee Amendment will help to save lives.   TNBC disproportionately impacts younger women, African American  women, Hispanic/Latina women, and women with a ``BRCA1C genetic  mutation, which is also prevalent in Jewish women.   TNBC usually affects women under 50 years of age and makes up more  than 30 percent of all breast cancer diagnoses in African American.   African American women are far more susceptible to this dangerous  subtype than white or Hispanic women.   The collaboration between the Department of Defense and NIH to combat  Triple Negative Breast Cancer can support the development of multiple  targeted therapies for this devastating disease.   A Triple negative breast cancer is a specific strain of breast cancer  for which no targeted treatment is available.   The American Cancer Society calls this particular strain of breast  cancer ``an aggressive subtype associated with lower survival rates.''  [[Page H5818]]    Triple negative breast cancer is a term used to describe breast  cancers whose cells do not have estrogen receptors and progesterone  receptors, and do not have an excess of the HER2 protein on their cell  membrane of tumor cells.   In 2011, the Centers for Disease Control predicted that year 26,840  black women would be diagnosed with TNBC.   The overall incidence rate of breast cancer is 10 percent lower in  African American women than white women.   African American women have a five year survival rate of 78 percent  after diagnosis as compared to 90 percent for white women.   The incidence rate of breast cancer among women under 45 is higher  for African American women compared to white women.   Triple Negative Breast Cancer cells account for between 13 percent  and 25 percent of all breast cancer in the United States and are  usually of a higher grade and size, are more aggressive and more likely  to metastasize, and onset at a much younger age.   Currently, 70 percent of women with metastatic triple negative breast  cancer do not live more than five years after being diagnosed.   African American women are 3 times more likely to develop triple- negative breast cancer than white women.   African-American women have prevalence TNBC of 26 percent versus 16  percent in non-African-Americans women.   African-American women are more likely to be diagnosed with larger  tumors and more advanced stages of breast cancer.   Currently there is no targeted treatment for TNBC exists.   Breast cancers with specific, targeted treatment methods, such as  hormone and gene based strains, have higher survival rates than the  triple negative subtype, highlighting the need for a targeted  treatment.   Because there continues to be a need for research funding for  biomarker selection, drug discovery, and clinical trial designs that  will lead to the early detection of TNBC and to the development of  multiple targeted therapies to treat this awful disease, the Jackson  Lee Amendment is essential to paving a way for advancements in these  areas.   That is why I am pleased that Jackson Lee Amendment No. 56 has been  included in the Chairman's En Bloc Amendment and I urge all Members to  join me in voting for its adoption.   I also wish to thank the Chairman and Ranking Member for including  Jackson Lee Amendment No. 168 in the Chairman's En Bloc Amendment to  H.R. 2810, the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2018.   This Jackson Lee Amendment directs the Department of Defense to  prepare contingency plans to assist relief organizations in delivery of  humanitarian assistance efforts in South Sudan and to engage in  consultation with South Sudan military counterparts to deescalate  conflict.   As a member of the South Sudan Caucus, and the sponsor of H.R. 48,  the ``Equal Rights and Access for the Women of South Sudan Act,'' I  have long advocated and supported emergency assistance to South Sudan,  the world's newest nation, located in the center of Africa and bordered  by six countries.   Such emergency assistance is desperately needed now to respond to the  famine in South Sudan.   On February 20, 2017 famine was declared formally in two counties of  Unity State, which is located in the northern region of South Sudan.   The United Nations currently estimates that more than 100,000 people  in two Unity State counties are directly affected by the famine.   In addition, food security experts are concerned that famine will  spread.   According to expert analyses, in the absence of urgent humanitarian  action, as many as 4.9 million South Sudanese, about 4o percent of the  country's population, face the grim and certain prospect of starvation.   In 1998 the region suffered from a famine spurred by civil war and  approximately 70,000 to several hundred thousand people died during  that famine.   Although South Sudan has previously experienced widespread food  insecurity, the present famine crisis is different because it is almost  entirely man-made.   South Sudan is rich in oil, but following decades of civil war it is  also one of the least developed regions on earth--only 15 percent of  its citizens own a mobile phone and there are very few tarmac roads in  an area larger in land mass than Spain and Portugal combined.   This makes the Nile River, which flows through regional centers, an  important transport and trade route.   Since South Sudan overwhelmingly voted to break away from Sudan in  2011, the government's main concern has been to get oil flowing  following disagreements with the regime in Khartoum.   There have been a few small armed rebellions, border clashes and  deadly cattle feuds but these have all taken place far from the capital  city of Juba.   Signs of friction within the governing party, Sudan People's  Liberation Movement (SPLM), came when President Salva Kiir, an ethnic  Dinka, the country's largest group, fired his deputy Riek Machar, who  is from the second largest tribe, the Nuer.   President Kiir believes Mr. Machar was behind a coup plot to oust him  and seize power.   Mr. Machar denies the accusations, but has publicly criticized Mr.  Kiir for failing to tackle corruption and vowed to challenge President  Kiir for leadership of the SPLM.   It is not clear what led to the breach in their relationship but what  started out as a political squabble has escalated into ethnic violence.   The loyalties of the South Sudan army are divided with each of the  principals commanding significant military support and forces loyal to  each man have clashed around the country.   And some of the most intense fighting has taken place in areas where  famine is most severe.   Compounding matters, South Sudan is awash with guns after decades of  conflict and there is a history of ethnic tension for politicians to  exploit if they believe that could help them gain, or remain in, power.   Complicating this situation is the fact that while the Government of  South Sudan has reportedly promised access to the most at-risk areas,  humanitarian organizations remain unable to provide vital food, water  and shelter in many locations.   The actions of South Sudan Government in prohibiting humanitarian  assistance from getting to starving communities has undermined the most  proactive attempts by the United States and others to address what has  now become a famine.   The Jackson Lee Amendment directs the Department of Defense to  prepare contingency plans to assist relief organizations delivering  humanitarian assistance and consult with South Sudan's military leaders  to deescalate intra-party conflict, put petty disputes aside, and to  put the well-being of the South Sudan people first.   Mr. Chair, let me conclude by observing that while bringing an end to  the civil war and humanitarian relief the famine-stricken in South  Sudan must be our first order of business, it is also very important to  note that all of us who worked to secure its independence want the  country to succeed and become a productive and constructive member of  the community of nations.   That is why I have reintroduced the ``Equal Rights and Access for the  Women of South Sudan Act'' (H.R. 48), which promotes the human rights  of women in South Sudan as the country transitions to a long-term  government and to ensure women enjoy the right to participate fully in  the political and economic life of the country.   Despite its newly won independence women in South Sudan continue to  face brutal violations of their human rights.   A lack of infrastructure as well as gender inequality has the  potential to regress much of the progress that has been made in South  Sudan.   Such a lack of human development factors only furthers the  marginalization of women in South Sudan.   The ``Equal Rights and Access for the Women of South Sudan Act'' puts  equal rights and access for the women of South Sudan at the forefront  by:   1. Encouraging the appointment of women to high level positions  within Republic of South Sudan Government;   2. Ensuring that a significant portion of United States development,  humanitarian, and relief assistance is channeled to local and United  States-based South Sudanese organizations, particularly South Sudanese  women's organizations;   3. Providing long-term financial assistance for primary, secondary,  higher, nontraditional, and vocational education for South Sudanese  girls, women, boys, and men;   4. Providing financial assistance to build health infrastructure and  deliver  [[Page H5819]]  high-quality comprehensive health care programs, including primary,  maternal, child, reproductive, and mental health care;   5. Requiring military training regarding the protection, rights, and  particular needs of women and emphasizing that violations of women's  rights are intolerable and should be prosecuted; and   6. Taking all necessary steps to ensure that internally displaced  South Sudanese women are directly receiving food aid, shelter, relief  supplies, and other services from United States-sponsored programs.   Mr. Chair, as a nation, we should support the Republic of South Sudan  in its efforts to become a freer, more equitable society that respects,  supports, and endorses the rights of women.   That is why I am pleased that Jackson Lee Amendment No. 168 has been  included in the Chairman's En Bloc Amendment and I urge all Members to  join me in voting for its adoption.   Mr. Chair, thank you for allowing me the opportunity to explain the  Jackson Lee Amendment No. 83, as designated by the Rule governing  debate on H.R. 2810, the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2018.   This Jackson Lee Amendment directs the Secretary of Defense to  develop measures to defend against deployment of nuclear ICBMs by North  Korea to protect against damage or destruction of satellites critical  to U.S national defense and global communications, International Space  Station, and other vital assets.   I request the support of my colleagues for this Jackson Lee Amendment  because it: upholds the goals of the 1963 Treaty Banning Nuclear Weapon  Tests in the atmosphere, in outer space, and underwater; addresses the  fact that our nation should take the next step in preparing for a  nuclear North Korea; establishes that the stakes may be far greater  than a nuclear North Korea when they may have the capacity to launch a  device using an ICBM, because of our nation's dependence on the global  telecommunications infrastructure that includes Geo-stationary  satellites as well as its implications for Space Stations and our space  program; and may have serious consequences for a range of environmental  factors that are critical to the health and wellbeing of our planet.   On July 4th, our nation's Independence Day, the U.S. confirmed that  North Korea had achieved a major step toward its objective of  delivering a nuclear weapon as far as U.S. shores.   This test represents a new escalation of the threat that a nuclear  North Korea poses to the United States and our interest.   The launch of Hwasong-14 missile reached a range of approximately  4160 miles, a distance capable of reaching Alaska, according to  experts.   The timing of this test launch was confirmed as a calculated insult  when North Korean Leader Kim Jung-Un stated that the missile was a  ``gift to Americans for the July 4th Anniversary.''   The United States must attempt to manage this situation and retain  the peace in the region.   We understand the end to the Korean War was a Armistice Agreement  signed in 1953, that put into place a cease fire.   North Korea still views itself as being at war with the United  States.   Otto Warmbier, an American college student who died days following  his release from a North Korean prison was held as a prisoner of war.   Given the unstable nature of the North Korean government, which has  political purges in recent years that included members of North Korean  President's Kim Jongun's family we can hold little hope for cooperation  that is essential to avoid unintended conflicts and reduce tensions  with its neighbors.   A nuclear-armed North Korea does not mean that country will be able  to shoulder the burden of managing a responsible nuclear weapons  program, given their single minded pursuit of a nuclear armed ICBM.   Nuclear arms programs are not always safe or easy for the nation  attempting to develop weapons.   The United States had its share of near disasters.   For example, in 1961, a B-52 Stratofortress carrying two 4-megaton  Mark 39 nuclear bombs broke up in mid-air, dropping its nuclear payload  in the process over North Carolina.   Fortunately, neither bomb detonated averting a catastrophic nuclear  incident at our own hands.   North Korea's program poses a danger to the entire Korean Peninsula,  Japan, and the Asia Pacific region because it insists on using the  world as its nuclear testing ground.   Even if an unarmed ICBM should land in a populated area, this could  trigger a conflict.   If North Korea decides to test nuclear weapons on its ICBM rockets  this poses serious problems for peace and stability not only that  region of the world, but the United States as well.   Since the entry of the space age, America has lead and we now rely on  the fruits of our investments in manned and unmanned missions to  support a global telecommunications infrastructure; a permanent  research presence in the International Space Station; plans for going  much further.   A nuclear North Korea armed with ICBMs can put all of that in  jeopardy.   We also have interest in the environment within our atmosphere, but  also the physical environment that envelopes the earth.   One component of the earth's space environment that protects against  solar radiation is called the Van Allen Belts.   The Van Allen belts present another factor to be considered when  talking about North Korea's nuclear program.   The Van Allen belts may respond to incoming solar radiation and is  known to change size.   The primary benefit to people on earth is they protect us from solar  radiation.   Should North Korea's tests of ICBM include nuclear devices of  significant size this could pose risks to not only our satellites,  space stations, but extend to the Van Allen Belts.   This Jackson Lee amendment allows for a deliberative approach to  addressing the potential for a nuclear North Korea.   This amendment works to develop plans to develop effective  countermeasures to the threat that North Korea's nuclear program  presents.   I ask that my Colleagues join me in support of this Amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Schneider).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from New Mexico (Ms. Michelle Lujan Grisham).   Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico. Mr. Chairman, I rise today  in support of my amendment, which encourages partnerships between the  DOD, DOE, and the private sector, to facilitate the licensure,  transfer, and commercialization of innovative technologies.   We cannot let groundbreaking research and new technologies in our  Nation's Federal laboratories sit idle when they have the potential to  reenergize domestic manufacturing, create high-paying jobs, and  transform our economy.   It is not government or private sector, it is government and private  sector working together to create opportunities that have led to the  development of many products in the marketplace today, including  batteries powering electric vehicles, internet servers, and GPS.   Both the DOD and DOE have separate programs that support technology  transfer to the private sector, but they don't work very well together.  My amendment would fix that and ensure that these departments are  actively collaborating to support the commercialization of cutting-edge  technologies and make them more widely available to American businesses  and consumers.
