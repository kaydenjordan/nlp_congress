 Madam President, I rise today to introduce the Special  Diabetes Program Reauthorization Act of 2023 with Senator Jeanne  Shaheen, my colleague from New Hampshire and cochair of the Senate  Diabetes Caucus. Our bipartisan bill would reauthorize and strengthen  vital type 1 diabetes research happening at the National Institutes of  Health and renew critical treatment, education, and prevention programs  for at-risk populations, specifically Native American and Alaska Native  communities, who experience type 2 diabetes at nearly three times the  national average. Together, these programs have become the Nation's  most strategic and effective effort to combat diabetes and its  complications, but, without an extension, both programs are at risk of  expiring on September 30, 2023.   For more than 25 years, the Special Diabetes Program--comprised of  the Special Statutory Funding Program for Type 1 Diabetes Research and  the Special Diabetes Program for Indians, SDPI--has delivered  meaningful resources and research breakthroughs for those with type 1  diabetes and also for Native Americans and Alaska Natives. This  research has also led to advancements to the broader community,  including the 37 million Americans with diabetes and 96 million with  prediabetes. Our bill would continue these investments in the research  aimed at developing a cure for diabetes and support the programs that  help prevent and treat the disease and its complications.   In one of my very first meetings as a new Senator, I met a young  Mainer with type 1 diabetes. I will never forget this 10-year-old boy  looking up at me and telling me that he wished he could take just 1 day  off from having diabetes--his birthday or Christmas--but of course he  could not. This meeting led me to start the bipartisan Senate Diabetes  Caucus and to begin fighting for a cure for this devastating disease.   Since then, we have made tremendous progress thanks to investments  like the Special Diabetes Program. From new technologies that are  making these children's lives easier to manage to treatments that can  potentially delay the clinical diagnosis of type 1 diabetes, this  program has generated a strong return on investment. Renewal of the SDP  is absolutely critical to accelerating the progress we have made over  the past two decades to treat and one day cure type 1 diabetes. Today's  research represents tomorrow's cure.   As the cochairs of the Senate Diabetes Caucus, Senator Shaheen and I  recently led a letter signed by 60 Senators advocating for the  program's reauthorization and outlining why investing in the Special  Diabetes Program is a cost-effective investment toward improving lives  and reducing healthcare expenditures. The driving force behind this  program is curing one of the United States' most costly diseases in  both human and economic terms.   Our bill would reauthorize both components of the SDP through  December 2025 at an annual funding level of $170 million per program.  Congress has reauthorized the SDP with bipartisan support numerous  times since the program's inception in 1997. Yet funding has not  increased since fiscal year 2004. During this time period, the cost of  research has increased, as has the size of the Indian Health Service  population and the cost of medical care. For that  [[Page S2009]]  reason, our bill also proposes a $20 million increase per program. This  would be the first increase for this program in 20 years.   The two programs in this reauthorization bill have had transformative  effects on diabetes care. The first program is the Special Statutory  Funding Program for Type 1 Diabetes Research, which provides funds to  NIH's National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases,  NIDDK, for life-changing preventive diabetes research. For example,  SDP-funded research laid early groundwork for artificial pancreas, AP,  systems--or closed-loop ``all-in-one'' diabetes management systems-- that have shown great promise in improving glucose monitoring and  insulin delivery. Advances in technology have helped reduce costly and  burdensome complications and improved the quality of life for those  with the disease. There are now multiple FDA-approved artificial  pancreas systems, enabling individuals with type 1 diabetes and their  doctors to choose the system that works best for them. According to one  study, the use of AP systems in adults could save Medicare roughly $1  billion over 25 years.   SDP research has also helped researchers identify genes and  environmental factors linked with type 1 diabetes, led to changes in  clinical practice guidelines for diabetic eye care, and supported  clinical trials on therapeutics to prevent and treat the disease. For  example, landmark research conducted by SDP-funded TrialNet  demonstrated for the first time ever that early preventive treatment  with a drug targeting the immune system delayed onset of clinical-type  1 diabetes for 2 years. This drug has since been approved by the FDA  and is the first ever disease modifying therapy for type 1 diabetes.   Continued investment in this program is essential to continue large- scale trials, plan next steps for research programs, conduct outreach  and education, and allocate research resources effectively. As Dr.  Griffin Rodgers, Director of the NIDDK, said when testifying at a  Senate Aging Committee hearing I chaired in 2019, ``with continued  research, it is possible to imagine that people could lead a life free  of the burden of Type 1 diabetes and its complications.''   Our bill would also provide $170 million per year to sustain a second  program, the Special Diabetes Program for Indians, SDPI. SDPI supports  type 2 diabetes treatment and prevention strategies for Native American  and Alaska Native populations who are disproportionately burdened with  type 2 diabetes at a rate of nearly three times the national average.  In Maine this program benefits five Tribal communities across the  state, providing approximately 5 million dollars in support for  diabetes prevention activities in those Tribal populations. This  Federal support is critical to reducing disparities. As Chief William  Nicholas of the Passamaquoddy Tribe in Maine recently explained,  ``Special Diabetes Program funding is instrumental and necessary to  educate and address high rates of diabetes in Indian Country. Native  Americans are high risk for diabetes, and the funding will continue the  much-needed support, education, and treatment in our communities.''   Tremendous improvements are occurring in diabetes outcomes for Alaska  Natives and Native Americans, and the SDPI has played a key role, just  as Congress envisioned when the program was created. Although diabetes  rates among the IHS service population remain high, with the help of  this program, diabetes rates in youth in these communities have not  increased in more than 10 years, and diabetes rates in Alaska Native  and Native American adults have not increased since 2011. Communities  with SDPI-funded programs have actually seen the diabetes incidence  rate decrease consistently since 2013.   The program is effective by other measures as well. Since SDPI began,  there has been a 50-percent reduction in diabetic eye disease rates  among Alaska Natives and Native Americans; hospitalizations for  uncontrolled diabetes among Alaska Native and Native American adults  have dropped by 84 percent; and the rate of end-stage renal disease has  fallen by more than 50 percent. These positive clinical outcomes have  reduced the risk for blindness, amputations, and kidney failure, in  addition to preventing the onset of type 2 diabetes.   The Special Diabetes Program is funding research that is leading  directly to the development of new insights and therapies that are  improving the lives of those with diabetes and accelerating progress  toward curing and preventing the disease. Ruby Anderson, a young Mainer  with type I diabetes who testified before the 2019 JDRF Children's  Congress, put an even finer point on the need to reauthorize the SDP.  Ruby she said she doesn't want her brother or sister to have to go  through what she has experienced. As she told Senators, ``We need more  research to find a cure. We need even better devices. And we need to  figure out what causes TID so we can stop it.''   I couldn't agree more with Ruby, and I am confident the Special  Diabetes Program will make these objectives possible. I urge my  colleagues to support a multi-year extension of this important program  so that one day we will find a cure to this debilitating disease.                            ____________________     Madam President, I rise today to introduce the Special  Diabetes Program Reauthorization Act of 2023 with Senator Jeanne  Shaheen, my colleague from New Hampshire and cochair of the Senate  Diabetes Caucus.
