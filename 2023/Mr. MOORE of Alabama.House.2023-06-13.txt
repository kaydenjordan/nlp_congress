 Mr. Speaker, on May 31, at midnight, 29 million  Americans became instant felons, thanks to Biden's weaponization of the  ATF.   The ATF's overreaching new rule, created by unelected bureaucrats,  reclassifies pistols as short-barreled rifles if they have a  stabilizing brace attachment. Many disabled veterans and other  Americans rely on these braces to be able to correctly use their  firearms.   Under this new rule, which several courts have already declared  unconstitutional, lawful gun owners could face up to 10 years in jail  and thousands of dollars in fines if they fail to register pistols with  stabilizing braces.   This is a blatant assault on our Second Amendment rights that makes  29 million Americans, including many veterans, subject to up to 10  years in prison and numerous fines. I am glad to see the courts getting  involved to temporarily halt this rule, but we need more permanent  solutions.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote for H.J. Res. 44, led by  the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Clyde), to block this unconstitutional  rule and ensure that lawful gun owners are not considered felons.                            ____________________
