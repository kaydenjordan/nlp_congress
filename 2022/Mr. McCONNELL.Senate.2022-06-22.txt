 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Yesterday, the Senate took a big step toward an  important bipartisan bill to prevent mass murders, make schools safer,  and protect the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding citizens. The  bipartisan group, led by Senator Cornyn, put together a package of  commonsense and popular solutions to make these horrific incidents less  likely, and it does not so much as touch the rights of the overwhelming  majority of American gun owners who are law-abiding citizens of sound  mind.   I have spent my career supporting, defending, and expanding law- abiding citizens' Second Amendment rights. The right to bear arms, the  right to defend one's self and one's family is a core civil liberty.  Among other things, Senate Republicans spent years confirming a  generation of Federal judges who understand that the Constitution and  the Bill of Rights actually mean what they say.   The American people know that we don't have to choose between safer  schools and our constitutional rights. Our country can and should have  both. But throughout recent years, our Democratic colleagues have  indicated they were not interested in substantial legislation to create  safer communities if they didn't get to take massive bites out of the  Second Amendment in the process. There have been attempts at bipartisan  talks after horrible incidents in the past, but they fell apart when  Democrats did not sign on to anything--anything--that did not roll back  the Bill of Rights for law-abiding Americans.   Well, this time is different. This time, Democrats came our way and  agreed to advance some commonsense solutions without rolling back  rights to law-abiding citizens. The result is a product that I am proud  to support. It will send more direct funding to community behavioral  health centers and for mental health in schools. It will send money not  just to States that decide to implement so-called red flag laws, but to  every State to fund crisis intervention programs of their own choosing.  And States that do not use the money for red flag laws will have to  build in new due-process protections that have never been required  before.   The bill also removes the blinders that have prevented the NICS  background check system from considering young people with preexisting  juvenile records. If a young teenager has been convicted of a violent  crime or institutionalized for mental illness, there is no reason why  that important record should be magically wiped away on their 18th  birthday for the purpose of buying weapons. That information is clearly  relevant, and 87 percent of Americans agree.   To be clear, this legislation has no new restrictions, bans, waiting  periods, or mandates for law-abiding gun owners of any age--no new  restrictions, bans, waiting periods or mandates for law-abiding  citizens of any age, including those aged 18 to 21. Someone who has  never been convicted of a violent crime or adjudicated as mentally ill  will not have their rights affected one iota. And a whole lot of  schools and communities will receive more mental health funding to  prevent crisis situations before they develop.                              Judicial Security    Mr. President, now on a related matter, speaking of safer  communities, it would be nice if Attorney General Garland and the  Department of Justice could do their jobs and enforce the Federal laws  that Congress actually already has on the books.   For example, it is currently--right now--illegal to join a mob  protesting outside the private family home of a Federal judge,  including Supreme Court Justices. It is illegal right now to try to  replace the rule of law with harassment and intimidation. What has been  going on outside Justices' homes for weeks now is a Federal crime right  now. But you wouldn't know it from the Justice Department's inaction.   First, the most prominent Democrats in America fan dangerous flames  with intemperate rhetoric about the Court. Then House Democrats  blockade a noncontroversial Supreme Court security bill for weeks-- weeks--until a literal assassination plot came to light. And all the  while, Attorney General Garland still refuses to enforce existing  Federal law and put a stop to these illegal pressure campaigns.   As Washington Democrats continue to stage hearings about political  violence that took place a year and a half ago, their own side of the  aisle is engaging in ongoing political violence as we speak.   In recent weeks, the entire country has been swept with vandalism,  arson, and attacks directed at churches, pro-life organizations, and  crisis pregnancy centers that serve and help women--going on all across  the country. By one count, there have been more than four dozen  incidents of vandalism, harassment, or violence committed by pro- abortion advocates since the shameful leak of a Supreme Court draft  opinion.   The Department of Justice will not even condemn or stop illegal  intimidation mobs today, leading to ask: Are they really prepared to  protect the safety and civil rights of American citizens after the  Court issues high-profile rulings?   Are local authorities here in Washington and around the country ready  for what one far-left group is promising will be ``a night of rage''-- ``a night of rage''?   Well, they had better be. I understand, yesterday, Attorney General  Garland caught a flight to Ukraine. Now, I certainly support our  efforts in Ukraine and was proud to meet with President Zelenskyy  myself a month ago. As a U.S. Senator, I work directly on foreign  policy, but our head of domestic law enforcement ought to be a little  more concerned with his day job.                               Gas Tax Holiday    Now, Mr. President, on one final matter, this morning, the Biden  administration announced another ineffective stunt to mask the effects  of Democrats' war on affordable American energy: calling for a holiday  on the Federal gas tax.   This ineffective stunt will join President Biden's other ineffective  stunt on gas prices: emptying out the Strategic Petroleum Reserve that  we need in the event of a true national security crisis, not just a  Democratic-fueled inflation crisis. This ineffective administration's  big, new idea is a silly proposal that senior members of their own  party have already shot down well in advance.   Earlier this year, Speaker Pelosi said President Biden's idea  ``[wouldn't] even [be] going to the consumers.'' She called it ``very  showbiz.''   Larry Summers, a top economist to multiple Democratic Presidents,  said the idea would be ``shortsighted, ineffective, goofy, and  gimmicky.'' That is Larry Summers.   Jason Furman, President Obama's former head of the Council of  Economic Advisers, said just yesterday--yesterday:         Whatever you thought of the merits of a gas tax holiday in       February, it is a worse idea now . . . A gas tax holiday       would also add to inflation.    Jason Furman, yesterday.   Back in 2008, then-Candidate Obama called the idea ``a gimmick [that  would] save you half a tank of gas over the course of the entire summer  so that everyone in Washington can pat themselves on the back and say  they did something.''   Look, a recent study of past gas tax holidays found that less than 20  percent of the amount ends up actually lowering prices at the pump. In  other words, lifting an 18.4-cent gas tax would mean lowering  Americans' gas prices by just 3 or 4 cents--3 or 4 cents.   The price of gas has risen $2.60 since the Biden administration took  office and launched its holy war on affordable American energy. There  had already been a substantial increase before the conflict in Ukraine  escalated. Now the President wants to trim 3 cents--3 cents--off the  top and take a bow? I don't think so.   Tomorrow, Secretary Granholm will continue the empty theater by  holding an ``emergency meeting'' with domestic energy refiners.  Presumably, this will involve another leftwing browbeating like the  accusatory letter President Biden sent to domestic producers just last  week. The same administration--the same one--that hasn't awarded a  single offshore energy lease, that hasn't offered an onshore lease sale  in five straight quarters, and that has taken every single opportunity  to slow-walk new energy infrastructure into submission appears to have  found  [[Page S3048]]  a convenient scapegoat for the consequences of its own actions.   Actually, I have a better idea: Democrats could stop setting off  inflationary spirals, stop proposing massive tax hikes on the brink of  a recession, stop waging a holy war against American fossil fuels, and  stop applauding the pain that working families are feeling as part of  some grand, leftwing ``transition.''
