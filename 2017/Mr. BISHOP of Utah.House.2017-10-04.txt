 Mr. Chair, I rise to share my concern regarding  potential budget reconciliation instructions to the House Oversight and  Government Reform Committee. These instructions could potentially  result in significant harm to federal employees and federal retirees,  many of whom I represent.   The national debt is a serious challenge that Congress must address,  but I urge members of this body to maintain the promises made to  federal employees at the time of their hiring. At a minimum, any  changes to federal employee retirement or benefits should only be made  on prospective employees, not current or former employees.   The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Duncan of Tennessee). All time for general  debate has expired.   Pursuant to the rule, the concurrent resolution shall be considered  for amendment under the 5-minute rule and is considered read.   The text of the concurrent resolution is as follows:                              H. Con. Res. 71         Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate       concurring),       SECTION 1.

TITLE IV--RESERVE FUNDS IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES       SEC. 401. RESERVE FUND FOR COMMERCIALIZATION OF AIR TRAFFIC                     CONTROL.         (a) In General.--In the House of Representatives, the chair       of the Committee on the Budget may adjust, at a time the       chair deems appropriate, the section 302(a) allocation to the       Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure and other       applicable committees of the House of Representatives,       aggregates, and other appropriate levels established in this       concurrent resolution for a bill or joint resolution, or       amendment thereto or conference report thereon, that       commercializes the operations of the air traffic control       system if such measure reduces the discretionary spending       limits in section 251(c) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency       Deficit Control Act of 1985 by the amount that would       otherwise be appropriated to the Federal Aviation       Administration for air traffic control. Adjustments to the       section 302(a) allocation to the Committee on Appropriations,       consistent with the adjustments to the discretionary spending       limits under such section 251(c), shall only be made upon       enactment of such measure.        (b) Definition.--For purposes of this section, a measure       that commercializes the operations of the air traffic control       system shall be a measure that establishes a Federally-      chartered, not-for-profit corporation that--        (1) is authorized to provide air traffic control services       within the United States airspace;        (2) sets user fees to finance its operations;        (3) may borrow from private capital markets to finance       improvements;        (4) is governed by a board of directors composed of a CEO       and directors whose fiduciary duty is to the entity; and        (5) becomes the employer of those employees directly       connected to providing air traffic control services and who       the Secretary transfers from the Federal Government.

SEC. 405. RESERVE FUND FOR THE REPEAL OR REPLACEMENT OF                     PRESIDENT OBAMA'S HEALTH CARE LAWS.         In the House of Representatives, the chair of the Committee       on the Budget may revise the allocations, aggregates, and       other appropriate budgetary levels in this concurrent       resolution for the budgetary effects of any bill or joint       resolution, or amendment thereto or conference report       thereon, that repeals or replaces any provision of the       Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act or title I or       subtitle B of title II of the Health Care and Education       Reconciliation Act of 2010 by the amount of budget authority       and outlays flowing therefrom provided by such measure for       such purpose.         TITLE V--POLICY STATEMENTS IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES       SEC. 501. POLICY STATEMENT ON A BALANCED BUDGET AMENDMENT.         (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:        (1) In fiscal year 2017, the Federal Government will       collect approximately $3.3 trillion in taxes, but spend more       than $4.0 trillion to maintain its operations, borrowing 15       cents of every Federal dollar spent.        (2) At the end of fiscal year 2016, the national debt of       the United States was more than $19.5 trillion.        (3) A majority of States have petitioned the Federal       Government to hold a constitutional convention to adopt a       balanced budget amendment to the Constitution.  [[Page H7812]]         (4) As of the spring of 2016, 46 States have requirements       to annually balance their respective budgets.        (5) Numerous balanced budget amendment proposals have been       introduced on a bipartisan basis in the House. Currently in       the 115th Congress, 8 joint resolutions proposing a balanced       budget amendment have been introduced.        (6) In the 111th Congress, the House considered H. J. Res.       2, sponsored by Representative Robert W. Goodlatte of       Virginia. Although it received 262 aye votes, it did not       receive the two-thirds required for passage.        (7) In 1995, a balanced budget amendment to the       Constitution passed the House with bipartisan support, but       failed to pass by one vote in the United States Senate.        (8) Five States, Georgia, Alaska, Mississippi, North       Dakota, and Arizona, have agreed to the Compact for a       Balanced Budget, which seeks to amend the Constitution to       require a balanced budget through an Article V convention by       April 12, 2021.        (b) Policy on a Balanced Budget Constitutional Amendment.--      It is the policy of this concurrent resolution that the House       should propose a balanced budget constitutional amendment for       ratification by the States.       SEC. 502. POLICY STATEMENT ON BUDGET PROCESS REFORM.         It is the policy of this concurrent resolution that the       House should enact legislation that reforms the congressional       budget process to--        (1) reassert congressional control over the budget process       by reorienting the Views and Estimates that committees submit       to the Committee on the Budget, as required under 301(d) of       the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, to emphasize       congressional rather than executive branch priorities;        (2) strengthen enforcement of budgetary rules and       requirements by--        (A) enabling Members of the House of Representatives to       enforce budget requirements in a manner that does not       jeopardize the ability of the majority to work its will on       legislation; and        (B) permitting members of Congress to determine whether       emergency-designated appropriations are for unanticipated       situations that pose a threat to life, property, or national       security;        (3) increase control over the costs of Federal activities       by--        (A) incorporating debt service costs into cost estimates       prepared by the Congressional Budget Office;        (B) establishing a process for setting limits on the amount       of debt incurred by the Federal Government from the private       sector as a share of the economy that requires congressional       action if such limits deviate from those previously       determined by Congress and the President;        (C) transitioning to fair-value accounting;        (D) budgeting for Federal insurance programs on an accrual       basis; and        (E) developing and implementing a regulatory budget as       provided in section 503;        (4) achieve greater control over mandatory spending by       reforming reconciliation procedures and requirements to       ensure they are transparent, objectively applied, and       maximize opportunities for deficit reduction;        (5) increase the efficiency of the congressional budget       process by--        (A) realigning the budget cycle with the calendar year and       the congressional calendar;        (B) simplifying the procedures by which the Committee on       Appropriations adjusts its section 302(b) suballocations to       ensure they are consistent with the Committee's overall       section 302(a) allocation; and        (C) increasing congressional accountability for budget       decisions;        (6) improve the transparency of the Federal Government's       obligations by--        (A) modifying the content of the budget resolution to       reflect the budgetary decisions that Congress actually makes       and enforces;        (B) requiring the Comptroller General to periodically       report to Congress on the consolidated financial report of       the Federal Government; and        (C) restructuring the baseline, as set forth in section 257       of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of       1985, to treat mandatory spending and revenue on a comparable       basis; and        (7) achieve control over long-term budget obligations by--        (A) establishing declining limits on the amount of debt       incurred by the Federal Government from the private sector as       a share of the economy that requires congressional action if       such limits deviate from those previously determined by       Congress and the President; and        (B) codifying limits on the amount legislation can increase       the deficit beyond the ten fiscal-year period of the       concurrent resolution on the budget.       SEC. 503. POLICY STATEMENT ON FEDERAL REGULATORY BUDGETING                     AND REFORM.         (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:        (1) Federal regulations are estimated to cost $1.9 trillion       per year or approximately $15,000 per household. Such costs       exceed 10 percent of the Gross Domestic Product of the United       States.        (2) Excessive Federal regulation--        (A) retards job creation, investment, wages, competition,       and economic growth, slowing the Nation's recovery from       economic recession and harming American households;        (B) operates as a regressive tax on poor and lower-income       households;        (C) displaces workers into long-term unemployment or lower-      paying jobs;        (D) adversely affects small businesses, the primary source       of new jobs; and        (E) impedes the economic growth necessary to provide       sufficient funds to meet vital commitments and reduce the       Federal debt.        (3) Federal agencies do not systematically analyze both the       costs and benefits of new regulations or identify and       eliminate, minimize, or mitigate excess regulatory costs       through post-implementation assessments of their regulations.        (4) Agencies too often impose costly regulations without       relying on sound science, through the use of agency guidance,       judicial consent decrees, and settlement agreements, and       through the abuse of high interim compliance costs imposed on       regulated entities that bring legal challenges against newly       promulgated regulations.        (5) Congress lacks an effective mechanism to manage the       level of new Federal regulatory costs imposed each year.       Other nations, meanwhile, have successfully implemented the       use of regulatory budgeting to control excess regulation and       regulatory costs.        (6) Significant steps have been taken already by President       Trump and the 115th Congress, including the imposition of a       regulatory pay-as-you-go regimen for new and revised       regulations by the Trump Administration and the enactment of       14 measures under the Congressional Review Act that repealed       regulations promulgated in the final 60 legislative days of       the 114th Congress.        (b) Policy on Federal Regulatory Budgeting and Reform.--It       is the policy of this concurrent resolution that the House       should, in consultation with the public, consider legislation       that--        (1) requires the President's budget submission to include       an analysis of the costs of complying with current and       proposed regulations;        (2) builds the institutional capacity of the Congressional       Budget Office to develop a regulatory baseline and estimate       regulatory costs;        (3) codifies the Trump Administration's regulatory pay-as-      you-go requirements, which require agencies to offset the       costs of new or revised regulations with the repeal or       modification of existing regulations; and        (4) requires Federal agencies to give notice and allow for       comments on proposed guidance documents.       SEC. 504. POLICY STATEMENT ON UNAUTHORIZED APPROPRIATIONS.         (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:        (1) Article I of the Constitution vests all legislative       power in Congress.        (2) Central to the legislative powers of Congress is the       authorization of appropriations necessary to execute the laws       that establish agencies and programs and impose obligations.        (3) Clause 2 of rule XXI of the Rules of the House of       Representatives prohibits the consideration of appropriations       measures that provide appropriations for unauthorized       programs.        (4) In fiscal year 2016, more than $310 billion was       appropriated for unauthorized programs, spanning 256 separate       laws.        (5) Agencies such as the Department of State have not been       authorized for 15 years.        (6) The House adopted a requirement for the 115th Congress,       as part of H. Res. 5, that requires each standing committee       of the House to adopt an authorization and oversight plan       that enumerates all unauthorized programs and agencies within       its jurisdiction that received funding in the prior year,       among other oversight requirements.        (b) Policy on Unauthorized Appropriations.--In the House,       it is the policy of this concurrent resolution that       legislation should be enacted that--        (1) establishes a schedule for reauthorizing all Federal       programs on a staggered five-year basis together with       declining spending targets for each year a program is not       reauthorized according to such schedule;        (2) prohibits the consideration of appropriations measures       in the House that provide appropriations in excess of       spending targets specified for such measures and ensures that       such rule should be strictly enforced; and        (3) limits funding for non-defense or non-security-related       Federal programs that are not reauthorized according the       schedule described in paragraph (1).       SEC. 505. POLICY STATEMENT ON FEDERAL ACCOUNTING.         (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:        (1) Current accounting methods fail to capture and present       in a compelling manner the full scope of the Federal       Government and its fiscal condition.        (2) Most fiscal analyses produced by the Congressional       Budget Office (CBO) are conducted over a 10-fiscal year       period. The use of generational accounting or a longer time       horizon would provide a more complete picture of the Federal       Government's fiscal condition.        (3) The Federal budget currently accounts for most programs       on a cash accounting basis, which records revenue and       expenses when cash is actually paid or received. However, it       accounts for loan and loan guarantee programs on an accrual       basis, which records revenue when earned and expenses when       incurred.        (4) The Government Accountability Office has advised that       accrual accounting may be  [[Page H7813]]       more accurate than cash accounting in estimating the Federal       Government's liabilities for insurance and other programs.        (5) Accrual accounting under the Federal Credit Reform Act       of 1990 (FCRA) understates the risk and thus the true cost of       some Federal programs, including loans and loan guarantees.        (6) Fair-value accounting better reflects the risk       associated with Federal loan and loan guarantee programs by       using a market based discount rate. CBO, for example, uses       fair-value accounting to measure the cost of the Federal       National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and the Federal       Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac).        (7) In comparing fair-value accounting to FCRA, CBO has       concluded that ``adopting a fair-value approach would provide       a more comprehensive way to measure the costs of Federal       credit programs and would permit more level comparisons       between those costs and the costs of other forms of Federal       assistance''.        (8) The Department of the Treasury, when reporting the       principal financial statements of the United States entitled       Balance Sheet and Statement of Operations and Changes in Net       Position, may omit some of the largest projected Federal       Government expenses, including social insurance programs. The       projected expenses of these programs are reported by the       Department in its Statements of Social Insurance and Changes       in Social Insurance Amounts.        (9) This concurrent resolution directs CBO to estimate the       costs of Federal credit programs on a fair-value basis to       fully capture the risk associated with these programs.        (b) Policy on Federal Accounting Methodologies.--It is the       policy of this concurrent resolution that the House should,       in consultation with CBO and other appropriate stakeholders,       reform government-wide budget and accounting practices so       Members and the public can better understand the fiscal       condition of the United States and the best options to       improve it. Such reforms may include the following:        (1) Providing additional metrics to enhance analysis by       considering the Nation's fiscal condition comprehensively,       over an extended time period, and how it affects Americans of       various age cohorts.        (2) Expanding the use of accrual accounting where       appropriate.        (3) Accounting for certain Federal credit programs using       fair-value accounting to better capture market risk.       SEC. 506. POLICY STATEMENT ON COMMISSION ON BUDGET CONCEPTS.         (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:        (1) In 1965, the President's Commission on Budget Concepts       made a series of recommendations that were adopted and       continue to provide the foundation for the Federal budget       process.        (2) Over the ensuing 52 years, the Federal budget process       has undergone major transformations, including the following:        (A) Congress asserted its Article I ``power of the purse''       through the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 in the form of a       congressional budget process predicated on the adoption of an       annual budget resolution setting forth its priorities       independent of the executive branch.        (B) Congress and the President have periodically augmented       the President's budget submission and the budget resolution       by establishing statutory budget rules and limits enforced       through sequestration.        (C) The share of Federal spending that is not controlled       through the annual appropriations process has ballooned from       32 percent of total Federal spending in 1967 to 69 percent in       2016.        (D) Activities previously considered the exclusive domain       of the Federal Government have been fully commercialized,       contracted out to the private sector, financed through third       party arrangements, or devolved to State and local       governments.        (E) Key functions of the Federal Government are now funded       through user fees rather than general revenue, often       shielding them from congressional control and oversight.        (F) The Credit Reform Act of 1990 placed Federal loans and       loan guarantees on an accrual basis.        (G) Increasing shares of the economy are directed towards       compliance with Federal regulations, which are not subject to       the limitations applicable to Federal spending.        (b) Policy on Commission on Budget Concepts.--It is the       policy of this concurrent resolution on the budget that       legislation should be enacted that establishes a Commission       on Budget Concepts to review and revise budget concepts and       make recommendations to create a more transparent Federal       budget process.       SEC. 507. POLICY STATEMENT ON BUDGET ENFORCEMENT.         It is the policy of this concurrent resolution that the       House should--        (1) adopt an annual budget resolution before spending and       tax legislation is considered in either House of Congress;        (2) assess measures for timely compliance with budget rules       in the House;        (3) pass legislation to strengthen enforcement of the       budget resolution;        (4) comply with the discretionary spending limits set forth       in the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of       1985;        (5) prevent the use of accounting gimmicks to offset higher       spending;        (6) modify scoring conventions to encourage the       commercialization of Federal Government activities that can       best be provided by the private sector; and        (7) discourage the use of savings identified in the budget       resolution as offsets for spending or tax legislation.       SEC. 508. POLICY STATEMENT ON IMPROPER PAYMENTS.         (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:        (1) The Government Accountability Office defines improper       payments as any reported payment that should not have been       made or was made in an incorrect amount.        (2) Improper payments totaled $1.2 trillion between fiscal       years 2003 and 2016 with a reported Federal Government-wide       error rate of 5.1 percent in fiscal year 2016.        (3) Improper payments increased from $107 billion in 2012       to $144 billion in 2016.        (4) The Earned Income Tax Credit, Medicare, and Medicaid       account for 78 percent of total improper payments, with error       rates of 24 percent, 11 percent, and 10.5 percent,       respectively.        (5) Eight agencies did not report payment estimates for 18       programs that the Comptroller General deems susceptible to       significant improper payments.        (b) Policy on Improper Payments.--It is the policy of this       concurrent resolution that an independent commission should       be established with the goal of finding tangible solutions to       reduce total improper payments by 50 percent within the next       5 years. The commission should also develop a more-stringent       system of agency oversight to achieve this goal.       SEC. 509. POLICY STATEMENT ON EXPENDITURES FROM AGENCY FEES                     AND SPENDING.         (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:        (1) Many Federal agencies and organizations have permanent       authority to collect and spend fees and other offsetting       collections.        (2) The Office of Management and Budget estimates the total       amount of offsetting fees and collections to be $513 billion       in fiscal year 2017.        (3) Agency budget justifications are, in some cases, not       fully transparent about the amount of program activity funded       through offsetting collections or fees. This lack of       transparency prevents effective and accountable Government.        (b) Policy on Expenditures From Agency Fees and Spending.--      It is the policy of this concurrent resolution that the House       should reassert its constitutional prerogative to control       Federal spending and exercise rigorous oversight over Federal       agencies. Congress should subject all fees paid by the public       to Federal agencies to annual appropriations or authorizing       legislation and a share of these proceeds should be reserved       for taxpayers in the form of deficit reduction.       SEC. 510. POLICY STATEMENT ON PROMOTING REAL HEALTH CARE                     REFORM.         (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:        (1) Patient-centered health care increases access to       quality care for all Americans, regardless of age, income, or       health status.        (2) States are best equipped to respond to the needs of       their unique communities.        (3) The current legal framework encourages frivolous       medical malpractice lawsuits that increase health care costs.        (b) Policy on Health Care Regulation.--It is the policy of       this concurrent resolution that--        (1) the American health care system should encourage       research, development, and innovation in the medical sector,       rather than stymie growth through over-regulation;        (2) States should determine the parameters of acceptable       private insurance plans based on the needs of their       populations and retain control over other health care       coverage standards;        (3) reforms should protect patients with pre-existing       conditions, reward those who maintain continuous health       coverage, and create greater parity between benefits offered       through employers and those offered independently;        (4) States should have greater flexibility in designing       their Medicaid program and State Children's Health Insurance       Program;        (5) medical malpractice reform should emphasize compliance       with best practice guidelines, while continuing to protect       patients' interests; and        (6) States should have the flexibility to implement medical       liability policies to best suit their needs.       SEC. 511. POLICY STATEMENT ON MEDICARE.         (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:        (1) More than 57 million Americans depend on Medicare for       their health security.        (2) The Medicare Trustees Report has repeatedly recommended       that Congress address Medicare's long-term financial       challenges. Each year without reform, the financial condition       of Medicare becomes more precarious and the threat to those       in or near retirement more pronounced. The current challenges       that Congress will need to address include--        (A) the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund will be exhausted in       2029 and unable to pay the scheduled benefits;        (B) Medicare enrollment is expected to increase more than       50 percent in the next two decades, as 10,000 baby boomers       reach retirement age each day;        (C) due to extended life spans, enrollees remain in       Medicare three times longer than at the outset of the program       five decades ago;  [[Page H7814]]         (D) notwithstanding the program's trust fund arrangement,       current workers' payroll tax contributions pay for current       Medicare beneficiaries instead of being set aside for their       own future use;        (E) the number of workers supporting each beneficiary       continues to fall; in 1965, the ratio was 4.5 workers per       beneficiary, and by 2030, the ratio will be only 2.4 workers       per beneficiary;        (F) the average Medicare beneficiary receives about three       dollars in Medicare benefits for every dollar paid into the       program;        (G) Medicare is growing faster than the economy, with a       projected growth rate of 7.2 percent per year on average       through 2026, peaking in 2026 at 9.2 percent; and        (H) by 2027, Medicare spending will reach more than $1.4       trillion, more than double the 2016 spending level of $692       billion.        (3) Failing to address the impending insolvency of Medicare       will leave millions of American seniors without adequate       health security and younger generations burdened with having       to pay for these unsustainable spending levels.        (b) Policy on Medicare Reform.--It is the policy of this       concurrent resolution to save Medicare for those in or near       retirement and to strengthen the program's solvency for       future beneficiaries.        (c) Assumptions.--This concurrent resolution assumes       transition to an improved Medicare program that ensures--        (1) Medicare is preserved for current and future       beneficiaries;        (2) future Medicare beneficiaries may select from competing       guaranteed health coverage options a plan that best suits       their needs;        (3) traditional fee-for-service Medicare remains a plan       option;        (4) Medicare provides additional assistance for lower-      income beneficiaries and those with greater health risks; and        (5) Medicare spending is put on a sustainable path and       becomes solvent over the long term.       SEC. 512. POLICY STATEMENT ON COMBATING THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC.         (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:        (1) According to the Centers for Disease Control and       Prevention (CDC), 91 Americans die each day from an opioid       overdose.        (2) Nearly half of all opioid overdose deaths involve a       prescription opioid.        (3) Since 1999, the number of prescription opioids sold in       the U.S. has nearly quadrupled.        (4) Since 1999, the number of deaths from prescription       opioids has more than quadrupled.        (5) The CDC asserts that improving opioid prescribing       practices will reduce exposure to opioids, prevent abuse, and       stop addiction.        (6) The CDC has found that individuals in rural counties       are almost twice as likely to overdose on prescription       painkillers as those in urban areas.        (7) According to the CDC, nearly 7,000 people are treated       in emergency rooms every day for using opioids in a non-      approved manner.        (8) The 21st Century Cures Act and the Comprehensive       Addiction and Recovery Act were signed into law in the 114th       Congress in an overwhelming display of congressional and       executive branch support in the fight against the opioid       epidemic.        (9) Bipartisan efforts to eliminate opioid abuse and       provide relief from addiction for all Americans should       continue.        (b) Policy on Opioid Abuse.--It is the policy of this       concurrent resolution that--        (1) combating opioid abuse using available budgetary       resources remains a high priority;        (2) the House, in a bipartisan manner, should continue to       examine the Federal response to the opioid abuse epidemic and       support essential activities to reduce and prevent substance       abuse;        (3) the House should continue to support initiatives       included in the 21st Century Cures Act and the Comprehensive       Addiction and Recovery Act;        (4) the House should continue its oversight efforts,       particularly ongoing investigations conducted by the House       Committee on Energy and Commerce, to ensure that taxpayer       dollars intended to combat opioid abuse are spent       appropriately and efficiently; and        (5) the House should collaborate with State, local, and       tribal entities to develop a comprehensive strategy for       addressing the opioid addiction crisis.       SEC. 513. POLICY STATEMENT ON THE STATE CHILDREN'S HEALTH                     INSURANCE PROGRAM.         (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:        (1) The State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP)       is a means-tested program that provides health insurance       coverage to low-income children and pregnant women who do not       qualify for Medicaid based on income.        (2) SCHIP eligibility varies by State, as States decide the       income upper limit for beneficiaries; the current upper limit       varies from 175 percent of the Federal poverty level to 405       percent of the Federal poverty level.        (3) SCHIP covered on average 6.3 million people monthly in       fiscal year 2017.        (4) The average cost of a child enrolled in SCHIP to the       Federal Government was approximately $2,300 in fiscal year       2017, compared to approximately $1,910 for a child enrolled       in Medicaid.        (5) The Federal spending allotment for SCHIP will expire at       the end of fiscal year 2017.        (6) The Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access Commission       recommends an extension of Federal SCHIP funding, and warns       that all States are projected to exhaust their Federal SCHIP       funds during fiscal year 2018.        (7) SCHIP should be preserved to assist the Nation's       vulnerable children.        (b) Policy on the State Children's Health Insurance       Program.--It is the policy of this concurrent resolution       that--        (1) the House should work in a bipartisan manner to       reauthorize SCHIP funding;        (2) the authorizing committees should consider establishing       a Federal upper limit for SCHIP eligibility, rather than       providing open-ended access to the program for those at       higher income levels;        (3) the House should target resources designated for SCHIP       toward those most in need of Federal assistance; and        (4) the House should require greater reporting by States of       SCHIP data in order to better structure the program to meet       beneficiaries' needs.       SEC. 514. POLICY STATEMENT ON MEDICAL DISCOVERY, DEVELOPMENT,                     DELIVERY, AND INNOVATION.         (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:        (1) The Nation's commitment to the discovery, development,       and delivery of new treatments and cures has made the United       States the biomedical innovation capital of the world for       decades.        (2) The history of scientific discovery and medical       breakthroughs in the United States is extensive, including       the creation of the polio vaccine, the first genetic mapping,       and the invention of the implantable cardiac pacemaker.        (3) Reuters ranks the United States Health and Human       Services Laboratories as first in the world for innovation on       its 2017 list of the Top 25 Global Innovators.        (4) The United States leads the world in the production of       medical devices, and the United States medical device market       accounts for approximately 45 percent of the global market.        (5) The United States remains a global leader in       pharmaceutical research and development investment, has       produced more than half of the world's new molecules in the       past decade, and represents the world's largest       pharmaceutical market, which is triple the size of the       nearest rival, China.        (b) Policy on Medical Innovation.--It is the policy of this       concurrent resolution that--        (1) the Federal Government should foster investment in       health care innovation and maintain the Nation's world       leadership status in medical science by encouraging       competition;        (2) the House should continue to support the critical work       of medical innovators throughout the country through       continued funding for agencies, including the National       Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and       Prevention, to conduct life-saving research and development;       and        (3) the Federal Government should unleash the power of       private-sector medical innovation by removing regulatory       obstacles that impede the adoption of new medical technology       and pharmaceuticals.       SEC. 515. POLICY STATEMENT ON PUBLIC HEALTH PREPAREDNESS.         (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:        (1) The Constitution requires the Federal Government to       provide for the common defense. As such, the Nation must       prioritize its ability to respond rapidly and effectively to       a public health crisis or bioterrorism threat.        (2) There is a persistent threat of bioterrorism against       American lives.        (3) Naturally-occurring public health threats can spread       through the transmission of communicable diseases during       international trade and travel.        (4) As of April 3, 2016, the World Health Organization       reported nearly 29,000 cases of the Ebola virus worldwide,       including 4 instances in the U.S.        (5) As of July 12, 2017, the Centers for Disease Control       and Prevention (CDC) reports that the current Zika epidemic       resulted in over 5,000 cases of the Zika virus within the       United States, with nearly 37,000 more cases reported in U.S.       territories.        (6) Preventing the spread of disease to Americans requires       halting threats before they breach the U.S. border.        (7) The United States is a leader in global public health       assistance and orchestrates international responses to health       crises.        (b) Policy on Public Health Preparedness.--It is the policy       of this concurrent resolution that--        (1) the House should continue to fund activities of the       CDC, the National Institutes of Health, and the Biomedical       Advanced Research and Development Authority to develop and       stockpile medical countermeasures to infectious diseases and       chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear agents;        (2) the House should, within available budgetary resources,       provide continued support for research, prevention, and       public health preparedness programs;        (3) the Federal Government should encourage private-sector       development of critical vaccines and other medical       countermeasures to emerging public health threats; and        (4) the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the       Secretary of Defense, and the Secretary of State should       collaborate on  [[Page H7815]]       global health preparedness initiatives to prevent overlap and       promote responsible stewardship of taxpayer resources.       SEC. 516. POLICY STATEMENT ON SOCIAL SECURITY.         (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:        (1) More than 60 million retirees, individuals with       disabilities, and survivors depend on Social Security. Since       enactment, Social Security has served as a vital leg of the       ``three-legged stool'' of retirement security, which includes       employer provided pensions as well as personal savings.        (2) Lower-income Americans rely on Social Security for a       larger proportion of their retirement income. Therefore,       reforms should take into consideration the need to protect       lower income Americans' retirement security.        (3) The Social Security Trustees Report has repeatedly       recommended that Social Security's long-term financial       challenges be addressed soon. The financial condition of       Social Security and the threat to seniors and those receiving       Social Security disability benefits becomes more pronounced       each year without reform. For example--        (A) in 2028, the Disability Insurance Trust Fund will be       exhausted and program revenues will be unable to pay       scheduled benefits; and        (B) with the exhaustion of both the Disability Insurance       Trust Fund and the Old-Age and Survivors and Disability Trust       Fund in 2035, benefits will be cut by as much as 25 percent       across the board, devastating those currently in or near       retirement and those who rely on Social Security the most.        (4) The recession and continued low economic growth have       exacerbated the looming fiscal crisis facing Social Security.       The most recent Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projections       find that Social Security will run cash deficits of more than       $1.3 trillion over the next 10 years.        (5) The Disability Insurance program provides an essential       income safety net for those with disabilities and their       families. According to CBO, between 1970 and 2015 the number       of disabled workers and their dependent family members       receiving disability benefits has increased by more than 300       percent from 2.7 million to over 10.9 million. This increase       is not due strictly to population growth or decreases in       health. CBO also attributes program growth to changes in       demographics and the composition of the labor force as well       as Federal policies.        (6) In the past, Social Security has been reformed on a       bipartisan basis, most notably by the ``Greenspan       Commission'', which helped address Social Security shortfalls       for more than a generation.        (7) Americans deserve action by the President and Congress       to preserve and strengthen Social Security to ensure that       Social Security remains a critical part of the safety net.        (b) Policy on Social Security.--It is the policy of this       concurrent resolution that the House should work in a       bipartisan manner to make Social Security solvent on a       sustainable basis. This concurrent resolution assumes, under       a reform trigger, that--        (1) if in any year the Board of Trustees of the Federal       Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal       Disability Insurance Trust Fund annual Trustees Report       determines that the 75-year actuarial balance of the Social       Security Trust Funds is in deficit, and the annual balance of       the Social Security Trust Funds in the 75th year is in       deficit, the Board of Trustees should, no later than       September 30 of the same calendar year, submit to the       President recommendations for statutory reforms necessary to       achieve a positive 75-year actuarial balance and a positive       annual balance in the 75th year, and any recommendations       provided to the President must be agreed upon by both Public       Trustees of the Board of Trustees;        (2) not later than December 1 of the same calendar year in       which the Board of Trustees submit its recommendations, the       President should promptly submit implementing legislation to       both Houses of Congress including recommendations necessary       to achieve a positive 75-year actuarial balance and a       positive annual balance in the 75th year, and the majority       leader of the Senate and the majority leader of the House       should introduce the President's legislation upon receipt;        (3) within 60 days of the President submitting legislation,       the committees of jurisdiction should report a bill, which       the House or Senate should consider under expedited       procedures; and        (4) legislation submitted by the President should--        (A) protect those in or near retirement;        (B) preserve the safety net for those who count on Social       Security the most, including those with disabilities and       survivors;        (C) improve fairness for participants;        (D) reduce the burden on and provide certainty for future       generations; and        (E) secure the future of the Disability Insurance program       while addressing the needs of those with disabilities today       and improving the determination process.        (c) Policy on Disability Insurance.--It is the policy of       this concurrent resolution that the House should consider       legislation on a bipartisan basis to reform the Disability       Insurance program prior to its insolvency in 2028 and should       not raid the Social Security retirement system without       reforms to the Disability Insurance system. This concurrent       resolution assumes reform that--        (1) promotes opportunity for those trying to return to       work;        (2) ensures benefits continue to be paid to individuals       with disabilities and their family members who rely on them;        (3) prevents a 7 percent across-the-board benefit cut; and        (4) improves the Disability Insurance program.        (d) Policy on Social Security Solvency.--It is the policy       of this concurrent resolution that any legislation the House       considers to improve the solvency of the Disability Insurance       Trust Fund must also improve the long-term solvency of the       combined Old Age and Survivors Disability Insurance Trust       Fund.       SEC. 517. POLICY STATEMENT ON MEDICAID WORK REQUIREMENTS.         (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:        (1) Medicaid is a Federal-State program that provides       health care coverage for impoverished Americans.        (2) Medicaid serves four major population categories: the       elderly, the blind and disabled, children, and adults.        (3) The Congressional Budget Office projects the average       monthly enrollment in Medicaid for fiscal year 2018 to be 78       million people.        (4) Of this 78 million people, 27 million - more than one       third of the enrollees - are non-elderly, non-disabled       adults.        (5) Medicaid continues to grow at an unsustainable rate,       and will cost approximately one trillion dollars per year       within the decade, between Federal and State spending.        (6) Congress has a responsibility to preserve limited       Medicaid resources for America's most vulnerable - those who       cannot provide for themselves.        (7) Forbes reported last year on a first-of-its-kind study       conducted by the Foundation for Government Accountability. It       analyzed data from the State of Kansas, which demonstrates       that work requirements have led to greater employment, higher       incomes, and less poverty.        (8) The State of Maine implemented work requirements in       2014, and saw incomes rise for able-bodied welfare recipients       by an average of 114 percent within a year.        (9) Work is a valuable source of human dignity, and work       requirements help lift Americans out of poverty by       incentivizing self-reliance.        (b) Policy on Medicaid Work Requirements.--It is the policy       of this concurrent resolution that--        (1) Congress should enact legislation that encourages able-      bodied, non-elderly, non-pregnant adults without dependents       to work, actively seek work, participate in a job-training       program, or do community service, in order to receive       Medicaid;        (2) Medicaid work requirements legislation could include 30       hours per week of work, of which 20 of those hours should be       spent in the core activities of: public or private sector       employment, work experience, on-the-job training, job-search       or job-readiness assistance program participation, community       service, or vocational training and education;        (3) States should be given flexibility to determine the       parameters of qualifying program participation and work-      equivalent experience;        (4) States should perform regular case checks to ensure       taxpayer dollars are appropriately spent; and        (5) the Government Accountability Office or the Department       of Health and Human Services Inspector General should conduct       annual audits of State Medicaid programs to ensure proper       reporting and prevent waste, fraud, and abuse.       SEC. 518. POLICY STATEMENT ON WELFARE REFORM AND SUPPLEMENTAL                     NUTRITION ASSISTANCE PROGRAM WORK REQUIREMENTS.         (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:        (1) Participation in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance       Program (SNAP) has grown from 17 million Americans in 2001 to       44 million in 2016.        (2) The work support role of SNAP has declined, and the       program increasingly serves as a replacement to work.        (3) Work requirements were key to the success of the       Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act (Public Law       104-193), which led to a two-thirds reduction in welfare       caseloads, a reduction in child poverty, and an increase in       work participation. The successful 1996 welfare reform law       provides a model for improving work requirements in other       anti-poverty programs.        (b) Policy on Welfare Reform and SNAP Work Requirements.--      It is the policy of this concurrent resolution that--        (1) the welfare system should reward work, provide tools to       escape poverty, and expect work-capable adults to work or       prepare for work in exchange for welfare benefits; and        (2) SNAP should be reformed to improve work requirements to       help more people escape poverty and move up the economic       ladder.       SEC. 519. POLICY STATEMENT ON STATE FLEXIBILITY IN                     SUPPLEMENTAL NUTRITION ASSISTANCE PROGRAM.         (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:        (1) Spending on Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program       (SNAP) has almost quadrupled since 2001.        (2) Various factors are driving this growth, but one major       reason is that while States have the responsibility of       administering the program, they have little incentive to       ensure it is well run.  [[Page H7816]]         (3) In 1996, a Republican Congress and a Democratic       President reformed welfare by limiting the duration of       benefits, giving States more control over the program, and       helping recipients find work. In the 5 years following       passage, child-poverty rates fell, welfare caseloads fell,       and workers' wages increased. This bipartisan success offers       a model for improving other anti-poverty programs.        (b) Policy on State Flexibility in SNAP.--It is the policy       of this concurrent resolution that SNAP should be reformed to       reduce poverty and increase opportunity and upward mobility       for struggling Americans on the road to personal and       financial independence. Based on the successful welfare       reforms of the 1990s, these proposals would improve work       requirements and provide flexible funding for States to help       those most in need find gainful employment, escape poverty,       and move up the economic ladder.       SEC. 520. POLICY STATEMENT ON HIGHER EDUCATION AND WORKFORCE                     DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITY.         (a) Findings on Higher Education.--The House finds the       following:        (1) A well-educated, high-skilled workforce is critical to       economic, job, and wage growth.        (2) Average published tuition and fees have increased       consistently above the rate of inflation across all types of       colleges and universities.        (3) With an outstanding student loan portfolio of $1.3       trillion, the Federal Government is the largest education       lender to undergraduate and graduate students, parents, and       other guarantors.        (4) Students who do not complete their college degree are       at a greater risk of defaulting on their loans than those who       complete their degree.        (5) Participation in Federal income-driven repayment plans       is rising, in terms of the percent of both borrowers and loan       dollars, according to the Government Accountability Office.       Because these plans offer loan balance forgiveness after a       repayment period, this increased use portends higher       projected costs to taxpayers.        (b) Policy on Higher Education.--It is the policy of this       concurrent resolution to promote college affordability,       access, and success by--        (1) reserving Federal financial aid for those most in need       and streamlining grant and loan aid programs to help students       and families more easily assess their options for financing       postsecondary education; and        (2) removing regulatory barriers to reduce costs, increase       access, and allow for innovative teaching models.        (c) Findings on Workforce Development.--The House finds the       following:        (1) 7.5 million Americans are currently unemployed.        (2) Despite billions of dollars in spending, those looking       for work are stymied by a broken workforce development system       that fails to connect workers with assistance and employers       with skilled personnel.        (3) The House Committee on Education and the Workforce       successfully consolidated 15 workforce development programs       when Congress enacted the Workforce Innovation and       Opportunity Act in 2014.        (d) Policy on Workforce Development.--It is the policy of       this concurrent resolution to build on the success of the       Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act by--        (1) further streamlining and consolidating Federal       workforce development programs; and        (2) empowering States with the flexibility to tailor       funding and programs to the specific needs of their       workforce.       SEC. 521. POLICY STATEMENT ON SUPPLEMENTAL WILDFIRE                     SUPPRESSION FUNDING.         (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:        (1) In 1995, fire activities made up 16 percent of the       United States Forest Service's (USFS) annual appropriated       budget. Since 2015, more than 50 percent has now been       dedicated to wildfire.        (2) Wildland fire suppression activities are currently       funded entirely within the USFS budget, based on a 10-year       rolling average. Using this model, the agency must average       firefighting costs from the past 10 years to predict and       request costs for the next year. When the average was stable,       the agency was able to use this model to budget consistently       for the annual costs associated with wildland fire       suppression.        (3) Over the last few decades, wildland fire suppression       costs have increased as fire seasons have grown longer and       the frequency, size, and severity of wildland fires has       increased.        (4) The six worst fire seasons since 1960 have all occurred       since 2000. Since 2000, many western states have experienced       the largest wildfires in their State's history. In 2016       alone, there were a recorded 67,595 fires and a total of over       5.5 million acres burned. The suppression costs to USFS and       other Federal agencies for 2016 totaled over $1.9 billion       dollars.        (5) As wildfire costs continue to increase, funding levels       for USFS wildfire suppression activities will also continue       to constrict funding levels for other necessary USFS forest       management activities focused on land management and wildfire       prevention.        (b) Policy on Supplemental Wildfire Suppression Funding.--      It is the policy of this concurrent resolution that Congress,       in coordination with the Administration, should develop both       a long-term funding mechanism that would allow supplemental       wildfire suppression funding and reforms on reducing       hazardous fuel loads on Federal forests and lands that could       decrease wildfires.       SEC. 522. POLICY STATEMENT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS                     AFFAIRS.         (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:        (1) For years there have been serious concerns regarding       the Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) bureaucratic       mismanagement and continuous failure to provide veterans       timely access to health care.        (2) Since 2003, VA disability compensation and health care       have been added to the Government Accountability Office's       (GAO) ``high-risk'' list, due to mismanagement and oversight       failures, lack of a ``unified vision, strategy, or set of       goals to guide their outcomes,'' and the inability to ensure       allocated resources are used in a cost-effective and       efficient way to improve veterans' health care access.        (3) The VA's failure to provide timely and accessible       health care to America's veterans is unacceptable. While       Congress has done its part for more than a decade by       providing sufficient funding for the VA, the agency has       mismanaged these resources, resulting in proven adverse       effects on veterans and their families.        (b) Policy on the Department of Veterans Affairs.--It is       the policy of this concurrent resolution that the House       should require the VA to conduct an audit of its programs       named on GAO's ``high-risk'' list and report its findings to       the Committee on Appropriations, the Committee on the Budget,       and the Committee on Veterans Affairs of the House of       Representatives.       SEC. 523. POLICY STATEMENT ON MOVING THE UNITED STATES POSTAL                     SERVICE ON BUDGET.         (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:        (1) The President's Commission on Budget Concepts       recommends that the budget should, as a general rule, be       comprehensive of the full range of Federal activity.        (2) The Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1989 (Public Law 101-      239) moved the United States Postal Service (USPS) off budget       and exempted it from sequestration.        (3) The USPS has a direct effect on the fiscal posture of       the Federal Government, through--        (A) the receipt of direct appropriations of $35 million in       fiscal year 2017;        (B) congressional mandates such as requirements for mail       delivery service schedules;        (C) incurring $15 billion in debt from the Treasury, the       maximum permitted by law;        (D) continued operating deficits since 2007;        (E) defaulting on its statutory obligation to prefund       health care benefits for future retirees; and        (F) carrying $119 billion in total unfunded liabilities       with no foreseeable pathway of funding these liabilities       under current law.        (b) Policy on Moving the USPS on Budget.--It is the policy       of this concurrent resolution that all receipts and       disbursements of the USPS should be included in the       congressional budget and the budget of the Federal       Government.       SEC. 524. POLICY STATEMENT ON THE JUDGMENT FUND.         (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:        (1) The Judgment Fund (Fund), established in 1956, was       created to pay judgments and settlements of lawsuits against       the Federal Government.        (2) As a result of the Fund's design, it is ripe for       executive branch exploitation. The Obama Administration used       the Fund to make billions of dollars in payments to Federal       agencies and foreign entities. For example--        (A) on January 17, 2016, the State Department announced the       Federal Government agreed to pay the Iranian government $1.7       billion to settle a case related to the sale of military       equipment prior to the Iranian revolution, of which $1.3       billion was sourced through the Fund, without prior       congressional notification; the Obama Administration's use of       the Fund to make this and other payments raises serious       concerns by sidestepping Congress; and        (B) in 2016, the Department of Health and Human Services       announced its intentions to use the Fund for settlements with       health insurers who sued the Federal Government over the loss       of funds for risk corridors under the Patient Protection and       Affordable Care Act.        (3) Failing to address the lack of oversight over the Fund       annually costs taxpayers billions of dollars, as payments       exceeded $4.6 billion in 2016 and more than $26 billion in       the preceding 10 year period.        (b) Policy on Judgment Fund.--It is the policy of this       concurrent resolution that the House should consider       legislation that reclaims Congress's power of the purse over       the Fund. Such legislation should--        (1) prohibit interest payments paid from the Fund for       accounts or assets frozen by the Federal Government and       listed on--        (A) the Sanctions Programs list of the Office of Foreign       Asset Control of the Department of Treasury; or        (B) Sponsors of Terrorism list of the Department of State;        (2) amend sections 2414 and 1304 of titles 28 and 31,       United States Code, respectively, to--  [[Page H7817]]         (A) provide a clear definition and explanation of a       ``foreign court or tribunal''; and        (B) require congressional notification whenever the Fund       makes a settlement or court ordered lump sum or aggregated       payment exceeding $500 million; and        (3) require legislative action to approve payments from the       Fund in excess of a specified threshold, increase       transparency, and require Federal agencies to reimburse the       Fund over a fixed time period.       SEC. 525. POLICY STATEMENT ON RESPONSIBLE STEWARDSHIP OF                     TAXPAYER DOLLARS.         (a) Findings.--The House finds that significant savings       were achieved by the House by consolidating operations and       renegotiating contracts.        (b) Policy on Responsible Stewardship of Taxpayer       Dollars.--It is the policy of this concurrent resolution       that--        (1) the House should be a model for the responsible       stewardship of taxpayer resources, and identify any savings       that can be achieved through greater productivity and       efficiency gains in the operation and maintenance of House       services and resources, including printing, conferences,       utilities, telecommunications, furniture, grounds       maintenance, postage, and rent;        (2) the House should review policies and procedures for the       acquisition of goods and services to eliminate unnecessary       spending;        (3) the Committee on House Administration should review the       policies pertaining to services provided to Members and       committees of the House, and identify ways to reduce any       subsidies paid for the operation of the House gym, barber       shop, salon, and the House dining room;        (4) no taxpayer funds should be used to purchase first       class airfare or to lease corporate jets for Members of       Congress; and        (5) retirement benefits for Members of Congress should not       include free, taxpayer-funded health care for life.       SEC. 526. POLICY STATEMENT ON TAX REFORM.         (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:        (1) A world-class tax system should be simple, fair, and       promote (rather than impede) economic growth. The United       States tax code fails on all 3 counts: it is complex, unfair,       and inefficient. The tax code's complexity distorts decisions       to work, save, and invest, which leads to slower economic       growth, lower wages, and less job creation.        (2) Standard economic theory holds that high marginal tax       rates lessen the incentives to work, save, and invest, which       reduces economic output and job creation. Lower economic       output, in turn, mutes the intended revenue gain from higher       marginal tax rates.        (3) Roughly half of United States active business income       and half of private sector employment are derived from       business entities (such as partnerships, S corporations, and       sole proprietorships) that are taxed on a ``pass-through''       basis, meaning the income is taxed at individual rates rather       than corporate rates. Small businesses, in particular, tend       to choose this form for Federal tax purposes, and the highest       Federal rate on such small business income can reach nearly       45 percent. For these reasons, sound economic policy requires       lowering marginal rates on these pass-through entities.        (4) The top United States corporate income tax rate       (including Federal, State, and local taxes) is slightly more       than 39 percent, the highest rate in the industrialized       world. Tax rates this high suppress wages, discourage       investment and job creation, distort business activity, and       put American businesses at a competitive disadvantage with       foreign competitors.        (5) By deterring potential investment, the United States       corporate tax restrains economic growth and job creation. The       United States tax rate differential fosters a variety of       complicated multinational corporate practices intended to       avoid the tax, which have the effect of moving the tax base       offshore, destroying American jobs, and decreasing corporate       revenue.        (6) The ``world-wide'' structure of United States       international taxation essentially taxes earnings of United       States firms twice, putting them at a significant competitive       disadvantage with competitors that have more competitive       international tax systems.        (7) Reforming the tax code would boost the competitiveness       of United States companies operating abroad and significantly       reduce tax avoidance.        (8) The tax code imposes costs on American workers through       lower wages, consumers in higher prices, and investors in       diminished returns.        (9) Increasing taxes to raise revenue and meet out-of-      control spending would sink the economy and Americans'       ability to save for their children's education and       retirement.        (10) Closing special preference carve outs in our tax code       to finance higher spending does not constitute fundamental       tax reform.        (11) Tax reform should curb or eliminate tax breaks and use       those savings to lower tax rates across the board, not to       fund more wasteful Federal Government spending. Washington       has a spending problem, not a revenue problem.        (12) Many economists believe that fundamental tax reform,       including a broader tax base and lower tax rates, would lead       to greater labor supply and increased investment, which would       have a positive impact on total national output.        (b) Policy on Tax Reform.--It is the policy of this       concurrent resolution that the House should consider       comprehensive tax reform legislation that promotes economic       growth, creates American jobs, increases wages, and benefits       American consumers, investors, and workers by--        (1) simplifying the tax code to make it fairer to American       families and businesses and reducing the amount of time and       resources necessary to comply with tax laws;        (2) substantially lowering tax rates for individuals and       consolidating the current seven individual income tax       brackets into fewer brackets;        (3) repealing the Alternative Minimum Tax;        (4) reducing the corporate tax rate; and        (5) transitioning the tax code to a more competitive system       of international taxation.
