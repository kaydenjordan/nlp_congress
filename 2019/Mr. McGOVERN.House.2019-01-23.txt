 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 61 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                 H. Res. 61         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 648) making       appropriations for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2019,       and for other purposes. All points of order against       consideration of the bill are waived. The bill shall be       considered as read. All points of order against provisions in       the bill are waived. Clause 2(e) of rule XXI shall not apply       during consideration of the bill. The previous question shall       be considered as ordered on the bill and on any amendment       thereto to final passage without intervening motion except:       (1) one hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the       chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on       Appropriations or their respective designees; and (2) one       motion to recommit.        Sec. 2.  Upon adoption of this resolution it shall be in       order to consider in the House the joint resolution (H.J.       Res. 31) making further continuing appropriations for the       Department of Homeland Security for fiscal year 2019, and for       other purposes. All points of order against consideration of       the joint resolution are waived. The joint resolution shall       be considered as read. All points of order against provisions       in the joint resolution are waived. The previous question       shall be considered as ordered on the joint resolution and on       any amendment thereto to final passage without intervening       motion except: (1) one hour of debate equally divided and       controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the       Committee on Appropriations or their respective designees;       and (2) one motion to recommit.        Sec. 3.  It shall be in order at any time through the       legislative day of February 1, 2019, for the Speaker to       entertain motions that the House suspend the rules as though       under clause 1 of rule XV. The Speaker or her designee shall       consult with the Minority Leader or his designee on the       designation of  [[Page H1013]]       any matter for consideration pursuant to this section.        Sec. 4.  The requirement of clause 6(a) of rule XIII for a       two-thirds vote to consider a report from the Committee on       Rules on the same day it is presented to the House is waived       with respect to any resolution reported through the       legislative day of January 30, 2019, relating to a measure       making or continuing appropriations for the fiscal year       ending September 30, 2019.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Woodall),  pending which time I yield myself such time as I may consume. During  consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose  of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, on Tuesday, the Rules Committee met and  reported a rule, House Resolution 61, providing for consideration of  H.R. 648, the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2019, under a closed  rule.   The rule provides 1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled by  the chair and ranking member of the Committee on Appropriations. It  also provides for consideration of H.J. Res. 31, which makes further  continuing appropriations for the Department of Homeland Security for  fiscal year 2019 under a closed rule. The rule provides 1 hour of  debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking member  of the Appropriations Committee.   Additionally, it extends same-day authority for appropriations  measures through January 30 and suspension authority through February  1.   Mr. Speaker, we are on day 33 of the Trump shutdown, the longest  government shutdown in American history. Hundreds of thousands of  Federal workers will miss a paycheck for the second time since the  President plunged us into this mess.   The very people who keep our Nation safe are struggling to put food  on the table, people like men and women in the Coast Guard, FBI agents,  Border Patrol officers, and TSA agents.   Makeshift food banks are being opened across the country to help  these workers and their families get by. Right outside our Nation's  Capital, in Northern Virginia, some Federal workers waited more than an  hour recently at a local food bank. Demand was so high that a tenth of  the food was gone in the first 5 minutes.   Because of the President's shutdown, 15 million households could see  a gap in their monthly SNAP benefits that lasts more than 40 days. Four  million low-income households could see a gap that lasts more than 50  days.   This program is their lifeline, Mr. Speaker. These families don't  have a plan B.   I have given weekly end-hunger-now speeches on this floor since  February of 2013, and I have made it clear time and time again that  hunger is not only unacceptable in this country, the richest country in  the history of the world, but it is a political condition.   We have the resources. We have what it takes. What we need to muster  is the political will to do something about it. But here we are, and as  I said, it is embarrassing enough that the wealthiest nation on the  planet has an ongoing hunger crisis, but I never, ever imagined that a  President of the United States would exacerbate it like this.   This is disgusting. This is unacceptable. This is unconscionable.   Let us be clear: It is the President's bruised ego that keeps a  quarter of our government closed today.   Now, his latest so-called compromise proposal isn't really a  compromise at all. In fact, it brings new meaning to the word  ``cruel.''                                time  1230    Not only does it fail to provide a permanent solution for the  Dreamers or TPS recipients, it only covers a fraction of eligible  Dreamers, it excludes TPS holders from Asia and Africa, and it rewrites  the law for future DACA recipients, TPS holders, and asylum seekers  that will make it all but impossible for anyone to qualify.   These are the same old, tired, and extremist ideas the President and  his advisers floated last year. They were rejected by both the  Republican-controlled House and the Republican-controlled Senate. This  is not a compromise. This is called backwards.   Now, if this administration wants to target refugees, people fleeing  persecution, people fleeing for their life, if that is what he wants to  do, then at least he should have the guts to do it in an open hearing  for the world to see.   Now, President Trump is treating this like some reality show. He  doesn't want to look bad in the right-wing press despite the fact that  Members of both parties are refusing to fund his ineffective wall. If  the President really wants to reach a real compromise, then he should  log off Twitter and actually sit down with us and be willing to  actually negotiate; no more storming out of the Situation Room and no  more of his my-way-or-the-highway approach. Work with us for a change.   For whatever reason, Mr. Speaker, he has been unwilling to do that.  President Trump may not have the fortitude to get us out of this mess  that he created, but this majority does. So instead of following the  President who got us into this mess, we have an opportunity to lead.  Passing these bipartisan, bicameral bills is what leadership looks  like.   Now, many of my Republican friends have asked to consider a plan that  doesn't cede the House's will by considering a Senate bill. Well, today  is their day because we are considering a bipartisan, bicameral  compromise. This six-bill package is the result of real negotiations  between the Appropriations Committees in the House and Senate. It is a  true compromise that would reopen the entire government apart from the  Department of Homeland Security. In fact, these negotiated bills are  exactly what my good friends on the other side of the aisle have been  asking us over the past week to take up. Again, this is all last year's  work in the last session.   I recognize that we don't have a similar agreement on the Homeland  Security measure included here, but this short-term CR will get our TSA  agents paid while all other parties get back to the negotiating table.   The minibus includes $328 million in new dollars for border security  that we know will actually work. The funding will increase  infrastructure investments at our ports of entry; install new  technology that will scan for drugs, weapons, and contraband; put in  place technology to detect unauthorized crossings; and fund more  immigration judges. This is what smart security looks like in the 21st  century, Mr. Speaker, not some medieval wall.   Now, these details have already been agreed to by Democrats and  Republicans on both sides of the Capitol. The majority is standing by  our word. I urge my Republican friends: Take yes for an answer.   The President may be proud to have shut down this government, but  this is nothing to be proud of.   How can anybody be proud that 800,000 Federal workers are about to  miss a second paycheck, that our TSA workers are calling in sick so  they can work another job that actually helps them pay the bills, or  the economy is losing growth at twice the speed originally estimated?   I could go on and on and on and on, Mr. Speaker, but I know each of  us has heard from people in our districts. Our offices are getting  these calls every day, in fact, every hour and every minute now. We are  all hearing from struggling constituents. Their message is the same:  End this shutdown. End this shutdown.   This doesn't seem, unfortunately, to be a priority for President  Trump. He is out there tweeting about which player should be in the  Baseball Hall of Fame. Give me a break. Maybe he doesn't know what it  is like in the real world. After all, the President got his start  through what he has called a small loan from his dad that reports now  estimate could have totaled more than $60 million. That is the world he  lives in.   But families are struggling and left to wonder how they are going to  afford to put food on the table or how they are going to pay for  medicine without a paycheck.   Enough of the games. Congress has the power to end this shutdown.  [[Page H1014]]    Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this rule  and give the underlying legislation the strong veto-proof vote it  deserves. Let's finally turn the lights back on. Listen to your  constituents, I say to my friends on the other side of the aisle.  Listen to what they are saying. Turn the lights back on.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Let me just remind my colleague that the bills that we are taking up  here today were the result of a robust amendment process and robust  debate in the last Congress. This is all last year's work.   I also remind the gentleman he is right about one thing, that we  haven't sent the President a bill from both Chambers, but we almost  did. If he remembers correctly, in December, when the Republicans  controlled the House and the Republicans controlled the Senate and  they, obviously, controlled the White House, we actually came together  and the Senate passed a bill that would keep the government running and  open, unanimously.   I even supported the gentleman's martial law rule to be able to bring  up that legislation expeditiously so we could do our work and so that  nobody would have to be anxious over the holidays as to whether or not  they were going to get paid.   We were about to vote on it, and it was agreed on by Democrats and  Republicans. There was no controversy. And then the President turned on  rightwing TV or was listening to rightwing radio, and Ann Coulter and  some of these other rightwing extremists said: No, you can't do that.   And he changed his mind, and everything came to a standstill. So all  this bipartisan work was for naught.   What we are bringing up here today is all the bipartisan work that  many of my Republican colleagues on the Appropriations Committee,  Democrats and Republicans, worked hard on to come up with a compromise  that is good. It is good. Yet my friends say: Well, no. Let's start all  over again.   The bottom line is the other side left us with a mess. When they  controlled everything, they weren't able to get the job done.   Let me just say, here are some facts:   This is the longest shutdown in history, but it is historic for  another reason. This is the first time in history that a Congress has  ended in a government shutdown. Never before has a Congress left it to  the next Congress to reopen the government. With all due respect to my  friends, that is what my friends left us with.   On top of that, Republicans had control of the White House, the  Senate, and the House last year, and they couldn't keep the lights on.  Then Republicans went home for Christmas and New Year's and every day  in between. I know because I was on the floor multiple times begging to  be recognized to offer solutions, and I was denied even the ability to  offer a solution.   Since we took charge, we have nonstop offered options. Now some  Members want to complain about how we are cleaning up the mess that was  left to us.   Imagine this. Imagine if someone dumped a bunch of garbage on your  lawn and then started complaining about how you weren't cleaning it up.  That is what is happening here.   I would suggest that my friends kind of save their criticisms for a  time when we aren't cleaning up after all of them.   I just want to make one other point. The gentleman said that we have  martial law, same-day authority in this rule to bring up anything we  want. No, that is not the case.   When my friends were in charge, they did. They had martial law to  bring up anything they wanted to, and they were trying to bring up a  cheese bill, if I remember correctly, instead of a bill to keep the  government open in the last days of December.   No. We limit it to appropriations matters, and we want to be able to,  if we can come to a deal, if we come to some sort of solution, to be  able to bring something up immediately to be able to get everybody the  paychecks to which they are entitled.   I know the gentleman was home over the holiday weekend, and I was,  too. My constituents asked me the question over and over: I get it that  there is a disagreement over the President's border wall, but why do  you have to shut the entire government down over that issue? Why can't  you just continue in negotiation? Why do you have to deny TSA workers a  paycheck? Why is that okay? Why is that acceptable? Why are they pawns  in this? Or men and women who serve in our Coast Guard, why is that  okay to say: You don't get paid because the President is having a  temper tantrum and he is not getting his way? All of a sudden, we have  to deny them a paycheck?   People don't understand why my Republican friends think this is  acceptable. The gentleman from Georgia knows that the reason why a bill  is not on the President's desk is because the Senate majority leader,  Mr. McConnell, is basically doing the President's bidding. He said: I  am not going to bring anything to the floor that the President doesn't  want to sign.   We have another option here, too: We can actually pass bipartisan  bills that should win overwhelming support. We should pass them with  veto-proof margins and basically say to the President: We don't believe  in government by blackmail. That is not the way we do things around  here. That is not the way this government is supposed to work.   We ought to reopen the government, and we ought to engage in serious  discussions about how we improve our border security. We have some  great ideas on how to do that. We have some ideas that I mentioned in  my opening speech on ways we can improve our border security.   We think a border wall is a ridiculous idea. But if you want to talk  about a wall, fine, but don't--don't--hold hundreds of thousands of  workers hostage.   We have an opportunity now to set these hostages that the President  has taken free. Let's do it.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Let me say, I think we have agreement here. We all want to open the  government. We all want to reopen the government. I think the  difference here is that we have no preconditions on reopening the  government. My Republican friends do have preconditions, and it is  whatever the President decides he wants to tack on at the last minute.   So there is a difference here. We have no preconditions. Open the  government up, start paying all of our Federal workers, let's get our  country back to normal here in terms of the Federal workforce, but my  Republican friends have all these strings that they want to attach to  it.   The gentleman from Michigan said, you know, he refers to one of the  ``gotcha'' amendments that the Republicans offered on backpay for  Federal workers. I should remind him that we actually passed a law  here, S. 24, which created an entitlement to backpay for  [[Page H1017]]  Federal workers who aren't getting paid during the shutdown. So we  actually dealt with that here. We actually passed a law, and, that, he  may not have known that.   I should also say to my Republican friends, understand that the  American people are not on your side on this. There is a recent ``CBS  News'' poll--7 in 10 Americans do not think the issue of a border wall  is worth a government shutdown--7 in 10.   Now, I know there is this--you know, the President is worried about  that 25, 30 percent of his base, but the vast majority of the people in  this country aren't with him on this. They are not with you on this by  not stepping up and saying we ought to reopen our government.   You want to have a negotiation on border security, we have lots of  ideas to enhance border security, and that is based on conversations  with people on the border who talk about increased technology, who talk  about better infrastructure, who talk about more personnel, you know,  more asylum judges. I can go on and on and on. We are all for that.  Let's continue that conversation.   But why in the world does this President insist on shutting the  government down until he gets his way on this border wall? This is not  the way you do a negotiation. And, again, if you want to reopen the  government, and we do, we have no conditions. Reopen the government. It  is that simple.   And the bills--the gentleman from Michigan talked about bills that  the Senate would pass. Some of the bills that we are sending over to  the Senate passed unanimously. Boy, I mean, if that is not a signal  that they overwhelmingly agree with the substance of these bills, I  don't know what is, but they did. They voted unanimously, in some  cases, for some of these bills we are sending over here.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record an article from ``The Washington  Post'' titled: ``Unacceptable: Coast Guard's top officer criticizes  lack of payment in government shutdown.''                 [From the Washington Post, Jan. 22, 2019]  `Unacceptable': Coast Guard's Top Officer Criticizes Lack of Payment in                            Government Shutdown                              (By Dan Lamothe)         The Coast Guard's top admiral said Tuesday that members of       the armed forces should not be expected to shoulder the       burden of the partial government shutdown, citing the       ``anxiety and stress'' it is causing military families as       their pay is withheld.        Adm. Karl Schultz, the Coast Guard commandant, said he is       heartened by the outpouring of support Coast Guard personnel       have received across the country but expects more.        ``Ultimately, I find it unacceptable that Coast Guard men       and women have to rely on food pantries and donations to get       through day-to-day life as service members,'' he said,       speaking on a video posted to his Twitter account.        The comments marked the admiral's most forceful remarks       about the shutdown since it began 32 days ago amid a dispute       over President Trump's demands for funding for a southern       border wall. While the majority of the U.S. military is part       of the Defense Department and has funding, the Department of       Homeland Security and is agencies, including the Coast Guard,       are affected by the shutdown.        About 41,000 active-duty service members and 2,100       civilians who are considered ``essential personnel'' are       working without a paycheck under the promise they will get       back pay when the shutdown is resolved, said Lt. Cmdr. Scott       McBride, a service spokesman. That situation grew more urgent       Jan. 15, when service members missed a paycheck. An       additional 6,000 civilians working for the service are       furloughed.        Overall, about 800,000 federal workers are not receiving       paychecks amid the shutdown, with nearly half furloughed.        Schultz, appearing alongside the service's top enlisted       man, Master Chief Petty Officer of the Coast Guard Jason M.       Vanderhaden, noted that civilian employees will miss another       paycheck Friday and called it a 'sobering'' situation.        Senior Coast Guard officials and the American public, he       said, ``stand in awe'' of the affected service members'       'continued dedication to duty and resilience'' and that of       their families.        The admiral, in keeping with the military's tradition of       not commenting directly on politics, did not blame anyone       specific for the shutdown. He and Homeland Security Secretary       Kirstjen Nielsen are making their case for the service on       Capitol Hill, Schultz said.        The Coast Guard has continued to carry out operations       across the globe during the shutdown.        On Sunday, the Coast Guard Cutter Bertholf departed from       Alameda, Calif., with about 170 people aboard for a       deployment to the Pacific that will last up to six months.       The Defense Department will reimburse the service for the       deployment, but Coast Guard personnel still will not be paid       until the shutdown is resolved.        ``The crew, like all other [Coast Guard] members, are       affected by the lapse of appropriations, and are not being       paid,'' said Lt. Cmdr. Steve Brickey, a service spokesman.       ``It is always difficult to deploy for months and leave       behind family and loved ones. That stress is of course       magnified when you add on the uncertainly of the shutdown.''     Admiral Schultz, the Coast Guard's commandant said:  ``Ultimately, I find it unacceptable that Coast Guard men and women  have to rely on food pantries and donations to get through day-to-day  life as servicemembers.''   In total, 41,000 Active Duty servicemembers and 2,100 civilians are  essential personnel and working without pay and have been for 33 days  now. An additional 6,000 are furloughed. As of this Friday, these brave  men and women will have missed two paychecks. That is unacceptable.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record an article titled: ``America's  veterans said to be disproportionately affected by government  shutdown.''                       [From ABC News, Jan. 9, 2019]  America's Veterans Said To Be Disproportionately Affected by Government                                  Shutdown                         (By Elizabeth McLaughlin)         As the partial government shutdown continues for a third       week, veterans groups are sounding the alarm because of what       they say is the disproportionate impact on America's veterans       and a growing fear that financial uncertainty could lead to       self-harm.        An estimated one-third of the federal workforce is made up       of veterans, according to the Office of Personnel Management,       meaning that more than 250,000 veterans are not currently       receiving paychecks.        ``This shutdown has consequences that go beyond loss of       pay,'' the Union Veterans Council said in a statement this       week. ``Financial instability is one of the main cause of       suicides among the veterans' community. These hard-working       men and women who sacrificed so much for their country should       not have their families held hostage by lawmakers that cannot       relate to living paycheck to paycheck.''        Edward M. Canales is a local union president with the       American Federation of Government Employees and a veteran       liaison officer who serves as a resource to veterans working       in the U.S. Bureau of Prisons west of the Mississippi River.        He told ABC News that he's received numerous calls from       veterans who aren't able to support their families during the       shutdown and express ``no positive outlook on the future.''        ``If this shutdown does not stop, we are going to have       fatalities. We're going to have suicides,'' he said.        Canales, a U.S. Army veteran himself who deployed to Iraq       during Operation Desert Storm, said he is referring calls to       the Department of Veterans Affairs hotline out of concern       that a veteran will self-harm.        He called the shutdown ``shameful,'' saying its ``slapping       every veteran in the face who has served their country.''        As a special investigative service technician who worked in       the federal prison system for 26 years, Canales is currently       not receiving his retirement pay.        Toby Hauck, a six-year Air Force veteran, is an air traffic       controller in Aurora, Illinois, who has gone without a       paycheck since Dec. 31. He told ABC News that his father and       grandfather served in the U.S. military and now his son and       daughter-in-law are deploying overseas at the end of the       month.        Hauck and his wife, a neonatal intensive care unit nurse,       will be looking after their two-and-a-half-year-old       granddaughter during the ten-month deployment, and the       continued lack of pay causes added stress to their already       hectic jobs, he said.        ``We are hardworking, proud American employees doing a job       for the American public that is essential as an air traffic       controller,'' said Hauck, who is also a representative for       the National Air Traffic Controllers Association. ``It's not       acceptable as a veteran, as a federal employee, as an air       traffic controller to use my profession and my livelihood as       a political football.''        ``[Veterans] are very proud of our heritage and what we've       done for the country. And those of us who continue to serve       the federal government as a federal employee continue that       pride throughout their careers,'' he added.     The Union Veterans Council said in a statement this  week, ``Financial instability is one of the main causes of suicide  among the veterans' community. These hardworking men and women who  sacrificed so much for their country should not have their families  held hostage by lawmakers that cannot relate to living paycheck to  paycheck.''   According to the Office of Personnel Management, one-third of the  Federal workforce is made up of veterans. That means 250,000 veterans  are not receiving paychecks right now during this  [[Page H1018]]  Trump shutdown. That is an absolute disgrace.   Mr. Speaker, as the Trump shutdown continues, hundreds of Internal  Revenue Service employees have received permission to skip work due to  financial hardships, and absences are only expected to grow.   I would like to share a story about Marissa Scott, an IRS employee  who is gravely affected by this Trump shutdown. Ms. Scott lives outside  of Kansas City, Missouri. She drives 98 miles roundtrip to work each  day. Right now, she cannot afford to fill her gas tank and has stopped  going to work.   She shared that she typically helps 50 people a day with their tax  returns and fears that this shutdown may cause delays in tax refunds  for months as more employees like her are unable to continue working  without a paycheck. These are tax refunds that Americans rely on and  are eagerly waiting to be processed.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record an article from ``The Washington  Post'' titled: ``Hundreds of IRS employees are skipping work. That  could delay tax refunds.'' It also details Ms. Scott's story.                 [From the Washington Post, Jan. 22, 2019]     Hundreds of IRS Employees Are Skipping Work. That Could Delay Tax                                  Refunds      (By Danielle Paquette, Lisa Rein, Jeff Stein and Kimberly Kindy)         Hundreds of Internal Revenue Service employees have       received permission to skip work during the partial       government shutdown due to financial hardship, and union       leaders said Tuesday that they expected absences to surge as       part of a coordinated protest that could hamper the       government's ability to process taxpayer refunds on time.        The Trump administration last week ordered at least 30,000       IRS workers back to their offices, where they have been       working to process refunds without pay. It was one of the       biggest steps the government has taken to mitigate the       shutdown's impact on Americans' lives.        But IRS employees across the country--some in coordinated       protest, others out of financial necessity--won't be clocking       in, according to Tony Reardon, president of the National       Treasury Employees Union, and several local union officials.       The work action is widespread and includes employees from a       processing center in Ogden, Utah, to the Brookhaven campus on       New York's Long Island.        The move is the leading edge of pushback from within the       IRS, and it signals the potential for civil servants to take       actions that could slow or cripple government functions as       the shutdown's political stalemate continues in Washington.       U.S. Department of Agriculture meat inspectors have begun to       call in sick, Transportation Security Administration sickouts       at airports have been rising, and federal law enforcement       agencies say the shutdown is increasing stress among agents       and affecting investigations.        ``They are definitely angry that they're not getting paid,       and maybe some of them are angry enough to express their       anger this way,'' said Reardon, whose union represents       150,000 employees at 33 federal agencies and departments.       ``But these employees live paycheck to paycheck, and they       can't scrape up the dollars to get to work or pay for child       care.''        Not receiving pay for more than a month has taken a toll on       employees across the government, but especially on those who       are not in high-salary jobs. The employees summoned back from       furlough to process tax refunds are paid between $25,800 and       $51,000 a year, depending on their seniority. IRS employees       will miss a second paycheck Monday if the government does not       reopen this week.        ``I'm at the point where I cannot afford to go to work,''       said Marissa Scott, 31, an IRS customer service       representative who is out on hardship leave. Scott lives       outside Kansas City, Mo., and drives 98 miles round trip to       work each day. ``I cannot afford to fill my gas tank.''        Scott, who has worked at the IRS for four years, says she       typically helps as many as 50 people a day with their returns       during tax season, including U.S. troops stationed overseas.       She said the shutdown could delay refunds for months, and       without employees like her on the job, ``it's going to be a       disaster all around.''        Many of the IRS employees who are choosing not to come to       work despite getting called back are taking advantage of a       provision in the union contract that allows them to miss work       if they suffer a ``hardship'' during a shutdown, according to       the labor groups.        That could mean a blown car tire, an empty gas tank or a       child-care bill.        ``I have fielded no less than 30 to 40 calls, emails or       text messages about hardship requests from employees daily       since Thursday,'' said Shannon Ellis, president of the NTEU's       Chapter 66 in Kansas City.        In Andover, Mass., more than 100 customer service       representatives, electronic filing workers and other IRS       employees plan to use the hardship exemption and won't report       to work, said Gary Karibian, chapter president of a local       union.        ``I would say a majority of employees are calling out under       hardship,'' Karibian said. ``I'm getting reports whole teams       are requesting out. One person told me, `I'm the only one on       my team here.' ''        The union lacks an official head count of absent workers--      the IRS declined to share data on hardship exemptions--but       staffers in Fresno, Calif.; Austin; Andover; Kansas City and       Atlanta, among other locations, say they won't be showing up       for work, Reardon said.        Duncan Giles, who has worked for 24 years at an IRS call       center in Indianapolis, said more workers are requesting       hardship leave as they learn it exists.        ``The more this goes on and the tougher it is to get to       work--they simply cannot afford it,'' said Giles, president       of NTEU Chapter 49, noting that about 30 of the 170 employees       who have been called back to work in Indianapolis have       requested the exemption. ``Every single person wants to be at       work. They want to help the American taxpayer. But we have to       pay for gas and child care.''        The hardship exemption allows IRS employees not to have to       use sick days to be absent from work, and managers must       approve the exemptions.        Lawmakers also have heard reports of IRS staffers intending       to miss work and are planning to ask Treasury, Secretary       Steven Mnuchin for details when he testifies on Capitol Hill       this Thursday, a House aide said.        The IRS declined to say how many workers are on hardship       leave, and spokesman Matt Leas said the IRS is continuing its       work to prepare for the beginning of filing season next week.        ``We are continuing our recall operations, and we continue       to assess the situation at this time,'' Leas said.        The IRS employees' moves come amid broad uncertainty about       the Trump administration's attempts to minimize the impact of       the shutdown. On Sunday, the number of TSA agents who failed       to show up for work hit a record 10 percent, resulting in       long wait times. Guards at federal prisons also are calling       out at high rates, with union officials at 10 prisons       contacted by The Washington Post this month saying the number       of employees skipping work has doubled.        As a result, officers who report for duty often are working       16-hour shifts, and prison secretaries and janitors are being       forced to patrol the halls and yards.        ``All I have is pepper spray and a radio to call for       help,'' said 52-year-old Opal Brown, who works as a secretary       at Hazelton Federal Correctional Institution in West       Virginia.        The FBI Agents Association said in a report Tuesday that       the shutdown is hampering the ability of agents to perform       their ``duties and fund necessary operations and       investigations.''        USDA meat inspectors also have begun calling in sick--in       numbers large enough to trigger an agency crackdown. The       inspectors were told Jan. 11 to bring in a doctor's note,       even if they were ill for a single day, records show.        Six days later, after protests from union leaders, agency       officials reverted to existing policy, which calls for a       doctor's note after three days.        Some front-line managers at the IRS have threatened their       employees and said they could lose their jobs if they put in       for the exemption, but Reardon, the union leader, said most       have been instructed by senior management to approve the       requests.        IRS employees are some of the most impactful federal       workers caught in the middle of the shutdown, as the tax       filing season begins and millions of Americans are expected       to seek tax refunds in February. Last year, more than $140       billion in tax refunds was paid out through early March,       according to IRS data.        Trump has expressed an interest in making sure that tax       refunds are paid out next month, believing that if they are       delayed he could face major public backlash. His budget       office took the unprecedented step this month of ordering       thousands of unpaid IRS workers back to the office, saying       that processing refunds was an ``essential'' government       function even if the workers weren't paid.        As much as 75 percent of the roughly 4,000 furloughed IRS       employees in Kansas City could qualify for hardship leave,       said Christina Bennett, executive vice president of the local       National Treasury Employees Union chapter.``Right now,       they're being lenient,'' Bennett said.        Employees who process tax refunds, she said, are among the       lowest-paid IRS workers. Some are worried about losing their       cars.        Bennett, 63, who has worked nearly four decades at the IRS,       most recently as an accountant, said she, too, can no longer       afford her commute. She plans to request hardship leave if       the government calls her back to work.        ``I just don't have it,'' she said. ``I'd have to walk a       half-hour to get to a bus stop. And it's so cold. We've got       rain, snow, rain, snow.''        Sakeya Cooks, 24, another IRS worker who guides taxpayers       through the refund process, said she might never report back       to work. She already has applied for a new job at a Kansas       City bank.        ``How am I supposed to live like this?'' she said. ``I'm       worried about losing my apartment.''        John Koskinen, a former IRS commissioner, said federal       employees are dedicated to the agency's mission but might be       reaching their breaking point.        ``As you put more and more pressure on the system, you       increase the risk of a significant glitch,'' Koskinen said.       ``If I were the  [[Page H1019]]       administration, I'd be troubled. The pressure is going to       mount.''     Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Let me just say, at the outset here, that if we all agree that the  government should be reopened, then what is there to negotiate about?  We should just open up the government.   We have no preconditions about opening up the government. We have  none. The gentleman from Georgia apparently has a precondition:  whatever the President's whim is on a particular day. Yeah, the  President did campaign on building a wall, but he didn't get up there  and say: We want to build a wall and you pay for it, American  taxpayers. What he campaigned on was saying: I want to build a wall,  and Mexico is going to pay for it.   Well, he has had 2 years, and, obviously, he can't get Mexico to pay  for it, so he wants to saddle the American taxpayers with that bill.   So, look, the bottom line is, we believe that border security is an  important issue, and we, on this side, have been more than willing to  invest in border security, and we are going to continue to do that.   As I mentioned before to the gentleman, President Trump's shutdown  has put a strain on local and Federal law enforcement, undermining  cooperation between them that helps keep our communities safe. While he  is having his temper tantrum, you know, our local law enforcement  officials are feeling the strain. That is why local law enforcement  leaders across the country, including those serving in border States,  are calling for an end to the shutdown.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter to President Trump and  Members of Congress.      [From the Law Enforcement Immigration Task Force, Jan. 22, 2019]            Law Enforcement Leaders Call for an End to Shutdown         Dear President Trump and Members of Congress: As law       enforcement leaders who support commonsense immigration       reforms consistent with public safety, we write to express       our deep concern with the partial shutdown of the federal       government.        State and local law enforcement work constructively with       federal law enforcement to combat drug trafficking, gangs,       organized crime, and other threats. In addition, the federal       government provides needed training, equipment, and funding       to state and local law enforcement agencies--support that is       now threatened by the ongoing shutdown. A prolonged shutdown       threatens this cooperation and strains local resources. It       also negatively impacts our colleagues in federal law       enforcement, forcing essential law enforcement personnel to       work without pay. These circumstances threaten public safety       and cannot continue.        Instead, we call on Congress and the Trump administration       to reopen the federal government without delay and work       together on bipartisan solutions to improve our immigration       system. We believe there is room for compromise.        While there are partisan disagreements over the need for a       border wall across our entire southern border, there is       widespread agreement over commonsense steps that can improve       border security. A bipartisan deal can build on these areas       of agreement, improving border security by focusing on ports       of entry, strategically deploying and using technology and       ensuring that CBP has clear sight lines all along the Rio       Grande. With nearly 700 miles of physical barriers already in       place along the southern border, these targeted investments       in border security can contribute to improving public safety       and reassuring the American people that the border is a       priority.        Similarly, bipartisan immigration reform will benefit the       United States as a whole. We believe that immigrants should       feel safe in their communities and comfortable calling upon       law enforcement to report crimes, serving as witnesses, and       calling for help in  [[Page H1020]]       emergencies. By reforming our immigration system to bring       undocumented immigrants into the legal immigration system,       immigrants are incentivized to become constructive partners       with local police in public safety initiatives. Bipartisan       immigration reform can provide undocumented immigrants with       an opportunity to earn citizenship, requiring them to pay a       fine and back taxes and pass a background check, encouraging       further civic responsibility. This would improve community       policing and safety for everyone.        The current impasse is an opportunity for Congress and the       Trump administration to strike a bipartisan agreement to end       the shutdown and fix our immigration system. The shutdown       prevents state and local law enforcement agencies from having       access to needed federal resources, strains federal law       enforcement personnel, and undermines cooperation between       state, federal, and local law enforcement.        We urge Congress and the Trump administration to break this       deadlock and improve public safety by reopening the       government without delay and working to reach a bipartisan       compromise that includes commonsense border security as part       of a comprehensive reform of the immigration system.

I say to my friends: Look at what  you are doing here. Look what is happening. This has to end.   For example, a long-term MS-13 investigation that has resulted in 23  gang indictments has been constrained because of the inability--get  this--the inability to pay for interpreters needed to communicate with  informants. That is insane, Mr. Speaker.                                time  1315    Mr. Speaker, I include that article from The New York Times in the  Record.                  [From the New York Times, Jan. 22, 2019]     Report Says Shutdown Is Impeding F.B.I.'s Law Enforcement Efforts                             (By Katie Benner)         Washington.--As the partial government shutdown enters its       fifth week, the funding freeze has impeded F.B.I. efforts to       crack down on child trafficking, violent crime and terrorism,       according to a report issued Tuesday by the group that       represents the bureau's 13,000 special agents.        ``The resources available to support the work of F.B.I.       agents are currently stretched to the breaking point and are       dwindling day by day,'' said Thomas O'Connor, the president       of the group, the F.B.I. Agents Association.        The report reflected the scope and seriousness of the       shutdown's effects, and came as President Trump and the       leaders of the two parties on Capitol Hill maneuvered to find       a path out of the impasse. The Senate scheduled procedural       votes for Thursday on competing Republican and Democratic       proposals, although neither appears likely to win sufficient       support to pass.        The Justice Department, which oversees the F.B.I., is one       of the government agencies affected by the partial shutdown,       along with the State Department, Transportation Department,       Agriculture Department, Interior Department and others.        Mr. O'Connor said that national security was directly       related to the bureau's financial security. ``It is critical       to fund the F.B.I. immediately,'' he said.        Because of the shutdown, the F.B.I. has been unable to       issue grand jury subpoenas and indictments in several cases       cited in the report.        An agent working on an MS-13 investigation that has gone on       for more than three years and resulted in 23 gang indictments       for racketeering, murder and money laundering has been       hamstrung by his inability to pay for an interpreter who can       communicate with his Spanish-speaking informants, the report       said.        The bureau has also not been able to pay its informants, an       important source of intelligence in terrorism, narcotics,       gang, illegal firearm and other national security cases. The       F.B.I. could lose those informants.        ``It is not a switch that we can turn on and off,'' the       report said.        The 72-page report described how field offices in some       cases have run out of basic supplies like tires for vehicles,       copy paper and forensic supplies like DNA swab kits, and do       not have the funds to buy replacements.        The F.B.I. is not the only part of the Justice Department       struggling during the funding lapse. The department has had       to ask the federal courts to postpone some major civil       litigation, including a lawsuit over the lawfulness of the       Affordable Care Act, which the department no longer defends       in court.        The federal courts that hear Justice Department cases are       also running out of money. The nation's legal system could       soon be hobbled if Congress and the Trump administration       cannot come to an agreement to reopen the portions of       government that have been closed since last month. The       federal courts will run out of money by around Feb. 1,       requiring them to cut back to essential services at that       point and furlough some workers.        The F.B.I. Agents Association has been warning of the       negative effects of the shutdown for nearly two weeks.        On Jan. 10, the association and representatives from all of       the F.B.I. field offices signed a petition that said the       shutdown could create financial issues for agents that would       make it hard for them to pass the routine financial       background checks necessary for them to obtain certain       security clearances. They also said the pay freeze would make       it hard to retain and attract agents.        The latest report from the association, which is based on       the accounts of scores of agents, outlines more dire       consequences. The group allowed the agents to speak       anonymously to protect them from retaliation and other       negative repercussions.        Correction: Jan. 22, 2019--An earlier version of this       article incorrectly described the F.B.I. Agents Association.       It is a professional association, not a union.     Mr. Speaker, 40 million Americans struggle with hunger  and food insecurity, and the Trump shutdown has needlessly made this  terrible problem worse. Without funding for USDA in place, access to  SNAP benefits for hungry families is threatened. Millions and millions  of people will be affected.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a report from the Center on  Budget and Policy Priorities titled ``Many SNAP Households Will  Experience Long Gap Between Monthly Benefits Even If Shutdown Ends.''      [From the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, Jan. 22, 2019]  Many SNAP Households Will Experience Long Gap Between Monthly Benefits                           Even if Shutdown Ends                           (By Dorothy Rosenbaum)         The Administration and states' efforts to issue February       Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, or food       stamp) benefits early to avoid deep benefit cuts in that       month that might otherwise have occurred as a result of the       partial government shutdown have created a new problem: a       lengthy delay between February benefits (which most       beneficiaries received by January 20) and March benefits.        In turn, this will place additional strain on the emergency       food network and other community resources, which already are       stretched.   Most Households Receiving February SNAP Benefits in January; March SNAP                   Benefits Remain Uncertain and at Risk         The Department of Agriculture (USDA) announced on January 8       that it would work with states to pay the vast majority of       February SNAP benefits early, by January 20, to ensure that       SNAP has the funding to stay open through February 2019.       Despite the operational challenges of this approach, it       appears that every state was able to issue benefits early,       and in combination with SNAP's contingency reserve, there       will be sufficient federal funding to cover all February SNAP       benefits as a result.        These recent actions that USDA and states have taken       protect millions of low-income households--including millions       of poor children, parents, elderly people, and people with  [[Page H1021]]       disabilities--from having their basic food assistance cut       back substantially in February. With a continuing shutdown,       USDA would have to issue additional guidance to states       explaining whether it has other options available to cover       all of March benefits, or if not, how deep a benefit cut will       be required in March and how states should implement it.        Ending the shutdown, and funding and reopening the       Agriculture Department and other parts of the government that       now are shuttered, would be the best way to avoid cutting       millions of households' SNAP food assistance. For the       remainder of this paper, we assume that SNAP will receive       funding so that full SNAP benefits can continue in March and       subsequent months--an assumption that is far from assured.   Many Households Will Have a Long SNAP Benefit Gap Even if the Shutdown                                    Ends         Some states may be able to adjust their March issuance       schedules to partly address this issue, but if all states       paid February SNAP benefits on January 20 and don't make       changes to their March issuance schedules, we estimate that       about 90 percent of SNAP households that receive ongoing SNAP       benefits--about 15 million low-income households--will       experience a more than 40-day gap between issuances. Almost       60 percent will experience a gap of more than 45 days, and 25       percent will experience more than a 50-day gap.        States have long had the option to pay SNAP benefits to       different SNAP households on different days of the month.       Spreading payments across multiple days evens state workloads       across the month and helps to ensure that retailers that       participate in SNAP do not face a severe increase in demand       for food and staffing on the day that SNAP benefits become       available. Any given household, however, must receive its       SNAP benefits on or about the same day of the month, usually       resulting in only 28 to 31 days between SNAP issuance dates.       Only seven states issue SNAP to all households in the state       on the first day of the month. Most others spread issuance       out, often over ten or 20 days, and usually based on       households' Social Security or case numbers or the first       letter of the head of household's last name.        In fact, SNAP law requires that ``no household experience       an interval between issuances of more than 40 days. It is not       clear whether USDA will waive this requirement in response to       the unusual circumstances resulting from the shutdown--as       seems likely--or whether the agency will require states to       develop an alternative issuance schedule to avoid gaps of       longer than 40 days One possibility would be for states to       change March issuance to occur on March 1, and to stagger the       adjustment back to households' normal issuance cycle over       several months, as needed to stay within the 40-day maximum       interval between issuances.      Households in Almost All States Will See Gaps Longer Than 40 Days         The length of the gaps between February and March issuances       will vary by state, but the vast majority will be longer than       40 days.        States where all households will have 40 days between SNAP       issuances: Seven states, accounting for about 2 percent of       SNAP issuances nationally, issue SNAP benefits to all       households on the first day of the month. In these states,       the gap for ongoing SNAP households that received the early       February issuance on January 20 would be exactly 40 days, as       households would receive their March benefits on March 1.       Those states are: Alaska, Guam, Nevada, North Dakota, Rhode       Island, Vermont, and Virgin Islands.        States where households will have 40-49 days between SNAP       issuances: Another 21 states issue all (or almost all) of       their ongoing SNAP benefits within the first ten days of the       month. In these states, SNAP households will experience a 40-       to 49-day gap in benefits. Those states are: California,       Colorado, Connecticut, District of Columbia, Hawaii, Idaho,       Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New       Jersey, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Dakota,       Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, and Wyoming.        States where some households will have 50 days or more       between SNAP issuances: About half the states have some       households that will have more than 50 days between SNAP       issuances if the states do not change their issuance       schedules. In states that issue some SNAP benefits for       ongoing SNAP households after the 10th day of the month,       those households will have at least a 50-day gap; households       that typically receive their benefits after the 15th day of       the month will have a gap of 55 days or more. These       households account for much of these states' ongoing SNAP       benefits: in 17 states, 50 percent or more of benefits will       be issued with at least a 50-day gap.    Long Period Between SNAP Issuances Will Cause Hardship for Some SNAP                                 Households         Assuming SNAP has full funding to continue in March, SNAP       households should have available the same total amount of       SNAP benefits over the three-month period (January through       March) that they otherwise would have. However, the change in       the timing of February's issuance and the long interval       between January 20 and a March SNAP issuance is likely to       cause hardship for some households and, as a result, increase       the demands for emergency food assistance and other community       services.        It's well documented that SNAP benefits normally run out       for most households before the end of the month. Within a       week of receiving SNAP, households redeem over half of their       SNAP allotments. By the end of the second week, SNAP       households have redeemed over three-quarters of their       benefits, and by the end of the third week they have redeemed       90 percent.        SNAP benefits are not intended to cover the entire month       for most households. The SNAP benefit formula assumes that       families will spend 30 percent of their available cash income       for food. Many households spend their SNAP benefits quickly       because they can only be spent on food. Cash income from       other sources is needed to pay for other expenses, such as       rent or mortgage, utilities, essential non-food items,       clothing, gasoline, and car repairs. As a result, families       use their SNAP benefits first to make food purchases, saving       cash for other needed expenses.        Moreover, SNAP benefits are low. SNAP is intended to       provide additional benefits to meet the cost of the Thrifty       Food Plan (TFP), the Agriculture Department's estimate of a       bare-bones, nutritionally adequate diet. But substantial       research has found that the TFP, which currently provides at       most $1.85 per person per meal for a family of three (the       average benefit is about $1.40 per person per meal), is not       sufficient to meet the needs of most low-income households.        Because SNAP benefits often fall short of meeting basic       monthly food needs, and because struggling households have to       use available cash to meet non-food expenses, families can       find themselves at the end of their 30-day SNAP benefit       payment cycle without enough food or the resources available       to buy more food. Research has found that food spending, food       consumption, and diet quality fall and that food insecurity,       hospital admissions, and school disciplinary problems rise       after households have exhausted their monthly SNAP benefits.       SNAP families often have to turn to social networks, food       pantries, and others to get through the month.        Given the experience of the strain on low-income       households' budgets and community resources under normal SNAP       issuance patterns--when the gap between SNAP issuances is no       more than 31 days--stretching that gap to 40 to 50 days or       longer could create substantial hardship and hunger and       sharply increase demand for local emergency food providers       and other community social services providers.        Many SNAP households may find ways to weather this       disruption. In general, households that participate in SNAP       demonstrate a capacity to manage limited budgets. But       extending the time between monthly benefit payments for the       vast majority of SNAP households will certainly cause       difficulty for some substantial number of poor families. Many       families may not be able to budget the advance food-      assistance benefit over an extended period of time for       several reasons, including:        Lack of information. USDA, state officials, retailers, and       state and local nonprofit groups and charities are working to       educate SNAP households about the early issuance of February       benefits and the fact that those households will not receive       another issuance in February. States are urging households to       factor the early payment and the delay until a March payment       into their February food budget. But USDA did not require       states to send SNAP households individual notices about the       change in February benefits. Instead, states are trying to       use newspaper stories, posts on their websites, fliers in       local welfare offices, and their partners' networks to spread       the news about the changes in the timing of SNAP benefit       delivery. Many households likely won't understand that the       benefits they received around January 20 are an early       issuance of their February benefit and that a lengthy gap       will ensue before they receive their next benefit insurance.        Confusion and misinformation. Reports are emerging that       there is considerable confusion about why households are       receiving early SNAP benefits for February and what to expect       in the future, especially given the uncertainty resulting       from the government shutdown. The confusion may result in       some SNAP households spending their SNAP benefits relatively       quickly, exacerbating their food shortages in the latter part       of February and the first part of March.        Household income fluctuations or unexpected expenses.       Households living with very low incomes experience shocks to       their monthly income on a routine basis. Workers can see       their hours and pay reduced with little warning. Individuals       with monthly income below the poverty line rarely have       savings to manage unexpected expenses. If their income drops       or expenses spike unexpectedly during this timeframe, perhaps       because of a high winter heating bill, households generally       will use available cash to manage their non-food needs,       leaving less money to buy food at the end of the SNAP payment       cycle.        Differing abilities among SNAP participants. Even with       advance warning and robust information, some SNAP households       can struggle to manage a significant shift in their budget,       particularly those with cognitive limitations. Managing a       major monthly budget shift like this could be difficult for       some individuals with mental impairments who do not receive       assistance to manage their benefits.                                  Conclusion         Even if the government shutdown is resolved quickly, the       disruption in the timing  [[Page H1022]]       of February SNAP benefits is likely to make it hard for many       SNAP households to meet their basic food needs as they wait       for their March SNAP benefit payment. Some 30 million people       in about 15 million households--the vast majority of SNAP       households--will not get their March benefit until at least       40 days after they received their February payment. Of these,       8 million people in more than 4 million households will need       to wait more than 50 days. This benefit disruption will       likely cause hardship for a substantial number of these       households. We expect more households to try to turn to       emergency food networks and other social services for help as       they seek to stretch their benefits across more days.     The crisis already has started. Access to food for SNAP  beneficiaries also is being threatened by the shutdown, as reports  indicate that 2,500 retailers around the country are unable to take any  form of SNAP EBT payments.   As PBS reported over the weekend, the licenses for these retailers  are on hold due to the shutdown.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the transcript of the PBS story.    PBS News Hour: Why Many Stores Can't Accept Food Stamps During the                                  Shutdown                               (Jan 17, 2019)         While so far there have been no major lapses in benefits       for the nearly 39 million people who depend on food stamps       amid the partial government shutdown, 2,500 retailers around       the country are unable to take any form of SNAP EBT payments.       Judy Woodruff:        With the government shutdown now in its 27th day, many       federal programs have been affected, including food stamps.        So far, there is no major lapse in benefits used by nearly       39 million people each month. That's because of the U.S.       Department of Agriculture. It found a way to pay SNAP       benefits, as they are called, earlier than normal.        February benefits, awarded through a debit-style card used       at stores, are being paid out this week. Several states,       including California and Florida, are warning users to be       careful and make sure they manage to make the money last       longer.        For 2,500 retailers, the problem is already here. That's       because those stores needed to renew a license for the       Electronic Benefit Transfer, or EBT debit card program, and       they failed to meet a deadline before the shutdown. Those       renewals, required every five years, are on hold.        Sarah Jackson is an employee at one store in Northern       Arkansas.       Sarah Jackson:        We have been completely unable to take any form of SNAP EBT       payments. Grocery stores need a license to process EBT       payments, and ours expired and was unable to be renewed on       schedule because of the government shutdown.        Because of an argument about a wall, I have to look people       in the eyes every day and tell them they can't pay for their       food, for their children's food.       Judy Woodruff:        Sarah Jackson in Arkansas.        We reached out to the U.S. Department of Agriculture for a       response. A spokesperson wrote back--quote--``Over 99 percent       of SNAP retailers are able to accept benefits as usual. There       is a small percentage of stores that failed to complete a       required reauthorization process that was due on December 21.       These stores can take steps to update their status once       funding is restored''--end quote.     Mr. Speaker, I could go on and on and on about the  impacts here. If we all agree we should end the shutdown, let's just  end the shutdown.   Maybe my Republican friends should be calling Senate Majority Leader  Mitch McConnell to say, you know, let's come together and pass a bill  to reopen the government without any conditions. That is what the  American people overwhelmingly want.   Mr. Speaker, I have heard my friends on the other side of the aisle  rushing to congratulate the President for his so-called compromise plan  over the weekend. Let me repeat: This is no compromise at all. Just  read the fine print.   The Washington Post said simply: ``The proposal on the Dreamers was  whittled down to the point where it only undoes the disaster Trump  himself is orchestrating.''   That would be like an arsonist offering you a fire extinguisher to  put out the wildfire that they created. That is a compromise? Are you  kidding me?   I have an idea. Mr. President, stop causing disasters. Congress  should be more than a cleanup crew for your messes and failed policies.   Let me close with this, Mr. Speaker. When I think of the best of the  United States, I think of the Statue of Liberty. It wasn't built from  within our borders. It was gifted to us by friends from abroad, the  French, to represent the freedom that we stand for, to welcome all  those immigrants who come to this country, not to transport drugs or  crime, as the President portrays, but to live a better life that they  can find only here in the United States.   When President Trump thinks of the best of America, he dreams about a  concrete wall, something to prevent immigrants from coming here,  something that offends our allies, that would make our country, a  global leader, turn away from the rest of the world at a time when  American leadership is badly needed.   On top of all of that, a wall will not work. It would be ineffective.  If we built a 50-foot wall, someone would build a 51-foot ladder.   As I said, it is a medieval idea when we have better solutions here  in the 21st century: cameras, sensors, radar, and drones. If anyone  doubts that they work, go visit the border, as I have.   Democrats are for border security. The minibus includes $328 million  in new funding to help secure the border. This is what professionals  are asking us for. A concrete wall is being discussed as a viable  option only at the President's rallies and in the right-wing media.   Here in the real world, hundreds of thousands of people are  struggling. They need us to reopen the government today, right now, not  years from now, as the President has suggested.   These bipartisan, bicameral bills will get us there. This continuing  resolution to fund the Department of Homeland Security will get us  there. Let's end this shutdown and reopen this government.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on this rule and the underlying  bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the  previous question on the resolution.   The previous question was ordered.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
