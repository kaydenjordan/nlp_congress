 Mr. Speaker, I was grateful to join  Secretary Rick Perry and my colleagues, Congressman Chuck Fleischmann,  Congressman Joe Barton, and Congresswoman Marcy Kaptur, yesterday to  celebrate the Department of Energy's 40th birthday.   The goals presented of progressing our science, protecting our  Nation, and promoting our energy were meaningful to me, having served  as Deputy General Counsel under Secretary Jim Edwards of the Reagan  administration. I was also grateful to have worked at the Savannah  River Site, where I saw firsthand so many dedicated personnel.   In Washington, I served with General Counsel R. Tenney Johnson; was  welcomed by Administrative Assistant Marsha McQueen; and was trained by  Deputy General Counsel Eric Fygi, who was recognized as an original DOE  staff member.   I look forward to working with Secretary Perry to ensure continued  progress on our nuclear cleanup missions, effective stewardship of the  nuclear weapons stockpile, and continued research and development at  our Nation's national labs. DOE now clearly promotes energy development  to create jobs.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.                            ____________________
