 Mr. Speaker, I am happy to be joined by my colleagues  who graduated from West Point, our alma mater, and our colleague, who  represents the West Point community and the area.   Why are we talking about the academy today? Well, we are close to  what we call our Founders Day, which is March 17, but this is also a  special year. It is the 150th anniversary of the Association of  Graduates, which keeps the alumni informed and connected with our alma  mater.   The 150th anniversary will be May 22, 2019, so we thought we would  come down to the floor to talk about the experience and the importance  of the military academies--of course, West Point being the oldest and  the best--to our Nation and its security.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Sean Patrick  Maloney), from Hudson Valley, who represents West Point and the  surrounding communities.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for doing that great  summation, because I brought my colleagues down here and they are  probably going to talk a little bit more about the micro aspects of  classes, friends, and experiences over the years. But I do appreciate  the gentleman's work for and support of West Point and the community.  And I know he will always be a good steward of the campus, the cadets,  the staff, and the faculty, so I thank him for coming down.   Mr. Speaker, usually, we manage things here in the House by seniority  based upon, again, elected Congress. But at West Point, it is a very  competitive institution, and our seniority is based upon the graduation  class. So I am going to turn things upside down here on the floor and  go by seniority, which means one of our newly elected Members of  Congress will get a chance to speak first.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Green).    Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, and I appreciate his  service in uniform and, of course, here on the floor. We are happy to  have him here.   Next, I yield to the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Guthrie), almost my  neighbor on the North American continent.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for his comments.   I think what Congressman Guthrie has said, article II of the  Association of Graduates Constitution, states the object of this  association shall be to cherish the memories of our alma mater and to  promote the social intercourse and fraternal fellowship of its  graduates, and I think we are seeing that tonight.   You see some snickering and some guffawing, and I think we all get  transported back in time. In fact, in preparing for this, I did like  Congressman Green and got a list of my classmates and then started  working on notes on Friday night and Saturday. I am telling you, I had  nightmares on Saturday night; I had nightmares on Sunday because that  experience was brought back to life for me, which I cherished.   I am now happy to yield to the gentleman from Ohio, Congressman  Davidson.   Before I turn it all over to him, one of the benefits that the  academies do, and West Point does, is just doesn't get what they  consider the brightest and the best in our secondary education system,  but they make sure that they reach into our active military forces and  find those young men and women who are showing to their chain of  command exceptional opportunity with a chance to promote and become an  officer. Congressman Davidson is one of those, and that is why I yield  to him, the class of '95.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for joining us  tonight. He makes me think of a lot of things.   I want to make sure that we don't forget the staff and faculty, the  Department of Army civilians, and the spouses and the families who make  up the whole West Point experience.   A lot of times, staff and faculty will adopt a cadet to be their  family while they are away. I am from Illinois, and New York was a  pretty long distance. I was fortunate to be, in essence, adopted by  Colonel Woodard and Mary Ellen Woodard. They were my pseudo family  there, and, boy, did I need it. That was kind of joked about.   I also remember going and visiting many times instructors after hours  on a program we called additional instruction. I thought I was smart in  high school. I found out in college-level engineering school, I wasn't  as smart as I thought I was. I needed a lot of assistance to get  through the academic program there, so I appreciated it.   Many of those staff and faculty teachers were West Point graduates,  so they not only had the book learning, but they knew the experience we  were all going through.   I brought down my yearbook and paged through it. General Omar Bradley  attended our graduation, which shows you the length, depth, and width  of The Long Gray Line. It was a special time to be able to see that  connection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. Watkins), our  most junior graduate--maybe we would call him a plebe in our lexicon-- but a freshman Member of Congress.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for joining us  tonight.   We have people who watch and participate in the Army-Navy games.  There is now a new kind of challenge for either the midshipmen or the  Corps of Cadets, and it is a fight to see who sings second. If you  watch the Army-Navy game, at the end, after a tremendous battle on the  field of friendly strife, both sides will join together on each side,  and they will listen as the alma maters are sung. The goal is to be the  one who gets to sing second, because that means that you have won the  football game.   I would like to read the alma mater of West Point.       Hail, Alma Mater dear,      To us be ever near.      Help us thy motto bear      Through all the years.      Let Duty be well performed.      Honor be e'er untarned      Country be ever armed.      West Point, by thee.      Guide us, thine own, aright      Teach us by day, by night,      To keep thine honor bright,      For thee to fight.      When we depart from thee,      Serving on land or sea,      May we stand loyal be,      West Point, to thee      And when our work is done,      Our course on earth is run,      May it be said, ``Well done''      Be thou at peace.''      E'er may that line of gray      Increase from day to day      Live, serve, and die, we pray,      West Point, for thee.    I want to talk about my class, the class of 1980, a little bit. They  are now mostly part of that Long Gray Line. We have some still on  Active Duty, but they are leaving soon, and they have served faithfully  over the years.   Folks will recognize some of these names. Our motto was ``Pride and  Excellence.'' These are the statistics I got from AOG. We all know that  there is garbage in, garbage out, so some of my classmates are not  updating their records. They may not be 100 percent accurate, but the  numbers are pretty good.   We graduated with 902. We think there are 23 who are deceased.   We graduated 62 women. These are the pioneers. This is the first  class of women who graduated from West Point. They are very close. I  talk with many of them frequently, and we are all very proud of them.  It was not easy for these women, as you can imagine, in an all-male  institution, and they are a tribute to our class.   We have four four-star generals or officers. Two recently retired,  Brooks and Perkins. We still have Thomas, who is the commander of  Special Operations Command, and Votel, who is commander at CENTCOM.  They are both retiring soon.   We had six lieutenant generals, Donohue, Cheek, Hodges, Lanza,  Chipman, and Linnington, and they are retired.   We had eight major generals and nine brigadier generals, the one  stars. I want to note Brigadier General Retired Anne MacDonald who, for  our women classmates, rose to the highest ranks of military service.   We have religious leaders in our class, pastors, chaplains, deacons.  One that I like to always catch up with and follow is Nancy Gucwa, who  is a Benedictine Sister, Nancy Rose Gucwa, who retired as lieutenant  colonel and then became a nun.                                time  2015    We have medical doctors, and we have university professors. I would  also like to highlight Jeff Williams, our astronaut who has spent more  time in space as a guide of the United States NASA program. Now there  is a female astronaut who just surpassed him, but he has been in space  quite a bit, and we are very, very proud of him.   I think what is also interesting is that people talk about the  military academies and these institutions as the proverbial return on  investment. I think my colleagues have talked about the selfless  service of their classmates and the people they have met. I think the  interesting thing that I came upon in just going over some data from my  class is we know that every graduate, for the most part, goes to serve  in Active Duty, and the desire is for a 20-year service at a minimum.  But a lot of people choose not to do that. I think what surprised me  was how many people picked up the mantle in other branches of service  or in the Reserve program. So out of the 902, I think about 422 retired  from military service, that is getting close to 50 percent.   What are those?   That is, obviously, the United States Army, the United States Army  Reserve, and the United States Army National Guard. We had a couple  retired from the Air Force, and we had one retire, I think from the  Coast Guard. So  [[Page H2635]]  selfless service, even as a part-time, and those who follow the  military today, if you are in the Reserves or you are in the Guard, you  are working, and you can be deployed. It is not a weekend warrior  status anymore. They are part of the total military force.   We also have published authors, college professors, master level,  world-class athletes, and even an artist. Some of our classmates now  have their children who are already graduates, who already served their  time and are already out of the service, so generation after generation  of families. That is just an example of one of our classes.   The Association of Graduates does a good job, as was noted here,  trying to keep us connected to our alma mater. We have folks that come,  not only from every one of the 50 States based on the way the  nomination process goes, but we also have folks from foreign countries  who are invited to serve and go through the program, and that is the  unity the association of graduates attempts to do.   So this night was spent to really accomplish two things: one, to  commemorate the 150th anniversary of the Association of Graduates whose  goal was to keep these bonds of friendship and keep reminding us of the  goal of duty, honor, country.   Another part was to thank our classmates who have served with us, who  help get us through the 4 years of training in the program, thanks to  staff and faculty, thanks to the Department of Army Civilians, thanks  to maintainers to allow us--really we should thank the national  government for continuing to support the great institutions of higher  military learning and training like West Point, Annapolis, the Air  Force Academy, the Merchant Marine Academy, and the Coast Guard  Academy.   I am going to end with the end of the Douglas MacArthur speech.  Congressman Watkins read the first part. I was going to read that too  because it is one of my favorites.   I will end on this, Mr. Speaker. This is the end of the speech  General Douglas MacArthur gave to the Corps of Cadets: ``But in the  evening of my memory, always I come back to West Point. Always there  echoes and re-echoes: Duty, Honor, Country. Today marks my final roll  call with you, but I want you to know that when I cross the river my  last conscious thoughts will be of The Corps, and The Corps, and The  Corps. I bid you farewell.''   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
