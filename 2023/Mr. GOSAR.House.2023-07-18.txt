 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   Is it what I hear? Is it really what I hear, that we are too lazy to  do our job? Because that is what I heard.   Every 6 months we are supposed to come here to this floor and ante up  in regards to the national emergencies. A national emergency, by its  whole name, is temporary and short-lived. It is temporary and short- lived.   I guess that is why I would have to quote Milton Friedman: ``Nothing  is so permanent as a temporary government program.''   Mr. Speaker, that says it all. That says it all.   There is a whole different way of getting to these perpetrators,  these bad actors, and we should do that. However, we are rushing  through this thing, and all I hear is: Wait a minute, if we take this  down, then all these people are going to get off.   That is not what happens. Remember, we are bicameral, so the House  will pass something, then it will go to the Senate where most of the  time it will die, but at least they might get something right in this  case as foreign affairs. They probably will get something right in  regards to who the people are and what is the vehicle to do this in.   This is exactly why Senator Church did this in 1976. It was to try to  orchestrate how do we put this together, how do we have checks and  balances, and how do we make this work for everybody?   This isn't the way. We just saw a COVID national emergency. Today  there is not one inventory in that disbursement record--not one, not  one--of $4.8 trillion. That isn't chump change, Mr. Speaker. That is a  bunch of money. That is a bunch of money.   So I look at this, and I will tell you, Mr. Speaker, it is time to  get rid of these national emergencies. We can do this. We can do it  right. We can make everybody look all right.    Mr. Speaker, let's review the facts. There are currently  41 national emergencies that are subject to periodic congressional  review, including the emergency declaration related to Libya, which is  more than a decade old.   The National Emergencies Act mandates Congress consider joint  resolutions terminating national emergencies at least every 6 months.  Think about it; every 6 months. That is our job--not the President's;  our job.   Yet, Congress has never, not even once, reviewed the legitimacy of  the national emergency related to Libya since its declaration by  President Obama in 2011, nor has Congress reviewed any of the national  emergencies debated today as required by law.   Almost comically, the extended national emergency related to Libya  still cites Muammar Qadhafi as a reason for declaration. Mr. Speaker,  Muammar Qadhafi has been dead for almost 12 years. You can't make this  stuff up.   The situation in Libya poses no extraordinary threat to the national  security or foreign policy of the United States. Once again, temporary  measures, short-term, punch, terminate.   No group or person in Libya currently poses a threat to our national  security. Furthermore, even if there was some hostility, none rises to  the level of an unusual and extraordinary threat to national security.   To the extent that there is a desire for certain sanctions, they can  be applied without these national emergency declarations in compliance  with the Constitution, Federal laws, and national security needs.   Now, that is an important point here. We can adjust these. We can put  these in in different places that adhere to our Constitution, our legal  aspect, because once again, this is us.   Despite unfounded concerns, sanctioned individuals and entities can  be redesignated pursuant to other authorities available to the  President, including but not limited to existing national emergencies  related to terrorism, Russia, and Iran.   National emergencies are supposed to be rare and brief. In passing  the National Emergencies Act in 1976, Congress did not intend for the  executive to utilize declarations for decades in order to apply  sanctions. That is something Congress can do separately from a national  emergency declaration.   In fact, let's look at the history of the National Emergencies Act.  It was written to respond to FDR and to Truman in keeping the country  in a state of emergency as part of their daily governance. That is what  they used the national emergencies for.   Congress allowing these tyrannical authorities to remain in place is  recklessly endangering our Republic, checks and balances, and the civil  liberties of our constituents.   Under all these extended national emergency declarations, the U.S.  Code provides the President with an additional 135 special statutory  powers, including: Testing chemical and biological weapons on human  beings, including American citizens. Can you say COVID?   Take over or shut down radio stations and U.S.-based internet  traffic. Wow. Censorship.   Detail members of our Armed Forces. Waive sanctions on  confidentiality provisions related to public health services. Impose  crippling and unconstitutional sanctions on American citizens that  could freeze their financial assets or restrict anyone from selling  them groceries, renting them an apartment, representing them as an  attorney, providing dental and medical treatment, and much more--all  without any due process supposedly afforded by the Constitution.    Clearly the President thinks he has authority to invoke these special  statutory powers absent an executive order explicitly detailing them,  which is why he announced his intention to forgive student loans via a  press release instead of an executive order.   Oh, but voila. The U.S. Supreme Court said: You can't do that. What  does this President do again? He turns around and does it again,  shoving it in the Court's face.   Under the extended national emergency declarations, Congress  abdicates control over policy and spending and instead transfers  unfettered power to the executive branch.   For example, despite repeated bicameral requests, Biden has never  provided a single expenditure report related to the COVID-19 national  emergency declaration as required periodically by law. Not one.   Now, how can we, Congress, with the explicit power of the purse,  allow any President to spend money without requiring a report?   Article I, Section 9, Clause 7 of the United States Constitution  says: ``No money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence  of Appropriations made by law; and a regular Statement and Account of  the Receipts and Expenditures of all public Money shall be published  from time to time.''   Further, 50 U.S.C. 1641(c) clearly states: `` . . . the President  shall transmit to Congress, within 90 days after the end of each 6- month period after such declaration, a report on the total expenditures  incurred by the United States Government during such 6-month period . .  .''   Despite repeated--and I said repeated requests--there have been no  expenditure reports to this date allocated in the COVID-19 national  emergency, nor was there a final report that was due on July 9.   In fact, what we heard is this President realized that he was behind  the gun, and he actually rushed it through on July 7, had the Secretary  of Health and Human Services actually try to do it for him. What a  shame.   The Constitution clearly provides Congress with the power of the  purse, not the President, regardless of supposed emergencies. These  emergencies are supposed to be limited, not forever bearing.   We have to come up with a different solution. This is not working.  This doesn't work at all. For us particularly, we as Congress, haven't  done our job.   Every 6 months--if you hear what I am saying here, every 6 months we  [[Page H3664]]  should be bringing these up, whether their application is great or  fettered or very, very faint, and we should discuss this: What about  Libya? What about Yemen? What about these other ones, Iraq and others?  By the way, this is regular order. Anything we are detailing here is  regular order.   This is almost comical to me. I hate to say it in that light, but  when Senator Church put this detail together, he spent a lot of time  trying to address this publicly. He tried to get as many people  involved in it as he could, and yet, we turn around and do this to him.   We have got to come up with something better, something different,  something short-lived, something that actually can keep our eye on the  prize.   I don't know whether it is something that we put together in a  clearinghouse for known terrorists and whether we utilize that in some  way, shape, or form so that we can make sure that we are keeping up to  date on all of that, but something has to happen, and it is not in the  national emergencies.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to vote in favor of this  joint resolution, and I yield back the balance of my time.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, Golda Meir once said that there would be no  peace in Israel until Palestinians love their children more than they  hate Israelis. Can't that be the same way?   Why I say that is, let's talk about Yemen. Heartlessly, while this  emergency has been extended, Yemen stifles the donation of food,  clothing, and medicine intended for human suffering in Yemen.    It is estimated that 130 children die each day because of the famine  in Yemen. That is more than 85,000 over the past decade.   I thought love meant a lot to children. Is it our way or the highway?  Is it thinking outside the box? A child needs very little. A child  needs very little, and this is one of those things that we ought to be  looking at, those children.   Right now, because of our sanctions, no international groups will  even give food or medicines. Not one. That is sad. That is the result  of the United States. I would hate to be that individual.   Nearly 80 percent of the people in Yemen need treatment for  malnutrition, and 20 million lack access to adequate healthcare. I have  to tell you, I think we need to start thinking outside the box.   If we are building these futures that hate America, that hate all,  where is the joy in that? There is no joy. This is one of those that we  can actually seemingly give some help to, and those children are not  going to balk.   Now, once again, let's go back. National emergencies every 6 months  have to be brought up and reviewed by Congress. To this date, none of  these five have had any review whatsoever. I have heard a lot about the  Presidents here and there--President Obama, President Trump, President  this or that--all saying that they looked at it and anted up, but I  have yet to hear where Congress has reviewed these designations. Not  one.   Therefore, when I saw these, when I looked at these and my staff  looked at these, we said, oh my God, we are not doing our job, and we  are not doing our job. We are not doing our job at all if we are not  reviewing each one of these to find out whether they pertain, whether  they don't. If they are not a national emergency, where do they belong?   I hate to give a lot of additional thought to the Foreign Affairs  Committee, but this isn't the place for these national emergencies,  even with the involvement of IEEPA. We have to do something a little  bit different. These have to be mainstayed, where we are actually  looking at these and saying: ``Okay, here are all the different bad  actors in the world. Here are all these bad institutions going on  across this world. How do we involve all our assets, whether they be  humanitarian, military, or just a little bit of everything?'' That is  what we should be doing.   However, once again, Congress hasn't done its job. Let me say it  again. Congress hasn't done its job.   We just went through the COVID national emergency, where $4.8  trillion had been allocated to fighting COVID. Not one inventory on  that disbursement record is actually there. Not one, for $4.8 trillion.  That is a sad state of affairs. That is a really sad state of affairs.   Mr. Speaker, when I look at these and then turn and look at--the  United Nations actually looks at this as the worst humanitarian crisis  in the world.   Let me also ask you this. Did the United States do this on its own or  was there somebody else that they are speaking up for?   I will let you answer that question, but I will actually tell you  that I hope you will vote for this if nothing else for children, the  malnutrition, the medicines. Let's see if we can get a new tomorrow  where people love the United States instead of hating us.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time I have  remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  [[Page H3666]]    With that 4 minutes what I will do at this point in time is speak up  on behalf of my good friend Eli Crane, who is looking at the Iraq  national emergency, and then my good friend Matt Gaetz, who is looking  at Syria. These are all from the same area, same detail. None of them  have had renewals by the National Emergencies Act. That is flawed. We  allow Presidents to re-up them, but we don't do anything on the  Congress side.   As a Congress, we need to step up. We need to step up our game.   If these aren't part of the National Emergencies Act--and I find it  very atrocious that they are--then we need to find a home for these. We  need to find a home where they manage it properly, that everybody gets  a chance to see them, look at them, and inventory them. Other than  that, we have to make some serious changes.   It is sad that we are here on these five. There will be 36 more  coming your way because, once again, when Congress doesn't do its job,  somebody has got to squawk, and I will be one of those that squawks  from here to sunset.   I have to tell you, we have to do something different. I wish all  Members would vote for my amendment, and, Mr. Speaker, I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
