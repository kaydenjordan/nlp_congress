 Reserving the right to object.   Mr. President, Senator Murphy indicates there should be no  discussion, really, because this is such a slam dunk. I am coming up to  talk about it.   We do not do regular order. Our job is to be there for advice and  consent on any nominee. We have tried to shortcut the process, not only  on nominations, but even things as important as our budgets. We don't  do anything anymore with discussion that gets out maybe the rest of the  story.   I believe that on any of these, rather than proceeding to the floor,  you ought to at least have a discussion in committee. That didn't  happen. There was a vote, but not a discussion.   And when you look at this noncontroversial nominee, I think there are  at least some things to think about. Harry Katz, a professor at the  Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations, said Mr.  Ramirez could be open to expanding the range of disputes that the  Agency will consider.   So kind of hinting at some political enterprise that you would be  doing more than just interpreting. He is not alone. Wilma Liebman, a  former NLRB chair under President Obama, has told media that Mr.  Ramirez should be ``open to creative expansion of what the mediators  do.''   We need public servants who are going to strictly interpret the law,  and this looks like if we don't at least have a recorded vote, it could  slip through when it is not maybe as uncontroversial as Senator Murphy  might indicate.   I have reservations about the nominee, mostly about the process, very  indicative of the way that things work here in general, not only for  nominations, but critical policy. I think that has got to change.   Therefore, I do object.
