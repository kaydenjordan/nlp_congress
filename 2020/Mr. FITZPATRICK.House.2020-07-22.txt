 Mr. Speaker, I rise today as the lead sponsor of the  Great American Outdoors Act, and this is a very, very big day for this  Chamber.   As my colleagues are aware, I have been pushing to both permanently  reauthorize and permanently fund the Land and Water Conservation Fund  literally since the day I entered this Chamber.   In addition to the LWCF, this legislation tackles the maintenance  backlog that needs to be addressed on public lands and parks across our  great Nation.   Mr. Speaker, this bill will have a positive impact on nearly every  single Congressional District in this country, and the LWCF has already  had a positive impact on many sites in my district alone, most notably,  Nockamixon State Park.   Hundreds of businesses, recreation, and environmental groups have  come together to endorse our legislation, including the Backcountry  Hunters & Anglers, the League of Conservation Voters, the Audubon  Society, the Natural Resources Defense Council, Ducks Unlimited, Clean  Water Action, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.   Mr. Speaker, this bill is historic; it is bipartisan; it is  bicameral, with over 250 cosponsors in the House. It overwhelmingly  passed the Senate, and it will be signed into law by the President.  That is what is called bipartisan cooperation.   Mr. Speaker, for those of us who are strong advocates of our  environment, this is a good day. I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.''
