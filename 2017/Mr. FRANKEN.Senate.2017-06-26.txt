 Thank you, Mr. President.   I rise to talk about the effort to repeal and replace the Affordable  Care Act. Before I begin, I thank Senator Hirono for sharing her story  and for leading us all here in the discussion tonight.   I thank the Presiding Officer who has been listening, and I  appreciate that. I really do.   In recent days, we have finally gotten to see the plan that 13  Republican Senators have been working on in secret and behind closed  doors. I really thought the Senate bill would be better. I thought it  would be better than the House version that was passed. Even Senator  Burr said of the House bill that it was ``dead on arrival'' in the  Senate, but, unfortunately, the Senate plan is just as bad.    The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office announced just today  that, under the Senate plan, 22 million more Americans would be  uninsured. That has consequences. Perhaps worst of all--and partly  because this causes the reduction in the number of Americans who would  be covered--the bill ends the Medicaid expansion and cuts the  [[Page S3761]]  funding for the Medicaid Program by nearly $800 billion--a program that  has been a vital part of our social fabric since 1965.   This bill--and I do not like to say this--is mean. The President said  that of the House bill. I do not like to characterize something that  way, but it is mean and would have far-reaching effects for millions of  Americans across the country.   This past weekend, I hosted a healthcare forum in Burnsville, MN. It  is a suburb that is south of Minneapolis, of the Twin Cities. It was on  the importance of Medicaid and how the Republican plan's devastating  cuts would affect Minnesotans. Over 230 people showed up to share their  stories about how Medicaid changed their lives, and it was very moving.   I think it is really important to tell this in terms of people, not  in terms of numbers, although the numbers are pretty stark. Brandon and  his mom spoke, Brandon and Sheri. They are both from Burnsville.   Brandon was born 15 weeks premature. He weighed just 1 pound 13\1/2\  ounces. He was so small that his parents' wedding rings could slide on  his arm. He was also born with cerebral palsy and hydrocephalus, which  is a condition that causes fluid to collect in Brandon's brain, which  results in brain damage.   Brandon, who is now 17, got up with a walker at the event. He told me  that he was taken immediately to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester. He was  born in the Twin Cities, but Mayo said that his case was too  complicated to handle, so they sent him back to the Twin Cities, to  Gillette, which is a children's hospital. It is a great children's  hospital, a great hospital. Within 24 hours of his birth, the hospital  told Brandon's parents that his costs were already over $1 million--a  terrifying addendum to what must have been a harrowing, harrowing  experience.   Over the years, Brandon has needed 38 surgeries--surgery to reduce  the fluid in his brain. He has a shunt. He has had surgeries to  straighten out his legs. He has had eye surgeries and more. He has also  needed extensive physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech  therapy, and across his lifetime, he has needed other interventions to  help him do basic tasks, like eat and now walk. He could not turn over.  He could not do the things that babies do, that we parents and  grandparents relish in every day.   But guess what. He is thriving. In fact, he just passed his first  college course at Dakota County Technical College. He proudly told me  and the rest of us that he received an A-minus, and he hopes someday to  get a job at Gillette, the Gillette Children's Specialty Healthcare,  which is the very place that provided him with the unique and high- quality care that he has needed over the years. All of this has been  possible because Brandon and his family were able to get health  insurance through Medicaid.   Sheri, Brandon's mom, said: ``If we didn't have Medicaid, Brandon  probably wouldn't be here''--meaning at our forum--``and he wouldn't be  doing as well as he's doing.''   Brandon similarly noted:         Kids with special needs are referred to as ``special       needs,'' and I like to think I'm pretty special. I also like       to think our needs are also special depending on the kind of       care we need and that's what Medicaid provides.    I really believe that all of us here tonight must do all we can to  protect these kids and protect their families and everyone who relies  on Medicaid, and I sincerely believe that means we have to defeat this  bill.   My colleague Senator Hirono stated last week: ``We are all one  diagnosis away from a serious illness.'' That is the case. Do you know  what else? We are also just one accident away from a life-changing  injury.   Another Minnesotan, Deborah, shared her story with my office. She  described for me a car crash and the subsequent traumatic brain injury  that she survived in 2012.   She explained:         It was just another day. I was on my way to work. I lost       control of my SUV after sliding on a patch of ice and slammed       into a concrete median.    Her whole life changed at that moment. She had to relearn basic  tasks--reading, walking, talking, and eating--but all of it was  possible because of the home- and community-based services she was able  to receive through Medicaid.   She said:         Without the services funded by Medicaid, my goal of       returning to paid employment would be impossible. I honestly       worry that proposed changes to the Medicaid program could       significantly diminish my overall health outcomes and even       leave me facing long-term homelessness.    As my colleagues and people at home who are watching this debate well  know, this week could prove to be an extremely consequential week in  the history of this country. The decisions we make--the 100 of us--over  the next few days could literally mean life or death for many  Americans. Lives are on the line.   Tomorrow, I will give a speech that is more about the data, and we  have heard about some of that, but there is a study in the New England  Journal of Medicine that came out this week that reads that Medicaid-- having the insurance--improves people's lives and that--this is not  precise--for every 300 to 800 who will lose healthcare, who would lose  Medicaid, there will be a premature death.   This is a study that is going to be summarized in the New Yorker, in  an article by Atul Gawande, that the effect of having insurance is not  about dramatic emergencies. This is especially about things like  diabetes and heart illness and cancer--the day-to-day. It is about  having access. Because you have insurance for care, it improves the  health of people, and it extends mortality. This is real stuff. What we  are doing is really serious.   I strongly urge my Republican colleagues to talk with their  constituents about the bill that was drafted. Again, it was behind  closed doors, and many of my Republican colleagues did not see it until  last week. I urge them to talk to their constituents about the  consequences this bill would have for seniors, for children, and  parents who have Medicaid coverage.   Talk to the people who would see their healthcare costs rise. Talk to  the families who may lose their health insurance. People are afraid.   I am a cochair of the World Health Caucus. I go all around my State.  I talk to roundtables at rural hospitals and nursing homes. These are  the parts of my State that voted for Donald Trump. During the campaign,  Donald Trump said that he would not cut Medicaid. These are people who  are scared, whose elderly parents stay home because Medicaid pays for  their home healthcare, and they are afraid because that will go away.  Both she and her husband work--this was a woman in Herman, MN--and they  do not know what they will do.   Please, listen to your constituents. You need to do the right thing  and vote no on this bill for their sake--for the sake of your  constituents.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
