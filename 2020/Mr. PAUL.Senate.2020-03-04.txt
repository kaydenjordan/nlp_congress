 Mr. President, I recently had the honor of being welcomed  by Game Changers, an organization based in Louisville, KY, devoted to  guiding our youth toward productive and meaningful lives, for a panel  discussion on the impact of violence in our community. The executive  director of Game Changers is Christopher 2X, who I have known for many  years and watched change the lives of so many Kentuckians through his  advocacy, leadership, and community building efforts. In December of  2019, just a few months ago, Christopher showed me the findings of Game  Changers's study on the impact of youth violence recently released by  his organization. Subsequently, I asked him to organize an event in  West Louisville with a panel of community leaders and parents to  discuss the report and how violent crime affects the lives of  Louisville youth.   At the event, we not only discussed the findings, but also heard from  Louisvillians whose real-life stories are contained in the pages of  those reports. Kentucky Education Commissioner, Dr. Wayne D. Lewis,  educated us on the burden that violence has on children. However, the  only way to grasp the true tragedy of violent crime is to hear from  those impacted. I met with Deshante Edwards, who not only lost her son,  Donte, but now sees her 6-year-old grandson subsequently lose focus in  school. I listened as Krista and Navada Gwynn told me that, as a result  of the murder of their son, Christian, their 17- and 11-year old  children are too petrified to go outside. Only personal stories such as  these truly demonstrate the extreme toll taken on children exposed to  violence.   That is why I feel compelled to share Game Changers's findings on  violence and its impact on our youth with my colleagues. Tragically,  children are exposed to violence in every corner of our Nation. I ask  unanimous consent that this report be printed in the Congressional  Record with the hope that every Member of Congress will read it and  work with me to create safer communities for our children.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as fallows: ,                    Violence Impact on Children Learning     The Christopher 2X Game Changers Target Education--Crush Violence               SHINING A LIGHT ON HOW GUN VIOLENCE IMPACTS KIDS       Kentucky Education Commissioner Dr. Wayne D. Lewis        ``Children who grow up in violent neighborhoods seldom       realize their way of life is not typical. Their lives may       include regularly hearing gunshots through the night and       sometimes during the day, losing friends, family, and       neighbors to gun violence, and continually being fearful of       becoming the victim of violent crime.        No parent wants that kind of life for their children, but       that is what life looks like for children living in violent       neighborhoods across the U.S., including children in some       Louisville neighborhoods. The trauma they suffer is unlike       anything children growing up in upper middle class or       affluent neighborhoods could imagine. And the impact of that       trauma, while often unrecognized, is significant; often       impacting their ability to reach their learning potential at       school.        Recognizing and responding to the trauma of students who       experience violence has to be part of how we educate them.       There is no way to reasonably expect students who have       experienced such trauma to leave their fears, anxieties, and       pain at home when they come to school. Instead, it is       incumbent upon schools to help connect students with       community resources as appropriate, and to do our absolute       best to be sensitive to and accommodate students' social and       emotional needs as we work to meet their academic needs in       schools.''      Jenny Benner, Senior Director-Child Development Center,           Chestnut Street Family YMCA        ``As an early childhood educator, it has become more common       to see children who have been affected in some way by       violence. Many of the children we serve are too young to       verbalize their trauma or stress. Because of this, we have to       ensure early childhood educators have the training and       support needed to help these children build resilience. We       focus heavily on a child's social-emotional development and       the first step is to make sure they feel safe and loved.        Once in a safe environment, they will open up to learn       skills necessary to be successful in school and life. It is       also important to teach problem-solving and how to resolve       conflicts appropriately, using words. I believe this skill is       lacking in some children and they are most likely to continue       cycles of violence because that is all they know. This report       shines a light on how important education is, even as early       as infancy, and my hope is that this will start a dialogue       about how we as a community can come together to serve       children to our best ability!''      Jefferson Family Court Judge Derwin Webb        ``When I was 15 years old, one of my good friends was       accidentally shot and killed by a friend. A few years later,       that same shooter was accidentally shot and killed by someone       else. Today, we have kids killing kids--at random times--      intentionally. Louisville, we are better than this. Guns have       no names, bullets have no names, but our children do. So, I       am asking you to please, please stop the violence. I started       YOUNG Men's Academy at Whitney Young Elementary, a mentorship       program, to try to help, and I applaud this report and all       efforts to bring attention to the needs of kids exposed to       violence, and to help them reach their potential.''      Dr. J. David Richardson, Chief of Surgery, University of           Louisville Hospital        ``Having been involved in the care of the injured for over       40 years, I applaud the current focus on the downstream       effects of gun violence in our community. As trauma surgeons,       our team focuses on the ``victim'' or injured. We analyze       their care and outcomes through our quality review process,       but we have few, if any, mechanisms for examining the effects       on families, neighbors, or others in the community who are       impacted by this violence. I have been particularly concerned       about the children who bear witness to these acts, even if       they are not directly or physically injured. How can a       growing, evolving, learning, adapting brain develop as we       would desire in an atmosphere of uncertainty and fear? I have       heard countless stories of the deleterious effects of these       acts of violence and their negative impact on the culture and       well-being of our neighborhoods. While it is cliche to state       ``our children are our future'', it is nonetheless true. The       children who are exposed to gun violence in Louisville       deserve better.''      Troy Pitcock, retired LMPD Major 2nd Division        ``Gun violence has a horrifying impact on our youth.       Witnessing it directly or the remnants of violence at police       crime scenes are situations too many of our youth are exposed       to, many times at such early ages. These situations have life       lasting implications on children, at times creating a       perception such violence is acceptable. A lack of parental       support can enhance the believe to our youth that such       actions are acceptable or even the proper method to deal with       conflict.''                                CHRISTOPHER 2X         Imagine you're a mom at home watching a video with your       kids and their playmates on a Saturday afternoon when all a       sudden your home is being riddled with bullets from a high-      caliber weapon.        Bullets through the walls, furniture, shattering the oven       door, while you scramble to get the little ones on the floor,       covered with your body, and under a bed, to keep them safe.        No imagination is needed. This happened to my daughter       Heaven, a child development specialist, who was with six       children, ages 1-7, when her home was hit with gunfire from       an AK-47 in the middle of the afternoon last Dec. 1. Two       neighboring apartments in the new Shepherd Square complex       just east of downtown also were hit.        While thankfully no one was physically hurt, the trauma       from exposure to such a violent act can interrupt a child's       normal development and ability to learn in school.        My daughter's experience and a spike in gun violence last       summer--with teens shooting automatic weapons out of stolen       cars, kids as young as 13 charged with murder--made me want       to shine a light on the impact of gun violence on children       and their learning.        As a peace and justice advocate for nearly 20 years, I know       my daughter's experience is not unique. In all parts of our       city, citizens report hearing gunfire to police every day and       gunshots have been heard outside my daughter's apartment       multiple times since the day her home was splattered with       bullets.        In the first nine months of this year, 65 of the 73 murders       in Louisville Metro were from  [[Page S1473]]       gunfire, and family and friends--including many young       children--struggle with the losses. In all, 276 people were       shot from January-September, more than 30 people a month.        Children suffer if they get hit by bullet, witness a       shooting, lose someone close or live on edge because the       crack of gunshots is as common as the chirping of a songbird.       They often can't focus or learn in school. Some can't sleep       and have nightmares. Some withdraw, others act out or       retaliate and resort to violence themselves.        In sharing their stories on the following pages--some       redemptive, some tragic--we can all have a better       understanding of what this sick culture of gun violence is       doing to our children and their ability to learn. We can all       do a better job recognizing children who are suffering and       providing help they need to succeed in school and reach their       potential.        There are many people--teachers, police officers,       counselors, therapists, physicians, nurses, others--doing       amazing work to help victims and their families. But much       more is needed. Here is my call to action as a start:        Parents/adults with children under your care: Talk to your       child's teacher or school counselor if your child has been       exposed to violence so they can be supportive and helpful.       Don't assume your child is ok. Seek services for your child       through the school or others such as their doctor if your       family needs help.        Teachers: Know the symptoms of trauma in a child, which       vary based on age and the individual child but include acting       out, aggressive verbal or physical behavior, or withdrawal       and not doing their work. Use school resources to link the       child to professional evaluation and help.        Principals/administrators: Support teacher training at your       schools, and make sure children in need receive evaluations       and follow up treatment if needed.        I am deeply grateful to survivors of gun violence and       others for sharing their stories. May God bless the victims,       survivors and the angels in their lives who support them.                            DEVIN SESAY AND FAMILY         Before June 13, he was excited about his upcoming freshman       year at Atherton High School. He was also relieved because       his big brother, Devin Sesay, a rising Atherton senior, would       teach him the ropes at his new school.        The brothers would walk to the bus stop together every       morning. On the first day, they would be sporting new shoes       that Devin, a smart dresser, would find online.        Everything changed on June 13 for the boy, 14, and his       close extended family whose members first came to the United       States 27 years ago to escape war-torn Liberia in West       Africa.        On June 13, Devin was shot and died on Roselane Street in       Smoketown, three doors down from the family's home. He was       17. Family members said Devin had been walking home late at       night from playing basketball in nearby Shelby Park when       shots were fired from a passing car.        Devin's family--his grandfather, mother and four brothers,       his aunt and cousins--are dealing with devastating shock,       grief and anger over his murder, while also coping with other       major life adjustments.        A few weeks after Devin's murder, his mother, grandfather       and brothers moved to a brick ranch house and new school       district 13 miles away in southern Jefferson County.        ``I was afraid for the boys,'' said their mother, Maima       Karneh, 41, a certified nurse assistant who works nights at       the Home of the Innocents, not far from Smoketown.        Her boys and other children often hung out at their home,       inside playing video games, outside on the porch or nearby       throwing a football or shooting hoops.        She liked having them around the house where they'd lived       for 10 years, she said, because it meant they weren't on the       street. She enforced stern rules, checked on her boys often       by phone and Devin had never been in any trouble, she said.        Ten days after Devin's murder, another shooting solidified       her decision to move. On June 23, Tyrese Garvin, 20, was shot       almost directly across the street from where her son was       killed. Garvin had been visiting his newborn twins at       University Hospital. He died five days later in the same       hospital where his twins were being treated. Three juveniles       including a 14-year-old were charged with his murder.        ``There was no way we were going to stay,'' Karneh said.        She and Devin knew Garvin, who was a senior when Devin was       a freshman at Atherton and Garvin attended Devin's memorial       service, a few days before he was murdered.        In their new home, Devin's portrait hangs in the living       room near the front door and his brother at times stares at       it. ``It reminds me of how many good days we had,'' he said.       ``I was supposed to go to Atherton with him this year. He was       supposed to show me the bus stops and everything and it just       kills me.'' Instead his brother is gone, he's is a new       neighborhood and attending Moore High School, and he said it       doesn't feel right.        The school alerted his mother to concerns about him       focusing and his grief and he and family members are       receiving counseling. Two other younger brothers, 11 and 13,       are attending Moore Middle School and said they are doing       their best to live up to Devin's memory.        Devin's four brothers--the oldest is 21--and a 10-year-old       cousin were at home when Devin was killed and some of them       heard the shots.        Karneh's 14-year-old son called her at work to report       hearing gunfire and that Devin was not home. When Devin did       not respond to her texts, ``I knew it was him,'' she said.        Her sister, Sietta Karneh, said the family wants to keep       Devin's memory alive. He was an outgoing, athletic, fun       teenager with a slew of friends who have taken his death       hard, posting remembrances on social media, his aunt said.       She and her sister have raised their kids as one family. ``I       also lost a son,'' she said about Devin. ``I can't get over       how close to home he was when they took his       life . . . . I can't get over this nightmare.''        *Deadliest Month of 2019: June--15 homicides, the highest       number of murders in any month in the past five years and       more than twice the seven homicides in June 2018.                            A FAMILY HUNKERS DOWN         Near 22nd and Oak streets in West Louisville, a 12-year-old       boy and his 13-year-old sister decided to stay inside during       the summer because they were afraid they'd get shot if they       ventured outdoors.        Their parents don't want their names revealed. ``We are so       close to it. We're a stone's throw away from it in either       direction,'' their father said about the gun violence.        Their mother, who remembers a safe environment when she was       growing up in the neighborhood, said they hear gunshots two       or three times a month at least, usually at night. She said       they stay inside, and don't go near the windows.        ``You hear it so much you get used to it. You hope the       gunshots don't affect your family.'' When news reports       spotlight a deadly shooting in areas where she has family       ``you think my brother lives down there. I hope it wasn't       him. You tend to tense up when you hear things like that.''        Their children are keenly aware, too. They know about       gunshot deaths not far from their home during the summer, and       a video on social media of teens with guns touting an ``east       vs west'' rivalry with random gun violence.        ``It's messed up,'' the boy said.        He said he began staying inside their house in early July       after he was outside with friends in the early evening and a       car pulled up on their street with a gun pointing out the       window. He ran to his backyard and said after that, ``I       decided on my own not to go out.''        His sister said she thinks ``the world's just getting       violent.'' She didn't go outside ``because the west and the       east was doing a shootout.'' She said she learned about it       through a video on Facebook.        Their parents said they don't call police because they       don't think there is much the police can do, although they       wish there were more routine police patrols visible on their       streets. Police respond to gunfire, but without adequate       information they are unable to make an arrest, their father       said.        ``You don't want to keep your kids locked in,'' their       mother said. ``You are scared for their safety, too. You       don't know what to do.''        Citizen reports of hearing gunshots over 18 months, from       Jan. 1, 2018-June 2019, totaled 4,558, from every Louisville       Metro police district.        Homicides by police district Jan.-Sept. 2019: 1st       District--12; 2nd District--25; 3rd District--11; 4th       District--13; 5th District--3; 6th District--5; 7th       District--2; 8th District--2; Total: 73.                             diontae ``tay'' reed         At 18, Diontae ``Tay'' Reed seems happy, with a playful       sense of humor and a lot to be proud of--good grades, a       diploma from Ballard High School, a future full of       possibilities including college.        He's come a long way from age 13 when he was shot in the       back, underwent surgery and spent 11 days in the hospital.       His homes have been shot up four different times, and he       knows more people who have been shot or killed than he can       count on both hands.        ``I knew about the violence in my neighborhood at a young       age,'' he said. ``I have trust issues. I don't trust people       easily so wherever I go I'm always looking.''        Now he's the first person in his family to have graduated       from high school, months after he and his family--his mother       and a younger sister--were evicted from their home in the       Portland neighborhood. He is staying with a friend's family       while his mother and sister are living apart with relatives.       He takes the bus from the apartment where he is living in the       Portland neighborhood to Mall St. Matthews and back for his       part-time job at a shoe store.        Diontae wonders if he's ready for college, and he's deeply       worried about how he would pay for tuition, but he is       exploring options as he also dreams of having a driver's       license and a car someday.        He credits his mother, who ``was always on me'' for keeping       him on the right track, off the streets and focused on       school. He also credits Ballard High School teachers and a       special tutor for helping him achieve. ``I always made       teachers laugh,'' he said with a smile, and ``they became       friends to me.'' He can tick off the names of several he       admired.        He attended Shawnee Academy his freshman year but pursued a       transfer to Ballard with the help of his mother. ``I felt       like if I had stayed at that school I wouldn't have learned       anything,'' because teachers spent so much time trying to       control the classroom, he said.        His cousin had been doing well at Ballard, had a tutor, and       he thought that formula would also work for him, and it did.  [[Page S1474]]         ``I'm seeing I'm getting good grades,'' he said. ``I do not       want to go home and be on the streets and do something that       could get me killed.''        His two older brothers, 23 and 22, chose a ``way different       path.'' When he was shot four years ago, he was running away       from a fight his brothers got into with another group of       boys. When asked why he thought his homes had been shot up in       the past, he responded, ``my brothers.'' While he's close to       them, ``I could never ask them what they're doing.''        While in the hospital, recovering from surgery and a       collapsed lung, he was angry but told relatives and friends       who visited him that he didn't want any more violence, no       retaliation. He said he would have liked to have seen whoever       shot him go to jail but no arrests were made.        He participated in the Christopher 2X ``Hood2Hood''       antiviolence campaign, preaching non-violence door-to-door       and in neighborhoods and remains active in anti-violence and       community service programs.        ``The violence going on now is terrible, crazy,'' he said.       ``People don't even want to go outside because of what is       going on.''        73--Number of homicides in Louisville in the first nine       months of 2019, an increase of nearly 20 percent compared to       the first nine months of 2018 when 61 murders were committed.        72.6%--53, of the 73 homicide victims in the first nine       months of 2019 were black compared to 63% for the same time       period in 2018.        32%--of the victims, 25 killed, were under age 25, with       eight victims 11-17 years old. One victim was under age 11.        Homicides: 2014: 55; 2015: 80; 2016: 118; 2017: 102; 2018:       80.        89% of the 73 murder victims, 65 people, in the first nine       months of 2019 were killed by gunfire, the highest percentage       of homicides by gunfire for a comparable time period in the       past five years.                            ____________________
