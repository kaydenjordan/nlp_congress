 Mr. President, many hoped that President Giammattei would  reject the corruption and impunity that his predecessors  institutionalized. The reappointment of Attorney General Porras, who  according to the State Department has ``repeatedly obstructed and  undermined anti-corruption investigations,'' shows that it is business  as usual.   Democracy cannot survive without an independent judiciary, which  Attorney General Porras has sought to dismantle by persecuting  prosecutors and judges who have stood up for the principle that no one  is above the law. As long as this continues, Guatemala's government is  not a serious anti-corruption partner of the United States.                            ____________________     Mr. President, a person wandering up Church Street or  jogging down on the shores of Lake Champlain on a crisp, snowy day in  Burlington, VT, this past winter could have glanced up at the sky and  seen an angular, white aircraft gliding through the air. It is called  the Alia and is an electric aircraft modeled after an Artic tern that  has been designed and manufactured by Beta Technologies.   At their headquarters, located beside the Burlington International  Airport in South Burlington, Beta Technologies has been ``quietly''  revolutionizing the aviation industry by designing an environmentally  friendly, rechargeable, and, yes, quiet, electric aircraft that can  vertically take off and land without a runway. It is incredible  technology that has game-changing applications for the domestic  shipping industry, private transportation, and the military. Their  research, production, and testing has been supported by dozens of  private investors, several public companies, and funding appropriated  by the Appropriations Committee to the Air Force's AFWERX Agility Prime  program. The Agility Prime program was launched in 2020 in an effort to  encourage private commercial development of the electric vertical  takeoff and landing--eVTOL--aircraft industry.   I am proud of the innovative work that Beta Technologies does in  Vermont. The company employs a workforce of over 350 employees and is  growing, employing veterans, pilots, engineers, and technicians. The  company is enriching the engineering and technology community of  Vermont. I am excited about the potential for Beta's aircrafts and look  forward to supporting their work in the future.   On April 16, 2022, The New York Times published an article on the  innovative work of Beta Technologies, and I ask unanimous consent that  it be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                  [From the New York Times, Apr. 16, 2022]                           The Battery That Flies                            (By Ben Ryder Howe)         Kitty Hawk.--The invention of the jet engine. And on a       frozen Vermont morning, circling above Lake Champlain, the       Alia.        In the mind of Christopher Caputo, a pilot, each moment       signals a paradigm shift in aviation. ``You're looking at       history,'' Mr. Caputo said recently, speaking from the       cockpit of a plane trailing the Alia at close distance. It       had an exotic, almost whimsical shape, like an Alexander       Calder sculpture, and it banked and climbed in near silence.        It is, essentially, a flying battery. And it represented a       long-held aviation goal: an aircraft with no need for jet       fuel and therefore no carbon emissions, a plane that could       take off and land without a runway and quietly hop from       recharging station to recharging station, like a large drone.        The Alia was made by Beta Technologies, where Mr. Caputo is       a flight instructor. A five-year-old start-up that is unusual       in many respects, the company is the brainchild of Martine       Rothblatt, the founder of Sirius XM and pharmaceutical       company United Therapeutics, and Kyle Clark, a Harvard-      trained engineer and former professional hockey player. It       has a unique mission, focused on cargo rather than       passengers. And despite raising a formidable treasure chest       in capital, it is based in Burlington, Vt., population       45,000, roughly 2,500 miles from Silicon Valley.        A battery-powered aircraft with no internal combustion has       been a goal of engineers ever since the Wright brothers.       Larry Page, the Google co-founder, has been funding electric       plane start-ups for over a decade. Electric motors have the       virtue of being smaller, allowing more of them to be fitted       on a plane and making it easier to design systems with       vertical lift. However, batteries are heavy, planes need to       be light, and for most of the last century, the e-plane was       thought to be beyond reach.        That changed with the extraordinary gains in aviation       technology realized since the 1990s. Late last year, curious       about the potential of so-called green aviation, I flew in a       Pipistrel Alpha Electro, a sleek new Slovenian two-seater       designed for flight training. The Electro looks and flies       like an ordinary light aircraft, but absent the roar of       internal combustion, its single propeller makes a sound like       beating wings. ``Whoa!'' I exclaimed when its high-torque       engine caused it to practically leap off the runway.        However, the Electro's power supply lasts only about an       hour. After ours nearly ran out, I wondered how many people       would enjoy flying in an electric plane. That take off is       fun. But then you do start to worry about the landing.        Despite the excitement about e-planes, the Federal Aviation       Administration has never certified electric propulsion as       safe for commercial use. Companies expect that to change in       the coming years, but only gradually, as safety concerns are       worked out. As that process occurs, new forms of aviation are       likely to appear, planes never seen before outside of testing       grounds. Those planes will have limitations as to how far and       fast they can fly, but they will do things other planes       can't, like hover and take off from ``runways in the sky.''        They will also, perhaps most importantly for an industry       dependent on fossil fuels, cut down on commercial aviation's       enormous contribution to climate change, currently calculated       as 3 to 4 percent of greenhouse gases globally.        ``It's gross,'' Mr. Clark said. ``If we don't, the       consequences are that we'll destroy the planet.''  [[Page S2701]]         In 2013, Ms. Rothblatt became interested in battery-powered       aircraft. United Therapeutics makes human organs, including a       kidney grown inside a pig that was attached to a person last       fall, the first time such a procedure has been done. Ms.       Rothblatt wanted an electric heli-plane ``to deliver the       organs we are manufacturing in a green way,'' she said, and       fly them a considerable distance--say, between two mid-      Atlantic cities.        At the time, though, batteries were still too heavy. The       longest an electric helicopter had flown was 15 minutes. One       group of engineers told her it would take three years of       design and development, too long, in her mind, to wait.        ``Every single person told me it was impossible,'' Ms.       Rothblatt said.                                A Grand Vision         Kyle Clark flew alone for the first time in 1997 on a plane       from Burlington to Erie, Pa. Mr. Clark, then 16, had just       been selected by the U.S.A. Hockey national team. ``I was the       worst player on the ice,'' he said, ``so I decided to fight       all the opposing players.'' As a result, ``the team named me       captain.''        At 6 feet 7 inches, a self-described physical ``freak,''       Mr. Clark would go on to a brief professional hockey career       as an extremely low-scoring right wing and enforcer. (His       Linkedin page shows him brawling, helmetless, as a member of       the Washington Capitals organization.)        After a stint in Finland's professional hockey league, he       left the sport and received an undergraduate degree in       materials science at Harvard, where he wrote a thesis on a       plane piloted like a motorcycle and fueled by alternative       energy. It was named the engineering department's paper of       the year.        He then found himself considering a career on Wall Street,       doing something he didn't want to do away from where he       wanted to be: back in Vermont.        ``There's a brain drain'' among engineers from his home       state, he said. ``People go away to college and come back       when they're 40, because they realize San Francisco or Boston       isn't the cat's meow.'' Returning to Burlington in his mid-      20s, Mr. Clark became director of engineering at a company       that designed power converters for Tesla.        In 2017 he attended a conference where Ms. Rothblatt made       her pitch for an e-helicopter. ``There were like 30 people in       the room, none of whom excited me,'' Ms. Rothblatt recalled.       ``Then Kyle stood up and said, `I'm an electronics and power       systems person, and I'm confident we can achieve your       specification with a demonstration flight within one to two       years.' Other people were shaking their head. He was probably       the youngest guy in the room. So I came up to him during       break and said, `Where's your company located?' And he said,       `I live in Vermont.' ''        A few weeks later, after a second meeting, Mr. Clark drew a       watercolor of his design and sent it to Ms. Rothblatt. Within       hours, $1.5 million in seed capital for Beta Technologies had       been wired to his bank account.        ``He drew a nice design,'' Ms. Rothblatt said.        A prototype with four tilting propellers was assembled in       eight months, with Mr. Clark piloting the vehicle himself.       Built in Burlington, the plane had to be flown over Lake       Champlain, away from population centers.        ``It was so fun to fly it that we found an excuse to every       chance we could,'' Mr. Clark told an audience at M.I.T. in       2019. Ultimately, though, it turned out to have too complex a       design and Mr. Clark threw it out. He created a streamlined       prototype modeled after the Arctic tern, a small, slow bird       capable of flying uncanny distances without landing.        Since then, Beta's work force has grown to over 350 from       30. The company's headquarters have expanded to several       buildings wrapping around the runway at Burlington       International Airport, with plans for an additional 40-acre       campus.        The board is stocked with players in finance and tech,       including Dean Kamen, the inventor of the Segway, and John       Abele, founder of Boston Scientific. It has $400 million of       funding from the government and institutions, including       Amazon. But it is not alone in trying to bring something like       this--what's known as a vehicle with ``electric vertical       takeoff and landing'' or eVTOL--to market.        Propelled by advances in batteries, control systems and       high performance motors, more than a dozen well-financed       competitors have their own prototypes, nearly all focused on       what the industry calls ``urban air mobility,'' or flying       taxis or privately owned flying vehicles. That no major       breakthrough has reached consumers in significant numbers yet       gives skeptics ammunition, but does not tamp down the       optimism within the industry, especially not at Beta. Beta is       alone in focusing on cargo, and is hoping to win F.A.A.       approval in 2024. If it succeeds, it believes it will do more       than make aviation history.        In the company's grand vision, electric cargo planes       replace fleets of exhaust-spewing short-haul box trucks       currently congesting America's roads.        With a limit of 250 nautical miles per battery charge, the       vehicles would land atop solar-powered charging stations made       out of shipping containers, some equipped with showers, bunks       and kitchenettes. (The cabinetry is Vermont maple.) Beta also       makes a stand-alone charger that ``our group is placing at       airports all over the country,'' said Mr. Clark.        A plane like Beta's could be a catalyst for       ``decentralizing'' the hub and spoke system, the company       hopes, taking dependence on shipping centers like Louisville       and Memphis out of the equation and rebuilding the supply       chain.        ``If you think about a path between two cities where       there's no direct air service,'' Blain Newton, Beta's chief       operations officer said, ``the only way is by taking one       connection, two connections.'' Alia can change that--      especially by increasing access to less populated parts of       the country, such as northern Vermont.        The ambitions are lofty. Bolstering Mr. Newton's claims,       however, UPS has already bought 10 Alias to be delivered in       2024 and signaled its intent to buy 140 more, which it plans       to use as ``micro-feeders'' for time-sensitive deliveries       such as medicine.        Amazon has invested heavily in Beta through its Climate       Pledge Fund. Both the Air Force and the Army have signed       contracts with the company worth a combined $43 million. And       Blade, the commuter helicopter service, perhaps sensing that       urban air mobility is not so far off, has reserved the right       to buy five Alias, at a price of $4 million to $5 million       apiece.                             `The DNA of Vermont'         Beta's headquarters at the Burlington Airport--close enough       to be seen from the Terminal B waiting area--still has the       youthful informality of a start-up. On a December morning in       the hangar, Naughty by Nature's ``Feel Me Flow'' somehow       penetrated the din of whirring propellers and industrial       tools. The heavily tattooed Mr. Clark, whose idea of formal       wear seems to be rotating his baseball cap forward, pinballed       around the hangar, grabbing stray machinery and vaulting up       staircases with the agility of a professional athlete.        Before he joined Beta, Mr. Newton worked in health care. At       his job interview, Mr. Clark took him for a helicopter ride.        ``He gave me the controls and said: `Your aircraft. Figure       it out,' '' Mr. Newton recalled, chuckling. ``I'd never flown       before. I ended up taking a 65 percent pay cut to work for       him.''        On their way back, with Mr. Clark back at the controls, the       helicopter flew over Burlington, a city built largely around       the University of Vermont and companies known for their       progressive bona fides, like Seventh Generation and Ben &       Jerry's. The city is famously left-leaning: Senator Bernie       Sanders served four terms as its mayor. It also hosts a       number of renewable energy startups.        ``Clean energy is built into the DNA of Vermont,'' said       Russ Scully, a Burlington entrepreneur who raised capital for       Beta. Burlington is closer to becoming net zero than almost       any municipality in the country; in the Beta parking lot,       many cars have charging cables inserted.        Another local resource: One hundred miles north, near       Montreal, is one of the largest aerospace clusters outside       Toulouse and Seattle, led by Bombardier, the Canadian       business jet-maker, and CAE, the world's premier manufacturer       of flight simulators.        For Blake Opsahl, a network planner who left Amazon to join       Beta, doing so was a no-brainer. ``My husband grew up here       and we've always wanted to to come back,'' said Mr. Opsahl,       who described an affinity between Beta engineers and       Vermonters as ``passionate tinkerers.''        Mr. Newton said: ``I don't want to throw any of our       competitors under the bus, but some folks out West are paying       huge salaries to attract people, and we're capturing a lot of       high-end aerospace talent for the lifestyle. They said, No, I       want to be part of this thing here.''        Mr. Clark said he was offered opportunities to move the       company elsewhere but declined. It has now become one of       Burlington's marquee employers, contributing to a population       swelling with high-earning remote workers who left larger       cities and brought with them a worsening housing crisis.       Burlington may be the kind of small city that Beta aims to       serve, but as its success has shown, it is also the kind of       city where sudden growth can bring challenges to livability.        In high school, Mr. Clark began building planes with spare       parts from the machine shop his father ran at the University       of Vermont. His mother, an artist, burned one in the backyard       to prevent him from flying it.        Like Mr. Newton, many recruits were treated to hair-raising       airplane rides. The company has a fleet of aircraft that the       communications director, Jake Goldman, calls an ``amusement       park for aviation fanatics,'' including a World War II       biplane and the experimental Pipistrel. (``I did not puke,''       Mr. Goldman said of his inaugural ride in an aerobatic plane,       ``but it was touch and go for a while.'')        The company offers free flying lessons to all its 350       employees, and has more than 20 flight instructors on staff,       including Nick Warren, formerly a Marine One pilot for       President Barack Obama. The idea is that in order to promote       ``critical thinking in aviation'' it helps to be airborne.       ``It's very Vermont--instead of just analyzing things on a       computer, you actually try them out,'' said Lan Vu, a Beta       electrical engineer who attended public high school with Mr.       Clark.        Like many of her colleagues, Ms. Vu had worked previously       for Mr. Clark, who recruited her. (``You know how good of a       talker he is,'' she said.)  [[Page S2702]]         She had no prior interest in flying, she said, but ``that       was one of the things Kyle made sure to talk about when he       was pitching me.''        ``And I was like: `Yeah, I don't have that kind of time. I       have three kids,' '' she said.        After changing her mind and getting her pilot's license       through the employee program, however, Ms. Vu began competing       in aerial acrobatic competitions. As an engineer, she said,       flying helps her address safety concerns. ``If I'm building       this, would I fly it?'' said Ms. Vu, who said she considered       herself a conservative pilot, although, she admits, ``I was       kind of surprised how much I enjoyed flying upside down.''                       The futurist and the test pilot         Is the world ready for wingless hovercraft levitating over       cities and hotrodding through congested air corridors?        The consensus within the industry is that the F.A.A., which       regulates half the world's aviation activity, is several       years from certifying urban air mobility.        ``It's a big burden of proof to bring new technology to the       F.A.A.--appropriately so,'' Mr. Clark said. Currently the       certification process for a new plane or helicopter takes two       to three years on average. For an entirely new type of       vehicle, it could be considerably longer. (One conventionally       powered aircraft that can take off and land without a runway       had its first flight in 2003. It remains uncertified.)        Ms. Rothblatt has built a career out of the long view. She       is a celebrated futurist who has argued passionately for       transhumanism, or the belief that human beings will       eventually merge with machines and upload consciousness to a       digital realm. And she has taken positions on issues such as       xenotransplantation--the interchange of organs between       species, including humans--considered audacious not long ago,       though no longer.        Yet in certain ways she and Mr. Clark make for unlikely       partners. Mr. Clark has a familiar demeanor for a test pilot:       exuberant, risk-taking, hyper-confident.        Ms. Rothblatt, on the other hand, calls herself an       exceedingly cautious person, both as a pilot and in general.       ``I'm an adventurous thinker, but I'm cautious in       everything,'' she said. She brought up her life experience as       an example. Aside from her accomplishments in medicine and       aerospace, Ms. Rothblatt is known as a transgender pioneer;       when she started Sirius XM and rose to prominence, she hadn't       yet transitioned. ``When I changed my sex, it was only after       watching presentations by a dozen top surgeons and I was       absolutely confident that it would be safe,'' she said.        The dichotomy between the futurist and the test pilot gets       to a real issue facing any plane with a battery: Who will fly       them?        According to Dan Patt, a technology analyst, vehicles like       the one Beta is building are ``very unlikely to make money       unless they go unmanned.'' Aviation in general faces a pilot       shortage, and labor comprises up to a third of operating       costs at legacy airlines.        The question for Beta as a business, said Mr. Patt, who led       the development of drones for the Defense Advanced Research       Projects Agency, is: ``What does it take for their model to       be competitive with ground transportation?''        Beta says its vehicles are designed to be ``optionally       manned'' in the future. Yet analysts such as Mr. Patt see       unpiloted commercial aviation as even farther from winning       F.A.A. approval than the electric plane itself, raising a       dilemma:        ``What's more important, going unmanned first, or do you       build the vehicle first? Beta is clearly in the latter       camp.''        Nathan Diller, an Air Force colonel, is not a futurist, but       his job is to find and support companies doing forward-      thinking, futuristic things.        The military applications of a vehicle like the Alia--      especially logistics--have gotten attention at the highest       levels of the Air Force, which has backed Beta and some of       its peers through an accelerator called Agility Prime.        Last month, for the first time, uniformed Air Force pilots       flew an Alia, soaring above Lake Champlain in a plane powered       only by a battery.        Colonel Diller sees this kind of transport as a national       security issue, in part because of its potential to reduce       fuel consumption, but what seems to intrigue him most is       ``the democratization of air travel.''        He grew up flying experimental planes on an organic farm in       West Texas, aware of the limits on where a plane can land and       who can fly. Looking at a floating sculpture twirling above a       lake, he sees a different future for aviation: ``Everyone a       pilot, everywhere a runway.''                            ____________________
