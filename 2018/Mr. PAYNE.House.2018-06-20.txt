 Mr. Speaker, there are babies being ripped away from their  parents at the southern border in the name of the American people. Make  no mistake, this is part of an evil plot by the Trump administration,  and it has to stop.   What I want to know is how the Trump administration is keeping track  of these children. My triplets didn't carry identification around when  they were little babies. That was my wife's and my job, to be able to  identify them and speak for them. We were with our kids, and we could  identify them.   If these babies don't have identification, how will they be reunited  with their parents? How will they be reunited with their families?   The American people demand answers, Mr. Speaker. The American people  demand an end to this evil, to this new GOP nonprofit, ``Cage the  Children.''                            ____________________
