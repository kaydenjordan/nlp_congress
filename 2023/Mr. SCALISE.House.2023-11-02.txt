 Mr. Speaker, I thank the appropriations chair, my good  friend from Texas, for yielding and for bringing this important  legislation, which I strongly support.   We have seen the atrocities in Israel. We have also stood by Israel.  In fact, the United States is proud to be the first country that  recognized Israel as a Jewish state on the heels of World War II as the  nations were coming together and recognizing the importance that we all  get behind a Jewish state. Unfortunately, from that day there were  always people around the neighborhood who wished Israel harm.   Over time, you have seen peace agreements, Abraham Accords, but you  have always seen seeds of discord. Of course, the biggest discord  started with Iran funding terrorist organizations like Hamas. Hamas  took action weeks ago, atrocities that are hard to repeat that we have  seen and the world needs to continue to see because, unfortunately, as  the world is seeing the atrocities, while we recognize the lives that  have been lost--not only Israelis, Jews, Americans, Palestinians--but  you also see the ugly head of anti-Semitism popping up.   Here on college campuses in the United States, other places around  the Nation and the world, where anti-Semitism seems to rise its ugly  head at times when Israel seems to be in a dangerous position, these  are times when we all need to be standing with Israel, giving them the  tools they need to make sure they can defend themselves against these  atrocities. That is what this legislation does.    In fact, we worked with the leadership in Israel. We worked with the  Biden administration, the Pentagon, and others who know what is at  stake. We have had long-time partnerships in our strength and our  defense systems. If you think about the Iron Dome and David's Sling  weapons systems that will be replenished with this legislation, a lot  of this is American technology that has been partnered with Israel over  many, many years to save lives in Israel.   And as those weapons systems get depleted, we need to make sure they  are replenished; the Iron Beam system, a more advanced missile systems.  Some of the other partnerships that we have had for a long time, that  is also funded in this bill. We are making sure that Israel has the  tools they need.   We came out of the box ensuring, under Speaker   Mike Johnson, that  we send a strong message to the world that we support Israel, passing  strong legislation to unite behind Israel. But now we need to back that  up with action, with the support in military strength that they need to  continue this conflict.   And it is actually paid for; paid for not by taking away existing IRS  agents, but tens of thousands of new proposed IRS agents. And where are  they coming from? Who are they going after? If you look at the CBO  report, the proposed IRS agents that we would be defunding in this, we  are actually helping President Biden keep his promise. You heard over  and over again, President Biden said no American  [[Page H5303]]  making under $400,000 will pay a dime in new taxes. We all heard that.  It was a promise made over and over again, except President Biden broke  that promise.   Families making under $400,000 are paying more in new taxes, and part  of that is the army of IRS agents that they are sending after people,  tens of thousands. Under this bill, these IRS agents that we would be  eliminating save the American taxpayers making under $400,000 a total  of $4 billion. That is $4 billion back in the pockets of hardworking  families who were promised by President Biden they wouldn't see their  taxes go up. Yet, he wanted to put tens of thousands of IRS agents  looking into and raising their taxes. That won't happen if this bill  passes, which is more money they need right now because prices are  higher on those families.                                time  1600    At the end day, sending the message that we are willing to stand up  to Iran and give Israel the tools they need--tomorrow, we are bringing  more legislation, by the way, in the SHIP Act, to put sanctions on  Iranian oil. Again, Iran is at the heart and center of funding Hamas.   Hamas started this. As the President talks about a cease-fire, it was  Hamas who broke the cease-fire when they invaded and attacked and  murdered, barbarically, Israel.   Israel needs the right to defend themselves. They need the tools to  defend themselves, but let's also defund Iran and the money they are  getting. They made $80 billion during the Biden administration selling  their oil on world markets. We need to pass that legislation tomorrow,  which we will, and hopefully in a very big bipartisan vote. We need to  start today by passing this legislation to give them the tools they  need in Israel to make sure that they can push back and destroy Hamas  and protect those citizens in Israel who deserve peace. America has  always stood by our ally Israel. Let's continue that today. I urge  passage.    Mr. Speaker, I am happy to yield to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Hoyer) for the purposes of a colloquy. I still call him  Leader Hoyer.    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the conversations that the  gentleman and I have had. He has led many delegations to Israel. I  think most of us have been to Israel and seen firsthand some of those  towns. I have been to Sderot and other cities that have come under  attack. I have seen the heartbreak going to some of the kibbutzim and  have heard the harrowing stories. We want to make sure they get their  relief.   I also know this. Obviously, as we talk about funding of government,  we just passed an appropriations bill last night, and we are going to  be moving after we get through this bill into two more appropriations  bills. We will be working late into the night and tomorrow on more  appropriations bills to properly fund government.   If you look at the bills we have already sent over to the Senate,  that includes the Defense appropriations bill, that includes more  funding for Israel, along with the State and Foreign Operations bill  that also includes more funding for Israel.   When we have had heads of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, military  leaders, come before us in committees to testify about the major  threats globally, they have been asked pointblank: What is the major  threat to America? You would think if you are a military leader, you  would be talking about maybe China and some of the threats that they  pose that we know are very real and other countries. That is not what  they talked about. They talked about our Nation's debt, that the  Nation's debt is the biggest threat.   If we can do both, support our friends around the world and start  confronting our Nation's debt--we are going to have to do this over and  over again. The Speaker talked about a debt commission that got a lot  of bipartisan interest, in fact, bicameral interest. These are all  issues we have to confront at the same time.   We are going to continue to do our work. The Senate could pass that  bill to the President's desk, and I think in the end he would sign it.  If the Senate passes this bill that we are going to pass today to the  Senate, I have no doubt the President would sign this bill.   We have to confront our challenges here. We need border security. As  we talk about Ukraine, we need to secure America's border, because we  know there are people on the terrorist watch list coming into our  country right now that we cannot ignore.   This administration might be ignoring it. Democrat mayors and  Republican mayors alike recognize it is a problem in major cities that  has to be confronted. We are going to confront it and continue to work  on those issues, as well. All of this has to be dealt with at the same  time. None of this happens in a vacuum. Many of these problems are  interrelated. We are going to continue to confront all of them and work  as we can hopefully together. Obviously, today maybe we might not all  be on the same page. Tomorrow, I think on that Iran oil sanctions bill,  we will be closer, but we have to keep working through these issues  together.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr.  Hoyer) for a colloquy.    Mr. Speaker, one final point on that. Obviously, if you  look at the history of CBO, they are the referee, the scorekeeper that  has to be used. They have often been wrong. I would say often wrong but  never in doubt. When they are wrong, they are usually wrong to the  detriment of taxpayers.   Here is a classic example. Only in Washington does eliminating  government positions count as something that is going to cost the  deficit. Getting rid of the size of government is ruled by CBO as  increasing the deficit, but they exposed a dirty little secret about  these new IRS agents. I emphasize ``new.'' These are not existing  employees. This is tens of thousands of new IRS agents that President  Biden wants to hire. It exposed that the only way that they generate  money is by raising taxes on families, including those making under  $400,000. In their report, they point this out.   If you are an American citizen who believed Joe Biden's promise that  you will not pay a dime in new taxes if you make less than $400,000-- and he said it over and over again; it is on video--that promise is  broken, according to the CBO in this report, to the tune of over $4  billion in new taxes that those families will be paying. Those are not  existing taxes. They are new taxes those families will be paying.  [[Page H5304]]    If you want to save $4 billion in taxes and you are one of those  families that bought the promise--and, frankly, in times of high  inflation, high interest rates, high cost for everything from gas to  groceries, no family should be paying more in new taxes. I would argue  this bill will save those families a lot more money than what those new  IRS agents were going to collect in new taxes, and we are doing them  all a favor while also helping address a serious spending problem in  Washington and standing with our ally Israel, most importantly.   Mr. Speaker, that is why we need to pass the bill.    Mr. Speaker, for scheduling, the House tonight, after  this vote series, will continue debating amendments to the Interior  appropriations bill. Tonight's final vote series will start around 10  p.m. and end by 11:30 tonight. We expect to continue amendment debate  after that but all recorded votes will be rolled until tomorrow.   For tomorrow, the House will meet at 9 a.m. for legislative business.  We will complete all amendment debate on the Interior appropriations  bill. Starting at 10 a.m., we will have our final vote series of the  week on the remaining amendments, the motion to recommit, and passage  of the Interior appropriations bill, as well as the SHIP Act under  suspension of the rules.   That will mark the end of vote series for tomorrow. We should walk  off by 11:30 tomorrow.   Hopefully that means you vote for all of the bills tomorrow, but we  will have walk-off at 11:30 tomorrow.   The T-HUD bill will still be voted on, but next week. Next week, we  have a full week starting Monday, 6:30 p.m.   The Rules Committee will be meeting prior to that to take up their  order of business for the Financial Services and General Government  bill. We will have both the T-HUD bill and the Financial Services  appropriations bills next week, as well as other possible legislative  items. The first votes next week will be at 6:30 p.m. Monday night.   Remember, the Veterans Day holiday is Friday, so the House will not  be in session next Friday.                            ____________________
