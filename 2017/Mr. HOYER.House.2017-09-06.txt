 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent, in order to carry out the  Speaker's expressed intent, to bring up H.R. 3440, the DREAM Act, to  protect DREAMers like Jean, who studies at the University of Maryland  and is a credit to that institution, a credit to our State, and a  credit to our country.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. As previously announced, the unanimous  consent request cannot be entertained.   Time will be deducted from the gentleman from Massachusetts.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from 18  evangelical religious leaders and other religious leaders in opposition  to President Trump's decision to end DACA.                                                  September 4, 2017.   A Letter From Faith Leaders and Evangelicals for Biblical Immigration                                   (.Com)       President Donald J. Trump,      The White House,      Majority Leader Mitch McConnell,      Speaker of the House Paul Ryan.        Honorable President Trump, Majority Leader McConnell and       Speaker Ryan: We agree that immigration reform and DACA are       difficult subjects. God loves the foreigner. Indeed, God       loves us all. It takes time to discern the balance of mercy       and justice by which a nation thrives.        It is easier to speak publically of mercy, as we, and many,       do. And, while loving mercy, who will also stand for justice       to those citizens who cannot find a job due to cheaper       foreign labor? Who will speak of the real cost of illegal       immigration to our states? And while many non-citizens are       good neighbors, who will stand for justice for Americans       victimized by people here illegally who do not uphold our       values and laws? And who will prevent more needless crime and       death?        The Church is called to serve all people, and our       Government leaders are elected to defend and uphold the       Constitution and the rule of law. Though there are tragic       stories on every side of illegal migration, for our elected       officials, responsibility to oaths must prevail. Law and       order sustain stability and peace. A nation of wise rule       grows strong enough to sustain care for the vulnerable in our       midst.        While some faith groups use selective Bible words for open       borders and amnesty, we consider the whole counsel of       Scripture. We find that the Bible does not teach open       borders, but wise welcome. We are to welcome the lawful       foreigner, who, like a convert, comes as a blessing (eg.s       Ruth and Rahab) We also find Nehemiah building walls to       protect citizens from harm. In Isaiah 1, we see God       condemning the destruction of borders and indigenous culture.        All lives matter. The lives of North, Central and South       Americans matter. The lives of Africans, Asians, Europeans       and people from the Middle East matter. In Scripture, we       learn that God placed us each in a family, a land, an epic       story of creation, the fall and redemption. The Bible       envisions a world of beautiful and unique nations, not a       stateless ``open society'' run by global oligarchs. Each of       us is called to be a blessing where God has placed us in the       world.        In policy decisions ahead, while treating undocumented       people kindly, we ask that you would first and foremost honor       often forgotten American citizens whose families have served       our nation for many generations, and the patient people who       have applied lawfully to come here and to become citizens of       the United States. These lives also matter. These people also       dream. Gratefully Yours,        Names are listed alphabetically and for identification       purposes only.

Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter signed by  20 State attorneys general in strong opposition to what the President  has done.                                                State of California,                                  Office of the Attorney General,                                      Sacramento, CA, July 21, 2017.      Re June 29, 2017 letter from Ken Paxton re Texas, et al., v.           United States, et al., Case No. 1:14-cv-00254 (S.D.           Tex.).       Hon. Donald J. Trump,      President of the United States, The White House, Washington,           DC.        Dear Mr. President: We write to urge you to maintain and       defend the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or       DACA, which represents a success story for the more than       three-quarters of a million ``Dreamers'' who are currently       registered for it. It has also been a boon to the       communities, universities, and employers with which these       Dreamers are connected, and for the American economy as a       whole.        Since 2012, nearly 800,000 young immigrants who were       brought to this country as children have been granted DACA       after completing applications, submitting to and passing a       background check, and applying for a work permit. In the case       of young adults granted DACA, they are among our newest       soldiers, college graduates, nurses and first responders.       They are our neighbors, coworkers, students and community and       church leaders. And they are boosting the economies and       communities of our states every day. In fact, receiving DACA       has increased recipients' hourly wages by an average of 42       percent and given them the purchasing power to buy homes,       cars and other goods and services, which drives economic       growth for all.        In addition to strengthening our states and country, DACA       gives these bright, driven young people the peace of mind and       stability to earn a college degree and to seek employment       that matches their education and training. The protection       afforded by DACA gives them dignity and the ability to fully       pursue the American dream. For many, the United States is the       only country they have ever known.        The consequences of rescinding DACA would be severe, not       just for the hundreds of thousands of young people who rely       on the program--and for their employers, schools,       universities, and families--but for the country's economy as       a whole. For example, in addition to lost tax revenue,       American businesses would face billions in turnover costs, as       employers would lose qualified workers whom they have trained       and in whom they have invested. And as the chief law officers       of our respective states, we strongly believe that DACA has       made our communities safer, enabling these young people to       report crimes to police without fear of deportation.        You have repeatedly expressed your support for Dreamers.       Today, we join together to urge you not to capitulate to the       demands Texas and nine other states set forth in their June       29, 2017, letter to Attorney General Jeff Sessions. That       letter demands, under threat of litigation, that your       Administration end the DACA initiative. The arguments set       forth in that letter are wrong as a matter of law and policy.        There is broad consensus that the young people who qualify       for DACA should not be prioritized for deportation DACA is       consistent with a long pattern of presidential exercises of       prosecutorial discretion that targeted resources in a       constitutional manner. Indeed, as Justice Antonin Scalia       recognized in a 1999 opinion, the Executive has a long       history of ``engaging in a regular practice . . . of       exercising [deferred action] for humanitarian reasons or       simply for its own convenience.'' Reno v. Am.-Arab Anti-      Discrimination Comm., 525 U.S. 471, 483-84 (1999). DACA       sensibly guides immigration officials' exercise of their       enforcement discretion and reserves limited resources to       address individuals who threaten our communities, not those       who contribute greatly to them.  [[Page H6686]]         Challenges have been brought against the original DACA       program, including in the Fifth Circuit, but none have       succeeded. On the other hand, in a case relating to Arizona's       efforts to deny drivers' licenses to DACA recipients, the       Ninth Circuit stated that it is ``well settled that the [DHS]       Secretary can exercise deferred action.'' Ariz Dream Act       Coalition v Brewer, 855 F.3d 957, 967-968 (9th Cir. 2017).       The court also observed that ``several prior administrations       have adopted programs, like DACA, to prioritize which       noncitizens to remove.'' Id. at 976.        As the Fifth Circuit was careful to point out in its ruling       in the Texas case, the Deferred Action for Parents of       Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (``DAPA'')       initiative that was struck down is ``similar'' but ``not       identical'' to DACA. Texas v. United States, 809 F.3d 134,       174 (5th Cir. 2015). Indeed, as DHS Secretary Kelly pointed       out in a press conference the day after his June 15       memorandum explaining that DACA would continue, DACA and DAPA       are ``two separate issues,'' appropriately noting the       different populations addressed by each program. Notably,       only a fraction of the 25 states which joined with Texas in       the DAPA case before the Supreme Court chose to co-sign the       letter threatening to challenge DACA.        Among other significant differences, DACA has been       operative since 2012 while DAPA never went into effect. More       than three-quarters of a million young people, and their       employers, among others, have concretely benefitted from       DACA, for up to five years. The interests of these young       people in continuing to participate in DACA and retain the       benefits that flow from DACA raise particular concerns not       implicated in the pre-implementation challenge to DAPA.       Further, the Fifth Circuit placed legal significance on the       ``economic and political magnitude'' of the large number of       immigrants who were affected by DAPA, Texas, 809 F.3d at 181;       thus, it is notable that many fewer people have received DACA       (about 800,000) than would have been eligible for DAPA (up to       4.3 million).        One additional, but related, issue concerns DHS's current       practices regarding DACA recipients. A number of troubling       incidents in recent months raise serious concerns over       whether DHS agents are adhering to DACA guidelines and your       repeated public assurances that DACA-eligible individuals are       not targets for arrest and deportation. We urge you to ensure       compliance with DACA and consistent enforcement practices       towards Dreamers.        Mr. President, now is the time to affirm the commitment you       made, both to the ``incredible kids'' who benefit from DACA       and to their families and our communities, to handle this       issue ``with heart.'' You said Dreamers should ``rest easy.''       We urge you to affirm America's values and tradition as a       nation of immigrants and make clear that you will not only       continue DACA, but that you will defend it. The cost of not       doing so would be too high for America, the economy, and for       these young people. For these reasons, we urge you to       maintain and defend DACA, and we stand in support of the       effort to defend DACA by all appropriate means.            Sincerely,          Xavier Becerra, California Attorney General; George             Jepsen, Connecticut Attorney General; Matthew Denn,             Delaware Attorney General; Karl A. Racine, District of             Columbia Attorney General; Douglas S. Chin, Hawaii             Attorney General; Lisa Madigan, Illinois Attorney             General; Tom Miller, Iowa Attorney General; Janet T.             Mills, Maine Attorney General; Brian Frosh, Maryland             Attorney General; Maura Healey, Massachussets Attorney             General; Lori Swanson, Minnesota Attorney General;             Hector Balderas, New Mexico Attorney General; Eric T.             Schneiderman, New York Attorney General; Josh Stein,             North Carolina Attorney General; Ellen F. Rosenblum,             Oregon Attorney General; Josh Shapiro, Pennsylvania             Attorney General; Peter Kilmartin, Rhode Island             Attorney General; TJ Donovan, Vermont Attorney General;             Mark Herring, Virginia Attorney General; Bob Ferguson,             Washington State Attorney General.    Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Gutierrez).    Mr. Chair, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.  Initially, I want to say that I hope that very soon, in a bipartisan  way, we will bring a DACA bill to this floor.   Let me quote what President Trump said last night. Trump tweeted that  he wanted to ``legalize DACA,'' another call to action, and further  muddled where the administration stood and what it would do.   He said: We need to come together and do this, and we really have no  choice.   Now, I want to speak about this bill. As the chairman knows, and as  the ranking member knows, I served on the Appropriations Committee for  23 years, so I have taken leave of absence because I am one of the  leaders on our side of the aisle.   For most of those years, we worked in a bipartisan fashion. This is a  partisan bill. It is sad, and it is not regular order at all. Regular  order is doing one bill after another until you have passed the 12  bills. In fact, I don't think I have ever seen this process done in  this fashion.   When I was the majority leader, the first year we passed all 12 bills  individually, discretely, separately, and sent them to the Senate  before the August break.   Hal Rogers, the former chairman of this committee, said of the  President's budget: ``While we have a responsibility to reduce our  Federal deficit, I am disappointed that many of the reductions and  eliminations proposed in the President's skinny budget are draconian,  careless and counterproductive.'' I think the same could be applied to  the budget that is before us.   The omnibus appropriations package the House is considering this week  is, as all of us here recognize--all of us recognize--the chairman, I  have great respect for, and I am not going to ask him publicly whether  he thinks the Senate is going to adopt any one of these bills, but I  know his answer.   The CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.    Mr. Chair, let me say to my colleagues, this is not the  way to do it. John McCain gave a compelling speech on the floor of the  United States Senate as he was challenged with a brain tumor and  thinking deeply about what we ought to do. And he said: We need to act  together. We need to be bipartisan. We need to do the people's work in  a way they expect us to do it: together.    Mr. Chairman, this bill is not going to get a Democratic vote. That  is sad. It is sad for the House; it is sad for the country; and it is  sad for the people who will be shortchanged by this bill.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``no,'' and I urge the majority party to  return to the table, as surely we will, to work in a bipartisan fashion  to construct bills that we can all be proud of.   There will be compromises. We won't get all that we want, but they  will be bills that the American people can be proud of and that this  House can be proud of. Let us return to the bipartisan comity and  respect for one another that so long prevailed in the Appropriations  Committee. How sad we have fallen to this place.
