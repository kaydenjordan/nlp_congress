 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, today we mourn the loss of at least 50  lives in Las Vegas, the victims of senseless violence at an outdoor  concert near the Mandalay Resort and Casino. The lives of fellow  Americans were taken in a barbaric manner that defies all  justification, excuse, or even explanation. That these events have  become almost commonplace in modern society makes them no less shocking  or morally reprehensible.   The date and location--a country music festival on a Sunday  afternoon--make the act seem doubly cruel. Thousands of innocent  spectators were there from around the country enjoying themselves, with  security being the furthest thing from their minds, until the shots  rang out.   As news reports have now indicated, the event is one of the deadliest  mass shootings in modern U.S. history. It and other forms of violence  continue to tear apart the fabric of our country, and the scars left  among the victims' families and loved ones will be painful and  permanent.   My prayers go out to all those in Nevada who have not slept since  yesterday and who are still grappling with the aftermath of the  shooting, the families tending to loved ones in hospitals, as well as  the first responders and law  [[Page S6243]]  enforcement officers who ran toward, not away from, the gunfire and who  are now nursing various wounds. Here in Washington, we will continue to  monitor the situation. We will continue to keep the fallen in our  prayers in the days ahead.    The following Senators are necessarily absent: the  Senator from Mississippi (Mr. Cochran), the Senator from Nevada (Mr.  Heller), the Senator from Arizona (Mr. McCain), and the Senator from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Toomey).    Mr. President, I would like to take a few moments to  congratulate Heath Tarbert, who was confirmed by the Senate last  Wednesday and will soon be serving as Assistant Secretary of the  Treasury for International Markets and Development,  [[Page S6256]]  and also to talk about reform legislation that relates to his new area  of responsibility. I was pleased to support Mr. Tarbert's nomination,  along with the vast majority of my Senate colleagues. He has held a  number of important positions in all three branches of the Federal  Government, including his service as a special counsel to the Senate  Banking Committee during the negotiations leading to the Dodd-Frank  Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act; an associate counsel to  the President of the United States during the global financial crisis;  and a law clerk for the Supreme Court of the United States. He is an  experienced lawyer and financial expert who will be a valuable asset to  the Treasury Department. While his new position may not be well known  to many outside of the Beltway, it is vitally important to safeguarding  our national security interests, as Chairman Crapo of the Senate  Banking Committee attested to when Mr. Tarbert was voted out of  committee in near-unanimous fashion in May. I have no doubt of Mr.  Tarbert's qualifications to take on this key role, and given that only  one Member voted against his nomination, it is clear that there is a  bipartisan consensus on that point.   With that being said, I look forward to working closely with him on  some important reforms that are desperately needed to protect our  national security and modernize the way we screen foreign investment  deals for those risks. Specifically I am referring to the Committee on  Foreign Investment in the United States, better known as CFIUS. As you  may know, Mr. Tarbert will now be charged with overseeing the vetting  of hundreds of proposed investments annually. I am confident that Mr.  Tarbert will make effective use of the tools and authorities that CFIUS  has. Unfortunately, those current tools and authorities are not  adequate, in light of the changing national security landscape. There  are clear gaps in the CFIUS process, which nations such as China are  exploiting on a daily basis. The reason for this is simple: CFIUS was  not designed to stop investment-driven technology transfers, and  unfortunately, many such transactions are occurring today that are  carefully designed to sidestep CFIUSs' limited jurisdiction.   The need to close these gaps has garnered support from Republicans  and Democrats alike, something that is seemingly rare in Washington  these days. In fact, there is a bipartisan effort coming together right  now to introduce legislation that would modernize the CFIUS process for  the first time in a decade. Such commonsense reforms should be made to  heighten scrutiny on certain types of investments, especially from  countries such as China that pose a potential threat to U.S. national  security interests. At a minimum, we should expand the types of  transactions that fall under CFIUS jurisdiction, including joint  ventures and minority-position investments, as well as certain real  estate transactions in close proximity to military bases and other  sensitive national security facilities.   My legislation, the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act,  or FIRRMA, will do just that, and I intend to file it in the next few  weeks. It will address the aforementioned gaps in the current CFIUS  process and will help protect our national security. I urge my  colleagues to cosponsor this legislation and support these commonsense  reforms for the sake of our long-term national security.   (At the request of Mr. McConnell, the following statement was ordered  to be printed in the Record.)   Mr. President, I have 1 request for a committee to meet  during today's session of the Senate.
