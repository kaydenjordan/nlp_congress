 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of my bipartisan  legislation, H.R. 8510, the Strengthening Whistleblower Protections at  the Department of Veterans Affairs Act.   It is a bill that improves policies and procedures to better protect  VA whistleblowers. It also promotes independence and removes conflicts  of interest at VA's Office of Accountability and Whistleblower  Protection.   Whistleblowers play a critical role in holding the Federal Government  and its agencies accountable for waste, fraud, abuse, and  mismanagement. When employees of the Department of Veterans Affairs  witness issues that put the health, safety, and well-being of veterans  at risk, VA staff should feel encouraged to speak out without fear of  retaliation. This would encourage corrective action to be taken and no  harm to the whistleblower.   In reality, however, too often the messenger is punished. The  Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations that I chair has done  years of work on this issue.   Alongside Ranking Member Tracey Mann, we have conducted multiple  hearings looking into this problem. Our efforts have highlighted the  individual stories of whistleblowers who have lost their jobs or faced  other retaliatory actions as a result of their disclosures.   Further, whistleblowers often wait years to be made whole after  experiencing retaliation under current Department policies and  procedures.   The testimony from three previous VA employees disclosed VA  whistleblowers are likely to face retaliation, including the loss of  their position, and are forced to wait years for justice.   This bipartisan bill will make major changes to how whistleblower  claims are handled, strengthening accountability through the process.  The bill ends VA's authority to investigate whistleblower retaliation  complaints and, instead, relies on the independent U.S. Office of  Special Counsel to ensure objectivity over the process.    OSC is an independent Federal investigative agency that has high  trust within the whistleblower community. They have the resources and  autonomy needed to do this work.   It will also require VA's Office of Accountability and Whistleblower  Protection to strengthen accountability over settlement agreements for  VA employees who suffered retaliation which provide financial  restitution and guarantees of reemployment.   Further, the bill will reaffirm OAWP's responsibility to provide  resources to VA employees on whistleblower rights, including training.  These reforms will ensure whistleblowers feel safe reporting issues  within the Department.   We can't continue to allow whistleblowers to be punished for speaking  out, and we have to make sure we are doing all we can to protect VA  whistleblowers. It is not only the law; it is also the right thing to  do to protect whistleblowers from retaliation.   My colleague and ranking member of the Subcommittee on Oversight and  Investigations, Congressman Tracey Mann, co-led this bill with me to  promote independence and strengthen the mission of VA's whistleblowers  office. I thank Congressman Mann and his staff for their dedication and  hard work on this issue.   I thank all the members of the Veterans' Affairs Committee for their  support of this bill last week, and I appreciate the support from the  whistleblower advocacy groups, including the Project on Government  Oversight, the Whistleblowers of America, and the Government  Accountability Project, as well as VA's labor union, AFGE.                                time  2100    So once this is enacted, this bill will ensure that the protections  are on the books at the Department of Veterans Affairs that will  strengthen independence and the mission of VA's whistleblower office.   Madam Speaker, I urge the full House to support passage.  [[Page H8192]]
