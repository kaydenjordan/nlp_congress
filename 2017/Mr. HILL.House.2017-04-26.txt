 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the Days of  Remembrance and pay tribute to all those who were affected by the  enormity, the calamity, and the horrors of the Holocaust.   On April 11, 1945, at 3 p.m. in the afternoon, General Patton's Third  Army liberated Buchenwald concentration camp, with the help of my  father-in-law, Bill McKenzie, then a young 22-year-old U.S Army  officer, fresh from the corps at Texas A&M University.   Bill said of that day: ``I will not describe the horrible sight of  our entry into Buchenwald, but I will tell you this--that the  crematorium was still  [[Page H2879]]  burning, dead were stacked like cordwood on large trailers, and the  living dead were starving.''   Some 65 years later, I would deliver the eulogy at Bill's funeral and  read a condolence letter sent to our family from the nephew of a  survivor he rescued that day.   As a member of the Greatest Generation, Bill will always be  remembered by us as a hero, and his role liberating innocent people  from the Nazi Germany death camps is a proud distinction for our  family. His story serves as a reminder that these atrocities have no  place in our world.                            ____________________
