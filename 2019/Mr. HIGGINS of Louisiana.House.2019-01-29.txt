 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend and colleague, Congresswoman Rice from  New York, for introducing this bill.   Over the past 12 months, there has been growing concern by  administration officials, as well as security and financial experts,  about potential threats associated with cryptocurrencies.   In July 2018, a Department of Justice task force reported noted  criminals are using virtual currencies to collect, hide, and launder  funds, as well as purchase illegal goods and services. Both the  Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service have ongoing  efforts to review registered digital currency providers and identify  illicit use.   The legislation we are considering today, sponsored by the  gentlewoman from New York (Miss Rice), adds to this effort by directing  the Department of Homeland Security to develop and disseminate a threat  assessment of threat posed by individuals using virtual currencies to  carry out activities in furtherance of terrorism, including the  provision of material support or resources to a foreign terrorist  organization.   The bill also requires DHS to share the threat assessment with State  and local law enforcement.   As the threat of terrorism evolves, so do the methods to finance and  support the actors who plot to attack the United States. The Federal  Government must evolve as well to meet these novel and technologically  based challenges.   This bill positions the Department to detect the new, digital-based  methods in terrorist financing and support that have already occurred  and to prepare for those that are sure and soon to follow.   The potential of terrorist organizations to use virtual currencies to  carry out an attack, or a smuggling network to launder illicit proceeds  through cryptocurrency markets, should be a major concern to the  Department of Homeland Security. Requiring the Department to conduct a  threat assessment is appropriate and timely.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Rice for bringing this bill  forward, and I urge a ``yes'' vote.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   Miss RICE of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 428 is an important piece of legislation that was  approved by a voice vote last Congress. This bill will help DHS  effectively address terrorists' actual and potential use of virtual  currencies.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues in the Freedom Caucus, who  care so much about national security and domestic security, to put  their money where their mouths are, to put political pettiness aside,  let these votes go through as they are meant to, because these are  bipartisan bills, DHS bills that are supported broadly by Members of  this House. Let's get on with this, since this is an issue that we all  care about.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this legislation,  H.R. 428, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, it is part of DHS' statutory mission to support State  and local law enforcement, and the Office of State and Local Law  Enforcement has the responsibility of proactively identifying ways in  which the Department can support these important stakeholders.   The Pathways to Improving Homeland Security at the Local Level Act,  sponsored by the gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. Demings), will ensure  that State and local law enforcement receive vital information on  available DHS resources and programs.   Under the bill, the Office of State and Local Law Enforcement will  annually produce and disseminate a catalog that details the Department  of Homeland Security training, publications, programs, and services  available to non-Federal law enforcement agencies. The office must  disseminate the catalog within 30 days of production to State and local  law enforcement entities.   This catalog is currently being produced by the office, and the bill  requires them to continue its production.   DHS also is required to share the catalog through the Homeland  Security Information Network. Using this existing information-sharing  platform will expand, hopefully, the number of State and local law  enforcement partners who receive it.   This bill is intended to increase awareness of DHS tools and  resources available to assist State and local law enforcement.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense  measure, and I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1330    Miss RICE of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. Demings).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Gosar).    Mr. Speaker, in closing, I thank the  gentlewoman from Florida for introducing this important bill to ensure  State and local law enforcement are aware of the resources DHS can  provide to them.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   Miss RICE of New York. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 449, which passed the House  of Representatives on suspension last Congress, will strengthen the  Federal Government's relationship with our State and local law  enforcement partners.   One of our top priorities on this committee is ensuring adequate  training for our first responders and creating collaborative  partnerships between DHS and its local counterparts. This bill will  help us accomplish that.   Mr. Speaker, I again urge my colleagues to support H.R. 449, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 504, the DHS Field Engagement  Accountability Act.   The Committee on Homeland Security has long supported the role and  mission of locally owned fusion centers across the United States. These  hubs for assessing and sharing threat information are important links  for the Department of Homeland Security, the FBI, and other Federal,  State, and local stakeholders.   The legislation before us today directs the Department of Homeland  Security to develop a forward-looking strategy to improve engagement  efforts with fusion centers and establish metrics for both DHS  personnel and technology deployed to fusion centers.   Clear performance metrics for fusion center personnel are needed to  ensure fusion center directors understand what to expect from DHS  personnel detailed to their centers. This effort will also allow DHS to  better track the value fusion centers are providing to the national  information-sharing environment.   Lastly, the bill addresses a need for improvements to DHS information  sharing utilized by fusion centers and other stakeholders by requiring  training modules and feedback mechanisms.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative   Don Bacon for his work on this  legislation and his overall commitment to Federal, State, and local  information sharing.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.   Miss RICE of New York. Mr. Speaker, I have no more speakers, and I am  prepared to close after the gentleman from Louisiana closes.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the  gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. Bacon), the cosponsor of this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers,  and I am prepared to close.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Thompson, Ranking Member Rogers, and  Congressman Bacon for bringing this bill to the floor.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 504, to improve DHS'  coordination and information-sharing activities with State and local  fusion centers across the country, thereby making the homeland security  intelligence enterprise more robust.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   Miss RICE of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 504, which passed the House on suspension last  Congress, would help ensure that fusion centers throughout the country  have access to the resources necessary to keep our homeland safe and  secure.   By directing the Department to develop a strategy for its fusion  centers, the bill seeks to enhance DHS' overall ability to fulfill its  core mission. Additionally, H.R. 504 would ensure that DHS'  information-sharing policies include strong privacy and civil liberty  safeguards.   Regardless of the target or the underlying ideology behind a  terrorist plot, State and local law enforcement entities need a clear  line of communication with their Federal counterparts.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 504, and I yield  back the balance of my time.
