 Madam President, perhaps later today or one day this  week, we will have debate on the Senate floor and a vote, and that vote  literally will decide the future for over 200,000 young Americans.   Politicians and elected officials are prone to exaggeration, but I  don't exaggerate when I say that, because we will have an opportunity  here to debate and vote on a system that was put in place years ago to  protect students from being defrauded by the colleges they attend. It  is called the borrower defense program. It was started years ago. It  was really designed for that rare situation where a student would take  out a government loan to go to college after the college made  misrepresentations about the education it offered. The student would  rely on those misrepresentations, sign up for the school, sign up for  the government loan, and learn, to his disappointment, months or years  later that the school had lied to him. The school may have told him: If  you take this certain course at this school, you will qualify for a  certain job or licensure. The school may have misrepresented to the  student that the courses they took at the school could be transferred  to other schools if the student decided to go to a different university  to complete their education. The misrepresentation may have been  something as basic as saying ``All of our professors and instructors at  this school have certain college degrees qualifying them to teach  you,'' or the school may have misrepresented to the student that ``If  you complete this course, here are the jobs that will be readily  available for you to fill.''   Students listen to those promises, sometimes rely on them, oftentimes  [[Page S1645]]  signing loans with the Federal Government that need to be paid off  later, and then they learn they were lied to.   Because they were defrauded or lied to or misrepresentations were  made, we set up a provision in the law that said there is a way out for  the student. You don't end up holding the bag here when a college or  university which the United States government has recognized as  accredited has lied to you. You are not left holding the bag. There is  another way out. Our Department of Education will take a look at your  circumstances and decide whether there is evidence that this school has  lied to you or misrepresented, and if we find it, we can restructure or  forgive some part or all of your student loan debt.   You know, that makes all the difference in the world to these  students because here they are holding the bag, with tens, if not  hundreds of thousands of dollars of debt because of lies that were made  by the schools that tried to entice them into enrollment. It is called  the borrower defense program.   Under President Obama, thousands of students came to the program and  said: We were lied to by these schools.   Most of the schools are for-profit colleges and universities. One of  the most notorious--Corinthian Colleges--is now bankrupt and gone, but  for years, they were enticing thousands of Americans into their  programs. They were signing up young students for courses, making them  sign the loan agreements, and then after that was done, the students  learned later on that the education was virtually worthless.   What happened to Corinthian? Well, the people who started this for- profit college and university did quite well, thank you. All these  students paid thousands of dollars to them, and even though they  misrepresented the school to the students, they ended up taking the  money and going home, and the school faced bankruptcy, and the students  are left holding the bag. That is the unfortunate reality we face. We  can do something about it today.   The Secretary of Education, Mrs. DeVos, has decided to change the way  students have to go through proving their losses, and that is why we  are here today. The House has voted overwhelmingly saying Secretary  DeVos's approach was unfair. I will describe to you why we think it is  unfair.   What we are asking Members of the Senate to do today is take an  honest look at the plight of these students and decide whether they are  entitled to any relief under the proposal by Secretary DeVos. We  estimate that fewer than 3 percent of the students will receive any  kind of relief because of the approach she uses. What we can do today  is reject that approach. This vote is not about any alternative  approach. Though, we could sit down and actually negotiate a better way  to deal with this. I have talked to Members on the Republican side  about doing just that.   The first step is to stop this new rule by Secretary DeVos, and that  will be an opportunity we have today. If we stop these rules she has  promulgated, then the students will have a chance to have some part of  their student loan forgiven--perhaps all of it--if they can prove  through evidence that they have been defrauded.   Let me be more specific about what we are facing here. In 1992,  Congress added a provision to the Higher Education Act which I just  described called the borrower defense program. It allowed student  borrowers defrauded by their schools to have their Federal student  loans discharged. Congress rightly didn't want students left holding  the bag because the schools had been guilty of misconduct. It was  really a little known or rarely used portion of the law until the year  2014 with the collapse of the for-profit giant Corinthian Colleges.   Corinthian had lied to students one after the other. They inflated  their job placement rates, saying to students: Take these courses, and  there are plenty of jobs waiting for you. They took out loans for  students without the knowledge of the students, and then they lied to  the students about employers' recognizing their degrees.    Yet Corinthian was not unique. Nearly every other major for-profit  college has been the subject of multiple State and Federal  investigations and lawsuits for similar predatory practices.   Since 2015--just 5 years ago--nearly 300,000 student borrowers,  mostly from these for-profit colleges, have applied to our U.S.  Department of Education for borrower defense discharges. They have  said: We were lied to. These schools lied to us about what the  education would mean to our futures. They enticed us into getting  student loans, and we learned too late that we have been subjects of  this fraud. Now, because our lives have been compromised with the great  debts that we carry, we are asking for relief from a 1992 law that has  been established.   Almost 220,000 of these students have pending claims with the U.S.  Department of Education. Do you know how long they have been waiting  for resolutions so they know if they can get on with their lives? Many  of them have been waiting for years. The claims come from every State  in the Union--large, small, red, blue, purple. It doesn't make any  difference.   Sadly, it is not going to stop. The Department of Education's  estimates show that nearly 200,000 student borrowers will be subject to  illegal practices by their schools in 2021 alone. The schools continue  to make these misrepresentations to students.   With the new borrower defense rule, Secretary DeVos at the Department  of Education will make it virtually impossible for these future  defrauded borrowers to receive the borrower defense discharge that  Congress intended. The DeVos rule places unreasonable new burdens on  defrauded borrowers, including requiring the student borrowers to  submit evidence that they will have to obtain by hiring lawyers and  private detectives. For example, defrauded borrowers will have to show  that the schools intentionally misled them. How are they supposed to do  that?   In addition, the rule requires defrauded borrowers to apply and  submit evidence individually instead of being able to apply as a group  when many borrowers have experienced similar misconduct across a  program or school.   Think about these schools that have been investigated by so many  different States and have been found guilty of predatory practices, of  exploiting these college students. The schools have been found guilty  of defrauding these students in State, after State, after State. Under  the new rule by Secretary DeVos, to be discharged under this borrower  defense program, each one of the students has to essentially lawyer up.  Each one of the students has to hire an investigator.   What is the likelihood that a student who is burdened with debt and  is struggling to find a job is going to go out and make those  expenditures? It is next to nothing. In fact, it turns out it is about  3 percent of the students who are likely to be able to take advantage  of that. Secretary DeVos is basically telling these student borrowers:  You are on your own. Lawyer up. Hire a private detective to find the  evidence.   This is unfair and unrealistic. We need to go no further than the  Department's own statistics to realize that 97 percent of the students  have no chance under this DeVos rule. By the experts' best testimony,  only 3 percent have a chance of recovering under this new approach.  That is the rule we will get a chance to vote on this week, whether  that rule should continue.   The Department claims that these new hurdles for borrowers are  necessary to guard against fraudulent claims made by students, but  there is no evidence--none--of widespread fraud on the part of  borrowers among the 300,000 borrower defense claims that have already  been submitted. In fact, the Department itself notes that it does not  have sufficient information to determine the extent of any potential  fraud by students. There is no evidence whatsoever of this notion that  Secretary DeVos's rule is needed because of fraud by borrowers. The new  rule just means that defrauded borrowers with legitimate claims are not  going to get relief.   The Department also claims the DeVos rule protects taxpayers by  shifting the burden of relief from the taxpayers to the schools that  commit misconduct. Yet it then turns around and acknowledges that other  changes in the rule will, in fact, reduce recoveries from schools  compared to the 2016 rule, and that means more cost for taxpayers.   The truth is, of the small amount of relief that will be awarded  under the DeVos rule, schools will be on the hook for about one-third  of it at the most. In  [[Page S1646]]  reality, the DeVos rule achieves savings on the backs of the borrowers  who are victims of fraud. It eliminates $11 billion in relief while it  reduces the share of relief that the schools which are guilty of fraud  have to pay.   The Department also acknowledges that the DeVos rule is not expected  to significantly change the percentage of loan volume subject to  misconduct. In other words, this rule will not only generate less money  from the offending schools, but it will be less likely to discourage  future misconduct by the same schools. On the other hand, the former  Department inspector general said the 2016 rule would ``avoid costs to  students and taxpayers that result from school closures.''   I could go on, but the bottom line is this: If we want to stop this  insidious practice of defrauding students and having them pile up debt  from schools that are phony and that eventually all go out of business,  we have to have a program that is sensitive to the needs of the student  borrowers and that puts these schools that are guilty of misconduct on  the hook for the payoff rather than the taxpayers.   The DeVos rule eliminates the prohibition in the 2016 rule that  prevents schools from using mandatory arbitration and class action  restriction as a condition of student enrollment. What is mandatory  arbitration? It is basically saying to the students and their families:  You can't go to court. You have to go into a closed room, sit across  the table from one of our lawyers, and take it or leave it.   That is what mandatory arbitration is all about. Class action  restrictions mean that the students of one school that defrauded  thousands of students can't come together in any kind of legal action.   You don't see those kinds of provisions for mandatory arbitration and  class action restrictions in the contracts that most students run into  when they sign up at colleges and universities. It is almost  exclusively in the area of private, for-profit colleges and  universities. The clauses are often buried in stacks of enrollment  documents that students rarely, if ever, read. It means that the  schools can defraud and mislead students and that they are protected  from being held accountable in court. Businesses around America are  held accountable for their conduct and misconduct. Why would we let the  for-profit colleges and universities off the hook?   Students have nowhere else to turn other than to the taxpayers  through this borrower defense program that we are discussing here.  Instead of allowing borrowers to hold their schools directly  accountable for misconduct in court, Secretary DeVos's rule shields  these schools from accountability and puts American taxpayers on the  hook.   I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter that  was published in the Charlotte Observer over the weekend. It was  written by Shaun Joyce, of Greensboro, NC.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                [From the Charlotte Observer, Mar. 8, 2020]         A Dwindling Defense Against a Fraudulent School, Big Loans                              (By Shaun Joyce)         I'm one of 300,000 people who applied for ``borrower       defense,'' a government rule that is supposed to cancel       federal student loan debt for borrowers who have been scammed       by their schools, almost 8,000 of us from North Carolina.       Education Secretary Betsy DeVos has made it harder for       defrauded students by rewriting the borrower defense rule       with so many restrictions that only 3 percent of the people       who were lied to by their schools will get the relief the law       says they should.        Fortunately, the U.S. House of Representatives has already       voted to strike down DeVos' rewrite, and the Senate is set to       vote on it later this month. This won't help my situation       because of when I took out my student loans, but I'm hoping       that North Carolina Sens. Richard Burr and Thom Tillis will       stand up for people cheated by predatory colleges--and pass       the bill to provide some justice. I always thought college       would be the magic key to unlock opportunity and open the       door to the life I wanted. My mother had to drop out before       she earned her degree, but always told me, ``Go to school.''       After learning about the Art Institute of Charlotte, I       thought,        ``Here's my chance,'' envisioning a future as a video game       designer. Art Institute recruiters at a college fair       convinced me the school was perfect for me. A week later, a       representative barely glanced at my portfolio, more       interested in selling me and my mother on all sorts of loans.       She said the school would prepare me for the job market and       connect me to people who could help me land a job. My       Bachelor's would cost me around $64,000, an amount that       seemed a little intimidating. But she talked about a number       of options--all loans--to help pay for it. She assured me       that if my mother didn't qualify for a parent PLUS loan, the       school itself would cosign loans for me.        We signed. I was on my way to earning the college degree       that would change my life. And it did. But not in any way I       would want.        Today, I owe nearly $100,000 for a degree that didn't       prepare me for a job within the gaming industry. I work       writing on--hold telephone messages for a marketing company       and attend one class at a time at my local community college,       working toward a degree in biology--none of my Art Institute       classes transferred.        The Art Institute of Charlotte shut down two years ago, but       my degree was worthless before then. None of my classes had       anything to do with video game design. The school kept       pushing me to take out more loans, and I didn't feel I could       leave. I still had my dreams--and, as a young black man, the       last thing I wanted to do was become just another statistic       by dropping out. I switched to an Associate 's in hopes of       saving money.        When I asked about career opportunities, my adviser sent me       Craig's List job postings in California. I never saw any       great opportunities. I'm not the only one. Hundreds of       thousands of people like me have attended colleges that       failed to educate them, left them with crushing debt, and       shut down for predatory lending and fraudulent recruitment.        I hope Congress comes through to provide these people       struggling and in debt through no fault of their own with       some relief. Senators Burr and Tillis should vote yes on       Senate Joint Resolution 56.        Shaun Joyce is a 2010 graduate of the Art Institute of       Charlotte. He lives in Greensboro, N.C.     Shaun is one of nearly 6,000 borrowers from North  Carolina who have applied to the Department for a borrower defense  discharge. He attended the Art Institute of Charlotte and thought it  was his path to having a successful future. He was told by recruiters  that the school would prepare him for a job in video game designing and  that those at the school would connect him with people who would help  him land that job. That is a pretty serious promise to a young person,  isn't it? He said they kept pushing him to take on more and more  courses and more and more debt. Eventually, he had so much debt that he  felt there was no other option than to finish the degree. He had to go  all in with this school, the Art Institute of Charlotte.   He writes: ``[As] a young black man, the last thing I wanted to do  was become just another statistic by dropping out [of school].''   Shaun owes nearly $100,000 in student loan debt today for a degree  that did not prepare him for a job in the very industry he was  promised. When he asked the Art Institute of Charlotte about career  opportunities, do you know where they sent him? Craigslist.   As of today, Shaun's work is in writing on-hold telephone messages  for a marketing company, and he attends one class at a time at his  community college at which none--not one--of his Art Institute credits  can be transferred. He has asked the Senate to overturn the DeVos rule.  He knows the struggles defrauded student borrowers go through.   I want to share with you a story of a U.S. Army veteran whose name is  Jarrod Thoma. Jarrod is from the State of Colorado. After Jarrod left  the Army, he wanted to pursue his lifelong passion for electronics by  pursuing a degree in engineering. He signed up at the for-profit DeVry  University in Westminster, CO. He said he quickly realized he was not  getting the quality education it had promised. Course materials and the  equipment for instruction were subpar and not as advertised.   He says: ``Although DeVry was more than happy to cash all of my GI  Bill benefits, my complaints about quality [of the courses they were  offering] fell on deaf ears.''   When he tried to transfer, he found out that his credits wouldn't  transfer to a public university or even a community college even though  DeVry had promised him they would.   In addition to using his entire GI bill benefit for serving this  country, he accumulated $52,000 in additional student loan debt in  order to finish his program at DeVry.   On top of that, Jarrod says: ``Upon entering the job market, I  quickly found that the degree . . . was not worth the paper it was  printed on, and it actually hurt my job prospects.''   Jarrod is waiting, along with 3,800 other Coloradans, for the  Department  [[Page S1647]]  to act on his borrower defense request, and he has urged the Senate to  overturn the DeVos rule in order to help future veteran borrowers like  him.   Let me also show you Tasha Berkhalter. I met her recently. She is a  U.S. Army veteran from Lima, OH. She enrolled at ITT Tech, which is  another notorious for-profit school. After she had been honorably  discharged from serving in our U.S. Army, she was promised by ITT that  her GI bill benefits would cover the cost for the program and that her  program would lead to a job in her field after graduation.   At one point, she tried to transfer, only to find out that other  schools wouldn't accept the credits she had earned at ITT Tech. She  didn't have any options. She had to finish at ITT. Not only did she  exhaust her entire GI bill benefits at ITT Tech, but she had to take on  additional Federal student loans despite all of ITT's assurances that  was not going to happen. Tasha's student loan debt today for having  attended ITT Tech is almost $100,000 beyond her GI bill benefits--all  for a degree that she says no employer takes seriously.   Of course, this puts a lot of pressure on her now. Tasha is married  and has a family. She is facing overwhelming stress, anxiety, and  depression because of the miserable experience she had with this for- profit school, ITT Tech, and the student debt she incurred.   She served our country, and she risked her life for America. When it  came to her GI bill benefits, she lost all of it at this for-profit  school. She is asking for a chance to start over with her life, and our  vote on the Senate floor may decide that. She even questions herself as  a wife and as a mother of four young children because she is unable to  provide for her family as she is still unable to get a job in her  field. She has lost cars, homes, and has had to move from State to  State. She supports overturning the DeVos borrower defense rule because  she wants defrauded veterans like her to have a shot at relief.   Veterans like Jarrod and Tasha are the reason that I bring this  matter to the floor and ask my Republican and Democratic colleagues to  join me. So many of us give speeches about our appreciation for the  veterans and their service to our country. So many of us voted for the  GI bill benefit package. We said to veterans: We owe it to you. You  served our country. We want to be on your side after that service so  you can build good lives in America.   Then schools like Corinthian and schools like ITT Tech defraud these  students out of their GI bill benefits and pile additional debt on top  of them. That is why this has become such a major veterans issue.   Take a look at the veterans organizations that support the measure  that I bring to the floor today: the American Legion--and I am going to  quote from a letter from its national commander in just a moment; the  Student Veterans of America; the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of  America; the National Military Family Association; the Paralyzed  Veterans of America; the Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors;  VetsFirst; Veterans for Common Sense; and Veterans Education Success.   I would like to show you this last poster here. It is a letter that I  received from Bill Oxford. Bill, as you can see, is the national  commander of the American Legion. He wrote to me on behalf of 2 million  American Legion members whom he represents because he wanted to go on  the record and give me a chance to bring this evidence before my fellow  Senators, Republicans and Democrats. Many of them are being visited  today by representatives of these veterans organizations, including the  American Legion. I hope they can spare a minute of their time in their  offices in honor of these veterans and listen to the pleas they are  going to make for a vote in favor of the measure I am going to bring  before the Senate.   Here is what Bill wrote in his letter to me: ``Thousands of student  veterans have been defrauded over the years--promised their credits  would transfer when they wouldn't, given false or misleading job  placement rates in marketing, promised one educational experience . . .  but given something completely different.'' Bill calls this rule by  Secretary DeVos ``fundamentally rigged against defrauded borrowers''  and writes that it ``flagrantly denies defrauded veterans [fair and  timely] decisions [on their claims].''   Bill closes his letter by calling on Congress to overturn the DeVos  rule.   How many times have each of us stood on the floor and talked about  honoring the sacrifices of men and women who serve our country in  uniform?   Well, we have a chance to do it with a vote this week--to put our  votes where all of our speeches have been. We have a chance to stand up  not just for the American Legion but for all the veterans groups that I  referred to before, to give defrauded student veterans and student loan  borrowers a fair shot at the Federal student debt relief that Congress  intended for them.   We don't do many things on a bipartisan basis around here anymore,  and it is a shame. I hope this will be an exception. Frankly, all of us  have given these speeches on both sides of the aisle. All of us have  said how much these veterans and their families mean to us. Well, now  they are asking us to be on their side with this vote.   I am urging my colleagues to show America that, when it comes to  supporting our veterans, the Senate, on a bipartisan basis, can come  together and do the right thing.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, last year, I was proud to stand with my  colleagues as we introduced the For the People Act in the Senate just  weeks after it passed the House of Representatives. This measure has  already passed the House of Representatives.   If you took civics 101, they explain that after the House took action  on a measure, it came here. So the obvious question is, What happened  to it? It has been a year. It must be here somewhere. Well, we know  exactly where it is. It is in Senator McConnell's office. He is the  Republican Leader of the U.S. Senate, and he has made a conscious  decision that hundreds of bills just like this one will not even be  considered on the floor of the Senate. It isn't that he doesn't have a  majority; he does. But he doesn't want us to even debate or discuss  these bills before the American people.   This U.S. Senate once enjoyed its reputation as the world's most  deliberative body, which means we came here, debated, argued, and voted  on things like amendments and bills like this one. Last year in the  U.S. Senate, the calendar year 2019, we considered exactly 22  amendments in the entire year--22 amendments in 1 year in this Senate.  Six of them were offered by Senator Paul, who, with a gun to our heads,  said: If you don't give me a vote on my amendment, you can't go home.  All six of his amendments were defeated, but that just gives you an  example of why there is so little activity and why this floor is so  empty so many times.   In fact, this floor has become a museum piece where bystanders,  witnesses, and spectators can come in, sit in the Galleries, and look  down on the desks that used to be occupied by Senators who debated and  voted. We don't do that anymore. Instead, we consider one after the  other after the other of judicial nominations. I am not going to get  into that issue because it has been touched on already.   My contribution to this For the People Act goes to the heart of  political campaigns. If you don't think American political campaigns  are long enough, if you would like us to be on television a few more  months each year, hang on tight because it is coming. If you don't  think enough money is being spent on American political campaigns, hang  on tight because more is coming. If you want to reach the point where  we have no idea where most of the money is coming from that funds these  campaigns, hang on. The Citizens United decision by the Supreme Court  across the street has set the stage for that, and that is where we are  headed in America today.   My proposal for fair elections now moves in exactly the opposite  directions--shorter campaigns, smaller contributions, more  confrontation between candidates over issues than to have this battle  of television ads that goes on now.   My act would create a voluntary, small-donor, public financing system  for Senate candidates who agree to raise only small-dollar  contributions. I know it is a dream, but think about what it would do  to change American politics. Here is how it would work: Qualified  Senate candidates would receive grants based on their State's  population, 6-to-1 matching grants for contributions they get of $200  or less--smaller contributors--and vouchers for purchasing television  advertising other than social media. Once candidates reach the maximum  amount of matching funds they receive, they continue to raise an  unlimited amount of contributions of $200 or less--a $200 cap on  contributions. They can also raise money from small-donor political  action committees, known as People PACs, which allow citizens to make  their voices heard by aggregating just small contributions--no big  hitters.   The fair elections public financing system would elevate the views  and interests of a diverse group of Americans, rather than the  traditional wealthy class, and we would pay for it without spending a  dime in taxpayer dollars. Our system would be financed with assessments  on wealthy bad actors and industry law breakers. In the 2018 midterm  elections, the price of victory for a successful House congressional  candidate averaged about $2 million, and 35 Senate candidates who won  in 2018 spent an average of $15.7 million apiece.    If we don't rein in the cost and length of campaigns, shame on us. We  have to reclaim the reputation of this great Congress and the U.S.  Senate, and it starts with the way we finance our campaigns.  [[Page S1652]]    In addition to the Fair Elections Now Act, this bill has measures to  increase access to the ballot box, to strengthen election security, to  improve oversight in our campaign finances, and to remove corruption  from office.   I think it is outrageous that we live in an America in which people  are dreaming up ways to restrict and restrain people's right to vote.  If there is anything fundamental to a democracy, it is the vote of  those who are legally entitled in America. I have been in this business  for a while. I started off by losing a few elections. I didn't enjoy a  moment of that, but there was a notion that at least the American  people had spoken in those elections, and I accepted the verdicts of  those people. They have come back and given me a few chances since to  be in public service.   Let's make sure the American people have the voice--the most  important voice in this process--through their right to vote. Keep  foreigners out of the process, and put Americans into them. Don't make  it hard to vote. Make it easy for those who are legally entitled to  vote.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, in just a few moments, we are going to be  considering the motion to proceed to the borrower CRA, and I would like  to say a few words, understanding that the Senators are expecting this  motion to come up in about 5 minutes.   This is a joint resolution that was passed on a bipartisan basis in  the House of Representatives to overturn the borrower defense rule that  has been promulgated by Department of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos.  I am pleased to be the Senate's sponsor.   Here is what it comes down to--hundreds of thousands of Federal  student loan borrowers having been defrauded by their schools. They  went to some of these for-profit schools that have gone out of  business, but many schools defrauded these students over the years.   We in Congress established what was known as the borrower defense. We  said, if you borrow money from the Federal Government and go to  colleges that we acknowledge as being accredited and they defraud you,  lie to you, misrepresent to you what your education is going to cost or  what it is going to give you, then, you don't have to be saddled with  the student debt for the rest of your life because of their lies,  because of their fraud. You have a chance to go to the Department of  Education and plead your case that you were defrauded, and you should  at least be relieved of some, if not all, of your student loan debt.  That is what it is all about.   There are 230,000 student borrowers who are waiting for the  Department of Education, under Betsy DeVos, to do something. The  Department has not done anything except to come up with a new rule that  says, at this point, it is going to be harder for these students to  prove fraud. It isn't enough that the States and other units of  government have found fraud by these schools. These students are  supposed to be their own lawyers and their own investigators and prove  the fraud and how it affected them personally.   Is it reasonable for a young student who has been defrauded and is  carrying student debt to have that responsibility? Secretary DeVos  thinks yes. I think no. That is what this vote is all about.   Who agrees with my position on this issue? Most of the advocates for  students do. In addition, the veterans organizations across America,  led by the American Legion, are supporting our effort now under this  Congressional Review Act to do away with the new rule by the Secretary  of the Department of Education. They say it is unfair to veterans--it  is--and unfair to student borrowers to hold them to this standard.   The American Legion's national commander, Bill Oxford, called the  rule, which we are going to get a chance to vote on after the debate,  ``fundamentally rigged against defrauded borrowers.'' He is speaking on  behalf of veterans. He could be speaking on behalf of young men and  women across America who have been misled by these schools over and  over again. The Bipartisan Policy Center Action, the NAACP, Third Way,  20 State attorneys general, and a host of others have joined me in  urging the Senate to overturn this unfair rule.   The Senate has a chance today to show the country that we can come  together and do the right thing for students and veterans. How many  times have we given speeches about how much we care about veterans?  Here is a chance to vote with the veterans, especially those who have  been defrauded out of their GI bill of rights and have ended up with  additional debt.   Secondly, how many times have people told us these student debts are  too much, are ruining kids' lives, and to give them a chance? I am not  for forgiving all loans to all students, but these students have been  defrauded. They should have an opportunity to start life again and not  be burdened with the debt that is going to make life impossible in  their futures.  [[Page S1659]]    I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will join me.  Regardless of what you think of the 2016 rule, we can certainly do  better than what Secretary DeVos has come up with.   I have been advised that we are not quite ready for my request of the  Chair. So I will say a couple of more words on the subject. I moved it  along quickly, but I didn't have to.   Under the new Betsy DeVos rule, it turns out that, of the 100 percent  of students who have been defrauded and are asking for relief, the  estimate is that 3 percent will be successful but that 97 percent of  these students will not have the opportunity to get this relief.   One of my colleagues whom I respect very much came to the floor here  and said: If your car is a lemon, you don't sue the bank; you sue the  dealer. A college can be a lemon just like a car can be. In his  scenario, the school is the dealer, and the Department of Education is  the bank. The case that he is making for a student who has been  defrauded by a school is that one has been sold a lemon of an education  and that we should go after the offending school.   Doesn't that sound right--that, if a school has defrauded you, you  would go after it?   It turns out that the rule that Secretary DeVos has promulgated ties  the hands of a student who is going after the school. It requires  forced, mandatory arbitration. So you can't take it to court. It  eliminates class actions so that students from the same school, like  the Corinthian Colleges, which went bankrupt, can't even come together  as a class. No, you have to lawyer up individually. You have to get  ready to fight in some room that has been set aside in which the for- profit school and the Department of Education are going to argue  against you.   Is that what we want to say to these students who have been through  bad college experiences and want to get on with their lives, who found  out that these credit hours from these for-profit colleges didn't  transfer anywhere, and who found out the courses that were supposed to  lead to jobs didn't lead to jobs?   These students were misled by these schools, and these schools are  notorious for it. The question is this: Are we going to stand up for  the students, many of whom are veterans, or are we going to stand up  for the schools that have been affected by this?    I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I understand there is a discharge petition  at the desk for S.J. Res. 56 that has been signed by at least 30  Senators, which will cause the joint resolution to be discharged under  the Congressional Review Act; is that correct?    Mr. President, I move to proceed to Calendar No. 439,  S.J. Res. 56, a joint resolution providing for congressional  disapproval under chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, of the rule  submitted by the Department of Education relating to ``Borrower Defense  Institutional Accountability''.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    I announce that the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders)  and the Senator from Massachusetts (Ms. Warren) are necessarily absent.
