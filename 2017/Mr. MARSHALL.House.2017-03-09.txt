 Mr. Speaker, as a physician, I know firsthand ObamaCare  [[Page H1961]]  is in a death spiral. Now we are on a rescue mission. The President and  our replacement bill repeals the ObamaCare mandates and taxes, but  preserves three important protections:   One, we don't allow denying coverage or charging patients more with  preexisting conditions.   Two, we don't allow insurers to charge women more for being women.   Three, we allow children to stay on their parents' plan until age 26.   Going forward, we bend the cost curve downward by decentralizing  health care, promoting competition, and expanding HSAs. We make health  care more affordable by providing tax credits, creating value pools,  and more judiciously redirecting Medicaid dollars back to those who  need it most: children, elderly, and those with disabilities.                            ____________________
