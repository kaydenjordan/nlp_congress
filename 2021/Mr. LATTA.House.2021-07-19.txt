 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3119, the Energy Emergency  Leadership Act.   This bill, sponsored by Representatives Rush and Walberg, has strong  bipartisan support, and passed on suspension last Congress.   The bill is necessary to strengthen the Department of Energy's  important energy emergency mission.   It does so by requiring that the well-established energy emergency  and cybersecurity functions at DOE are organized under the leadership  of an assistant secretary confirmed by the Senate.   Three-and-one-half years ago, Secretary of Energy Perry recognized  the importance of elevating this position within the Department.   He established an assistant secretary-led office, the Office of  Cybersecurity, Energy Security, and Emergency Response, which proved  its worth in various situations over the past 2 years, including  assistance relating to hurricanes and the recent Colonial Pipeline  ransomware attack.   This bill amends the Department of Energy Organization Act to  establish in law this assistant secretary level of leadership of DOE's  emergency response and cybersecurity functions.   This bill will ensure the Department has the focused and accountable  leadership to protect the public more fully  [[Page H3639]]  from fuel and electricity supply disruptions against all hazards,  natural or man-made, including emerging threats from our foreign  adversaries to the Nation's electric grid.   The bill has been drafted to ensure the Department carries out its  responsibility in coordination with other agencies by improving  coordination across the Department; ensuring more effective interagency  collaborations; and increasing accountability to Congress.   Establishing accountable leadership of this DOE mission is an  important step in the face of increased threats, vulnerabilities, and  interdependencies of energy infrastructure and end-use systems.   Protecting energy security requires defense in depth.   This means a strong energy sector, strong state capabilities, and  ensuring sector agencies, like the Department of Energy, have the tools  and accountable leadership they need to respond to energy emergencies.   A vote for H.R. 3119 is a vote for ensuring accountable DOE  leadership over energy emergencies for the benefit of public safety and  welfare and for stronger cybersecurity protections and energy systems.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Walberg), one of the coleads on this legislation.                                time  1415     Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I yield myself  such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I again thank Representative Walberg and Representative    Bobby Rush for their work on this very important legislation because,  again, it is going to ensure that the Department of Energy has the  focus and the accountable leadership to more fully protect the public  from any electricity fuel supply disruptions against all hazards-- natural or manmade--including emerging threats from our foreign  adversaries to our Nation's electric grid.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2931, the first of two  grid security bills I have worked closely on with my good friend and  colleague, the gentleman from California (Mr. McNerney) over the last  several Congresses.   The goal of these two bills is to improve the resiliency of our  Nation's energy grid against cyberattacks. Since the House last  considered these bills on the floor, our country has experienced a new  wave of cyberattacks on our critical infrastructure.   On December 13, 2020, the cybersecurity firm, FireEye, published  research that a malicious actor was exploiting a supply chain  vulnerability in SolarWinds products to hack into government and  private sector information technology networks.   On May 8 of this year, the Colonial Pipeline Company announced that  it was forced to halt its pipeline operation due to a ransomware  attack, which disrupted critical supplies of gasoline and other refined  products throughout the Southeast and the East Coast.   Cyberattacks on our critical infrastructure will only continue to  grow in both size and severity and Congress must take a stand. H.R.  2931, the Enhancing Grid Security Through Public-Private Partnerships  Act, will facilitate and encourage public-private partnerships in order  to improve the cybersecurity of electric utilities.   Specifically, it would develop and provide for voluntary  implementation of maturity models, self-assessments, and auditing  methods for assessing the physical security and cybersecurity of  electric utilities.   H.R. 2931 would provide training and technical assistance to electric  utilities to address and mitigate cybersecurity supply chain management  risks and increase opportunities for sharing best practices and data  collection within the electric sector.   Finally, this legislation will require the Secretary of Energy to  submit a report to Congress that assesses priorities, policies,  procedures, actions, and implementations of electricity distribution  systems to address threats to and vulnerabilities of such electricity  distribution systems. We cannot allow criminal cyber behavior to go  unchallenged. Both H.R. 2931 and H.R. 2928 will help in the fight  against cyber attacks.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Pallone, Chairman Rush, leaders Rodgers  and Upton for their efforts to advance these bills, and I encourage all  my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on final passage.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, again, from the recent attacks that we have  had across the country in the last year and a half, it shows the  importance of making sure that we are protected on the cybersecurity  front. And working with my good friend and colleague from California,  it has been so important that we get these two bills across the finish  line today.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members today to support H.R. 2931, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2928, the Cyber Sense  Act, which is the second of two grid security bills that I have  introduced and, again, worked closely on with my good friend and  colleague, the gentleman from California (Mr. McNerney).   This bipartisan legislation will establish a testing process under a  newly established voluntary Cyber Sense program to test the  cybersecurity of products and technologies intended for use in the  bulk-power system, including products relating to industrial control  systems and operational technologies, such as supervisory control and  data acquisition systems.   It would provide technical assistance to electric utilities, product  manufacturers, and other electricity sector stakeholders to develop  solutions to mitigate identified cybersecurity vulnerabilities in  products and technologies tested under the Cyber Sense program.   H.R. 2928 would also develop guidance for electric utilities for  procurement of products and technologies and consider incentives to  encourage the use of analysis and results of testing under the program  in the design of products and technologies for use in the bulk-power  system.   The SolarWinds attack exposed a vulnerability in our supply chains  that  [[Page H3642]]  should serve as a wake-up call to the energy sector. Similar attacks on  products used in grid operators' IT networks could go undetected and,  when exposed, result in the costly process of disabling and removing  such products from operation.   Having a program that would allow for the testing of a product's  cybersecurity would help grid operators share information and maintain  coordination with the Federal Government to keep pace with evolving  cybersecurity threats. H.R. 2928 would accomplish these goals.   Again, I want to thank Chairman Pallone, Chairman Rush, Leader  Rodgers, and Leader Upton for their support. I call on my colleagues to  support this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no other speakers, and I am ready to  close.   Mr. Speaker, again, as the gentleman from California mentioned about  the ongoing cyberattacks we have had in this country, it is absolutely  essential that we get this bill across the finish line. H.R. 2928 is  going to help accomplish these goals and protect our grid out there.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1250, the Emergency  Reporting Act, that was introduced by Representatives Matsui,  Bilirakis, Eshoo, Thompson, and Huffman.   Today's legislation will allow 911 centers across the country to have  access to confidential information on potential 911 outages, subject to  appropriate safeguards.   In times of disaster, 911 public safety answering points do not  always know that 911 calls may not be going through. The Federal  Communications Commission, the FCC, currently collects information on  the status of communications infrastructure and communications network  outage information. They make that information available to the  Department of Homeland Security to coordinate overall emergency  response efforts within a State between State and local first  responders.   Given the sensitive nature of this data to both national security and  commercial competitiveness, this information is confidential. However,  as first responders work to ensure the 911 system can seamlessly get  back online and route calls to the neighboring call centers, access to  this confidential information is important.   This bill would help make timely outage information available to help  first responders on the ground restore service as quickly as possible.   The bill also requires the FCC to hold a field hearing in areas in  which the Commission's Disaster Information Reporting System, DIRS, is  activated for more than 7 days and to provide an initial and final  report on the status of communication networks.   The FCC only activates the DIRS system for significant natural  disasters, such as major hurricanes or wildfires, and the bill limits  these types of reports to only areas where damage was significant and  sustained.   This is an important bill to the resiliency of public safety  networks, and I urge my colleagues to support the measure.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this bill is, again, a very important piece of  legislation that has come out of the Energy and Commerce Committee. It  is important to make sure that we do have that resiliency out there for  our 911 system, which is so important to that person picking up that  phone call but also who is receiving it on the other end.   Mr. Speaker, I ask the House to pass the legislation, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1754, the MEDIA  Diversity Act, introduced by my colleague from Missouri, Representative  Long. This legislation represents another step forward to uplift  minority voices and promote diversity in the media marketplace.   I understand how important it is to serve communities with local  programming that accurately reflects a community's population. I have  also seen the media industry make great strides to promote diversity  and create new content to appeal to the communities they serve by  establishing programs and initiatives to promote opportunities for  women, minorities, veterans, elderly, and other socially disadvantaged  individuals to participate in the media marketplace.   Of course, the media industry is only one small part of a vast  communications marketplace that encompasses a large variety of  organizations, including mobile wireless providers, online video  distributors, fixed broadband providers, and so on.   It is also important to keep in mind that there are new entrants in  the tech industry who are providing additional opportunities for  minorities, women, veterans, and underrepresented groups who might not  have been heard before to make their voices heard.   Nonetheless, there is still work to do to make sure that those  previously unheard voices and underserved communities are represented  in traditional media and all other areas of the large communications  marketplace, and this legislation will help.   I am glad to support this piece of bipartisan legislation that will  allow the Federal Communications Commission to evaluate the market  barriers socially disadvantaged individuals face in the communications  marketplace as a whole.   In closing, Mr. Speaker, again, I urge all Members to support this  piece of legislation. It is very important. It was introduced by our  colleague, Mr. Long from Missouri.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 277, a resolution  introduced by our colleague, Mrs. Demings.   This resolution reaffirms the commitment by Congress to work with  media entities and diverse stakeholders to find common ground solutions  to eliminate barriers to expanding diversity in our media. While  today's resolution focuses specifically on broadcast stations, this  problem is not unique to one segment of the industry, but to their  cable and digital streaming competitors in the marketplace as well.   I appreciate the many steps that the broadcast and cable industries  have taken to not only recognize these barriers, but the many programs  and initiatives they have put in place to promote opportunities for  women, minorities, and veterans. However, data shows we have some room  for improvement.   While the House is considering this resolution today, it is my hope  that we can work together in a bipartisan manner to address the  inequality that this resolution seeks to address. Republicans on the  Energy and Commerce Committee have put forward solutions to uplift  minority voices and promote media diversity that can breathe life into  this resolution before us today.   Today, we are also considering H.R. 1754, the MEDIA Diversity Act,  sponsored by Mr. Long, which would help us better understand the market  and regulatory barriers for socially disadvantaged individuals to enter  and compete in the marketplace so we can make informed policy  decisions.   We have also worked with advocates and industry alike as we try and  find consensus on legislation to establish the long-sought-after  broadcast incubator program to help increase the number of minority- owned broadcast stations.   Last Congress, Republicans introduced the Broadcast Diversity in  Leadership Act, which would incentivize large, established broadcasters  to work with aspiring broadcasters to break down barriers to capital  and provide mentorship and experience to new minority entrants to  ensure their longstanding success in serving their local communities.   While the Supreme Court has recently reinstated the Republican-led  pilot program, Congress should continue working to ensure it is  expanded and made permanent with improved safeguards. We urge the  majority to continue working with us on these important issues.   With the passage of this resolution, we are affirming our commitment  to work toward common ground solutions, and Republicans stand ready to  work across the aisle to turn our common ground solutions into law.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers.  [[Page H3646]]    In closing, Mr. Speaker, I urge support of H. Res. 277, I ask the  House for its passage today, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support H.R. 3003, the Promoting United  States Wireless Leadership Act.   Our communications networks are a critically important asset for  facilitating domestic and international commerce. For decades, the U.S.  has led the development of wireless technology with like-minded  nations. With the deployment of the next-generation wireless technology  5G, which is expected to skyrocket in the coming years and months, we  must continue to focus on bolstering the foundational elements to make  sure the United States continues to lead on future technological  advances.   As these standards are set in global, industry-led standards bodies,  we must enhance participation by U.S. companies and remain vigilant  that bad actors don't game the system for their own economic and  national security interests.   To keep accountability and ensure proper transparency, we must ensure  participation by trusted like-minded partners. The National  Telecommunications and Information Administration, NTIA, plays a  central role in these efforts as the executive branch agency with  technical expertise on wireless innovation. It has decades of  experience working with industry and other stakeholders to develop  these technical standards globally. I would also like to thank the  dedicated career staff who worked tirelessly to advance U.S. global  wireless leadership.   As we move into the next decade, it is critical that we continue to  enhance participation in critical standards-setting bodies and preserve  U.S. wireless leadership.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this piece of  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support H.R.  3003, again a very important piece in our infrastructure in this  country, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak on H.R. 678, the PHONE Act. This  legislation will ensure that Americans whose homes are lost during a  fire or other natural disaster do not have to worry about losing their  home phone numbers.   As we have seen from the horrific fires over the last several years,  they destroy everything in their path. No matter how resilient a home  or communications tower may be, you cannot regulate your way out of a  fire's burning path.   Today, when a natural disaster strikes, the Federal Emergency  Management Agency, FEMA, is activated to provide housing assistance and  other resources to respond to the crisis at hand. If your home is  completely burned to the ground, the last thing that you should have to  worry about is if your home phone number will be available when you  return.   Thankfully, the Federal Communications Commission, FCC, can prevent  that from happening. The FCC can waive rules and regulations that  require landline phone numbers to return to the pool of available  numbers when a home is completely destroyed by a natural disaster. This  bill codifies that process, but we still must be cautious. This type of  relief should only apply to areas where significant physical damage has  occurred to render a home uninhabitable, as is the objective of the  bill.   It is FEMA's role to determine which households have actually  sustained damage in an affected county, which this bill does not  codify, and we hope can be addressed as it moves through the process.  As the experts on the ground, we should defer to their assessment  before these regulations go into effect.   While it may be easy to grab a cell phone upon evacuating, landlines  cannot be brought on the go. For many people, especially our seniors,  they rely on their landline phone number to stay connected to family,  their doctor, and others during such a trying time in their life.  During a traumatic event, one less thing they should not have to worry  about is losing their home phone number.   I ask for support of this measure moving forward, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close. I support H.R. 678  moving forward, and I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1515     Will the gentleman yield?    Mr. Speaker, I want to congratulate Jeff on his future  endeavors.   Our staffs do so much for us. As the chairman was speaking, I was  thinking that the hours that they put in aren't ever recognized,  including the work over the weekends. I know when I have talked to our  committee staff, especially when we have worked on pieces of  legislation the last several Congresses, with the amount of work that  goes into it, we have to thank our staff.   For all his years of service here and for his future endeavors, I  give him my best wishes.
