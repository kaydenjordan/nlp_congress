 Mr. Speaker, it is an honor and a  privilege to serve the constituents of the Second Congressional  District of West Virginia for a second term.   As we begin the 115th session of Congress, my top legislative  priorities are rolling back anti-coal regulations that have been  imposed by President Obama's administration over the last 8 years;  fighting the drug epidemic; repealing ObamaCare and making health care  more affordable and accessible; and investing in our roads, bridges,  airports, and other key infrastructure.   West Virginia needs good-paying jobs. President Obama has spent the  last 8 years waging a war on coal on our country. During this session  of Congress, we must continue to work together to promote an all-of- the-above energy strategy that conserves our natural resources,  cultivates our economy and jobs, and promotes American energy  independence.   One of our Nation's and our States' greatest natural resources is our  fossil fuel. Fossil fuel, including coal, supplies around 85 percent of  our Nation's energy. West Virginia produces about 15 percent of that  total.   Under the outgoing administration, we have seen our West Virginia  energy industries come under attack even though we have made  significant strides in recent years to improve the quality of our air,  land, and water. By rolling back harmful regulations like the so-called  stream protection rule, we can save 30,000 jobs in the Appalachian  region right now. That is why last year I introduced my bill, the  Supporting Transparent Regulatory and Environmental Actions in Mining  Act, also known as the STREAM Act. My bill was passed by the House last  year with bipartisan support, and I will continue to fight to stop this  outrageous rule from taking effect.   Another top priority for this Congress must be stopping the drug  epidemic in our country. Drug abuse ravages our communities, rips  families apart, and further ruptures our State's already-ailing  economy. This issue is above party politics. It is a plague that both  parties must come together to solve. There is no magical solution to  this epidemic. We need local, State, and Federal officials to work  together to effectively and efficiently fight back.   This past Congress I worked with Members on both sides of the aisle  to find commonsense solutions to fight back against this scourge. That  is why I introduced H.R. 4499, the Promoting Responsible Opioid  Prescribing Act. This bipartisan bill struck out a harmful provision of  ObamaCare that places unnecessary pressure on doctors and hospitals to  prescribe narcotic pain medicine. I am proud to say that the Department  of Health and Human Services announced that they changed their policy  and implemented my bill. This change in policy is an important part of  the fight against opioid abuse. I will remain steadfast in my efforts  to fight this epidemic.   Another important way to fight back against the drug epidemic is by  making health care more accessible and affordable. The first step to do  this is to repeal ObamaCare.   Healthcare costs are on the rise because ObamaCare adds burdensome  taxes, regulations, and mandates onto American consumers. The limited  choice in health insurance plans is harming families and their budgets.  ObamaCare will kill 2.5 million jobs in 10 years. It has continued to  raise health insurance costs and has placed the Federal Government in  between patients and their doctors.   Research done by the National Center for Policy Analysis found that  average monthly premium costs increased for almost everyone regardless  of their age, race, or gender after ObamaCare was implemented.   As a Republican in Congress, I want to ensure that everyone has  access to health care, but I want it to be quality health care that  people choose for themselves. That is why Republicans have come up with  a plan that we call A Better Way. Our plan recognizes that people  deserve more patient-centered care, not more bureaucracy. That means  more choices, not more mandates.   The A Better Way plan offers many improvements that will help West  Virginia's Second Congressional District, including commonsense reforms  such as allowing health insurance sales across State lines. Simple  changes like these will lower costs and increase choice for Americans.   Finally, it is imperative to pass bills that invest in our Nation's  deteriorating infrastructure. President-elect Trump has said that  updating our Nation's infrastructure is a top priority for his  administration.                                time  1830    The Federal Highway Administration has classified more than 142,000  bridges as either ``structurally deficient'' or ``functionally  obsolete.'' Also from the Federal Highway Administration, traffic  delays cost the U.S. economy more than $50 billion annually. Most major  roads are rated as ``less than good condition.''   Improvement to other Nation's infrastructure would greatly benefit  West Virginia, which needs road, bridge and rail repairs. We are also  in need of water, sewer, and power line repairs.   By improving the transportation, our country will open the  opportunity for job growth and expansion. I look forward to working  with my colleagues in the House and the Senate, as well as the new  administration, to make sure that these legislative priorities take  hold.
