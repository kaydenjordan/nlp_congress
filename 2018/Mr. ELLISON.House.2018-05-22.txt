 Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the gentleman for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this FIRST STEP  Act. I spent 17 years of my life representing people accused of crimes.                                time  1315    Some of them are people whom I will never forget. One is a woman  named Daniella. She had some prior misdemeanor offenses and was charged  with possession of crack cocaine. She was looking at a sentence of  about 60 months, based on the amount. She had a small child. There were  no weapons involved.   The prosecutors told her: If you tell on your boyfriend, we will take  you to State court. If you don't, we are taking you to Federal court.   They took her to Federal court. And try as I did, she ended up  getting 60 months of prison. She got taken away from her child. I  remember the screams of that little boy as they walked his mother into  custody.   I cannot imagine asking her to stay in prison one day longer than she  needed to. I cannot imagine not giving every opportunity to improve her  life and her skills.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote, and I do so with a lot of  enthusiasm today.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding time  to me.   Mr. Speaker, in just about an hour or so, Congress will vote to roll  back some of the rules for the biggest banks in the country.   Think about that for a minute. Just 10 years after the big banks  crashed the economy, Senate Republicans and some Democrats want to roll  back the rules that were put in place to prevent the next crash.    Some of my colleagues may have forgotten about the bad, bad days of  that crash in 2008, but I sure have not. Millions of people lost their  homes. In fact, 1 in 54 homes was in foreclosure. $2.6 trillion, with a  T, vanished from people's retirement accounts.   Think about that for a moment. Why on Earth would we go back there?   And let me remind everyone here: Before this crash, we heard all this  talk about progrowth. Before the big crash, they said we want to allow  commercial banks and investment banks and insurance companies just to  all conglomerate together. We want to allow banks to use the money of  their depositors to make gambling decisions on Wall Street. We are  going to sell people no-doc, low-doc loans, and we are going to let the  seller get a yield spread premium for steering people to high-cost  loans; and we are going to let them securitize all of it, and if they  lose their money, it is okay because we are going to let them buy  credit default swaps, which is insurance, so that the American people  lose but the big banks and the insurance companies never do.    Mr. Speaker, all this progrowth talk is a movie that we  have seen before. Remember Alan Greenspan telling all us: Let them do  what they want to do. It doesn't matter. You can't interfere with the  market. The market has all the answers.   We found out who had the answers when it came to bailing out Wall  Street. It was the American people.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to not vote for this because it  will be the American people who pay, not to mention people who live in  manufactured homes who are going to be allowed to be charged more for  their home choices, and it will open the door to racial discrimination  which has been proved time and time again. This bill is bad. Vote  ``no.''                                time  1445
