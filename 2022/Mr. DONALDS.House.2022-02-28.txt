 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of this bill, which would name a  post office in New York after Indiana Hunt-Martin.   Mrs. Hunt-Martin was born in Uvalda, Georgia, during a time when  opportunities for Black Americans were very limited. Her family moved  to western New York, where she was one of two Black students at Niagara  Falls High School.   In 1944, Mrs. Hunt-Martin joined the only all-African-American  Women's Army Corps, the 6888th Central Postal Directory Battalion,  known as the Six Triple Eight.   She was then chosen to serve overseas in England, where she worked  with fellow soldiers under harsh and challenging workspace conditions.   In only 3 months, they cleared a 2-year backlog of mail destined for  nearly 7 million members of the United States military and others  serving in the European theater. This was certainly an important  contribution to  [[Page H1170]]  the war effort, which the Six Triple Eight recognized with the motto:  ``No mail, low morale.''   In 1946, Mrs. Hunt-Martin returned to the United States and received  an honorable discharge. She then worked at the United States Department  of Labor for 41 years. During this service, she met her husband and had  a daughter, Janice Martin.    After her service to the Nation, Mrs. Hunt-Martin became an active  member of several veterans organizations and mentored young Black women  who served in the military.   Sadly, on September 21, 2020, Indiana Hunt-Martin passed away.   I encourage my colleagues to support this bill to honor Indiana Hunt- Martin's exemplary life of service.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
