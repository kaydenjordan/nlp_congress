 Mr. Speaker, 10 months into the Biden administration and  crisis defines this Presidency.   Since President Biden took office, we have faced crisis after crisis,  not the least of which is at our southern border. Right now, the United  States is experiencing the highest number of attempted illegal border  crossings in 21 years. Some 1.7 million people were apprehended  attempting to enter the U.S. illegally in fiscal year 2021, ending  September 30, which is a new record. Over 164,300 attempted to cross  just in October. This is 128 percent increase from last October.   Since March 20, 95,000 illegal immigrants were released with notices  to report on their honor. President Biden recently announced a hotly  debated approach to limiting the spread of COVID-19, mandating  vaccinations for Federal workers, Federal contract workers, healthcare  workers, and anyone who works for a private business with over 100  employees. But take a guess as to who is not included in this wide- spread vaccine mandate--illegal immigrants.   While President Biden blames American citizens for the increase in  COVID cases, he refuses to call out the record number of illegal  immigrants entering the United States from COVID hotspots around the  world who are potentially contributing to the spread of new and  dangerous variants of the virus, like the delta, lambda, and mu  strains.   On September 20, when White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki was asked  about this double standard, she is quoted as saying, illegal immigrants  didn't need to comply because ``they are not intending to stay.'' What  a laughable statement.   Once again, we are seeing the Biden administration choosing to put  the interests of illegal immigrants above the interests of the American  people. Why is President Biden allowing this ever-growing burden on the  already strained resources of this country to continue unabated?   Our southern border is an ongoing, full-blown catastrophe and it  should be treated as one. That is why I am calling on President Biden  to finally address this historic disaster of his own making and at  least make a good-faith effort to stem the flow of illegal immigration,  dangerous illicit drugs, and human trafficking in this country. And  while he is at it, to implement stricter, more comprehensive and more  effective COVID protections at our southern border.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague from Louisiana for the  opportunity to address the House today.   This week, President Biden signed into law the $1.2 trillion  Infrastructure and Investment Jobs Act, which focuses more on pushing  Democrats' far-left socialist policies than on America's crumbling  infrastructure needs.   Madam Speaker, the signing of this bill comes on the heels of  Democrats' reckless taxing-and-spending spree and senseless policies  that have created an economic crisis of monumental proportions.   As the Biden administration takes a victory lap, the American people  are in no mood to celebrate. Inflation is at a 30-year high as prices  on everything are more now than they were just 1 year ago. Gas is up 49  percent; beef is up 20 percent; home heating bills are up 28.1 percent.   Under the Biden administration, working families are getting crushed.  Increased costs at the grocery store and the gas pump and higher home  heating bills are squeezing Americans dry. Skyrocketing inflation is  driving down real wages for hardworking middle-class families and  making it more difficult for those living on fixed budgets to make ends  meet.   Instead of addressing the root cause of inflation--which, by the way  and for the Record, is largely caused by out-of-control government  spending--House Democrats are continuing to push their sweeping $1.75  trillion build back broke act.   This package would once again hand out cash to households and create  new paid leave benefits with no expectation of work. However, as we all  know, an engaged workforce is key to invigorating economic recovery and  slowing inflation. Make no mistake, wasteful and increased spending by  Democrats, much of which is being funded by even more borrowed money,  won't slow inflation; it will supercharge it.   Madam Speaker, I strongly urge President Biden and Democrats in  Congress to reconsider the devastating economic consequences they are  proposing to enact.
