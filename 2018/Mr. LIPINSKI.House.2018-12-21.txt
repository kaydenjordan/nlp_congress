 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of this legislation to establish  a commemorative program to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the end of  World War II in Europe.   This was fundamentally a war for freedom and human rights. The  victory of the Allies in the war and the contributions of America's  Armed Forces must never be forgotten. That is why commemorating this  anniversary should be done in an extraordinary way.   Commemorating this critical event in history will also allow us to  recognize our World War II veterans who are still living. We must  listen and learn from their stories while we are still able.   I fear that knowledge of history is continuing to decline in our  Nation. We must do all we can to make sure Americans never forget the  lessons of World War II and all the sacrifices that were made to  preserve freedom in the world.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this important bill so  we can preserve the memory of the American effort in World War II.   I want to thank Mr. Graves for introducing this legislation, which is  very important for remembering World War II and commemorating it on its  75th anniversary. I thank him for his work. I wish him a merry  Christmas and look forward to working with him next Congress.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
