 Mr. President, I rise to join Chairman Inhofe in support of  the fiscal year 2020 Defense authorization bill. I thank the chairman  for his great bipartisan leadership, thoughtful, sensible, and  delivering what I think is an excellent piece of legislation.   It was based on thorough hearings, discussions, and debate on both  sides of the aisle, and it came out of the committee with strong  bipartisan support. I hope it enjoys that support on final passage.   As the chairman indicated, the bill provides for many different  aspects that are necessary to our national defense. It provides a pay  raise for the men and women of our Armed Forces who do so much for us.  It includes over 30 provisions to address the privatized military  housing crisis. It authorizes military construction in almost every  State in this country. It provides funding and authorities for our  military personnel on the frontlines and for those who are back in the  United States building the ships and the tanks and advancing the  technologies we need for the future fight.   This bill also contains numerous amendments from many of my  colleagues, again, on both sides of the aisle, on other issues of great  importance, such as the Intelligence Authorization Act, the  authorization of the Maritime Administration, and provisions addressing  the fentanyl crisis and the dangers of PFOS-PFAS in our water.   There are numerous provisions here that go beyond the narrow  definition of the defense establishment. They are bipartisan, and they  are strongly supported by both sides of the aisle.   Again, let me thank Senator Inhofe for his leadership. It made a  great difference in terms of his approach to this important  legislation.   Finally, I would like to thank the committee staff. Particularly, I  would like to thank the majority staff and their staff director, John  Bonsell. He did a superb job--they did. ``Diligence,''  ``professionalism,'' and ``bipartisanship'' were the watchwords of  their efforts. I thank them for that.   Let me thank my staff. In particular, Jody Bennett, Carolyn Chuhta,  Jon Clark, Jonathan Epstein, Jorie Feldman, Creighton Greene, Ozge  Guzelsu, Gary Leeling, Kirk McConnell, Maggie McNamara, Bill Monahan,  Mike Noblet, John Quirk, Arun Seraphin, Fiona Tomlin, and my staff  director, Elizabeth King, who, with John Bonsell, did a superb job.   Let me thank the floor staff who have helped us over the last few  days immensely.   I urge all of my colleagues to join the chairman and me in supporting  this excellent legislation.   I yield the floor.                          Vote on Amendment No. 764     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the escalating  tensions between the United States and Iran, my concern about the  administration's current approach--a path that I am worried will lead  us to war--and my support for the Udall amendment to the NDAA, which  will be voted on tomorrow.   I believe that diplomatic efforts, in concert with our international  partners, should be pursued immediately to avoid another unnecessary  armed conflict in the Middle East.   Let me be clear. Iran is a dangerous and destabilizing force in the  region. It supports terrorist proxies and meddles in the internal  affairs of other states. Iran continues to pursue ballistic missile  capabilities in violation of international norms and abuses the rights  of its own people. Unfortunately, the administration's chosen course of  action with respect to Iran has isolated the United States from the  international community and made it more difficult to collectively  address these issues.   The administration's actions and rhetoric related to Iran have  created a credibility deficit. This is a fast-changing and dangerous  situation, and it is clear that there is not a consensus within the  international community with respect to Iran's plans and intentions.   Given these disconnects, it is imperative for the administration to  provide Congress with current, unvarnished intelligence so that we may  reach substantiated conclusions.   Taking a step back, it is important to recount the actions that have  precipitated the current state of affairs. Current tensions are an  entirely predictable outcome of the administration's ill-conceived  approach to Iran.  [[Page S4605]]  Despite then-Candidate Trump's campaign rhetoric, I and others hoped  that he would heed the advice of the advisers with respect to the Iran  nuclear agreement, also known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of  Action, or the JCPOA.   For example, despite personal concerns about the JCPOA before it was  signed, former Secretary of Defense Mattis told the Armed Services  Committee at his confirmation hearing that ``when America gives her  word, we have to live up to it and work with our allies.''   In October 2017, Secretary Mattis told the Armed Services Committee  that he believed it was in our national interest to remain in the  JCPOA. General Dunford, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, echoed  these sentiments at the time and cautioned that, in his words, ``the  U.S. will incur damage vis-a-vis our allies if we unilaterally withdraw  from the JCPOA. Our allies will be less likely to cooperate with us on  future military action to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon  and less likely to cooperate with us on countering other destabilizing  aspects of Iranian behavior that threaten our collective interests.''   The administration should have sought to work with the international  community to address the challenges posed by Iran by building upon the  foundation of the JCPOA rather than squandering that opportunity in  favor of ``putting Iran on notice'' and other inflammatory rhetoric.   Just over a year ago, President Trump made the disastrous decision to  unilaterally withdraw the United States from the JCPOA and reimpose  nuclear-related sanctions, in violation of previous U.S. commitments  under the deal. Since withdrawing from the deal, the Trump  administration has taken a series of additional escalatory actions,  including the imposition of new sanctions on various aspects of the  Iranian economy; cancellation of waivers that previously allowed  importation of Iranian oil by China, India, Japan, South Korea, and  Turkey; and the designation of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps-- often referred to as the IRGC--as a foreign terrorist organization.   The designation of a foreign government entity as a foreign terrorist  organization was unprecedented, and it is not clear what purpose it  served other than to unnecessarily raise tensions with Iran. As I  learned during a recent visit to Iraq and Afghanistan, the IRGC  designation has significantly complicated our relationships with  foreign partners who described the action as provocative and  destabilizing.   While the JCPOA was not a perfect deal, it was a necessary deal. It  is important to remember that when the JCPOA was signed, Iran's  ``breakout'' timeline--the amount of time Iran would need to produce  enough fissile material for a nuclear weapon--was only 2 to 3 months.  Even by the most conservative estimates, the JCPOA stretched that  timeline to more than a year.   By all accounts, the JCPOA has worked as intended. The JCPOA commits  Iran to never seeking to develop or acquire a nuclear weapon and  effectively cuts off all pathways for Iran to achieve a nuclear weapon  until at least 2030. The agreement dramatically reduced Iran's  stockpile of enriched uranium and the number of installed centrifuges.  It also prevented Iran from producing weapons-grade plutonium and has  subjected Iran to the most intrusive monitoring regime in the world to  ensure it is living up to its commitments.   The JCPOA was appropriately built upon the concept of ``distrust and  verify,'' and I support efforts by our European partners, as well as  Russia and China, to preserve the JCPOA despite challenges the Trump  administration has put in their way.   According to General Dunford, in the absence of the JCPOA, Iran would  likely resume its nuclear weapons program, and, in his words, ``a  nuclear-armed Iran would likely be more aggressive in its actions and  more dangerous in its consequences.''   Unfortunately, the administration's withdrawal from the agreement and  reimposition of sanctions has left us isolated from our allies and  partners while emboldening the hardliners in Iran.   In May of last year, subsequent to the decision to withdraw from the  JCPOA, Secretary of State Pompeo articulated a set of 12 ``demands''  and indicated that ``major changes'' would need to be made by Iran  before sanctions relief would be provided. The administration has sent  mixed messages on whether its demands should be viewed as a set of  preconditions for discussions on sanctions relief. The demands outlined  by Secretary Pompeo are widely viewed as maximalist and leave little  room for negotiation, especially given that the administration has  already reneged on previous diplomatic commitments related to Iran's  nuclear program.   Without greater certainty by the administration on what specific  actions would need to be taken by Iran to relieve U.S. economic  pressure, I fear that Iran has little incentive to engage in  negotiations.   Indeed, the administration has followed that initial set of 12  demands with a succession of orchestrated steps to force Iran into an  ever-smaller corner that only serves to increase the odds of  miscalculation and reduce diplomatic opportunities. The economic  sanctions by the United States have left the Iranian economy reeling,  with its gross domestic product shrinking by 5 percent and  the inflation rate rising by 50 percent.    As part of this so-called ``Maximum Pressure'' campaign, the  administration has just announced personal sanctions against Supreme  Leader Ali Khamenei and other Iranian leadership. The Iranians have  responded by indicating that these sanctions mean ``the permanent  closure of the doors of diplomacy.''   Rather than modifying its behavior, Iran has responded to these  demands and subsequent escalatory actions by increasing its malign  activities in the region, including in Yemen and Syria, and announcing  that it would stop complying with certain aspects of the JCPOA. If Iran  follows through on threats to completely withdraw from the JCPOA and  resume nuclear weapons development activities, the United States and  the international community will be in a much less unified and  therefore weaker negotiating position than we had leading up to the  JCPOA.   As I assess the current state of affairs, I see four potential  outcomes of the current approach being pursued by the administration.   First, Iran could bend to the will of the administration and announce  its compliance with the so-called 12 demands laid out by Secretary  Pompeo. However, Iran has a long history of struggle against outside  forces. A notable example is the Iran-Iraq war of the 1980s.  Additionally, Iranian capitulation would likely threaten its top  priority of regime survival, so clearly this is an unrealistic outcome.   Second, Iran could remain in the JCPOA despite seeing little of the  economic benefits promised by the deal and hope that a future U.S.  administration would return to the agreement. Iran's recent  announcement that it would stop complying with aspects of the JCPOA is  a signal that it views the current arrangement as unsustainable and is  willing to abandon the JCPOA completely if its economic situation does  not improve in the near term.   Third, Iran could agree to return to the negotiating table, seeking a  reduction in tensions and easing of sanctions. However, both the  administration and Iranian leaders have made clear that they are not  interested in such an approach.   In announcing the administration's strategy for Iran last May,  Secretary Pompeo stated that President Trump is ``ready, willing, and  able to negotiate a new deal'' but also made clear that ``we will not  renegotiate the JCPOA itself.''   On May 8, Iranian President Rouhani stated:         We are ready to negotiate, within the boundaries of JCPOA.       . . . It is not us who left the negotiation table.    These seem to be irreconcilable positions, especially after the  latest round of sanctions directed at the Iranian leadership.   Lastly and most significant, I believe, the current approach could  result in a military conflict between the United States and Iran. The  destruction of an American unmanned drone flying in international  airspace by a missile fired from Iran is an example of the potential  for widespread conflict. Only at the last minute did President  [[Page S4606]]  Trump call off a strike against the Iranian missile sites in  retaliation. He concluded correctly that such a strike would be  disproportionate. But the incident underscores the precarious position  we are in after months of the misguided ``maximum pressure'' campaign.   Iranian action, either directed by national leadership or mistakenly  taken by zealous supporters, could put us on an escalatory ladder of  strike and counterstrike that would involve the entire region from  Afghanistan to the Levant.   In addition and equally troubling is that an unarticulated goal of  this so-called ``Maximum Pressure'' campaign is to prompt Iran to leave  the JCPOA either officially or by gradually increasing its stock of  highly enriched uranium or other aspects of its nuclear program. This  could give advocates for a military strike on Iran increased leverage.  Again, such a strike, even targeted to nuclear facilities, would likely  prompt a regional asymmetric response by Iran, with significant  military as well as economic consequences.   Like all of my colleagues, I am deeply concerned about Iranian  threats to U.S. personnel facilities in the Middle East. U.S. forces  have the unquestioned and inherent right to defend themselves, but  absent an Iranian directed or sponsored attack or the imminent threat  of such an attack on U.S. personnel facilities or key strategic  interests, military actions should be pursued only as a last resort and  as part of an international coalition, which the administration has so  far failed to bring together.   I will be supporting the amendment offered by Senator Udall because  it would make clear that any offensive military action against Iran  must be consistent with domestic and international law, including a  specific authorization for the use of military force, or an AUMF,  provided by Congress.   In this context, the President's demonstrated willingness not just to  bend the facts but to indulge, in certain cases, in fabrications is  particularly concerning and unacceptable when it may come to deploying  our troops into harm's way. Congress has the responsibility to demand  and, if necessary, challenge the basis for unsupported assertions of  Iranian aggression and provocation that could be used to take this  country to war.   Echoing one of the themes used in the Bush administration's  justification for the 2003 Iraq war, Secretary of State Pompeo  testified to the Senate in April that ``there's no doubt there is a  connection between the Islamic Republic of Iran and al Qaeda. Period.  Full stop.'' And he refused to rule out the use of the 2001 AUMF as a  means to conduct military action against Iran.   While Iran is a state sponsor of terror, I am not aware of compelling  evidence to suggest Iran or Iranian affiliated groups are an  ``associated force'' of al-Qaida for the purposes of the 2001 AUMF.   In fact, such an arrangement is hard to fathom, given the deep  religious and ideological differences between the Shia leadership of  Iran and the Sunni leadership of al-Qaida. The administration must come  to Congress if it seeks to pursue offensive military action.   Likewise, any consideration of military action against Iran must  fully account for the likely cost of such an engagement--in lives,  resources, potential negative impact on the global economy, disruption  of U.S. bilateral relationships, and other unintended consequences. The  administration must provide the American people with a clear-eyed  assessment of what those costs may be in advance of any contemplated  military engagement.   The Trump administration's escalatory attacks may soon place Iran in  an untenable position. As a result, Iran may seek to change the status  quo by initiating a limited military conflict with the United States,  thereby requiring the intervention of the international community. If  such a scenario comes to pass, our recent efforts to deter Iran through  the deployment of additional military capabilities to the region will  have failed, and even a limited conflict would be very difficult to  manage or to bring to a conclusion.   The President and others in the administration have consistently  downplayed the potential costs of conflict with Iran. In fact, just  yesterday, the President said that ``if something should happen [with  Iran], we're in a very strong position. It wouldn't last very long.''  The President's assessment is undercut by his own Director of National  Intelligence Dan Coats, who told Congress earlier this year:         Iran continues to develop and approve a range of new       military capabilities to target U.S. and allied military       assets in the region, including armed UAVs, ballistic       missiles, advanced naval mines, unmanned explosive boats,       submarines and advanced torpedoes, and antiship and land-      attack cruise missiles. Iran has the largest ballistic       missile force in the Middle East and can strike targets up to       2,000 kilometers from Iran's borders. Russia's delivery of       the SA-20c SAM system in 2016 has provided Iran with its most       advanced long-range air defense system.    In addition to the conventional military capabilities laid out by  Director Coats, Iran maintains a network of proxy forces throughout the  region, many of whom operate in close proximity to U.S. military  personnel in Iraq and Syria. They maintain the capability to conduct  lethal action against our forces and facilities without notice.   Recently retired commander of the U.S. Central Command, General  Votel, told the Armed Services Committee in February:         The Iranian regime masks its malign activities through       proxies and surrogates enabled by the Iran Threat Network in       Yemen, Syria, Iraq, and Lebanon. Iran is also attempting to       build ground lines of communication through Iraq and Syria       into Lebanon to support its proxy Hezbollah. Iran has gained       influence with Iraq's armed forces with the formalization of       Popular Mobilization Forces, and also exerted influence in       Lebanon, Iraq, and Yemen, oftentimes affecting established       sovereign governments.    The combination of Iran's known conventional and asymmetric  capabilities should dispel any notion that conflict with Iran would be  quick or could be won only through the use of U.S. air power. As former  Secretary of Defense Robert Gates reportedly said in a recent speech:  ``If you think the war in Iraq was hard, an attack on Iran would, in my  opinion, be a catastrophe.''   He continued: ``[Iranian] capacity to wage a series of terror attacks  across the Middle East aimed at us and our friends, and dramatically  worsen the situation in Iraq, Afghanistan, Lebanon, and elsewhere is  hard to overestimate.''   All of the competent military analysts I have engaged with believe  that we cannot conduct an effective land campaign in Iran, and an  extended air and sea campaign will undercut the priorities laid out in  the national defense strategy, which focuses not on the Middle East but  on Russia and China.   Absent the full mobilization of our Armed Forces and those of our  allies, ground operations in Iran are simply beyond our capacity. The  last ground war involving Iran, the Iran-Iraq war of the 1980s,  resulted in the death of nearly 1 million troops, the majority of whom  were Iranians who died fighting a superior Iraqi military during a  brutal and prolonged conflict. There is clearly no widespread U.S. or  international support for another such military engagement in the  Middle East.   Considering the costs associated with ground operations, a more  limited conflict involving a series of tit-for-tat actions is far more  likely, with Iran utilizing its asymmetric advantages and proxies in  response to U.S. precision and standoff strikes.   It is unlikely that U.S. deterrence could be quickly reestablished  under such a scenario, and Iran may use the time to restart and advance  its nuclear weapons efforts, thereby increasing its negotiating  leverage and also making the situation much more volatile.   War with Iran is not inevitable. To date, the administration has  tried to use every instrument of national power to get Iran to change  its behavior--except diplomacy and negotiations. The administration's  ill-conceived approach has not worked, and the time has come to try  real and sustained diplomacy, rather than relying on coercion.   I urge the President and those in the administration to take this  moment of high tension to engage with our allies and partners with the  goal of seeking a diplomatic solution to the current situation. In that  context and in that spirit, I will support the Udall amendment  tomorrow.   I yield the floor.
