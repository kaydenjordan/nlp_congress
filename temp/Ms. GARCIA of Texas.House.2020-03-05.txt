 Mr. Speaker, today I recognize Bill Balleza, a  KPRC 2 anchor, who, for nearly 50 years, has been a reliable source of  daily news for our community.   Bill has been seen on TV screens across our city for years, where he  reported on thousands of stories, did a weekly child segment from 1985  to 1995, and earned an Emmy Award for his reporting.   Not only has he served our community as a distinguished journalist  and anchor, but he is also a proud Vietnam veteran. He is a common  sight at the Veteran's Day celebration and parade every year.   We thank Bill for his service. In the days of fake news and attacks  on the media, he has always been above the fray and a trusted source.  We will miss seeing him on the TV screen when we tune into KPRC 2 for  the daily news.   For now, he should enjoy his retirement. He has earned it. And God  bless.                            ____________________
