 Madam President, I want to take a few moments to  discuss the brave men and women who serve in U.S. Immigration and  Customs Enforcement.   I had the privilege of visiting the ICE office in my hometown of  Louisville this past Friday and of meeting with these agents in person.   This is a Federal agency that was created following the attacks of  September 11, 2001. It is responsible for several key aspects of our  homeland security: enforcing our immigration laws, combating terrorism,  and preventing people and goods from moving illegally throughout our  country. Its record on these vital missions is staggering. In fiscal  year 2017, ICE recorded more than 105,000 arrests of aliens with known  criminal convictions on their records--nearly 4,600 convictions for  robbery, more than 3,700 for sexual assault, and more than 1,500 for  homicide.   We are talking about the men and women in law enforcement who  confront all of this in order to keep all of us safe. This is hardly a  controversial mission; it is essential. We are lucky these agents are  willing to serve. The Nation is better off for it. So I wanted to pay  these agents a visit in Louisville and thank them firsthand for their  work.   Recently, they have fallen into the crosshairs of some extremely  vocal, far-left special interest groups, groups that explicitly say-- now get this; this is what they say--that our Nation would be better  off with no borders and no immigration laws of any kind. That is what  these people advocate. They are slandering ICE agents. They are calling  the agency ``an unaccountable strike force executing a campaign of  ethnic cleansing'' and even ``a genuine threat to democracy.'' That is  what they are calling ICE agents. According to these leftwing groups,  the threat to democracy is not the violent criminals who are illegally  present in our country but, rather, the brave law enforcement officers  who volunteer to take them on.   Well, fringe political movements are nothing new. You can find a few  Americans who will argue almost any side of any issue. What is new-- what does get my attention--is when prominent, leading Democratic  politicians, including a number of our colleagues right here in the  Senate, adopt some of these extremist views wholesale and let the far- left talking points form the basis of their own policy positions.   The junior Senator from New York said recently that if Democrats  regain the House and Senate, the first thing they should do is ``get  rid of ICE.''   The senior Senator from Massachusetts pointed to ``replacing ICE'' as  the first priority of a top-to-bottom rebuild of America's immigration  system.   The mayor of New York City calls the agency ``no longer acceptable.''   A Member of the U.S. House of Representatives likened it to--get  this--``the Gestapo of the United States.''  [[Page S5464]]  The gestapo of the United States? I am really not sure where to begin  in responding to this foaming hysteria.   It is one thing for a few protesters and Socialist hecklers who want  open borders and the elimination of all immigration laws to adopt a  slogan as silly and ill-considered as ``abolish ICE,'' but it is  something else entirely when U.S. Senators are so eager to please these  leftwing extremists that they join that chorus--join in denigrating the  men and women of U.S. law enforcement. This is the moment we are in-- that of leading Democrats' taking cues from the open-borders Socialist  crowd and proposing to eliminate the very agency that enforces Federal  immigration laws within the interior of our country. Talk about a  political stunt.   The American people want nothing to do with these dangerous antics.  My neighbors and constituents in Kentucky certainly don't. So my fellow  Republicans and I will continue to proudly stand with ICE, stand with  the rule of law, and stand with all of the American families who would  rather have fewer drugs and less crime in the communities in which they  are raising their children.                            ____________________     Madam President, now on another matter, we learned  last week that second-quarter real GDP growth exceeded 4 percent. That  is the best quarterly growth rate in 4 years and one of the strongest  reports since the great recession.   Earlier this month, we learned that new claims for unemployment  insurance recently reached the lowest level since--listen to this--1969  and that the number of continuing claims, week to week, is lower than  it has been at any point since 1973. Let me say that another way.  Notwithstanding almost half a century of population growth, fewer  Americans are applying for new unemployment benefits today than has  ever been the case since just a few months after Apollo 11 landed on  the Moon. The last time this few number of Americans continued to  receive unemployment week to week was when Richard Nixon was President.  No wonder analysts are heaping praise on this economy. The Wall Street  Journal noted last week that recent reports indicate ``underlying  strength that could tee up one of the best years in the current  expansion.''   Back in March, my home State of Kentucky joined a list of 14 States  that have reached the lowest unemployment rates in recorded history  since this united Republican government has been in office. Never  before on record has Kentucky's unemployment rate dropped as low as 4  percent.   Already in 2018, an estimated 14,000 Kentuckians have found jobs at  businesses of all shapes and sizes.   Glier's Meats, in Covington, announced that the company was planning  to add new positions and invest in new equipment to meet growing  demand. In the words of the company's president, ``We had a number of  projects that were seen as something we could consider doing down the  road, but because of tax reform, it's possible to reinvest in the plant  and in new equipment now.''   In Ashland, Braidy Industries expects to support 1,000 construction  jobs as it constructs a new state-of-the-art manufacturing facility and  then 600 permanent jobs. It broke ground in June.   Not a single one of our colleagues across the aisle voted in support  of this historic tax reform that is helping to make these developments  possible. For them, these data are telling an inconvenient truth, and  the inconvenient truth is this: The rest of America is not hiding from  these numbers. Americans are benefiting from these numbers. We are  celebrating them and all of the life-changing job opportunities, wage  growth, and small business expansions they represent.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
