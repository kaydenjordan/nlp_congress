 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 1 today.   Despite its name, this act is not for the people. It is for the  politicians seeking power.   East Tennesseans and Americans want election reform that increases  the security and integrity of our election, and they are demanding it.  Instead, this bill erodes the public confidence in our elections. This  bill picks D.C. bureaucrats over State and local officials, and it uses  hard-earned tax dollars to fund political campaigns by a 6-to-1 fund- matching provision. Now, let me repeat that. It is a 6-to-1 fund- matching provision.   I am sure my fellow east Tennesseans agree this is a waste of money.   Wouldn't you rather have our tax dollars used to fund measures to  safely open schools or to expand critical access to rural broadband?   These are the priorities we need to fund, not political power grabs  and public financing of our own political campaigns.   Mr. Speaker, I oppose, and I urge my colleagues to oppose H.R. 1.
