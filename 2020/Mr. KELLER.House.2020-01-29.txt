 Madam Speaker, today, it is my great pleasure to  recognize the heroic action of Odren Polk, a resident of Williamsport,  Pennsylvania, in our 12th Congressional District.   Affectionately referred to as ``Mr. O,'' Odren serves his community  at Stevens Primary School through STEP AmeriCorps, a national service  organization.   On what Odren described as an otherwise usual day in the cafeteria,  Mr. O noticed one of the students choking on a grape tomato. Utilizing  the first aid training he received at AmeriCorps, Mr. O jumped into  action, dislodging the tomato from the student's airway and saving his  life.   What Mr. O described as an automatic reaction was possible only  because of the training he received at AmeriCorps.   AmeriCorps is a network of national service programs that seeks to  improve lives and foster civic engagement. Approximately 75,000  Americans across the country serve their community through AmeriCorps  each year.   AmeriCorps members also receive training that prepares them to serve  their communities after their AmeriCorps is completed. As in the case  with Mr. O, sometimes that training comes in handy sooner rather than  later.                            ____________________
