 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the United States Fire  Administration, AFG, and SAFER Program Reauthorization Act of 2017.   I hope we can all agree on the urgency of reauthorizing this program  before the sunset in current law would terminate this program in  January. We heard from the local, State, and Federal experts at our  hearing in July just how essential these programs are to ensuring both  firefighter and community safety in all of our districts across the  Nation.   This bill authorizes funding at the 2017 levels for the U.S. Fire  Administration, Assistance to Firefighters Grants, Staffing for  Adequate Fire and Emergency Response Grants.                                time  1730    It also directs establishment of a grant monitoring and oversight  framework. It makes important technical fixes to current law. It  ensures lesser resourced fire departments have the tools to  successfully apply for grants. These are critical programs to ensure  the safety and security of all Americans, and they must be  reauthorized.   Unfortunately, I must also express my disappointment and frustration  with the majority's insistence on including a new sunset clause in this  bill. The sunset currently in law is putting these programs at risk as  we speak. Congress shouldn't need sunsets to do a job properly. In this  case, arbitrary program sunsets puts lives at risk. Every single  firefighting organization wants this sunset out. On a bipartisan basis,  the Senate has voted to remove this sunset, yet here we are today  running up a program termination that nobody wants, and senselessly  adding a future program termination date that nobody wants.   Legislating by self-created emergency is bad for Congress and bad for  our country. Here we are in December desperately trying to avoid  terminating assistance to firefighters. At the same time, we are  desperately trying to keep the Federal Government from shutting down  and we are desperately trying to provide disaster assistance to  Americans who are suffering. Of course, we have already missed the  deadline on CHIP, and now 9 million children all across our country are  in danger of losing health coverage. This is no way to run a country.   So we will vote on this bill today and, in 7 years, probably be right  back in the same boat we are today. We can and should do better than  this.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no requests  for time, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of  the bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4375, the STEM Research and  Education Effectiveness and Transparency Act.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to be a cosponsor of this bill, and I thank  the Research and Technology Subcommittee chairwoman, Mrs. Comstock, for  introducing it.   Research shows that the underrepresentation of women and minorities  in STEM fields is not due to a lack of interest or motivation. There  are real institutional and cultural barriers preventing talented  individuals from realizing their dreams of working in STEM careers. We  must better understand these barriers so that we may develop and  support the most effective policies and programs.   H.R. 4375 directs the NSF to report on the effectiveness of current  portfolio of broadening participation programs. This bill also includes  one provision from my STEM Opportunities Act that requires all Federal  science agencies to collect and report annually on data for all  research grant applications and awards.   This would enable researchers to conduct a cross-agency assessment of  the participation and success of Federal grant applicants across  demographic groups. With information about the participation and  success of women and minorities throughout the process of applying for  Federal research funding, including such details as the award size, we  can identify and root out any inequities that reflect implicit bias in  the process.    This bill is a small, but important, step in the right direction  toward ensuring equitable access to STEM education and careers.   I want to take a moment to advocate for this House considering my  STEM Opportunities Act, H.R. 2653, in its entirety. That would allow us  to continue the steps we are taking today to broaden participation in  STEM in our country.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume. I rise in support of H.R. 4254, the Women in  Aerospace Education Act.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        December 18, 2017, on page H10160, the following appeared:  Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time  as she may consume to the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. Esty).    Mr. Speaker, I have no further  requests for time. I urge passage, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1159, the United States and  Israel Space Cooperation Act. The cooperation between the National  Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA, and the Israel Space Agency  is just one example of peaceful international cooperation that has been  a hallmark of NASA's approach since its inception in 1958.   In fact, when Congress passed NASA's founding legislation, the Space  Act of 1958, one of the primary objectives established for the agency  was: ``7, Cooperation by the United States with other nations and  groups of nations in work done pursuant to this act and in the peaceful  application of the results thereof.''   NASA has followed this objective over the years in a variety of ways.  Since its establishment in 1958, NASA has entered into over 5,000  original agreements with international entities, and currently NASA has  over 800 active cooperative agreements across a range of disciplines  with over 120 countries and international organizations.   These international partnerships have led to a range of benefits in  scientific advancement, access to scientific data, partnering in  exploration, and sharing the costs and risks of space missions.   NASA has had a long and fruitful relationship with the country of  Israel, and that cooperative relationship continues to this day.  Current activities with Israel include the involvement of almost 200  Israeli schools in the Global Learning and Observations to Benefit the  Environment, GLOBE, educational project; collaboration on atmospheric  and climate research; and numerical cloud modeling, among other  activities.   I think it is also fitting to remember that the crew of the ill-fated  Space Shuttle Columbia mission, STS-107, included an Israeli astronaut,  Ilan Ramon, who, along with the entire STS-107 crew, tragically  perished with the loss of the space shuttle orbiter on February 1,  2003.   Israel has shared in the great achievements of NASA as well as great  losses that have paved the way for future space explorers. Their  sacrifice will be held in our hearts as we work to further space  exploration for the benefit of mankind.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the sponsor of this legislation, Mr.  Kilmer, for introducing the bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as  he may consume to the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Kilmer).    Mr. Speaker, I have no further  requests for time. I urge passage, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4323, the Supporting Veterans  in STEM Careers Act, and I thank Mr. Dunn and Mr. Takano for  introducing this good legislation.   The demand for a workforce equipped with STEM skills is growing. At  the same time, many veterans developed valuable technical skills during  their service. We must do more to take advantage of those skills and  increase veteran participation in STEM careers if we are to meet the  workforce demands.   This summer, I was pleased to see the passage of the Forever GI Bill,  which extended GI benefits for veterans enrolled in STEM degree  programs. Now that STEM degrees are more accessible for veterans, we  must do more to support veterans during their transition into STEM  degree programs and careers.   H.R. 4323 directs the National Science Foundation to report data on  veterans in STEM studies and careers and develop a plan to increase  outreach to veterans.   This bill also creates an interagency committee that will examine how  Federal programs and policies can best be leveraged to equip veterans  with the skills they need to transition into STEM careers.   H.R. 4323 is a good step toward strengthening our STEM workforce and  creating opportunities for an eminently deserving sector of our  citizenry.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as  he may consume to the gentleman from California (Mr. Takano).    Mr. Speaker, I have no further  requests for time. I urge support of this legislation, and I yield back  the balance of my time.
