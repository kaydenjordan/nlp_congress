 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Madam Speaker, I thank Congressman Graves for arranging this special  tribute to a devoted patriot, a serious legislator, and endearing  colleague and friend, the dean of the House, Congressman Don Young. I  thank Mr. Graves for his leadership in putting this together. I am  pleased to join our distinguished Democratic leader, Mr. Hoyer, who is  still here on the floor now for this.   Madam Speaker, this morning, Congress had the sad and official honor  of welcoming Congressman Young back to the Capitol to lie in state in  Statuary Hall. As Speaker, it was my solemn privilege to join in paying  tribute to this legendary leader, as his historic public service  brought luster to the Congress and to the country.   It was always clear that Don was passionate about his position and  his patriotism, and about working in this institution to make a  difference.   As an Army veteran, he was a force for ensuring our servicemembers,  veterans, and military families got the care they earned;   As a former teacher and passionate advocate for quality education for  all of our Nation's children; and   As a champion for Alaska--as Congressman Graves pointed out, and Mr.  Hoyer as well--he was relentless in delivering investments to his  beloved home State, especially lifting up Native communities in honor  of his late wife, Lu.   When Don became dean in December 2017, he said right here on the  House floor: I love this body. I believe in this body. My heart is in  the House.   He loved the House and the House loved him. Indeed, Don Young was an  institution in the House of Representatives. As was said this morning,  49 years for the 49th State, The Last Frontier, which he loved; Alaska.   While a committed conservative, he was more than willing to work  across party lines if it meant delivering for his beloved home State of  Alaska. And as dean, he cherished the duty to bring Members together  and to defend the dignity and integrity of this institution.   I, myself, was personally honored to be sworn in as Speaker two times  by the distinguished dean, Don Young, in 2019 and 2021.   As dean, he cherished his duty to bring Members together, as I said.  Despite political differences, many of us on the other side of the  aisle enjoyed close personal friendships with him built on our shared  reverence and respect for this institution.   His salmon dinners were legendary. His personality was similarly  legendary.   While we are devastated by the loss of our dear friend and colleague,  each of us has a duty to honor his unending love for the House and the  towering legacy he leaves behind.   Again, I call to attention the fact that George Miller, who served  with him wrote--it is online in The Hill--an article he wrote with John  Lawrence as opinion contributors. But George Miller and Don Young were  back and forth, chair and ranking member, on the Interior Committee and  the Committee on Natural Resources. You have to read it because any one  sentence taken out of context, you might not appreciate, but let me  just read what he said at the end: ``Saying you miss Don Young doesn't  mean he was right all the time or that he was invariably wrong; it  means the House is diminished by his loss. He was a great Congressman  and a great friend; Alaska was fortunate to have him.''   May it be a comfort to his beloved wife, Anne, his dear children,  Dawn and Joni, and his 20-some darling grandchildren that so many in  the Congress and the country mourn their loss.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record the statement of George Miller  and John A. Lawrence.            Don Young: A Conservative Who Believed in the House                  (By George Miller and John A. Lawrence)         Don Young, the Alaska congressman who died on March 18 at       88 and who is lying in state today, was a hard-nosed, in-      your-face, unapologetic, old-line conservative. An ardent       hunter and gun advocate, the walls of his legendary Rayburn       building office looked like the workplace of an over-active       taxidermist: covered in heads, hides and horns of the       creatures that had the misfortune to cross paths with this       former teacher, trapper and river boat captain. A descendent       of the early conservationist movement that preserved open       lands and wildlife so he could drill and graze on the former       and shoot the latter, he had no patience with public land       purists who demanded minimal human intrusions on the natural       ecosystem. It is fair to say he was much more Safari Club       than Sierra Club.        Don was not a subtle personality, as many discovered       throughout his career. If he was unhappy with your criticisms       or bored with your speechifying, he might pull out his       hunting knife and hold it to your throat or jam it into the       dais next to you at a hearing. The chief proponent of logging       old forests and drilling the fragile coast, he was a hero to       his Alaska constituents who sent him to Congress longer than       any other sitting member, but a desecrating exploiter of the       public's resources to environmentalists, especially those in       the other 49 states.        But if Don was a throwback to an earlier age of gruff,       sharp-elbow politics, he also retained that era's deep love       for the House in which he spent the bulk of his life, where       he chaired two committees and served as Dean--and where it       was not considered an act of treachery or political suicide       to reach across the aisle.        There is often a tendency when someone dies to sand off the       hard edges and portray the recently departed as something of       a saint. Don would be the first to acknowledge he was no       saint, and he'd be furious with anyone who tried to sand off       his rough edges. He would bellow like a wounded grizzly when       he made concessions on the Tongass forest or the Alaska Lands       law, but once the deal was struck in the negotiations, he       would go out on the floor and defend the work product of his       committee.        Even so, Don remained a pariah to most national       environmental activists for promoting projects like the       Trans-Alaska pipeline or drilling in the Arctic Wilderness       (both issues on which we strongly disagreed with him), and       many of his own colleagues were angry with him for pushing       through the $400-million Gravina Island ``bridge to nowhere''       that became a paradigm of congressional pork and provoked       Congress to ban earmarks. But the people who worked on those       projects and would have driven on that bridge (it was       cancelled in 2005) were Don Young's constituents, and he was       doing what congresspeople have done since time immemorial:       taking care of the district. And it's worth noting that the       House, after a decade of prohibition, has resurrected--with       greater transparency--earmarks as a crucial way of securing       the votes to pass legislation.        Because he was very much his own man and did not suffer       fools (or anyone else, for that matter) lightly, Don was       skeptical of the new breed of hyper-partisans who emerged       halfway through his long tenure in the House. Back in 1994,       he was one of just a handful of Republicans who refused to       embrace Newt Gingrich's ``Contract With America,'' a       collection of half-baked, rhetorical broadsides against the       Democratic majority under which he had always served. Asked       why he declined to embrace the campaign  [[Page H3961]]       document, he matter-of-factly declared, ``Because it's a       crock of shit.''        Later in the decade, Don unexpectedly joined with leading       environmentalists to support the Conservation and       Reinvestment Act (CARA) that offered up vast lands for both       hunting and backpacking but also included greater protections       for landowners and restrained federal land acquisitions. Down       at the White House, plying the bill's key sponsors with Diet       Cokes as they happily missed floor votes, Bill Clinton       professed his commitment to the bill to a delegation that       included Republicans like Young who had just voted to impeach       him. When Young left the West Wing after a couple of hours,       he marveled, ``No president has spent that much time with me       since Nixon'' three decades earlier.        Don helped build a stunning bipartisan coalition for CARA       that passed the House with over 300 votes but stalled in the       Senate. When asked why he could not get the bill past the       upper house, he blamed ``those crazy, god-damned right-wing       bastards.'' When he was reminded ``Don, you're a crazy right-      wing bastard, you know,'' he answered, ``That's true, but I       know how to cut a deal.''        The House Don Young leaves behind is one where knowing how       to cut a bipartisan deal is a much more difficult challenge       than in his glory days, wielding the gavel at the Resources       and Transportation committees. His departure marks one more       loss of the kind of people who were willing to take tough       stands and live with the fallout, good or bad, because it was       vastly better than gridlock and cheap shot sniping.        Saying you'll miss Don Young doesn't mean he was right all       the time or that he was invariably wrong; it means the House       is diminished by his loss. He was a great congressman and a       great friend; Alaska was fortunate to have him.    Madam Speaker, frequently we will say at a service, ``I  mourn with you.'' We are all mourning in the House with Anne, Dawn, and  Joni because we have all lost a dear, dear friend, and we are praying  for them at this sad time. He was a blessing to our country. May  Congressman Don Young forever rest in peace.   When I asked George Miller this morning, what word would you use to  describe Don Young. He said: He was amazing. He shouted over the phone:  He was amazing.   And how appropriate that the family had suggested ``Amazing Grace''  as the song to be sung at his service earlier today as he laid in state  in Statuary Hall.   Yes, Don Young. Amazing. ``Amazing Grace.''
