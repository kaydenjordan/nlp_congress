 Madam Speaker, I haven't seen the Vice President at the  border lately. I was down there about a month ago, and I just want to  share a few things that I learned down there that maybe somebody else  can pass on to her.   First of all, when you're at the Yuma center, when you walk along the  path the people walk to get in this country, it is littered with photo  IDs. Obviously, people do not want the United States Government or  Border Patrol to know who they are. So this is a sign we are getting  people in this country who have a lot to hide.   The second thing to point out that I was not aware of until I talked  to the Border Patrol, is they feel they don't have the right to test  somebody for COVID. We know that some people who are testing positive  are already let in the country. I was not aware until I went down there  that it is the current policy if you say, I want to test you for COVID,  and you refuse, they just let you in.   The third thing I want to point out is that apparently they are  advertising on Central American TV for people to come here.   Obviously, if we had a better relationship with those Central  American countries, this wouldn't be going on, but if you wonder why so  many people are coming here, it is because the drug gangs are  advertising on TV.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I would like one more time to address  the reconciliation package. We know that it is a very large spending  package and will result in more welfare and, inevitably, we will have  to have more taxes which will put a damper on the economy.   But let's look at the type of vision that the Democratic Party has  for our country given what they are spending the money on. We know we  have a big, illegal immigration crisis in this country--everybody knows  8,000 people in the country last July, 105,000 this July.   What are we going to do with it?   We have record amounts of fentanyl coming across the southern border.  We respond with a provision giving 7 million people a path to amnesty  which is a magnet to get more people here. We make it more difficult to  remove people from the country if they commit crimes, including sex  offenses and firearm convictions without any discretion from DHS. So,  Madam Speaker, you want to make it more difficult to get even the  criminal element out of the country.   But, finally, we promised anybody coming into the country free  college. Pell grants that are designed for poor Americans are going to  go to people who come here illegally. We want the average American to  sit there at home paying $30,000 or $40,000 tuition, in debt until they  are 30 or 40 years old, but if you come here illegally, boom, free  college.  [[Page H6355]]    The second thing we get out of here is a new welfare problem in this  country. We are encouraging people not to work. We are encouraging  people not to get married.   How do they respond?   Look at the recent increase in food stamp benefits, the massive  amount of money going to low-income housing, the increase in the earned  income tax credit, and the larger Pell grants. Everywhere you look in  this bill, Madam Speaker, is more money for people of a certain  lifestyle at the expense of the person who is getting married and  working harder.   Race preferences are throughout this bill. It seems like they are  incapable of doing a program that benefits all Americans. It is always  targeting somebody from this race or that race or this gender or that  gender. It is a very divisive bill.   There is a great increase in government's role in raising children.  It is the government that pays for all the 3- and 4-year-old kids. It  is kind of the opposite of what America is supposed to be where the  child's upbringing is family centered. Now we want to make the child's  upbringing government centered.   Finally, it creates more of a surveillance state. There are 87,000  new IRS agents.   What could they possibly do?   But, obviously, Madam Speaker, you can see where we are headed as a  country. At a time when our factories and farms can't find anybody to  work, we are going to take unemployed people and make them IRS agents.    In any event, I urge Americans to pay attention to where the money is  going in this bill because it is the type of America our forefathers  never would have imagined.    Madam Speaker, like all other Congressmen, I am sure,  my office has received many calls from people objecting to the OSHA  rules and the CMS rules related to employees of hospitals.   It amazes me, the number of articulate doctors and nurses and other  employees out there who have good reasons not to take the vaccine.  Whether their doctors have told them don't take it because you already  have antibodies, you have too many antibodies, the vaccine is going to  make you sick; whether it is doctors who tell their patients you better  not take the vaccine, your cancer is in remission, the vaccine can  weaken you and bring it back.   Again and again, it appalls me that doctor Biden decides to weigh in  and knows better for these people than what their own doctors do, not  to mention there are plenty of things on the internet--which may be  true even though they try to take them down and keep us in the dark-- indicating that some very articulate people believe the vaccines are  not for you anyway, and there are other ways to deal with the problem.   It is such a gross grab of power to think you can tell other people  what they have to do with their own bodies. I sure hope America stands  up and says no to this kind of hatred and arrogance.
