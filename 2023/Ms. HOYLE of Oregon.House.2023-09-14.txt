 Mr. Speaker, when the U.S. auto manufacturers  were suffering during the recession, the UAW workers took pay cuts,  were willing to forgo pay raises for the greater good of U.S.  manufacturing, believing that U.S. auto manufacturers would repay their  sacrifice once they were earning good profits.   That didn't happen. Today, I rise in support of the United Auto  Workers, and I urge the Big Three auto manufacturers to treat their  employees fairly in these negotiations and share the wealth that is  earned from their labor.   The UAW is leading the charge to make green jobs good union jobs. The  UAW organized the first battery plant in this country in Ohio. They are  willing to move forward and work with manufacturers to get the job  done. We need those jobs.  [[Page H4310]]                                ____________________
