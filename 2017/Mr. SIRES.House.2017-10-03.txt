 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this measure, and I  yield myself as much time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank our chairman on the Foreign Affairs  Committee, Ed Royce, and our ranking member, Eliot Engel, as well as  the authors of this bill, Mr. Chabot of Ohio and Ms. Kelly of Illinois.  Both of these Members have worked hard on the bill to expand access to  education around the world. I agree with them that this is an important  priority for our foreign policy.    When children are able to get basic education, it pays massive  dividends down the road. Those girls and boys grow up with great  opportunity, and they play a bigger role in their economies and their  communities.   We have seen research that, when children can learn about certain  issues like nonviolent civic engagement, support for violence drops.  That adds up to stronger and more stable countries and better partners  for the United States.   Children belong in a classroom, Mr. Speaker, no matter where they  happen to be born, but in too many places, that access just doesn't  exist. What happens then?   We know in places like the Middle East, in north Africa, violent  extremists are happy to fill in the void, to recruit and indoctrinate  the next generation with their hateful and violent ideology. This  problem is especially acute among refugees of displaced populations.   Mr. Speaker, 3.7 million schoolchildren under the U.N. refugee  agency's mandate have no school to go to. Some countries are trying to  tackle this challenge, like Lebanon, where the government has taken  steps to enroll Syrian refugees in schools, but the need is just too  great. Out of 500,000 school-age refugees, nearly half are out of  school.   This bill aims to help address those really desperate situations. It  calls for the USAID to ramp up access to these children, and  particularly young girls. It will help us gather more data to assist  government and NGOs that are also grappling with this problem, and it  authorizes the Secretary of State and the USAID Administrator to  prioritize this issue, to work with multilateral organizations, and to  seek out partners in the private sector and civil society that will  bring innovative new approaches to expanding access to education. This  bill will put more young girls in the classroom in places around the  world where this help is badly needed. I am glad to support it.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1430     Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Ms. Frankel), my colleague on the Foreign Affairs Committee  and a real champion for women and girls.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am also a former certified teacher, and expanding  access to education is critical in combating terrorism. When we  increase opportunities through education, we help more girls and boys  by giving them the tools to think critically and resist those who mean  to harm us. We are helping to give these children an alternative with  the possibility of positioning them to make further positive impact on  their communities and their countries.   Time and time again we have seen the results of what happens when  children are not provided a better path: extremism, radicalism, and  terrorism.   This is one of our best opportunities to provide a more safe and  secure world not only for them, but also for us, too.   Mr. Speaker, again, I thank Congressman Chabot and Congresswoman  Kelly for their hard work. I support this bill, and I urge all Members  to do the same.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in support of H.R. 1918, the Nicaraguan  Investment Conditionality Act, also known as the NICA Act.   I want to start by thanking Chairman Royce, Ranking Member Engel, and  my chairman on the Western Hemisphere Subcommittee, Jeff Duncan, for  their efforts to bring this bill to the floor.   I also would like to thank my good friend from Florida, Ileana Ros- Lehtinen, who has worked tirelessly for decades and never backs down  when it comes to standing up against authoritarian regimes and human  rights violators.   We are here today to stand up against Daniel Ortega and his constant  pursuit of gaining absolute political control over the Nicaraguan  people. Daniel Ortega and his family continue to amass wealth while the  Nicaraguans remain the second poorest country in the Western  Hemisphere.   Ortega has spent years winning sham elections, eliminating political  opposition, and now has his wife take the role of Vice President. If  you need any more convincing of his intentions, Ortega continues to  strongly defend Nicolas Maduro, the Venezuelan dictator whose regime  shoots unarmed protestors in the streets, jails the opposition,  dissolved Congress, and has brought what should be one of the richest  countries in Latin America to the brink of collapse.   Being a corrupt democracy in name only cannot go without  consequences. This bipartisan legislation makes it clear that the U.S.  will not stand by and watch Ortega trample the people's human rights  defenders and stomp all over democracy, while getting rich at the  expense of the Nicaraguan people.  [[Page H7703]]    H.R. 1918 calls on the U.S. Government to oppose loans at  international financial institutions for Nicaragua unless the  Nicaraguan Government takes some effective steps to hold free, fair,  and transparent elections and commits to upholding democratic  principles.   Congress and the administration need to work together and find ways  to empower the Nicaraguan people and defend against Ortega's hostile  behavior towards innocent civilians. It is my hope that this bipartisan  legislation will pass the Senate and quickly be signed into law.   I thank the chairman and ranking member once again and their staff  for all their help in bringing the NICA Act to the floor. I urge my  colleagues to vote in support of this bill to hold the Ortega regime  accountable for its actions.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Gonzalez), a member of the Financial Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I again want to thank Chairman Royce, Ranking  Member Engel, and mi hermana from Florida, my sister, Ileana Ros- Lehtinen, for their work on this bipartisan measure and for their  commitment to democracy in the Western Hemisphere. They have skillfully  crafted the NICA Act to hold President Ortega accountable, while  ensuring that the Nicaraguan people do not suffer. I am glad that we  are advancing this measure, and I urge my colleagues to support it.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
