 Madam Chairman, it is my distinct honor to bring to the  House floor the fiscal year 2019 Interior, Environment, and Related  Agencies Appropriations bill.   Before I go into details about the bill, I would like to commend  Chairman Frelinghuysen for his leadership and support throughout this  process.   As reported by the Appropriations Committee, the fiscal year 2019  Interior and Environment bill is funded at $35.252 billion, which is  equal to the FY18 enacted level. We have made sincere efforts to  prioritize critical needs within our subcommittee allocation and in  reviewing more than 5,200 individual requests.   In the interest of time, I won't outline all the problems or programs  and activities funded in this bill. I would like to point out a few  highlights.   The bill provides robust wildland fire funding totaling $3.9 billion.  It fully funds the 10-year average for wildland fire suppression costs  and provides an additional $500 million in suppression funds for the  Forest Service. The committee has also provided a $30 million increase  over fiscal year 2018 for hazardous fuel reduction.   The bill provides $500 million in fiscal year 2019 for the Payments  in Lieu of Taxes, PILT program, which is a top priority for many  Members on both sides of the aisle.   The bill also makes critical investments in Indian Country, a top  priority of this committee. This legislation honors our commitment to  Native Americans with a particular emphasis on Indian health, law  enforcement, education, and water settlements.   The bill fully funds contract support costs and Tribal grant school  support costs; provides funding to staff newly constructed health  facilities; improves public safety; significantly increases economic  development; invests an additional $16 million in fiscal year 2019 to  address needs of schools throughout the BIE system; and invests an  additional $82 million to correct funding disparities across the Indian  Healthcare System.   Overall, funding to EPA has been reduced by $100 million from fiscal  year 2018, with reductions aimed at research and regulatory programs.  Members from the Midwest will be pleased to know that the Great Lakes  Restoration Initiative is maintained at the fiscal year 2018 enacted  level of $300 million.   The bill continues to invest in water infrastructure and cleaning up  contaminated land. These programs help create jobs and spur economic  development in communities all across the Nation. The bill provides  funds to leverage over $10 billion worth of investment in water  infrastructure through the funding in the WIFIA program and the Clean  Water and Drinking Water State Revolving Loan Funds.   The bill also provides $3.2 billion for the National Park Service. It  maintains, and builds upon, critical investments made in the fiscal  year 2018 enacted bill to address longstanding park operations and  deferred maintenance needs.    We have also attempted to address a number of concerns within the  Fish and Wildlife Service accounts. The bill restores popular grant  programs through fiscal year 2018 enacted levels. It also restores  funds to combat international wildlife trafficking; protects fish  hatcheries from cuts and closures; and continues funding to fight  invasive mussels and Asian carp; and reduces the backlog of species  that are recovered but not yet de-listed. We have also increased funds  for the Recovery Challenge program, which we started in 2018 to  challenge non-Federal partners to a more active role in recovering  endangered species.   The bill also provides $360 million for Land and Water Conservation  programs with bipartisan support.   Lastly, this bill makes significant investments toward critical  deferred maintenance, construction, and infrastructure needs within the  Department of the Interior, Forest Service, Indian Health Service,  Smithsonian, as well as critical air and water infrastructure programs  within the EPA.   In closing, I would like to thank staff on both sides of the aisle  who have worked long hours on this legislation. On the minority side, I  would like to thank Rita Culp, Jocelyn Hunn, and Rebecca Taylor.   On the majority side, I would like to thank Darren Benjamin, Betsy  Bina, Jackie Kilroy, Kristin Richmond, Mac Cloyes, and Dave LesStrang  from the committee staff, as well as Ian Foley, Rebecca Keightley,  Tricia Evans and Dave Kennett from my personal staff.   To say the least, this has been a team effort.                                time  1915    Lastly, I would like to thank my good friend and ranking member,  Betty McCollum, for working with me to address a number of critical  needs throughout the bill.    Madam Chair, while we may disagree on some issues, we  are never disagreeable and we continue to work well together.   Madam Chair, it is a good bill. I urge its adoption.  [[Page H6380]]         Madam Chairwoman, at this time, I yield to the gentleman  from New Jersey (Mr. Lance) for the purpose of a colloquy.    Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman. I want to thank my  colleague from New Jersey for expressing support for the Superfund  program.   The Superfund program continues to be a priority of this committee.  In the fiscal year 2018 omnibus, we provided a $66 million increase to  the program to accelerate cleanup of Superfund sites and respond to the  release of hazardous materials.   I look forward to working together through the 2019 process to ensure  that the Superfund program receives necessary funding to clean up and  revitalize our Nation's toxic sites, like the American Cyanamid site,  so that they are returned to productive use.    Madam Chair, I thank the chairman.   Madam Chair, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. Ruiz).    I thank Mr. Ruiz for raising this issue. I would like to  offer and continue working with the gentleman and the Forest Service to  amicably and productively resolve the situation.    Madam Chair, I rise in support of the gentleman's  amendment. I want to acknowledge, our members on both sides of the  aisle support more land acquisition funding, not less. That said, both  sides of the aisle also recognize the maintenance backlog of our  national parks is unacceptable.   In this bill we tried to balance the bipartisan support for land  acquisition with bipartisan support for maintaining and improving the  conditions of facilities we already own.   The gentleman from Arizona thinks we should direct a bit more to the  National Park Service maintenance, and there is no debate that those  needs are there.   Madam Chair, I support the amendment.    Madam Chair, I rise in support of the amendment.    Madam Chair, I am happy to accept the gentleman's  amendment and to work with the rest of my colleagues to address a need  for funding to battle the spread the harmful invasive species. I  support an ``aye'' vote, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I rise in support of the gentleman's  amendment.   The Delaware River Conservation Program leverages Federal funding by  at least 2 to 1. That is exactly the kind of public-private partnership  we should be fostering throughout the enterprise. That is why I support  this amendment, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.    Madam Chair, I support the amendment.    Madam Chair, I appreciate the Member's interest in the  New England Scenic Trail and the National Park Service operations  generally.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I rise in support of the amendment.  [[Page H6437]]     Madam Chair, as the gentleman knows, I am a strong  supporter of the National Park Service and the Historic Preservation  Fund. While I have some concerns about the offset at the Office of the  Secretary, this is a bipartisan amendment I can accept, and I urge  adoption of the amendment.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I rise in support of the amendment.    Madam Chair, to the gentlewoman, my colleague on the  House Intelligence Committee, this is certainly an amendment I can  accept. The gentlewoman and I have a history over the years of working  together on this program, and I am happy to continue it.   Madam Chair, I urge adoption of the amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I rise in support of the amendment.    Madam Chair, I have no objections and urge adoption of  the amendment.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I rise in support of the gentleman's  amendment.    Madam Chair, the gentleman and I have a history over the  years of working together to support HBCUs. I thank the gentleman for  working with me on this issue and with the ranking member, and I urge  the adoption of this amendment.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I rise in support of the gentlewoman's  amendment.    Madam Chair, I am happy to continue to work with the  gentlewoman from Texas on this program and others, and I have no  objection.   Madam Chair, I urge adoption of the amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I rise in support of the amendment.    Madam Chair, I am happy to support the gentlewoman from  Michigan in her quest. The Great Lakes Science Center has bipartisan  support for the role it plays in protecting the economic and  environmental health of the Great Lakes region.   Madam Chair, I support my colleague's amendment, urge an ``aye''  vote, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I rise in support of the amendment.    Madam Chair, I support this amendment. I will work with  the gentleman to address this issue with the United States Geological  Survey and learn more about where this mineral occurs.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I rise in support of the amendment.    Madam Chair, it is my understanding that the United  States Geological Survey is in its early stages of discussing temporary  spaces but that, eventually, the United States Geological Survey may  have to develop a long-term solution for the Hawaiian Volcano  Observatory.   I encourage the Department of the Interior, the United States  Geological Survey, and the National Park Service to work together to  develop a plan for the future observatory because operating the HVO out  of the Hawaii Volcanoes National Park was a cost-effective solution for  many years.   Madam Chair, in the meantime, I certainly support my colleague's  amendment. I urge an ``aye'' vote, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Madam Chair, I rise in support of the amendment.    Madam Chair, we can accept the gentleman's amendment.   The committee takes invasive species threats seriously. We spent a  lot of time on Asian carp in our committee in prevention efforts  throughout the bill. It is a bipartisan effort. Everyone is very  concerned about this. We are talking about a bounty program, possibly,  to go after these things. Let's go do it.   I accept the gentleman's amendment, but I will be working with him  and the rest of my colleagues to ensure that Asian carp and grass carp  control and prevention efforts are effectively coordinated across the  agencies within our jurisdiction.   Madam Chair, I urge adoption of the amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman, and certainly we are  prepared to accept the amendment.   I understand the gentleman's overall goals to continue funding for  the AML pilot consistent with the fiscal year 2018 enacted bill that  provided the funding for the six Appalachian States, and I know the  economic devastation that has happened throughout that region.   This increase to the AML program by $30 million, so that Ohio,  Alabama, and Virginia would receive $10 million each, equal to the  fiscal 2010 enacted levels, could certainly help in those regions.  [[Page H6444]]    So we can accept this package of amendments at this time. I look  forward to maintaining funding for the six States, with distribution  similar to fiscal year 2018 and the final 2019 enacted bill. As such, I  encourage my colleagues to adopt the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the amendment.    Mr. Chair, I am happy to accept the gentleman's  amendment and work with him and the rest of my colleagues to address  the public safety and justice construction needs in Indian Country.   The ranking member and I have worked very closely together in Indian  Country to recognize the shortcomings throughout Indian Country in  Indian education, Indian healthcare, and certainly within the Indian  public safety and justice problems that we are having throughout the  United States.   Mr. Chair, I certainly support an ``aye'' vote, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in reluctant opposition to this  amendment.    Mr. Chair, I was happy to support the gentleman and  accept the prior amendment, but this just goes too far.   I couldn't agree with the gentleman more that the Federal obligations  for construction in Indian Country far outweigh the amount of money we  have in the budget. That is why the Bureau of Indian Affairs  Construction account has been and will continue to be a nonpartisan  priority for the subcommittee, and we are certainly proud of the  progress we have made so far, but I cannot support an offset on an  account that also serves Indian Country and other underserved  populations.   In addition to cutting the Office of the Assistant Secretary of  Indian Affairs, this amendment is likely to cut the Office of Native  American Relations, the Office of Small Disadvantaged Business  Utilization, the Office of Civil Rights, and the Office of Hearings and  Appeals.   Again, while I agree with the increase, and I certainly don't  disagree with the gentleman's intentions, I cannot in good conscience  agree to this offset.   If we find money down the road in this process as the gentlewoman and  I are going through the conference, this is something I would be very  interested in looking at, but right now I must encourage a ``no'' vote.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in support of the amendment.    Mr. Chair, in light of the catastrophic hurricane season  last year and the fact that we are already in the midst of another  hurricane season right now, I suspect there is additional relief needed  for the territories in the weeks and months ahead. So with this reality  upon us, I am happy to accept the amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in support of the amendment.    Mr. Chair, while I certainly have some concerns about  [[Page H6447]]  the offset, I am able to support my recent classmate's and colleague's  amendment. As the gentlewoman knows, this bill has a strong history of  supporting underrepresented communities, including African American and  Tribal communities.   This bill funded the construction of the Smithsonian's National  Museum of African American History and Culture and continues to  strongly support the operations of this very popular museum.   This bill maintains a strong bipartisan support for Tribal health,  Tribal education, Tribal law enforcement, and numerous other priorities  critical to Native Americans and Alaska Natives, and this bill supports  underrepresented communities throughout the Historic Preservation Fund  grants under the National Park Service.   Though we may have to turn the lights off at the Department of the  Interior if we keep going on--he is a Navy SEAL; he will get by--I  certainly urge the adoption of this amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in reluctant opposition to this  amendment.    Mr. Chair, don't get me wrong. I am not opposed to what  the EPA is doing at the border to improve water quality, but I think it  is important to note that the bill already provides $10 million for the  program, equal to the fiscal year 2018 level, and did not support the  elimination of the program as proposed in the President's budget.   As the gentleman knows, we are level-funded in this year's  appropriation bill, so I wasn't able to get additional funds for some  of these programs that I like. Because a $5 million reduction could  significantly impact the work of the Secretary of the Interior--we have  been chewing away at that all night--the programs under this  jurisdiction, and other important offices funded by the account, I  can't support the amendment.   I will continue to work with the ranking member as we move this  through this process because I know the important work we have done in  California and along the entire border. It is a good program, and I  certainly support it, but I can't support this amendment at this time.   Mr. Chair, I must oppose the amendment and urge my colleagues to vote  ``no.''   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for the time.   Mr. Chairman, I also rise in opposition to the amendment. As the  gentleman mentioned, the bill already includes a $1.5 million increase  for the Inspector General which is the amount that was requested. This  transfer is not needed, and if enacted, it could affect the operations  of the Department of the Interior.   For those reasons and others, I oppose this amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the gentleman's  amendment.    Mr. Chair, I appreciate the interest in our Nation's  water infrastructure needs.   Although this amendment does not do what the gentleman intends it to  do, I think it is always important for Congress to have a clear  understanding of what improvements need to be made to meet the quality  goals of the Clean Water Act.   Mr. Chairman, this is an amendment I can accept, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, I appreciate my colleague's desire to show  additional support for a program important to her constituents.  Unfortunately, the amendment does not do what she intends it to do;  therefore, I must oppose the amendment.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Arizona (Mr. Gosar).    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the amendment.    Mr. Chair, I certainly appreciate the gentleman's desire  to show support for robust funding for the National Estuary Program.  The FY19 bill provides $26.7 billion for the National Estuary Program,  which is equal  [[Page H6453]]  to the FY18 enacted level. This is an amendment I can accept.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, will the gentleman yield?    Mr. Chair, I am happy to work with the gentleman as we  go through this process. If we can find some additional funds as we  move to conference, I will be more than happy to revisit this issue  with the gentleman.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I just want to note that this bill  provides $10 million above the President's request for Superfund  Enforcement and $12 million above the fiscal 2018 enacted level for the  entire Superfund program. We attempted to find middle ground on  enforcement while also prioritizing on-the-ground cleanup efforts that  returns land to productive uses.   I certainly appreciate the gentlewoman's support for the interest in  the Superfund program, and while the amendment does not do as she  intends, this amendment is something we are unable to support at this  time.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman because this is  somewhat personal to me. I appreciate the gentleman's interest in this  illegal marijuana cultivation in our national forests.   One of the largest national forests in the State of California,  Cleveland National Forest, is literally in my congressional district  and right close to my house. We are always having problems with people  setting up illegal grow operations in the Cleveland National Forest. So  this increase to remediate these sites is needed.   I agree with the gentlewoman that these offsets are difficult, but I  am pleased to offer my support for the gentleman's amendment.  Hopefully, we can get rid of some of this illegal marijuana that is  grown in these national forests.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for bringing this  issue to our attention.   Invasive species, pests, and diseases have wreaked havoc across the  Nation and continue to do so. I know that the emerald ash borer has  been a tremendous pest throughout a good part of our country, certainly  in State and private forests also.   We need to improve management in our forests, and we need those  conditions to improve. So I am happy to accept the gentleman's  amendment, and I hope we can reduce the emerald ash borer.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Will the gentleman yield?    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Chairman, I certainly support this amendment. Mr. Ruiz and I  represent the same area. Volunteer firefighters are extremely  important, especially in our rural areas, and this is something we all  should support.   Mr. Chairman, I am happy to accept the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, certainly, I agree with the gentleman that  hazardous fuel reduction is something that is extremely important. That  is why we provide for a $30 million increase from last year's levels  for hazardous fuel reduction in this bill.   Second, the national forests are overgrown and prone to severe and  catastrophic fires, there is no doubt about  [[Page H6457]]  it. Colorado, for instance, has already experienced a number of these  fires this year, and, certainly, our home State of California is no  different. We have had a number of fires, and we have fires going on at  this very moment.   The timber program, which removes trees from these overgrown stands,  significantly reduces the threat of catastrophic fire. We went down a  path in the early 1990s that many people in the mainstream  environmental movement now realize is a mistake. We have now got out of  that enterprise, and a lot of these forests, unfortunately, have  overgrown and have bark beetle disease, so that now becomes hazardous  fuel.   Unfortunately, it wasn't harvested in a responsible way earlier.  Responsible harvesting of timber from the national forest is a  necessary component of good forest and land management.                                time  2300    So taking money from that account is the offset that I can't support.  But certainly, I do support hazardous fuel reduction, because,  unfortunately, we have created a lot of it in our home State of  California and throughout the West. So, unfortunately, I have to urge a  ``no'' vote on this amendment.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    I certainly agree with the gentleman that we have a  budget problem. I served on the Budget Committee for a number of years  and recognize the fact that we are spending too much money.   However, if we take a look at the entire budget picture, nondefense  discretionary accounts represent 16 percent of total Federal outlays.  And if you take a look at the nondefense discretionary accounts, over  the last number of years, we are pretty flat. We are pretty flat  spending right now. I mean, even with this increase, even with this  increase.   However, this NEA-NEH program is something I can't support. While I  understand, again, why the gentleman wants to save money, this  amendment would have unintended consequence affecting the men and women  who serve in the country in uniform, military veterans, their families,  as well as Native Americans, Alaska natives.   We are putting a lot of this money in to help people get through  their post-traumatic stress syndrome. This amendment would have  devastating consequence on critical work for the National Endowment for  the Arts at Walter Reed Medical Center, 11 other clinical sites across  the country that are supporting therapy service.   We have reformed the National Endowment for the Humanities to make  sure that we have low overhead, and that this money is getting out into  the country. This money doesn't go to New York or L.A. This goes out to  the rural areas around the country that don't have the benefit of large  interest in arts.   So I certainly urge Members to support the innovative work the NEA  and the NEH are providing our men and women in uniform, our veterans,  and families.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Maine (Ms.  Pingree).    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New  Jersey (Mr. Lance).    Mr. Chair, can I inquire how much time I have left?    Mr. Chair, one thing I want to make a point of, and  because obviously this deficit is a problem. Everybody recognizes that.  Seventy percent of all our spending today is nondiscretionary spending,  70 percent.   When I came to Congress 26 years ago it was 30 percent. Today those  numbers have totally flipped. Now it is 30 percent discretionary, 70  percent nondiscretionary.   Of the discretionary account, half of that goes to defense. The other  half goes to nondefense discretionary. No way are we ever going to  balance the budget on nondefense discretionary spending. At some point,  we all need to come together, Republicans, Democrats, the President,  and come to a budget agreement. It has been tried before and needs to  be tried again. And the 70 percent of nondiscretionary spending has to  be on the table and we have to bend those cost curves.   We are not going to--and I dispute the fact that we are at an all- time high on NEH and the National Endowment for the Arts. In past  years, those numbers were quite higher.                                time  2315    Those numbers have been cut down over the years, and we are trying to  do the best we can on these discretionary accounts; but being what it  will, this is not, I think, a wise cut. Money is going to every  congressional district in the United States.   Mr. Chair, I oppose this amendment, and I yield back the balance of  my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to the  gentleman's amendment.    Mr. Chair, with the change of administrations, we were  able to reduce the number of issues addressed in this bill, but some  issues warrant continued congressional attention. WOTUS is one of them.   Deciding how water is used should be the responsibility of State and  local officials who are familiar with the people and the local issues.  Under the WOTUS rule, however, the reach of the Federal jurisdiction  would be so broad that it would significantly restrict a landowner's  ability to make decisions about their property and a local government's  right to plan for its own development.   The language in the underlying bill simply repeals the misguided  WOTUS rule and clarifies what rules will be in effect until a new rule  is finalized, specifically, the same rules that were in effect  immediately prior to the promulgation of the final WOTUS rule.   WOTUS is an issue that warrants continued congressional attention and  the provision in the underlying bill is the appropriate action to take.   For these reasons, I must urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move that the Committee do now rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.  Lance) having assumed the chair, Mr. Budd, Acting Chair of the  Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that  that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 6147)  making appropriations for the Department of the Interior, environment,  and related agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2019, and  for other purposes, had come to no resolution thereon.                            ____________________
