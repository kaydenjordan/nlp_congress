 Mr. Speaker, this National Police Week, I rise today  in gratitude for those who protect our homes and families, bring  justice to the evildoer, and comfort to their countrymen in distress.   These dedicated men and women, who put their lives on the line as  they put on their uniforms every day, often do not receive the support  that they deserve.   From corporate media to Hollywood, even to this Congress, American  police officers frequently receive abuse instead of thanks, and blame  where they deserve applause.   However, hardworking, law-abiding American families and citizens know  better. They know the importance of fighting crime and protecting the  innocent, and they know the cost.   In 2022, 11 Georgia police officers died in the line of duty. So far  in 2023, we have lost another.   Last week, I had the honor of presenting a wreath at the National Law  Enforcement Officers Memorial here in Washington, D.C. dedicated to  those courageous men and women, the heroic peace officers of Georgia,  and all across America.   May their service and sacrifice never be forgotten and may Americans  always proudly back the blue. Semper fidelis.                            ____________________
