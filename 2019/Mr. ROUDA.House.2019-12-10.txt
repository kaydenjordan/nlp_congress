 Madam Chair, I commend my colleagues on the Natural  Resources Committee and the authors of the bill's various provisions  and amendments for their work on H.R. 729, the Coastal and Great Lakes  Communities Enhancement Act. I am proud to support this critical bill  aimed at equipping coastal and great lakes communities with the tools  they need to enhance resiliency planning efforts; implement forward- thinking solutions to address intense climate impacts; and ensure a  cleaner, safer, and more sustainable future.   Orange County is ground zero for the climate crisis. Families living  on the coast know that rising sea-levels, frequent flooding, coastal  erosion, and increasingly severe weather events are a clear and present  danger to our lives and livelihoods. This legislation protects and  preserves coastline, helps communities create and enact resiliency  measures, and improves ocean monitoring and research. Climate change is  here, and we must continue to take bold and swift action to protect  coastal communities.   The first of my two amendments to the Coastal and Great Lakes  Communities Enhancement act authorizes a prize competition to stimulate  innovation to advance coastal risk and resilience measures. My second  amendment requires the development of a catalog of research on  applicable coastal risk reduction and resilience measures to evaluate  effectiveness, eliminate redundancies, encourage cooperation, and make  research findings available to the public. These amendments strengthen  the underlying bill, and I appreciate the opportunity to offer to  advocate for the millions of Americans who live and work in coastal  communities.   I urge adoption of my amendments to this important piece of  legislation and final passage of the Coastal and Great Lakes  Communities Enhancement Act.
