 MALONEY of New York asked and was given permission  to address the House for 1 minute.)    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, on June 19, 1865,  freedom finally came for the last enslaved African Americans in the  United States when Union soldiers arrived in Galveston, Texas, more  than 2 years after President Lincoln issued the Emancipation  Proclamation.   Today, 156 years later, President Biden will be signing a law to make  Juneteenth a new Federal holiday. It is a cause for celebration. It  should also serve as an occasion for learning and for this country to  reflect on our history and recommit to doing the vital work to ensure  that the lasting effects of slavery, bigotry, and racism are replaced  with hope, dignity, and equality for all.   We can start with the Senate passing the George Floyd Justice in  Policing Act, legislation to reform policing and address systemic  racism and bias within law enforcement, and finally making the John  Lewis Voting Rights Act a law, passing it.   Today, we celebrate this historic designation of Juneteenth as a  Federal holiday. Tomorrow, we get back to work.                            ____________________     MALONEY of New York: Committee on Oversight       and Reform. H.R. 2662.
