 Madam Speaker, I rise today to address  the people's House for one final time.   It is hard to sum up the lessons that I have learned over my decades  of service in 1 minute, so instead, I would just like to say thank you.  [[Page H9988]]    Thank you to the 13th District of Illinois for allowing me to  represent you for the last 10 years.   Thank you to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who were  willing to work together to make life better for our constituents.   Thank you to my hard-working staff over the years who have been in  the trenches alongside me.   Thank you to the dedicated men and women who serve our legislative  branch and keep our House operations running.   Thank you to our brave Capitol Police who saved my life on more than  one occasion.   Thank you to my kids, Toryn, Griffin, and Clark, and my best friend  in the world, my wife, Shannon, for going on this journey with me all  these years.   While I will no longer be a Member of Congress come January, I will  continue to be this institution's biggest advocate and know that the  great work will continue because of all of you.   So as I leave, I would like to offer some advice to the incoming  freshmen. My friend Lee Brice sings in one of his best songs ``Love  Like Crazy": ``Don't outsmart your common sense.''   I hope I remembered every time that I got in front of a microphone  here or in a committee hearing that I had these words come to my head  sung by one of the greatest rock bands ever, Nickelback: ``These five  words in my head, scream, are we having fun yet?''   So thank you, Congress. It has been an honor.   I yield back for the very last time.                            ____________________
