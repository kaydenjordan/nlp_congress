 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address my colleagues in both  Chambers of Congress.   Yesterday, we saw the absolute acquittal in the Senate of President  Donald Trump after 3 years of baseless accusations, harassment, and a  prolonged witch hunt known as the impeachment process.   Without a doubt, the saddest part of this 130-day fiasco that cost  taxpayers an estimated $3 million and yielded zero direct evidence  implicating the President has been the colossal waste of time and  resources.   The question we must ask ourselves now is this: How many lives could  we have bettered during all of this?   The answer is: Countless.   It is time to get back to the issues that matter to the American  people. Let's find common ground and do something.  [[Page H930]]    Today, I stand here just feet away from where President Trump stood  on Tuesday and called for unity in this body.   As the President said that night, the only victories that matter in  Washington are those that deliver for the American people, and I stand  ready to work across the aisle.   Will you join me?   The American people are watching.                            ____________________
