 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I am here on a sad note and then on a  happier note as well. I am going to try to tie the two together.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I have been privileged to serve, and this  my 19th year here in the U.S. Senate. A long time ago, I served as a  naval officer in the Vietnam war and as later State treasurer,  Congressman, Governor of Delaware, and now I serve as U.S. Senator. I  have had the privilege of serving with literally hundreds of people  here, in the House, as Governor, and certainly in the Navy and the  armed services during the Vietnam war.   Among my all-time favorite colleagues of all of those, whether it was  in the military service, the State of Delaware, or here in Congress,  one of my all-time favorite people to serve with was a woman from North  Carolina, from a place called Shelby.   My wife is from North Carolina, from a place called Boone. Her family  is from North Carolina. She has her father down there. Boone is up in  the mountains. She has sisters. She has sisters in Raleigh, and some of  her family has actually lived in Shelby, NC.   There was a woman born there on May 26, 1953, named Kay Hagan. I  don't know that she was born Kay Hagan, but she became Kay Hagan, and  maybe that was after getting married. But she was the daughter of a  homemaker named Jeanette, and her dad had a tire business. Later, he  worked as a real estate broker. Apparently, politics was in her blood.  Her dad also served as mayor, later on, of Lakeland, FL. That was where  Kay Hagan spent most of her childhood.   Lakeland, FL, is near to me because it is the spring training camp  for the Detroit Tigers. I have been a Detroit Tigers fan since I was 9  years old. So it has been a while. For the people watching the World  Series, three of the best pitchers in baseball used to pitch for my  Tigers. They went through training camp in Lakeland and ended up with  other teams that took them into the World Series.   Kay was not around to watch any of those former Tigers pitch because  she passed away just about 3 days ago.   Her uncle was a former Governor of Florida, with whom I served.  Lawton Chiles was one of the sweetest, best guys I have ever known. He  served here in the U.S. Senate for many years--sort of a centrist  Democrat. He was beloved in his State and beloved here as well.   Both Kay's dad and her brother served in the U.S. Navy. I did 23  years  [[Page S6354]]  in all, Active Duty and Reserve, in the Navy, and I treasure those  days.   Apparently, Kay also spent summers on her grandparents' farm. They  had a farm not in North Carolina but in a place called Chesterfield in  South Carolina. Chesterfield used to be a tobacco brand, It was called  Chesterfield. She spent summers on her grandparents' farm in  Chesterfield, SC, and there she helped to string tobacco and harvest  watermelons.   I grew up in Danville, VA, the world's biggest tobacco market. The  kids in my classes at school--the really cool kids, apparently--strung  tobacco and probably havested watermelons, as well, as Kay did.   She graduated from Lakeland High School in 1971 and went on to  Florida State University and received her JD from Wake Forest Law  School in 1978.   Her husband Chip, whom she married, I think, in 1977, was a  transactions lawyer. She raised her family in Greensboro, NC. If you go  30 or 40 miles north of Greensboro, you are in Virginia, and that is  where I grew up, in Danville, VA.   When I first met her, we kind of talked about her background in the  Navy and her father, and we talked about Lakeland, FL, and my affinity  for the Detroit Tigers, who have trained there for decades. We talked  about her raising her family in Greensboro. I spent a lot of my  childhood in Danville, just north of Greensboro.   I told her a story about going to Greensboro with my dad, as a kid,  and we got ourselves a hunting dog from Greensboro, where she raised  her family.   She leaves behind three kids--Jeanette, who was named after her  mother, Tilden, and Carrie. She also is a grandmother of five  grandchildren whom she loved and adored.   Before she got into politics she worked in the financial industry.  She became vice president of what was then North Carolina National Bank  and went on to become today part of Bank of America.   She worked as a campaign manager for a guy named Jim Hunt. Jim Hunt  was Governor for 8 years. In North Carolina, you can be Governor for 8  years, and you have to step down, or you can come back and be elected  again. He was elected for another 8 years. She worked for Jim Hunt, a  great education Governor, who always surrounded himself with just the  best people in the world. I treasured serving as a Governor with him  and his friendship, and the fact that she had been his campaign manager  endeared her to me.   She was first elected to office, I think, when she was elected to the  North Carolina General Assembly, not as a State representative but she  was elected as a State senator. She served, I think, five terms,  representing Guilford County down in North Carolina.   She ran for the Senate in 2008 against Elizabeth Dole, another person  for whom I had great affection, as I did for her husband, Bob. Both of  them actually served here in the Senate, Bob and Elizabeth Dole.  Elizabeth is from North Carolina.   We were fond of her, and when the two of them ran against each other,  it was tough, but stuff like that happens. Kay won, and she came here  and served for 6 years until 2015.   She left the Senate in 2014. She was defeated by Thom Tillis, who  serves here today. She lost by, I think, less than 50,000 votes, so it  was a close vote. After her term ended in the Senate, she went on to  work as a fellow at the Harvard Institute of Politics and a senior  policy consultant at a law firm, Akin Gump.   She died October 28 of this year, 3 days ago, of encephalitis caused  by a virus she contracted from a tick bite, and it is something that  happened in 2016, and it was 3 years later that she finally died, which  is very, very sad.   She was the second female Senator from North Carolina--first female  Democrat to be elected from North Carolina to the Senate, the first  female Democrat. She served, while she was here, on a number of  committees. I did not have the pleasure of serving with her at the same  time. She was on Armed Services. There is a lot of military in North  Carolina, especially the Marines there on the East Coast.   But she was on the Banking Committee. She joined the committee after  I left to be a member of the Finance Committee. She served on the  Health, Education, Labor, and Pension Committee and Small Business and  Entrepreneurship.   In 6 years, you vote on a lot of amendments, you vote on a lot of  bills, you offer a lot of bills and amendments. She did all of that,  and I just wanted to focus on one thing that she supported and worked  on. She was a person who believed that we have a moral obligation to  the least of these in our society. Matthew 25 speaks to a moral  obligation--when people are hungry, what we should do about it, when  they are naked or thirsty, what are our obligations, regardless of our  faith.   Matthew 25 states: When I was hungry, did you feed me? When I was  naked, did you clothe me? When I was thirsty, did you give me drink?  When I was sick or in prison, did you visit me? When I was a stranger  in your land, did you walk with me?   And she answered all of those questions: Yes, yes, yes.   She was somebody that thought we had moral obligations for the least  of these, but since we didn't have unlimited amounts of money, we just  couldn't waste our money, and we had to spend it effectively. She  believed that we should not just give a person a fish and feed them for  a day, but teach a person to fish and they would feed themselves for a  lifetime.   She was a fitness buff. I love to work out, and my wife loves to work  out, and she did too. I think that is one of the reasons that she was  able to fight this disease and fight it off as long as she did. There  is a gym here that used to be little. It is a little bigger that it  used to be. The one in the House is much bigger; they have a lot more  people.   But they have a little swimming pool at the gym here, and I have  never used it. For years, it was just men only. In fact, for years  there was not even an opportunity for women in the Senate to actually  have a fitness center to work out. She changed that. She led the fight  to change that. I think when she lost her race in 2014 and the women in  the Senate threw her a goodbye party, they did it at the pool and in  the fitness center down in the basement of the Russell building.   In the 1970s, she was an intern in the Capitol--and we have some  pages here. I don't think she was ever a page, but later she was an  intern. She became an elevator operator. I am not sure if Harry Reid,  who was our majority leader and minority leader here, he was an  elevator operator, but there was sort of a pecking order, starting with  pages at a very young age and interns later on, and then they become an  elevator operator and have some other jobs here and then go off to do  amazing things with their life.   And she certainly did that. She was operating an elevator here in the  Senate that carried Senators, including her uncle Lawton Chiles, who I  mentioned earlier.   Joe Biden visited Kay Hagan in North Carolina the day before her  death--that would have been 4 days ago--and what Joe said of Kay is  that she was a crucial partner in passing the Affordable Care Act and  the stimulus package which got us off of our back when we were going  through the worst recession since the Great Depression. Joe said that  ``She was a crucial partner'' in passing the Affordable Care Act, which  passed by one vote, and she was that one vote. I think she was probably  prouder of that vote than anything that she did when she served here.   I want to segue from Kay, but before I do, she was always interested  in figuring out the right things to do, not what was easy or expedient.  She was always asking what is the right thing to do. I remember her  being here and other Senators--Democrats and Republicans--and we were  trying to figure out what to do on a particular issue. She would always  say: What is the right thing to do?   She was one of those people who had deep faith, and she believed not  only do we have a moral obligation to the least of these, but she  thought that we ought to treat other people the way we wanted to be  treated, and that is the Golden Rule.   As it turns out, about a week ago, I was invited to worship in a  Hindu worship service in Delaware with a congregation of a thousand  people, and I was reminded there that the Golden  [[Page S6355]]  Rule--to treat other people the way we want to be treated--is part of  every major religion, the Golden Rule. I do not care if you are  Catholic, I do not care if you are a Jew, I do not care if you are a  Muslim, Hindu, some form of the Golden Rule is right there. She was a  big proponent of the Golden Rule, and that was the work of her life.   She was also one of those people who focused on excellence in  everything she did. She was committed to doing things well and wanted  to be surrounded by staff that did things well. When thing would go  well for her and she would do a good job, she would always give credit  to her team. When her team would fall short, she was not one of those  people who blamed the team; she blamed herself.   Another thing I would say is she just didn't give up. She was  tenacious--not very tall, not tall in stature, but, boy, was she  tenacious. She showed this especially by the way she fought for her  life to the very end 3 days ago.   I want to talk just a little about her vote on the Affordable Care  Act and why she thought it was the right thing to do. Matthew 25 does  not say anything about: I was lame and you gave me healthcare or access  to healthcare. My own source of healthcare was the hospital, what did  you do about it? That doesn't say that in the New Testament.   But I think the implication is clear. We have an obligation--I think  a moral obligation to try to make sure everybody has access to  healthcare and, hopefully, to affordable healthcare. That is what we  tried to do with the Affordable Care Act, and that is why she supported  it.   Sometimes people think the Affordable Care Act is just the exchanges,  just the marketplaces. Every State has an exchange or marketplace that  is there. It is sort of like a purchasing pool for healthcare that  people can become a part of. If they don't work for an employer who  provides healthcare, that is issued by the employer, and they are not  old enough for Medicare or their income level is too high to allow them  to participate in Medicaid and, in those cases, they have to find some  way to get access to healthcare.   Back in 1993, the Republican Senator from Rhode Island, John Chafee-- who is also a Navy guy, later Secretary of the Navy--he introduced  legislation here in the Senate in 1993 as a Republican response to  something Hillary Clinton was doing during her husband's administration  that was working to find ways to make sure that everybody had access to  healthcare in this country.   We worked on something called HillaryCare, and the Republicans  ridiculed her efforts and those around her. She said basically in  response: What is your idea? What is your idea?   The response was by Senator Chafee, joined by 22 or 23 Republican  Senators, and part of what they came up with is that every State should  have an exchange and every State should have the ability to set up the  purchasing pool in their State. People who didn't have coverage could  get their coverage in the exchanges.   Neither one was turned into law, but about 10, 12 years later, the  new Governor of Massachusetts, Mitt Romney, took the idea of the  exchanges and introduced the Mitt Romney Care so that the people in his  State would have the opportunity to sign up for the coverage in their  exchange.   We wrote the Affordable Care Act, we did it, and we took good ideas  from all over the country and all over the world to provide healthcare  to people that was affordable. One of the ideas that we stole to put in  the Affordable Care Act was Governor Romney's idea of the exchanges.   And you know what? It was a good idea. It was a good idea. The first  few years of RomneyCare in Massachusetts, they did a pretty good job of  extending coverage. They did not do such a good job initially on  affordability, and they kept trying, and they finally figured it out-- competition in the marketplace, in the exchange, and more insurance  companies providing, participating, and this worked well. We found in  the first 2 years that the Affordable Care Act was standing up the  exchanges 7, 8, or 9 years ago that it was a challenge. It was  difficult.   What has happened now is the insurers are starting to figure it out.  They priced too high. The States have come up with ways to buy down the  risks for the insurers and to make a number of States' health insurance  in the exchanges more affordable, so that more people can actually  afford that help.   I would just close this here. The majority leader is standing here  waiting to speak, so I will just close if I can by saying after a  number of years seeing the cost of healthcare coverages in exchanges  across the country go up, up, up--sometimes by double-digit rates--the  insurance companies were trying to figure out how to price health  insurance for people who have not had health insurance for years. It  took them several years to figure it out, but they finally, for the  most part, have. The cost of healthcare in exchanges doesn't go up by  double-digit rates anymore.   In fact, we have 20 or more States now where the cost of healthcare  coverage in the exchange is only going up a couple of percentage  points, maybe less. In a half-dozen States, the cost of healthcare in  the exchanges is actually going down. In the State of Delaware, when  the exchanges open up tomorrow, the people will sign up for the  healthcare exchange in Delaware, the price will not be going up next  year. It will be going down by 19 percent. There are six other States  where the consumer experience is similar, and that is encouraging.   A lot more insurance companies are offering coverage in the States,  23 last year and 45 this year--and that is going to introduce  competition and, we hope, a cycle that will allow more people to get  better coverage for a lower price.   So, Kay Hagan, we miss you, and we considered it a privilege to have  served with you here. Something good has come out of something very  difficult. The passage of the Affordable Care Act was hard. It has been  hard finding a way forward since then, but I think better days lie  ahead, and market forces are starting to work, and that is a good  thing.   And with that, I will yield the floor.
