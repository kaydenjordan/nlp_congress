 Mr. President, today, I would like to recognize  COL Douglas B. Guttormsen on the occasion of his retirement from the  Kansas City District Commander for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. He  has diligently served in this role for 3 years.   After earning degrees from the U.S. Military Academy at West Point,  the University of Missouri at Rolla, the National Defense University,  and the U.S. Army Command and General Staff College, Colonel Guttormsen  went on to lead engineering battalions across the United States and  around the world. In addition to these assignments, he served in combat  operations in Iraq and the Republic of Korea.   As commander of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Kansas City  District, Colonel Guttormsen has overseen many military and civil works  projects throughout the district. From directing construction projects  at the region's military installations to ensuring the levees and dams  are structurally sound, Colonel Guttormsen has demonstrated able and  consistent leadership.   Although his resume boasts many accomplishments, Colonel Guttormsen's  work leading the emergency operations center, which plays a vital role  in responding to natural disasters whenever and wherever they may  occur, is most impressive.   This spring, when facing extensive rainfall and severe flooding, he  and the entire Kansas City District staff worked around the clock to  respond to levee breaches and assist affected communities. Colonel  Guttormsen also participated in the Missouri River Flood Forum that  Congressman Steve Watkins and I hosted in May, where we saw the  extensive flooding at the 4-State Lookout Point in Kansas and then  spoke alongside the Department of Agriculture and answered questions  from community members.   Colonel Guttormsen is a true professional and has exhibited  remarkable leadership during his time as the U.S. Army Corps of  Engineers Kansas City District commander. I trust my fellow members  will join me in congratulating him and wishing him well in the days to  come.                            ____________________
