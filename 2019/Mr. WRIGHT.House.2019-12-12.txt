 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in staunch opposition to H.R.  3.   I can add to what my colleagues have said with statistics and  legalese, but I would rather offer you my personal experience.   I was diagnosed with Stage 4 lung cancer. I was told that the average  life expectancy was 16 months. That was 16 months ago. By the grace of  Almighty God and American biotech ingenuity, I am still here, and I  will get to spend another Christmas with my family.   I was prescribed a rigorous regimen of chemotherapy and an  immunotherapy wonder-drug called Keytruda, which had only just been  approved for my regimen in May of 2017. Keytruda's discovery is as a  result of significant financial investment by the private sector, not  the government. Today, I feel great. My last CAT scan showed nothing in  my liver and lymph nodes, and the primary tumor had shrunk to about the  size of a raisin.   Now, 5 years ago, my diagnosis would have been a death sentence.  Today, I am beating it. Millions of Americans are diagnosed with life- threatening illnesses every year. And thanks to medical innovation in  the United States, miraculous outcomes like mine are not uncommon  either.   If H.R. 3 becomes law, stories like mine would be rare. If these  socialist policies had been implemented earlier, I probably would not  be here. For too many in this Chamber, this has become part of their  political agenda, but for me and millions of Americans, this is a  matter of life or death.   H.R. 3 will not save American lives. It will end them. I urge my  colleagues to think of their loved ones who will face deadly diseases  in the future. Many cures are on the horizon. We cannot stop. We cannot  slow down. We cannot stifle research and development of new cures by  onerous government control. Too many lives hang in the balance.   Mr. Speaker, I beg my colleagues to support this motion to recommit,  and let's take action that will actually save lives.
