 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this legislation and thank  Congresswoman McBath and Congressman Carbajal for the great work they  have done to put this together.   Red flag laws are supported by a majority of Americans and nearly 70  percent of gun owners. Red flag laws provide an opportunity for an  intervention if someone demonstrates that they are a danger to  themselves or to others. California's red flag laws have been used 21  times to prevent mass shootings.   The bill we are considering today was originally authored by Senator  Lindsey Graham, a Republican, and is very similar to the Florida red  flag bill that was signed by then-Governor Rick Scott, also a  Republican, and today a U.S. Senator. Neither of those two have ever  been accused of being antigun or anti-Constitution.   We know red flag laws save lives and we know the issues raised by the  other side of the aisle are a stretch at best. If someone files a false  complaint, they are subject to a $5,000 fine and 5 years in jail. This  bill will save lives, and I urge you to vote ``yes.''   The only real question is how much more bloodshed is needed to spur  us to do the right thing and help us keep our kids and our communities  safe.   Please vote ``yes'' on this bill.
