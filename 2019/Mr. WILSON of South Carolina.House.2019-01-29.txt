 Mr. Speaker, this past weekend, the  world paused to commemorate International Holocaust Remembrance Day.  Millions of Jews were mercilessly killed as part of what the Nazis  called their final solution to the Jewish problem. This happened just  74 years ago, though many seem to forget.   From the ashes, Jewish people returned to their ancient homeland and  established a dynamic democracy in the Middle East. Unfortunately, the  Jewish people of Israel are again targets of extermination. Just  yesterday, the deputy head of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps  called to erase Israel from the global political map.   We must honor the memories of the 6 million murdered by Nazis by  vowing that Jews will never again be threatened with extermination. The  American people stand with Israel as proven by the embassy being  established in Jerusalem where I led the House delegation May 14.   We remember, and we vow: never again.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.                            ____________________
