 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight  Elizabeth City State University, an HBCU that understands the  importance of educating and empowering remarkable leaders.   This year, Elizabeth City State University will celebrate 133 years  of service and, over those years, the university has left a significant  mark on our district, State, and Nation.   Mr. Speaker, Elizabeth City State University is home to the only 4- year aviation science program in North Carolina. I am proud of students  such as Aleathia Hudson, who is not only a student in this program, but  was my special guest for the State of the Union.   Mr. Speaker, we must continue to help provide resources for Elizabeth  City State University, those resources they deserve to be successful.   I commend Chancellor Karrie Dixon for her commitment to preparing the  next generation of Viking leaders for their future.   Viking pride.                            ____________________
