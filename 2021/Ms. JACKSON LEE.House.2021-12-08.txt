 Mr. Speaker, in this holiday season, a time of joy,  there are still families who are mourning the tragedy of loss of their  beautiful, precious students in Oakland County, Michigan. What a  suffering time.   In this place where our voices speak volumes, two Members decided to  show their holiday spirit by exhibiting their families with any manner  of weapons, AK-47s and otherwise, automatic weapons.   How they thought that this was the volume that should be heard from  this place, I do not know. But I really condemn this kind of attitude  and this kind of volume that generates into violence.   We have a responsibility as we take an oath in this place to not only  uphold the laws of the land but to be role models for the American  people. Guns in the holiday season in the midst of precious souls who  died--enough is enough.   Pass real gun safety laws and pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act.  Elections count. Enough is enough. Let us act like those who have taken  an oath to serve this Nation.                            ____________________
