 Mr. President, fellow Senators, today, in a few moments,  we are going to consider S.J. Res. 20, which is a joint resolution that  it prohibits the sales of munitions to Bahrain. Actually, we are going  to consider a motion to discharge, and the same is true of S.J. Res.  26, which is a joint resolution that prohibits the issuance of a letter  of offer with respect to the proposed sale to Qatar of 24 helicopters.   I strongly urge my colleagues to consider these sales on their own  merits and to avoid conflating these with unrelated controversies over  the administration's recent emergency declarations. They are not  related. They are different matters.   These sales--the two that we are talking about regarding Bahrain and  Qatar--address the legitimate security interests of both countries and  strengthen the U.S. partnerships with both countries and support shared  efforts to deter Iran. Congress should support these sales. The news  this morning of attacks on two more civilian oil tankers in the Gulf of  Oman lend further weight to the conclusion that our allies and partners  in the region need greater capabilities to share the burden of defense  in support of our mutual security interests.   The State Department notified these sales in the standard process,  and the chairs and ranking members of both House and Senate committees  approved them last month.   The sale to Qatar is not related to the activities of the Saudi-led  coalition in Yemen. Denying this sale will not punish Saudi Arabia or  influence its actions in Yemen, as Qatar ceased its participation in  the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen 2 years ago. I think that is very  important because there is a lot of discussion up here, as there should  be, regarding the hostilities in Yemen, but they are not related at all  to the matters we are dealing with today.   Bahrain has not been implicated in any inappropriate strikes in Yemen  and has focused on defensive operations, including border security. The  Royal Bahraini Air Force patrols Saudi Arabia's borders to counter  incursions from Yemen into Saudi Arabia. Just this week, we saw how  real these threats are, as a missile from the Iranian-supported Houthis  wounded 26 civilians at a civilian airport. Denying this sale will not  punish Saudi Arabia or influence its actions in Yemen.   As the ranking member said regarding the resolution brought up last  November, this vote is not Yemen, it is not Saudi Arabia, and it is not  the UAE. It is Bahrain. Bahrain is a critical ally to us, and there is  absolutely no question about that. These sales will help Qatar and  Bahrain rightfully assume the burden of their own defense and relieve  U.S. forces that have been providing support. The helicopters will  enable the Qataris to provide for their own defense against threats to  its vital infrastructure. The munitions are critical for Bahrain's F- 16s and essential to any plans to defend Bahrain. The United States has  critical and strategic interests in both of these matters.   In addition to Qatar and Bahrain taking increasing responsibility for  their own defense, they are taking an increasingly prominent role in  U.S.-led coalition operations. Importantly, Qatari fighters conduct  joint air patrols with U.S. forces to deter Iran.   Qatar contributes more Naval forces to coalition patrols of the  Arabian Gulf than any of its neighbors. Qatar C-17s have moved more  than 3 million pounds of cargo in direct support of coalition  operations in Syria, Iraq, and Afghanistan and is expanding its tanker  fleet to become the No. 2 provider of coalition air refueling, ahead of  the British.   Bahrain has also contributed to stability in the region. Bahrain has  been the key mediator in opening relations between the Gulf Cooperation  Council and Iraq and contributes to counter-mine, counter-piracy, and  intelligence sharing in support of regional security.   The United States named Bahrain a major non-NATO ally in 2002, and  since then, they have lived up to that designation. Bahrain holds 7,000  U.S. troops in its borders, including the U.S. Navy's Fifth Fleet, and  it is home to the only U.S. naval base in the Middle East.   For its part, Qatar hosts 10,000 U.S. forces and is home to the  regional headquarters of U.S. forces, including air and special  operations. Qatar provides access to key logistic nodes and overflight  rights for U.S. aircraft. It has already invested more than $8 billion  to develop Al Udied Air Base and is now providing more than $3 billion  to upgrade U.S. facilities there to meet specific requirements of the  United States. The Qataris are also providing $200 million a year to  sustain these facilities. Duplicating or recreating the facilities in  Qatar would result in a sizable and needless bill to the U.S. taxpayer.   In recent years, Qatar and Bahrain have worked to strengthen  cooperation with the United States on countering the financing of  terrorism. As part of these efforts, Qatar has agreed to increase the  sharing of information on terrorist financiers in the region, to place  greater emphasis on preventing terrorist financing abuse in the  charitable and money services business sectors, and develop a domestic  designation regime in line with international standards. Bahrain, too,  is a significant partner in cutting off terrorist financing and has  assisted in blocking Iranian efforts to circumvent sanctions.   Meanwhile, the credibility of the United States as a partner of  choice is on the line. If the United States cannot reliably sell its  partners weapons that are vital for defense, these partners will turn  by necessity to China and Russia.   The United States recently sent 1,500 more troops into the theater in  protection of U.S. forces. As we ask partners like Qatar and Bahrain  for their support in protecting their own forces, we should support  them as they seek greater capabilities to protect themselves.   In November, this body concluded that blocking sales to Bahrain over  an unrelated issue was inappropriate and did not make sense. I urge my  colleagues in the strongest possible terms to reach the same  conclusions in this case.   In closing, these sales should be considered on their own merits and  should not be entangled with unrelated controversy. These sales address  Qatar and Bahrain's legitimate security interests, strengthen U.S.  partnership with Qatar and Bahrain, and, importantly, they deter Iran.   I support these sales. I urge my colleagues to do the same. As we can  see from what I have said here, these sales are minimal, really, in the  overall scheme of what these countries are doing to help us. We should  show these countries that indeed we are reliable partners, we are good  friends, and we deeply appreciate their efforts to promote the same  interests the United States of America has in the region.   Thank you, Mr. President.   I yield the floor.                   Vote on Motion to Discharge S.J. Res. 20
