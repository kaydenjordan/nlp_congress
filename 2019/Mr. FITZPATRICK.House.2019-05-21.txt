 Madam Speaker, it is with a heavy heart that I rise  today to honor the life and memory of Trooper Donald C. Brackett, a  dedicated law enforcement professional with the Pennsylvania State  Police. Trooper Brackett passed away while on duty Saturday morning at  the age of 58.   Our Nation just recognized National Police Week, a time to reflect  upon and honor the sacrifices made by the men and women in law  enforcement. Trooper Brackett was no exception.   A resident of Bensalem, Trooper Brackett served nearly 18 years in  the United States Marine Corps and enlisted in the Pennsylvania State  Police in October of 2001. He was most recently assigned to the patrol  section of Troop T, King of Prussia, and was previously assigned to  Troop K, Media, and Troop M in Trevose throughout his distinguished  career.   Madam Speaker, Trooper Brackett lived his life in service to our  Nation and to our community. He is truly an American hero, and I send  my deepest condolences to his wife, Marta, and his children, Gabriella  and Brianna.   Trooper Brackett lived his entire life in service to our community.  He set the example for our entire Nation to follow.                      In Recognition of Paul Steklenski     Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize a native of  Perkasie in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, who is promoting animal welfare  through the nonprofit organization he established 4 years ago.   Paul Steklenski, an Army veteran and a network engineer, founded  Flying Fur Animal Rescue in 2015. Flying his 1970 Beechcraft single- engine airplane, Paul transports shelter animals, mostly dogs, at risk  of being euthanized to rescue groups along the East Coast. To date,  Paul estimates he has saved the lives of over 1,300 animals in need.   Paul credits Rick Witt, who helps manage the operations at Doylestown  Airport, for the success of this organization. Rick allows Paul to use  the original aircraft he used to transport the animals.   Madam Speaker, I applaud the work of Flying Fur Animal Rescue and  thank Paul for his work. I encourage all of us to follow his lead of  being a voice for the voiceless.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise to recognize an outstanding  nonprofit organization in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, that is  serving individuals in need in our community.   Brush With the law, based in Montgomeryville, was founded as a visual  arts program at the Montgomery County Correctional Facility in 2013.  The program quickly grew popular and was transitioned into one that  helps marginalized individuals trying to reenter society.   Brush With the Law works with municipalities and small businesses in  their endeavors, which involves creation of conceptual art  installations to beautify our community. These installations seek to  raise awareness for issues important to local residents, such as drug  addiction, homelessness, and climate change. The principal goal of  Brush With the Law is to bring people together, a vision which we all  should applaud.   I would like to recognize the founder and director, Maria Maneos of  North Wales, for her leadership and for her work in empowering our  community.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise today with enthusiasm and  gratitude that exactly 100 years to the day this very body passed the  19th Amendment which guaranteed women the right to vote.   This decision was a critical step forward, a major development in a  representative government to empower millions of Americans and allow  them access to the fundamental freedoms enshrined in our Constitution.   The passage of the 19th Amendment was an important turning point, and  the culmination of decades of fervent activism by members of the  women's suffrage movement and their allies. Their vision and their  tenacity paved the way for generations of leaders who would follow.   And in their honor, I am proud to be the co-lead of H.R. 1980, the  Smithsonian Women's History Museum Act, along with my friend and  colleague, Carolyn Maloney from New York, to give these pioneers proper  recognition by constructing a National Women's History Museum on the  National Mall.   Madam Speaker, I am privileged today to be a Member of this House at  such a monumental time where there are more women serving in the House  of Representatives than ever before. I am proud to serve with them and  to honor this centennial anniversary by their side.                            ____________________
