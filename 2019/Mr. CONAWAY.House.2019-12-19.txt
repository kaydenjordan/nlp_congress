 Madam Speaker, I appreciate my colleague from Texas for  yielding. I am certainly glad this day has finally arrived and to stand  with American farmers by passing the USMCA.   For the last year, Democrats obsessed over a partisan impeachment  process while President Trump remained focused on securing the wins  that American farmers were counting on.   For our farm families, passing USMCA means an annual increase of $2.2  billion in agriculture exports. It also means we gain about 176,000  quality jobs for Americans. The USMCA resets our trading relationships  with Mexico and Canada, improves our farmers' market access to these  two important trading partners, and strips away nontariff barriers that  prevent free and fair trade.   I commend President Trump, Ambassador Lighthizer, and Ambassador Doud  for their tireless work on this agreement, in all its stages. Our  farmers and ranchers were counting on them, and they delivered.   The near-universal support in the agricultural community for USMCA  speaks volumes about the importance of this trade deal. I urge my  colleagues to join me in supporting America's farmers and ranchers by  voting to pass the USMCA.
