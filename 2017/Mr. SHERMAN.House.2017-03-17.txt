 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of the memory of my  good friend of nearly three decades, Michael Jay Grobstein of Encino,  California, who passed away Wednesday, March 8.   Michael died at home, surrounded by his loving family, including his  wife of 53 years, Barrie; his children, Marla and Marc; and his  grandchildren, Miranda and Avery.   Fifty years ago, as a young and talented CPA, Michael founded a CPA  firm which grew to be the largest accounting firm in the San Fernando  Valley, Grobstein and Horwath. In that role, he provided financial and  strategic advice to businesses throughout southern California, and  beyond. There are thousands of people who are employed today at  businesses that Michael guided with insight and wisdom.   Michael served as a founding member and president of The Executives,  a group of business leaders in the Valley formed to support the Jewish  Home for the Aging, where my own mother lives, along with hundreds of  those enjoying their senior years. For that effort, Barrie and Michael  earned the Circle of Life Award.   As lifelong residents of the Valley, both Michael and Barrie were  involved in many charities, including the Junior Blind of America, the  Grossman Burn Foundation, City of Hope, Cal State University  Northridge, Sherman Oaks Hospital, and the Sheriff's Youth Foundation.   Above all, Michael was an example of one of San Fernando Valley's  finest community leaders, and he was a good friend. He will be missed.                            ____________________
