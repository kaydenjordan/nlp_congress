 Madam Speaker, we heard a little bit about inflation,  and we are going to talk about the economy a little bit more.   As has been widely reported, inflation is at a 40-year high, the  worst it has been since 1981. Over 8 percent. However, I feel that we  are doing a disservice to the current situation to pretend that  inflation is only 8.3 percent.   In the official figures they talk about housing going up 5\1/2\  percent. Does anybody think the cost of housing has only gone up 5\1/2\  percent in the last year? I  [[Page H5483]]  know somebody who builds houses; the cost of a new house that he sells  has gone up over 25 percent in the last year.   We look at interest which has to be eaten by landlords or a person  buying a house that has gone up from 2\1/2\ percent on a house to 4\1/ 2\ percent in a year. That doesn't sound like any 5\1/2\ percent to me.   You look at, anecdotally, how much rent has gone up. You look at  assessments, how much they have gone up on property taxes. In  Wisconsin, I am told it is not unusual to find 10 to 20 percent  increases in assessments.   When politicians talk about this 8.3 figure, I think it is really a  lot higher than that. There is no way the cost of housing and rentals  in this country has only gone up 5\1/2\ percent in the last year.   I also had the pleasure in the last few days to talk to people in the  automobile industry. The official numbers say used cars have gone up  16.1 percent in the last year. Where are you going to find that? People  I know in the automotive retail industry talk about used cars going up  30 or 40 percent in the last year.   First of all, we ought to be honest with the American people. When we  talk about inflation at 8.3 percent, it is a lot higher than that.   Now, in order to correct it, we have to look at the cause. What is  the cause?   We can start with the American Rescue Plan, one of the first things  President Biden did. Larry Summers, an economist for President Obama  called it the ``least responsible'' macroeconomic policy in the last 40  years. So they had advanced warning. The expert who worked under Barack  Obama told them this was going to be irresponsible, but what did they  do? They charged ahead anyway, spending another $1.9 trillion the  taxpayers didn't have.                                time  2140    And not long after that we got the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs  Act. Nice sounding, wasn't it? American Rescue and Infrastructure  Investment and Jobs Act. I always think it is kind of interesting the  way they come up with names of irresponsible bills under here. That was  another $1.2 trillion.   Between these two bills--at a time where it was so important that  Congress stop spending money--we hit the gas for another $3 trillion.  If it weren't for our friends, the Senators from Arizona and West  Virginia, they would have doubled that with a Build Back Better bill  for another $4 trillion. I beg you all, please stop spending.   In any event, the American Rescue Plan and the Infrastructure  Investment and Jobs Act, I think, are more than anything responsible  for the out-of-control inflation. I believe they are artificially  holding down the numbers to only 8.3 percent.   When I talk to people back home, particularly on housing,  particularly on used cars, to a certain extent on food, I think those  numbers are artificially low. I think it is higher than that.   People say: What can we do to get things back to where they should  be? We just have to work our way back from that level of  irresponsibility. Right now we are working on the budget for calendar  year 2023. In that budget we have a 13.5 percent increase in nondefense  discretionary spending. The days of 13.5 percent increases have got to  be over. That number has to be reduced to zero, and I mean zero for  defense as well.   We all know there are things in the defense budget that--at least  rumors are--that are done more to benefit the people who are making the  equipment than are actually going to be helpful in an all-out war.   My suggestion is for both sides to agree that inflation is out of  control. To recognize the only way to get it under control is to stop  having the Fed print money and to show the rest of the world that we  can contain things by committing ourselves to a zero percent increase  in discretionary spending for 2023.   Part of the problem here, too, by the way, is the press corps. I  don't know if the press corps ever listens to us here. If the press  corps wants to make a name for itself--as people with journalism  degrees used to--they can do some poking around on that 8.3 percent and  do their own research by talking to car dealers, by talking to people  who build housing, and by talking to landlords. They can find out, is  that 5.5 percent housing cost up in the last year, is that accurate, or  is the government trying to pull somebody's leg? I know the answer, and  it is time the press corps stops allowing people to get away with it.   Madam Speaker, the second issue that I think has been underreported  is what is going on in Ukraine. We last had a briefing, for Congress  collectively on Ukraine, on March 30, 2022. I want to know, and I would  like to request right now of the majority party another briefing, by  that I mean representatives from the Department of Defense and  representatives from the State Department, to see how exactly we are  going to get out of this.   I voted for more money for the plan because I felt that it is  important for America to appear united, and in that vote, we knew it  was going to pass. We know the majority party wanted a commitment to  make sure that Ukraine was not short of munitions.   However, I think it is important for the majority party to bring  representatives of the key departments before Congress as a whole. The  reason I would like to talk to them is I don't think enough has been  talked about this. Are they working toward ending this war or not?   We all know there are people in this building who, for whatever  reason, seem to want to heighten the tensions in the war and get more  American troops over there. There are the responsible people--of which  I will classify myself as one--in which they want to work toward some  sort of peace treaty here before things get even more out of control.   We are dealing with a country, Russia, that has the ability to create  economic havoc all over Western Europe, and, quite frankly, economic  and human dislocations in the United States.   We should be briefed to see where the administration is on this  topic. These are confidential briefings. In the past, I have sometimes  gotten answers I like, and sometimes I have gotten answers I don't  like. It would be good if the administration would hear from Congress  and see what they want.   Do they want this war heightened--tensions heightened? Do they want  the United States to provide troops as backup here? Do they want the  administration to be working toward an end to the war?   As I said before, we are dealing with two countries who have  problems. Their birth rates are low. Ukraine has the second lowest  birth rate of the 100 largest countries in the world. Russia's birth  rate is not that high either. Both countries have people leaving their  countries, sometimes to the United States and sometimes other places.   In any event, I would like to make a request to the majority party  that we, one more time, be briefed collectively to see what is going  on. I think, by the way, that is something that our incurious press  corps ought to be looking at as well.   Madam Speaker, the next thing I would like to address--not one of my  top 20 topics--but for the mainstream media, they feel what happened  January 6, 2021, is very important. It is important. We are having a  committee on it.   I don't think I would rather spend my time on the committee. I would  rather spend my time fighting inflation, trying to find solutions to  the Ukraine problem, trying to find solutions to the border, trying to  do something about the huge number of people who are dying of drug  overdoses in this country.   Nevertheless, it is in the news that a committee is looking into what  happened on January 6. I feel it is important to put all the cards on  the table, and it is important that America know exactly all we have  available to determine what happened on January 6.    A considerable time ago, me and two congressmen--8 months ago-- myself, Congressman Norman from South Carolina, and Congressman Gohmert  from Texas wrote a letter to Merrick Garland and asked the Department  of Justice to release any footage of tapes as far as what went on here  that day. Unless it is going to be released, we really don't know all  we should know.   I am sure there are both Democrats and Republicans who would like to  [[Page H5484]]  know all we have as far as what actually happened that day. What tapes  were available because they are taking picture of us all the time from  this building.   To my dismay, 8 months later, the Department of Justice has still not  answered our plea for these tapes. Eventually it gets beyond the idea  of just we want everything to be available, people begin to think that  the Department of Justice is hiding something.   Madam Speaker, I will make the request verbally and eventually follow  up with some sort of written document asking the Department of Justice  to release all the video footage of what happened in and around this  building on January 6. I think until it is released there are going to  be members of the public who believe that something is being hidden  that day. Right now it is part of this country's history, but I see no  reason to continue this game of not allowing the American public to  know what the Justice Department must already know about what happened  that day.   By the way, I also feel if Congresswoman Cheney wants to be a little  bit of an asset on that committee because she has a bigger mouthpiece  than myself, she could demand and create a little bit of a raucous on  that committee and demand to see all these tapes, so we know who really  was behind things and what to make of various theories that are out  there.                                time  2150    That is another issue that the press corps back in the good old days,  where they liked to report on what is going on in this country, would  routinely be against secrecy in government and would demand that those  tapes be released. I do not know where the press corps is. They have  the potential to improve this country, but they don't like to get out  there and apparently inform the people. And they are not adequately  skeptical of people in power.   Now I will address another issue that I think the press corps ought  to be picking up and the American public ought to know more about. I  have addressed COVID many times. Over 1 million people have died. When  COVID broke, several briefings were held for all Congressmen and others  for the Oversight and Reform Committee on which I serve. I would bet in  the first 3 months of the COVID crisis I must have attended five or six  hearings in which I had a chance to talk to the relative experts,  Anthony Fauci and others, about COVID.   Then we switched to an isolated, small subcommittee where only a  small fraction of the people in this Congress got a chance to ask  questions. And at that time, with the rest of us left out, I think  there are a lot of topics that the press should be looking into that we  would have a chance to ask questions about but are not being asked.   As I said, when over 1 million Americans have died, I would think the  press would express an interest. I, many times before, have stood at  this microphone and talked about the benefits of vitamin D, and experts  beginning two Septembers ago, well before the vaccine was even  released, were putting papers out there saying how much vitamin D could  prevent deaths. Now people who don't like to push vitamin D will say  that the studies out there only show correlation, not causation. But  the same thing could be said about other things that clearly are  connected with COVID deaths.   Recently, Dr. Amiel Dror of Israel found that people with vitamin D  levels under 20 nanograms per milliliter were 11 times more likely to  die than people who weren't.   Isn't that something interesting?   Can you imagine, Madam Speaker, how many less people would have died  if the public health establishment and the medical establishment had  pushed vitamin D initially?   This study is interesting and consistent with prior studies.   Where is the medical establishment?   Where is the public health establishment in either pushing vitamin D  or apologizing for not pushing it in the past?   By the way, when calculating vitamin D deficiency--which they are  calculating at 20 nanograms per milliliter, not very much--84 percent-- I don't like talking about race; I don't think America is this horrible  racist country that some people on the other side of the aisle claim-- but when calculating vitamin D deficiency, about 84 percent of Blacks  in the country are vitamin D deficient compared to 35 percent of  Whites. Blacks are 70 percent more likely to die of COVID. Every expert  I have talked to believes the reason of heightened deaths in the Black  community is the result of a lack of vitamin D.   By the way, it is even higher among Native Americans.   I do not know why the public health establishment and the politicians  have not gone out of their way to share these numbers with people of  color. All Americans should have been alerted to the benefit of vitamin  D. All people over age 60 should have been given a vitamin D test to  see if they were under that 20 nanograms threshold. I think anyone of  color regardless of age should be given the test. But for whatever  reason, no money was put into this, not a lot was publicized.   One million Americans died. Black Americans were 70 percent more  likely to die than White Americans, and nothing was done. I think that  is a scandal. I think we ought to have more hearings before Congress  collectively so we can have a chance to ask the public health  establishment why they were dropping the ball here.   I think the American press corps--which was asleep at the switch  here--should have been publicizing these numbers a lot more. And the  American press corps should have been out there asking questions to  Anthony Fauci and the other bureaucrats as to why it was not more  publicized and why didn't they specifically highlight the increased  number of deaths among people of color.   I personally believe if it was the other way around, they might have  been a little bit more forthright in explaining what is going on and  the degree to which a lack of vitamin D correlated with additional  deaths from COVID.   One other thing for the subcommittee to look at, if they get done  talking about vitamin D, now that COVID is a lot less likely to lead to  death, recently a new drug called Paxlovid was introduced. You can get  a 5-day dosage of that drug, which is recommended, for $530. It is not  cheap. Pfizer right now, I am told, expects to earn $27 billion dollars  in sales from Paxlovid--$27 billion. That is a lot of money. They made  a lot of money on other things as well on the COVID. When you are  talking about making $27 billion on a drug, just a few little pills, a  5-day dosage, $530, I would think the subcommittee would want to look  into that and see if there is an excessive amount of money being  charged for that drug. I would think the slumbering press ought to be  looking into it as well.   Twenty-seven billion dollars in sales?   That is what it says.   So if anybody out there wants to find something to talk about rather  than some of the trivial issues that dominate our newspapers, they can  look into the rich and powerful one more time and see whether the  payment for Paxlovid are a little bit excessive.   The final topic tonight is a topic that is no secret but right now  people are planning for the next session and seeing what problems in  America we should address.   I personally have been outspoken. I think one problem that needs  immediate attention is what is going on at the border. We also have to  do something to make sure that we don't wind up in a more serious war  with Ukraine or a war with China. These are vitally important.    But in the long run, the future of America comes down to its moral  fiber. This country has since the mid 1960s strongly subsidized or  strongly discriminated against the American nuclear family.   We know that Karl Marx--and there are a surprising number of  academics in America who are drawn to socialism--Karl Marx felt in  order for socialism to exist, you had to get rid of the family. We all  know that in the last election Black Lives Matter was a powerful group  and that Blacks Lives Matter, the founders anyway, were opposed to the  traditional American nuclear family--or as they describe it, the  Western prescribed nuclear family, which is a lie by the way. We have  nuclear families in countries that are not Western countries. There are  nuclear  [[Page H5485]]  families all over Latin America, sub-Sahara Africa, and Asia. But, in  any event, it is apparent that powerful groups in this country want to  destroy the nuclear family. And probably no policy did more to aid in  the destruction of the American family than Lyndon Johnson's war on the  family. I think he called it the War on Poverty, but it was really the  war on the family is what it amounted to.   I hope after almost 60 years or approaching 60 years after the war on  the family and the huge expansion of the welfare state that this  Congress would begin to address the discrimination against the  traditional family.   Madam Speaker, if you look at the welfare programs--whichever program  that you look at, be it health insurance, be it SNAP, but be it WIC, be  it the earned income tax credit--which was a very anti-marriage program  which was actually initiated by a Republican--all low-income housing,  daycare, TANF, Pell grants, and other provisions--program after program  after program--are designed to take tax dollars from the traditional  family and give it more to other families. It is no problem to help  everybody, but I think when you clearly set up programs designed not to  go to the nuclear family, you are discriminating against them.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
