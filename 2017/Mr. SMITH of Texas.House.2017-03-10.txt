 Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chairman, the Lawsuit Abuse Reduction Act, known as LARA, is just  over one-page long, but it would prevent the filing of thousands of  frivolous lawsuits in Federal courts. These absurd lawsuits cost many  innocent families their savings and often ruin their reputations.   Frivolous lawsuits have been filed against a weather channel for  failing to accurately predict storms, against television shows people  claimed were too scary, against a university that awarded a low grade,  and against a high school that dropped a member from the track team.   Lawyers who bring these cases have everything to gain and nothing to  lose under current rules, which allow plaintiffs' lawyers to file  frivolous suits without any penalty. Meanwhile, defendants are often  faced with years of litigation and substantial attorneys' fees.   Prior to 1993, it was mandatory for judges to impose sanctions, such  as orders to pay for the other side's legal expenses, when lawyers  filed frivolous lawsuits. Then, the Civil Rules Advisory Committee, an  obscure branch of the courts, made penalties optional. This needs to be  reversed by Congress.   LARA requires lawyers who file frivolous lawsuits to pay attorneys'  fees and court costs of innocent defendants. This will serve as a  disincentive to file junk lawsuits.   Further, LARA specifically requires that no changes ``shall be  construed to bar or impede the assertion or development of new claims,  defenses, or remedies under Federal, State, or local laws, including  civil rights laws, or under the Constitution of the United States.''   So civil rights law would not be affected in any way by LARA, and  that might go a long way to reassuring the ranking member's concerns  about its impact on civil rights.   Opponents argue that reinstating mandatory sanctions for frivolous  lawsuits impedes judicial discretion, but this is false. Under LARA,  judges retain the discretion to determine whether or not a claim is  frivolous. If a judge determines that a claim is frivolous, then they  must award sanctions. This ensures that victims of frivolous lawsuits  obtain compensation. But the decision to determine whether a claim is  frivolous or not remains with the judge.   The American people are looking for solutions to obvious lawsuit  abuse. LARA restores accountability to our legal system by reinstating  sanctions for attorneys who are found by a judge to have filed  frivolous lawsuits. Though it will not stop all lawsuit abuse, LARA  encourages attorneys to think twice before making an innocent party's  life miserable.                                time  0930    These attorneys engage in legalized extortion and try to force  individuals to settle out of court instead of paying huge legal costs.  There is currently no disincentive to deter attorneys from filing  frivolous claims. By requiring attorneys who file junk lawsuits to pay  the court costs of those they sue, such lawsuits will be discouraged.   I thank Chairman Goodlatte, the chairman of the Committee on the  Judiciary, for bringing this much-needed legislation to the House  floor. I ask my colleagues who oppose frivolous lawsuits and who want  to protect innocent Americans from false charges to support the Lawsuit  Abuse Reduction Act.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume  to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Chabot), a senior member of the  Committee on the Judiciary.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chairman, the Judicial Conference, by its own admission, objects  to any amendments to the Federal rules it doesn't propose itself, but  Congress has the constitutional authority and responsibility to  establish and amend the Federal rules. It also has the duty to address  problems with the judicial system that fall within its enumerated  powers. Reducing frivolous lawsuits and ensuring that those who face  meritless filings are able to receive compensation for losses caused by  frivolous claims is a significant improvement to our justice system.   Also, Mr. Chairman, I would ask my colleagues, does a bill that  grants the victims of corporate fraud the right to damages create  satellite litigation? Of course it doesn't. What it does is create a  means of guaranteed compensation for a wrong suffered. This bill does  just that. It creates a means of guaranteed compensation for a wrong  suffered; namely, the wrong of a frivolous lawsuit.   It is the job of judges to apply the law. It is the job of Members of  Congress to write the law. We are the people's representatives, and all  of us have constituents who have been the victims of frivolous  lawsuits. We are responsible for the lack of any redress today for the  victims of frivolous lawsuits, and we aim to remedy that today by  passing this bill on behalf of the constituents who sent us here. If  you deny that the victims of frivolous lawsuits are real victims, then  vote against this bill, but if you think the victims of frivolous  lawsuits should be entitled to compensation, just like anyone else who  proves their legal claims in court, you should support this bill.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  0945     Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chairman, a few minutes ago, a judicial poll was mentioned. But I  would point out to all of my colleagues that only one survey was done  that consisted mostly of judges who had experience under both the  stronger rule with mandatory sanctions. That poll showed overwhelming  support for mandatory sanctions. When judges who had experience under  both the stronger and weaker versions of rule 11 were polled, they  overwhelmingly supported mandatory sanctions for frivolous lawsuits.   The survey of 751 Federal judges found that an overwhelming majority  of Federal judges believed, based on their experience under both a  weaker and stronger rule 11, that a stronger rule 11 did not impede  development of the law: 95 percent; the benefits of the rule outweighed  any additional requirement of judicial time: 72 percent; the stronger  version of rule 11 had a positive effect on litigation in the Federal  courts: 81 percent; and the rule should be retained in its then current  form: 80 percent. Incredible.   A 2005 survey was also mentioned. In that survey, only 278 judges  responded, as opposed to the 751 who responded to the survey done in  1990. Over half of the judges who responded to the 2005 survey had no  experience under the stronger rule 11 because they were appointed to  the bench after 1992. So that 2005 survey tells us very little about  how judges comparatively view the stronger versus the weaker rule 11.   I would also point out that in the 1990 survey, roughly twice as many  responded as in the 2005 survey.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Let me first point out that this bill is being key voted by the  United States Chamber of Commerce. It has been endorsed by the National  Federation of Independent Business, and also endorsed by the Physicians  Insurance Association of America.   Mr. Chairman, let me remind Members what the base bill--which is just  a page long--actually does. It makes it mandatory for the victims of  frivolous lawsuits filed in Federal Court to be compensated for the  harm done to them by the filers of frivolous lawsuits. The bill doesn't  change the existing standards for determining what is or is not a  frivolous lawsuit. So under the bill, mandatory sanctions would only be  awarded to victims of frivolous lawsuits when those lawsuits have no  basis in law or fact.   The victims of frivolous lawsuits are real victims. They have to  shell out thousands of dollars, endure sleepless nights, and spend time  away from their family, work, and customers, just to respond to  frivolous pleadings. Few would ever claim that judges should have the  discretion to deny damage awards to victims of legal wrongs proved in  court.   So why should judges have the discretion to deny damage awards to  victims of frivolous lawsuits who prove in court that the case brought  against them was, indeed, frivolous?   A vote against LARA, including a vote for the motion to recommit, is  a denial of the fact that victims of frivolous lawsuits are real  victims. But they are real victims, and they deserve to be guaranteed  compensation when they prove in court that the claims against them are  frivolous. This bill would do just that, and for these reasons, I urge  my colleagues to support it.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to  the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I oppose this amendment which  allows lawyers who file frivolous claims to escape any sanction.   It is essential that LARA reverse the 1993 amendments to rule 11. The  current rule allows those who file frivolous lawsuits to avoid  sanctions by withdrawing claims within 21 days after a motion for  sanctions has been filed. This loophole, which LARA closes, gives  unscrupulous lawyers an unlimited number of free passes to file  frivolous pleadings with impunity.   Justice Scalia correctly predicted that such amendments would, in  fact, encourage frivolous lawsuits. Opposing the 1993 amendments in  which the 21-day rule was instated, Justice Scalia wrote:         In my view, those who file frivolous suits in pleadings       should have no safe harbor. The rules should be solicitous of       the abused and not of the abuser. Under the revised rule,       parties will be able to file thoughtless, reckless, and       harassing pleadings, secure in the knowledge that they have       nothing to lose: if objection is raised, they can retreat       without penalty.    LARA would eliminate the free pass lawyers use to file frivolous  lawsuits. This amendment would eliminate that free pass that is so  costly to innocent Americans.   Mr. Chairman, I oppose the amendment, and I yield back the balance of  my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to  the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I oppose this amendment which would  strike the provision for penalties for frivolous lawsuits and, thus,  defeat the purpose of the bill.   Today, there is no guarantee that a victim of a frivolous lawsuit  will be compensated, even when a court finds that the lawsuit is  frivolous. This legislation gives the victims of frivolous lawsuits the  ability to receive compensation from those who abuse the legal system.  The underlying bill enables innocent Americans to protect  [[Page H2033]]  themselves and their families from absolutely absurd lawsuits, which  can cost them their reputations and their livelihoods.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, let me just summarize this bill in  one sentence, and that is that no reputable attorney is going to have  any concerns with this legislation.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to  the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, let me say, first of all, that the  ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, the gentleman from Michigan  (Mr. Conyers), has been a champion of civil rights all of his life. I  recognize and respect that.   For that reason, I would like to try to reassure him that the base  bill already says, as I mentioned in my opening statement:   ``Nothing in this Act or an amendment made by this Act shall be  construed to bar or impede the assertion or development of new claims,  defenses, or remedies under Federal, State, or local laws, including  civil rights laws, or under the Constitution of the United States.''   This provision clearly preserves the right to assert claims under the  civil rights laws or the Constitution. I don't know how this language  could be more clear.   This amendment would allow frivolous claims to be brought under civil  rights laws without any of the penalties required in the base bill. If  this amendment were adopted, the bill would invite the filing of  frivolous civil rights claims without any penalty whatsoever.   I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, which regrettably  would expose innocent Americans to abusive and frivolous lawsuits.  [[Page H2034]]    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to  the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the Chair pointing out  that it is improper to impugn the integrity or damage the reputation of  the President of the United States or others. I thank the Chair for  pointing that out.   Mr. Chairman, the Lawsuit Abuse Reduction Act makes three important  changes to rule 11 to limit lawsuit abuse by imposing sanctions for  bringing frivolous lawsuits. These changes apply to all cases brought  in Federal district courts.   However, this amendment would change that. If this amendment is  adopted, the changes to rule 11 made by LARA would not apply to  lawsuits brought in relation to whistleblower claims. There is no  reason to make this or other exceptions.   The changes made by the Lawsuit Abuse Reduction Act should apply  uniformly throughout the Federal courts. Because this amendment  excludes certain cases from the bill's coverage and thereby allows  frivolous lawsuits to be filed without any of the penalties required by  the bill, I oppose the amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chairman, proponents of this amendment want to allow lawsuits  with no basis in law or fact to proceed without penalty if the lawsuit  relates to whistleblowers. Think about that. The proponents of this  amendment support lawsuits that apparently have no basis in law or  fact, and they want those frivolous lawsuits to proceed without  penalty.  [[Page H2036]]    Let me remind Members what the base bill--which is just one page  long--actually does. It makes it mandatory for the victims of frivolous  lawsuits filed in Federal court to be compensated for the harm done to  them by the filers of frivolous lawsuits. The bill doesn't change the  existing standards for determining what is or is not a frivolous  lawsuit. So under the bill, mandatory sanctions would only be awarded  to victims of frivolous lawsuits when those lawsuits, as determined by  the judge, have no basis in law or fact, including cases related to  whistleblowers that have no basis in law or fact.   This amendment would allow legally frivolous whistleblower cases to  go without penalty and leave their victims uncompensated, so I urge all  of my colleagues to oppose it.   Once again, I don't know how any reputable attorney would have any  concerns with this legislation.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
