 Mr. President, shortly, I will be making a unanimous  consent request to confirm the nomination of Ms. Karen Hedlund to be a  member of the Surface Transportation Board.   Ms. Hedlund served as Deputy Administrator of the Federal Railroad  Administration, and before that, as Chief Counsel at the Federal  Highway Administration. She has spent most of her career in the  development and financing of infrastructure projects across the United  States, including improvements to the national freight rail system.   She is well qualified to be a member of the Surface Transportation  Board, which we know is so critical to the movement of freight; and her  appointment comes at a time when there are many important issues and  decisions before the Board.   Ms. Hedlund was nominated by the President in April. She received  bipartisan approval in the Commerce Committee now over 2 months ago,  and it is time for the full Senate to do the same.   So I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the following  nomination: Calendar No. 315, Karen Jean Hedlund, to be a member of the  Surface Transportation Board for a term expiring December 31, 2025. I  further ask unanimous consent that the nomination be confirmed, the  motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no  intervening action or debate; that no further motions be in order to  the nomination; and that the President be immediately notified of the  Senate's action.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I have 10 requests for committees to meet  during today's session of the Senate. They have the approval of the  Majority and Minority Leaders.   Pursuant to rule XXVI, paragraph 5(a), of the Standing Rules of the  Senate, the following committees are authorized to meet during today's  session of the Senate:              COMMITTEE ON COMMERCE, SCIENCE, AND TRANSPORTATION    The Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation is authorized  to meet during the session of the Senate on Wednesday, October 6, 2021,  at 10 a.m., to conduct a hearing.
