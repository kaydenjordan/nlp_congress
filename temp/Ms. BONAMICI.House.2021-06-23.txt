 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Scott for yielding and  for his leadership on this important legislation. I rise in strong  support of the bipartisan Protecting Older Workers Against  Discrimination Act.   My home State of Oregon has one of the most rapidly aging populations  in the country, and I have heard from many workers, particularly those  in the technology industry, who believe they have been dismissed or  denied employment because of their age. In fact, 6 in 10 older workers  say they have experienced age discrimination, and 90 percent say that  it is common.   My office has helped older workers who have filed age discrimination  complaints before the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, but the  burden of proof is very high and often results in uncertain outcomes.   Congress recognized the need to protect older workers from pervasive  age discrimination when it enacted the Age Discrimination in Employment  Act of 1967. But decades later, in 2009, the Supreme Court, in Gross v.  FBL Financial Services, imposed a much higher burden of proof for  workers to prove age discrimination under the ADEA. Because of the  Court's holding in Gross, workers now must prove that age  discrimination was the decisive cause for their employer's adverse  action rather than just a motivating factor in their employer's adverse  action.   Mr. Speaker, earlier this year, I joined Chairman Scott in  reintroducing the bipartisan Protecting Older Workers Against  Discrimination Act. This needed bill is a commonsense legislative fix  that will simply restore the pre-2009 standard in age discrimination  claims and, importantly, align the burden of proof with the same  standards for proving discrimination in other areas, such as those  based on sex, race, religion, and national origin.   As we discussed during the joint Civil Rights and Human Services  Subcommittee and Workforce Protections Subcommittee hearing earlier  this year, Americans are living longer and working longer. We must make  sure they are protected from age discrimination.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the Leadership  Council of Aging Organizations in support of the Protecting Older  Workers Against Discrimination Act.                                               Leadership Council of                                             Aging Organizations,                                                       May 13, 2021.        Dear Member of Congress: The Leadership Council of Aging       Organizations (LCAO) is a coalition of 69 national nonprofit       organizations concerned with the well-being of America's       older population and committed to representing their       interests in the policy-making arena. We are writing to urge       you to vote for passage of the Protecting Older Workers       Against Discrimination Act (POWADA, H.R. 2062, S. 880).       POWADA is bipartisan and bicameral legislation introduced in       the House by Representatives Bobby Scott (D-VA) and Rodney       Davis (R-IL). In the Senate, the bill is sponsored by       Senators Bob Casey (D-PA), Chuck Grassley (R-IA), Patrick       Leahy (D-VT) and Susan Collins (R-ME).        Age discrimination is pervasive and stubbornly entrenched.       It often starts in the hiring process when employers       circumvent anti-age discrimination laws by using such tactics       as setting a maximum number of years of experience that a       prospective employer will consider. Whether it starts at the       hiring process or not, six in 10 older workers say they have       experienced age discrimination and 90 percent of them say it       is common. It is even more pervasive among older women and       African American workers--nearly two thirds of women and       three-fourths of African Americans say they have seen or       experienced workplace discrimination. The COVID-19 pandemic       has wreaked havoc on employment for everyone, with older       workers taking a harder hit. Older workers experienced a 1.1       percent higher unemployment rate from April through September       of 2020 than their mid-career counterparts (9.7 percent were       unemployed versus 8.6 percent). The rates were worse for       older workers who were black, female, or who did not have a       college degree.        Courts have not taken age discrimination as seriously as       other forms of discrimination and older workers have fewer       protections as a result. Over ten years ago, the Supreme       Court decision in Gross v. FBL Financial Services Inc.       (2009), set a higher standard of proof for age discrimination       than previously applied, and much higher than for other forms       of discrimination. Since Gross, court decisions have       continued to chip away at protections. As a result plaintiffs       now must prove that age was a determinative cause for their       employers adverse treatment of them. Before the Gross cases       it was enough for plaintiffs to prove that age was one of the       motivating factors.        POWADA would restore the standard of proof in age       discrimination cases to the pre-2009 level and treat age       discrimination as unjust as other forms of employment       discrimination. Moreover, because courts have applied Gross'       higher burden of proof to retaliation charges and to       disability discrimination, POWADA would also amend the Age       Discrimination in Employment Act, Title VIT's provision on       retaliation, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and the       Rehabilitation Act of 1973.        Please vote to restore fairness for older workers by       passing the Protecting Older Workers Against Discrimination       Act (H.R. 2062, S. 880).            Sincerely,          AARP, AFL-CIO, Alliance for Retired Americans, AMDA--The             Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine,             American Postal Workers Union Retirees Department,             American Society on Aging, Association for Gerontology             and Human Development in Historically Black Colleges             and Universities, Association of Jewish Aging Services,             Asociacion Nacional Pro Personas Mayores, Caring Across             Generations, Center for Eldercare Improvement, Altarum,             The Gerontological Society of America, Justice in             Aging, LeadingAge, Medicare Rights Center, National             Active and Retired Federal Employees Association,             National Adult Day Services Association, National             Alliance for Caregiving, National Association of Area             Agencies on Aging, National Association of Nutrition             and Aging Services Programs, National Association of             Social Workers, National Caucus and Center on Black             Aging, National Committee to Preserve Social Security             and Medicare, National Council on Aging, National             Indian Council on Aging, National Senior Corps             Association, Pension Rights Center, Social Security             Works, Women's Institute for a Secure Retirement.     Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to stand up  for older workers and to support this bipartisan, bicameral bill.
