 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the dean of the  House and my friend, Congressman Don Young.   The great State of Alaska and the Eighth Congressional District of  Minnesota, which I have the honor of representing here in Congress,  have many shared similarities and qualities.   These are the values that Don and I shared to fight for our way of  life, to promote the responsible use of our abundant natural resources,  and to provide for our children and grandchildren infrastructure built  to last.   This made working alongside the dean such a pleasure and an honor. We  served together on the Natural Resources and Transportation Committees,  and I will never forget the countless times he helped me out through  the kindness of his heart.   Since first being elected to office in 1973, Don picked up a range of  helpful tips, funny stories, and congressional experience that he was  never shy about sharing.   His wife, Anne, along with the rest of his family, are in my prayers.  Don's legacy of service will never be forgotten, and he will always be  remembered as a titan for the people of Alaska and our great Nation.  May he rest in peace.
