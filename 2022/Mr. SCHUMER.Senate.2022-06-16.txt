 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, today is a historic, long-awaited day  for our Nation's veterans. In a few moments, the Senate is finally  going to pass the PACT Act--the most significant expansion of  healthcare benefits for our veterans in generations. It is officially  called the SFC Heath Robinson Honoring our PACT Act because Heath  Robinson was one of the many who succumbed to the poisons of toxins  that he was exposed to fighting for America.   For too long, our Nation's veterans have faced an absurd indignity:  They enlisted to serve our country, went abroad in good health, and  came back, only to get sick from toxic exposure endured while in the  line of duty.   As many as 3\1/2\ million veterans have been affected by burn pits  since 9/11. Yet approximately 80 percent of all disability claims  connected to burn pits have been rejected by the VA. So many of our  veterans have been fought by the VA after they fought for us, as they  try to get healthcare benefits. Many of them had to hire lawyers just  to prove their illnesses and then do a complicated legal dance to show  what everyone knew: that toxic exposure from burn pits caused all kinds  of cancers and other diseases. That was so, so wrong. Indignity. The  callousness of forcing veterans who got sick as they were fighting for  us because of exposure to these toxins, to have to fight for years in  the VA to get the benefits they deserved--well, that will soon be over,  praise God.   To these American heroes who have carried on without the benefits  they deserve, I have one thing to say: No more. Today, the Senate  finally takes action to right this profound wrong.   The PACT Act will finally change outdated rules at the VA that have  been in effect for far too long that prevent our veterans from getting  the care they need to treat health complications caused by burn pits.  It will expand eligibility for VA medical care to make sure veterans  get the help they need.   There is even more good news in the PACT Act. It is not just about  burn pits, as important as they are. The PACT Act will expand coverage  of health issues exacerbated by Agent Orange, which, over the years, I  have strongly pushed for in this Chamber.   I want to give deep thanks to Senators Tester and Moran, who worked  for months to push this bill over the finish line. Their leadership on  this issue has been extraordinary.   I want to thank my colleagues. This is another bipartisan action that  is accomplishing something very significant, and I want to thank my  colleagues from both sides of the aisle who supported the bill through  its consideration.  [[Page S2984]]    Most importantly, I want to thank the many veterans, the veterans  service organizations, advocates like Jon Stewart and John Feal, who  never gave up on making this change happen. Because of their advocacy,  our veterans will finally get the dignity and care they rightfully  deserve.   If you want to take the measure of any nation, look no further than  the way it treats those who sacrificed everything in the line of duty.  Today, the Senate is making sure we treat our heroes the way our heroes  deserve to be treated--with dignity, with gratitude for everything they  have done to protect our way of life. Gone are the days when veterans  will have to struggle to prove and fight to get benefits they deserve.   I thank my colleagues for their work, and I urge all of us to vote  yes on this long-overdue legislation.                      Nomination of Steven M. Dettelbach    Madam President, now let me talk about something that just happened  in the Judiciary Committee.   As we await the completion of the gun safety bill, there is another  step the Senate will take today to protect our communities from gun  violence. We can move to confirm Steven Dettelbach as the Director of  the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.   I want to thank Senator Durbin and the Judiciary Committee for moving  this nomination expeditiously.   Later today, I will move to discharge the nomination of Mr.  Dettelbach from the Judiciary Committee after his nomination resulted  in a tie vote. Based on his record and qualifications, Dettelbach  unquestionably deserves bipartisan support, but either way, he is going  to move forward.   The ATF has not had a permanent Director since 2015, so confirming  Mr. Dettelbach is one of my top priorities before the end of June. We  need a fully functional, fully staffed ATF in order for that Agency to  fulfill its mission of keeping our communities safe from gun violence.   Obviously, the legislation we are talking about that is being  negotiated is very important, but so is having a fully functioning ATF.  It is critical we have a fully functioning, fully staffed ATF for the  Agency to carry out its mission of protecting our communities from gun  violence, and what they do is very, very important. Sometimes it is  quiet. Sometimes it is not noticed. But their ability to deal with gun  traffickers and so many others who poison our streets with illegal guns  that take the lives of our children--the ATF is essential in stopping  that, curtailing it, and having a strong, qualified nominee like Mr.  Dettelbach will certainly help reduce the scourge of gun violence in  this country, particularly because the ATF has not had anyone at the  helm since 2015. So I am going to make sure his nomination moves as  quickly and speedily through this Chamber as possible.                                  Gun Safety    Madam President, now on the other issue, the debate on gun safety,  this week, the Senate is making progress on a subject that has  frustrated this Chamber for decades: meaningful gun safety legislation.   Last night, I spoke with Senator Murphy on the latest round of  bipartisan negotiations. Both sides met well into the evening and will  be meeting again this afternoon. The work is not finished. No one will  pretend that has been easy, but both parties are still working towards  a final product. I urge both sides to keep going at it. This is so  important to the American people. I am hopeful they will come to an  agreement on bill text soon.   Once we have the language for a gun safety bill, I am prepared to  make it the next legislative matter considered on the Senate floor. We  want to move quickly and decisively to make sure we don't let this  opportunity slip away.   Just a month ago, very few could have predicted that this Chamber  would make as much progress as we have on a gun safety compromise.  Given our recent history, it is hard to blame Americans who feel  hopeless that change can happen on this issue. But that is why you  never give up--never give up--even after facing so many  disappointments. No matter how many times gridlock has taken hold in  the past, survivors of gun violence, gun safety activists, people who  have lost loved ones, children, have fought and fought and fought. They  have visited our office every year, many times. Because of them, we are  closer to making real progress than we have been in a long, long time.   The work is not done, but I remain hopeful that we are going to get  it done, and I want to thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle  for continuing their work towards a compromise.                              January 6 Hearings    Madam President, now on the Big Lie, today, the House will continue  its public hearings on the Capitol attack of January 6. I urge all  Americans to tune in and listen to the strong case our House colleagues  are presenting.   The dangers of the Big Lie transcend the Capitol attack. This week,  many hard-right candidates, who deny the 2020 elections and have little  faith in the fidelity of our elections, who may well move to undermine  them, have won primaries and will be on the ballot in November.   If you want to know what our country could turn into if they win,  look at what is happening right now in New Mexico. Right now, a county  commissioner in that State is refusing to certify the results of his  county's primary elections because of debunked conspiracy theories  involving Dominion voting machines. The votes of over 7,000 people are  now in jeopardy, and the State supreme court has been compelled to step  in. This is the result of the Big Lie spread by Donald Trump. He cannot  accept the fact that he lost. His ego is so huge and infantile that he  is undermining American democracy, and too many, often out of fear of  Trump and the primary voter acolytes that Trump has, go along with  this.   It is happening in too many States. It is a real danger to our  democracy. In Nevada, for instance, secretary of state candidate Jim  Marchant has said that if he had been in office in 2020, he wouldn't  have certified Joe Biden's victory.   That is dangerous stuff. Do my colleagues on the other side of the  aisle who go along with this realize that? This undermines the  democracy, sacred to all of us--Democrat, Republican, Independent.   America needs to be watching what is happening in States like New  Mexico and Nevada because if we are not careful, it will be a preview  of greater horrors to come. It is not a partisan argument; it is simply  about democracy versus authoritarianism. Many of the things said by  some of these officeholders were said by people who then led their  country to authoritarian regimes.   It doesn't matter if you are a Democrat or a Republican or an  Independent; democracy is at risk if we elevate individuals who don't  believe in the sanctity of elections.   I urge the American people, regardless of party, to reject these  radicals in November because our democracy is literally--literally--on  the line.                          Ocean Shipping Reform Act    Madam President, finally, on the ocean shipping bill, today is an  important day. President Biden will sign the Ocean Shipping Reform Act  into law.   Shipping reform is exactly the kind of bill that can make a  difference to the American people. It fights inflation. It relieves our  supply chains. It will help small businesses and consumers alike.   Our ports need help. The cost of sending a container across the  Pacific Ocean is up 1,000 percent. Who pays that? The consumer and the  American exporter. Our ports need help. Our supply chains need relief.  With today's signing, we can now say help is on the way.   I thank President Biden for signing this bill quickly. I thank my  colleagues, Senators Klobuchar, Thune, and Cantwell, for their  leadership in the Senate. I thank Speaker Pelosi and my House  colleagues for approving the bill earlier this week.   I would say to our friends in the media: No, this has been  bipartisan. There hasn't been conflict, but it is important. Please pay  some attention to it. Things are getting done to deal with the scourge  of inflation.   I yield the floor.                      Recognition of the Minority Leader     Mr. President, this is the greatest advance in veterans'  healthcare in decades. It wouldn't have happened without Jerry Moran  and the amazing work of Chairman Jon Tester who persisted through so  many different turns and twists and difficulties. Every veteran in  America, every American, should give tremendous thanks to Senator  Tester and Senator Moran.   I yield the floor and urge a vote.                              Vote on H.R. 3967     I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, as we await completion of the gun safety  bill, today, the Senate is taking another important step to protect  communities from gun violence, moving forward with the nomination of  Steven Dettelbach, to be Director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco,  Firearms and Explosives.   In a few moments, I will move to discharge Mr. Dettelbach's  nomination from the Judiciary Committee. After that, I am going to make  sure his nomination moves through this Chamber rapidly.   The bipartisan gun safety legislation currently being negotiated is  crucially important but so is having a fully staffed ATF. And my  colleagues, listen to this: We haven't had a Director of ATF since  2015. Gun violence is ripping through the Nation, killing so many, and  we still don't have a Director of ATF. That is just outrageous, at a  time when we need one more than ever.  [[Page S2993]]    At a time when Americans are sick and tired of our country's gun  violence epidemic, we should be sprinting--sprinting--to confirm  someone whose job would be precisely to keep Americans safe from gun  violence, and that is exactly what the new ATF Director will do.   The ATF may not always capture the spotlight, but it is vital in  stopping gun trafficking, in preventing illegal possession of firearms,  and making sure our kids can't get their hands on dangerous weapons.   It is still so confounding to realize we haven't had somebody there  because people have blocked it since 2015. An organization as important  as the ATF absolutely needs to have a Senate-confirmed Director in  place, and though we haven't had one in 7 years, we are going to change  that very, very soon.   Having a strong, qualified nomination like Dettelbach will certainly  help reduce the scourge of gun violence in the country.   So, once again, after I move to discharge Mr. Dettelbach, I am going  to make sure his nomination moves rapidly through this Chamber. We need  to fill this vacancy that has been blocked by the other side far too  often.   Now, pursuant to S. Res. 27, the Committee on the Judiciary being  tied on the question of reporting, I move to discharge the Committee on  the Judiciary from further consideration of Steven M. Dettelbach, of  Ohio, to be Director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and  Explosives.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I yield back all time on the motion to  discharge.
