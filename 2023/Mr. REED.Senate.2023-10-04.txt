 Mr. President, first, I want to commend my colleague from  Rhode Island. No one has been more accurate and more farseeing about  climate change than Sheldon Whitehouse.   When he first came to the Senate, it was a technical issue that  scientists debated. Now it is an issue we are confronting because of  his efforts, and it is also an issue we are confronting because we see  it.   We are in the midst of a crisis. He foresaw it. He has dedicated  himself to addressing it. I am just very proud to be his colleague in  this Senate.    I must point out that our support is the leading edge of  worldwide support. Our NATO allies have stepped forward, and countries  around the globe understand that this battle between democracy and  freedom and autocracy and inhumanity must be won.   President Zelenskyy came to this very building 2 weeks ago to ask for  our support. He received overwhelming bipartisan promises from Members  of both the Senate and the House. Of course, I was proud to pledge my  support, and I know nearly all of my Senate colleagues were also.   It is shameful that on the heels of that visit, after looking  President Zelenskyy in the eye and promising to stand with him, our  House colleagues decided to strip all Ukraine funding from their  continuing resolution. That decision contradicts the will of the  majority of Congress and the American people, and it breaks faith with  the people of Ukraine, who are in a battle to preserve their nation and  their lives. And their battle is our battle. Their battle against  unprovoked aggression by Putin against a democratic neighbor is a  battle that we must ensure they can win because he won't stop there.   We can't allow the obstinacy of a few Members of the House of  Representatives to force a cruel deal on those who least deserve it-- the Ukrainian people.   As I said, this conflict matters not just to Ukraine but to our own  security here at home. It is clear that if Putin succeeds in Ukraine,  he will not stop. He made this clear years ago when he talked about  that his mission in life, his sole, overwhelming preoccupation, was to  recreate the Russian Empire--the Balkans, parts of Poland, Moldova,  Georgia. He is very clear.   It is ironic in history how dictators can be so clear about what they  want to do but ignored by people who should stand up to them. Hitler  was very explicit in ``Mein Kampf'' on what his goal was. Yet world  leaders appeased him. Will we appease Putin and cut off aid to the  Ukrainians? If we do, it will be our problem.   He will seek to destabilize other countries in the region, including  our NATO allies. If that happens, under article 5 of NATO, we have a  legal and moral obligation to go to their aid. That means the blood  that will be shed is not Ukrainian blood but the blood of our soldiers,  sailors, airmen, marines, guardians, and coastguardsmen. The cost of  that, in my view, is priceless.   Our job in some respects is to ensure by our actions here that we  continue lowering the probability that American men and women in our  service will suffer and die in action. If we renege on our commitment  to Ukraine, that probability will go up, not down, and we will regret  it immensely.   We have seen colleagues on the other side speak out, but they have to  speak out more vigorously.   Leader McConnell said recently:         With Ukraine bravely defending its sovereignty and eroding       Russia's capacity to threaten NATO, it is not the time to       ease up. . . . Helping Ukraine retake its territory means       weakening one of America's biggest strategic adversaries       without firing a shot.    Leader McConnell is right about that, and I admire his forceful and  courageous support of the Ukrainian people.   Remember, also, China is watching how the democratic nations of the  [[Page S4939]]  world respond to Russia. In considering a potential invasion of Taiwan,  President Xi is scrutinizing Putin's playbook and the international  response, and he has seen things that are potentially encouraging,  particularly if the international community simply gives up and allows  Ukraine to fall.   The conclusion he likely will draw is that, if I engage and I am  persistent enough for long enough, then the political whims in the  United States and across the globe will fall behind and they will give  up and I will succeed.   The credibility of the U.S. deterrent is only as strong as our  actions. Our would-be partners around the world are also watching  closely at what we are doing. Will we have their backs if they are  attacked? We must show that we are a steadfast ally, not hamstrung by  the whims of fringe politicians. Again, our adversaries would see  themselves empowered as our alliances dissolve because there is no  confidence or a lack of confidence in the United States.   This is especially true when we consider how the Ukrainians have  proven, time and time again, that, given the right support, they are  entirely capable of defeating the assaults launched against them, and  there are a number of reasons for this.   First and foremost is the incredible courage and fighting skill of  the Ukrainian people as well as the inspirational leadership of  President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. I had the opportunity, like so many of  my colleagues, to travel to Kyiv earlier this year and was deeply moved  by the Ukrainians' bravery and commitment to defending their homeland.   Second is the remarkable statesmanship of President Biden. His  administration has forged a unified response, leading the worldwide  condemnation of Putin and providing enormous military, economic, and  humanitarian support for Ukraine. I doubt if anyone in this Senate, in  the weeks before the invasion of Ukraine, would have predicted that  NATO would rally as it has to support the Ukrainians; that allies  across the globe would dig into their stocks of munitions and transfer  them to the Ukrainians; that the whole world would be, in some  respects, moved by the actions of our country in standing up and  inspiring others to join with us.   We also benefited from 8 years of training of Ukrainian forces,  starting in 2014. In fact, I had the first opportunity to meet General  Cavoli, our Supreme Allied Commander, when he was a brigadier general  in Lviv training Ukrainian soldiers. That training was manifested as  they repulsed the Russian assault. It was squad leaders and company  commanders and young battalion commanders who had been trained by us  and our allies who were able to outfight, outmaneuver, and outthink  their Russian adversaries, and they continue to do that.   Finally, Putin's assault has faltered from the inept performance of  his own forces. The war has exposed a poorly led and poorly trained  Russian Army with corrupt leadership at every level, poor tactics and  communication and inept logistics. But people learn from adversity. The  Russians are learning, and they are beginning to understand the  limitations of their forces. So they are putting them in trenches; they  are fortifying the battlefield; they are minimizing any maneuver that  they must do because that is a complicated military operation. Then  they are throwing in thousands and thousands of poorly trained but  still well-armed soldiers.   So we can't assume that their poor performance will last forever.  That is another reason we have to continue our support and give our  Ukrainian allies all the help they need.   Now, Putin assumed, I believe, that his actions, his quick assault on  Kyiv, would drive a wedge within the international community; that we  would dither; that we would debate; that we would do nothing. Well, he  was badly mistaken. As I indicated before, with the leadership of  President Biden and Secretary Blinken and others, NATO has shown a  remarkable unity and resolve. And we can't overstate the scale of this  importance; that countries that before were unenthusiastic, let me say,  about military operations, suddenly began to provide equipment,  support, training, raised their budgets, and do so to assist the people  of Ukraine.    Also, something that goes unstated by so many is that our European  allies are also giving tremendous aid to civilian populations that have  been displaced and aid to the budget of Ukraine. If you look on a per  capita basis of the GDP--I should say the basis of percentage of the  GDP--we are not the most generous benefactor of Ukraine; it is the  Baltic nations. So this is an unusual worldwide commitment of  sacrifice, of resources, in which we are the leader, but many other  nations are giving as much, if not more.   Now, Putin, I think, believes he can wait us all out. He can wait for  the supplies to be exhausted by the Ukrainians. Oh, and by the way, if  we take away our resources, those supplies will be quickly exhausted.  But we cannot validate this viewpoint as the Ukrainians have fought too  hard and suffered too much to be left alone on the battlefield, to be  abandoned.   And just as the Ukrainians have learned and adapted on the  battlefield, the effort to aid and equip their security forces has  evolved as we have gone forward. Throughout the war, the Biden  administration has calibrated our assistance to Ukraine, calibrated in  a very difficult situation. We have allies that were somewhat reluctant  to move weapons systems in. We have allies that are signatories to the  treaty against the use of cluster munitions, which we had to take into  account. We have to negotiate between multiple parties that don't have  precisely the same viewpoint as we have, but yet we have been able to  consistently support, train, equip, and provide the resources necessary  for the Ukrainian forces to begin their counteroffensive, which they  did weeks ago; to continue their fight through this winter and position  them, we hope, for a decisive action as soon as possible.   We have committed tremendous amounts of security assistance,  including advanced air defense systems equipment, and we remain keen  that we look ahead to provide the most modern weapons systems that the  Ukrainians can use. Many people forget the training that is necessary  to use sophisticated weapons systems. Many people forget that the key  to maneuver operations is a rather sophisticated coordination between  ground forces, heavy armored forces, artillery support, air support  when available. All of these things are not something that one just  does naturally. It takes training. It takes repeated attempts.  Fortunately, for us, the Ukrainians are so dedicated to their country  that they are committing their all to use our equipment effectively.   I will also note that the supplemental funding that we have brought  has allowed us to invest more money and create more jobs right here in  the United States as U.S. defense industry partners ramp up production  to meet Ukraine's needs and to backfill our own munitions supplies.   Indeed, what we have found is, really, a new type of warfare. We had  become accustomed for decades to have complete air superiority when we  fought, to have precision weapons that were so accurate that the  battles we fought were weeks: Desert Storm, Iraqi Freedom, the first  phase of the battlefield in Afghanistan. So we didn't think we needed a  large-scale munitions production. The type of warfare we are seeing  now, which very well might be the type of warfare we encounter in the  future, requires an industrial base that can provide adequate  ammunition, an adequate supply of equipment. We have started that  process. One aspect is multiyear contracts now for munitions so that  there is a demand that producers understand and will fulfill.   Now, some have said our response has been too slow and that we should  have given more weaponry or better weaponry, et cetera. Well, those  people who have criticized the President about their claims of slowness  should be outraged at the House, which is demanding we stop it all.  They should raise their voices now, strongly, emphatically, to tell the  House: We must have Ukrainian aid approved, and we must do it quickly.   Throughout the war in Ukraine, President Biden has led the United  States and the international community with admirable resolve. Congress  must send a strong message to Putin that Americans continue to stand in  solidarity with the people of Ukraine  [[Page S4940]]  and that we are committed to supporting them as they fight bravely to  defend their homeland.   The simple truth is that their battle is our battle. If they lose,  Americans lose, and the likelihood that our young men and women will be  called upon to enter the fray increases dramatically. We must support  our Ukrainian allies.   I yield the floor.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.
