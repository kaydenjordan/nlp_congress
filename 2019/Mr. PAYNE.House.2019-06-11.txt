 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate LGBT Pride Month,  which occurs every June.   Pride Month is the time when the LGBT community comes together to  celebrate their ability to live freely. For many people across the  country, Pride events held in this month of June are the occasion where  they can express themselves freely in their community.   This year's LGBT Pride Month marks an important turning point in LGBT  history, the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall uprising. While LGBT  Pride events today center on celebration of good times, they are rooted  in the LGBT community's fight for survival.   Mr. Speaker, 50 years ago this month, police raided the Stonewall  Inn, a gay bar in New York City. Raids weren't uncommon at the time,  but this time, the gay community rose up in protest. They set off a  national movement of LGBT rights, which still is going on today.   Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to celebrate these great strides in LGBT  rights in this country. I ask that my colleagues join me in celebrating  LGBT Month and commit to protecting the rights and safety of LGBT  people.                            ____________________
