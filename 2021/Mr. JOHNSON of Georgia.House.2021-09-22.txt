 Mr. Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my  bipartisan amendment to end the Defense Department's militarization of  police departments across the Nation.  [[Page H4946]]    I think we can all agree that community confidence in law enforcement  is at an all-time low, and a huge factor in this loss of confidence is  the militarization of our police departments across the Nation.   This trend has been exacerbated by the 1033 program that creates a  pipeline to transfer surplus military weapons from war zones directly  to domestic law enforcement agencies.   These law enforcement agencies, without consent of the civilian  authorities, obtain military grade weaponry directly from the war zones  of Iraq and Afghanistan, and it is the civilian authorities who should  decide whether such equipment is needed, not the law enforcement  agencies themselves.   The approval of city councils, county commissions, and other civilian  authorities is bypassed under the 1033 program, and this amendment  would fix that. It would stop law enforcement agencies from acquiring  military-grade weaponry without the consent of the governed.   They oftentimes have no need for these weapons of war, nor are they  trained as to how and when to use the equipment, but a requirement in  the 1033 program mandates that the acquired equipment be placed into  use within 12 months of acquisition. This mandate has resulted in the  misuse of the equipment and abuse of civilians against whom it was  used.   The result has been communities alienated and a loss of confidence in  law enforcement. Momentum is building toward reform of the 1033  program. American communities are not and should not be turned into  battlefields, and people in those communities should not be looked at  as enemy combatants.   The ending of the war in Afghanistan makes it even more important  than ever that we close down this pipeline of military-grade weapons  from foreign war zones to the streets of our Nation.   Over 17,000 pieces of military equipment have been declared excess or  surplus and sent to the Defense Logistics Agency for distribution on  our streets.   The time is now to act, and I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on  my amendment.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1615     Mr. Speaker, a small law enforcement agency  being able to order massive amounts of military equipment directly from  the battlefields of this country and to do it without consent of the  governed is wrong, and that is what this amendment will get at.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, rather than defund police, this  amendment restores civilian authority over law enforcement.   And I will submit to you that a small law enforcement agency doesn't  need a military-grade tank to rescue stranded individuals due to a  hurricane or something like that, some kind of a natural disaster. You  don't need a military tank to do that.   And no law enforcement agency should be able to order that equipment  directly from the battlefield without the consent of the governed.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, a large metropolitan law  enforcement agency with the consent of the governed has the ability to  purchase whatever equipment they need, but the bottom line is the  civilian authorities get to decide, and the taxpayers pay for it.  [[Page H4947]]    But there should not be a supply line directly from the battlefield  to a local law enforcement agency without consent of the governed and  with the governed having to bear the cost of unnecessary equipment, as  well as its misuse that contributes to the decline and confidence in  law enforcement.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, a pig with lipstick is still a  pig, and a military-grade helicopter secured from the battlefields of  Afghanistan is still a military-grade helicopter being used against the  citizens.   Now, if the gentleman's jurisdiction, the city council or the county  commissioner agreed to purchase and voted on that, agreed to accept the  material, then that is good, but that is not required under the 1033  program, which allows law enforcement agencies to petition directly to  the Department of Defense and get this equipment like those helicopters  without the consent of the governed. And that is wrong.   Over the last several decades, the 1033 program has transferred more  than $7.4 billion in surplus military equipment to over 8,000 Federal,  Tribal, State, and local law enforcement agencies across the country.   When I first introduced this language in 2014, I have heard every  single excuse why we should not do something about this program, but it  needs to end. The militarization of our police departments needs to end  so that we can begin the process of restoring confidence in law  enforcement.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
