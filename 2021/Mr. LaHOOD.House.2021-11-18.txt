 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to the so- called Build Back Better agenda. President Biden campaigned as a  moderate problem-solver, but has governed as a radical progressive.   Under nearly a year of Democrat control in Washington, we have  witnessed devastating consequences, stifling inflation, massive labor  shortages, a supply chain crisis, and devastation at our southern  border.   Instead of stepping back and working with Republicans to address the  real-life issues American families are facing, President Biden and the  Democrats are pressing ahead with the most radical legislative agenda  in my lifetime.   Here is what the bill does: raises taxes on Illinois farmers, middle- income workers, and small businesses, while subsidizing the wealthiest  individuals on the coasts; encourages the IRS to snoop on average  Illinoisan's bank accounts; and pushes us to the brink of becoming a  welfare state.   Moreover, this bill is not paid for, as the Democrats claim, and will  only bankrupt our children and grandchildren. This so-called Build Back  Better agenda is a bad deal for Illinois and American families, and I  urge my colleagues to vote ``no''.
