 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, last week's midterm elections  reconfirmed something that has been clear for a number of years: When  it comes to politics and to policy, we are a closely divided nation.   For the third straight election, our closely divided nation saw a  closely fought election go all the way down to the wire. And as the  dust settles, for the third straight time, the American people have  chosen a very closely divided government.   Though several races for the House of Representatives remain  uncalled, it appears the likeliest outcome would mean the American  people have put a stop to 2 years of Democrats' disastrous one-party  government and placed the House in Republican hands.   Senate Republicans have spent 2 years working to check and balance  reckless policies; it will be an outstanding thing for the country to  have a set of new reinforcements arriving on the other side of the  Capitol.   Now, while this election underscored some of our country's close  divisions, it also highlighted areas where the people are speaking  overwhelmingly with one voice. The American people are not divided over  what Democrats' reckless policy decisions have done to our economy and  to their families' budgets. Exit polls show three-quarters of voters  say the economy they are facing is ``poor'' or ``not good.''   Americans are not divided over whether the current trends in  inflation, crime, open borders, and drug addiction are acceptable  outcomes for the greatest country in the history of the world; everyone  knows they are not.   And Americans are not especially closely divided about whether they  want President Biden to keep governing like he has been or actually  change course. At this point in their presidencies, every one of the  last 13 Presidents dating back to Truman had higher approval ratings  than the Biden administration.   One State where Democrats' policy failures have hit especially hard  is the State of Georgia. Georgia families have seen cumulative  inflation of 14.7 percent since January of 2021. Both of their Senators  cast the deciding vote to rubberstamp the spending that made that  happen. Now households in the Peach State are paying a hidden  Democratic inflation tax that adds up to thousands of extra dollars per  year.   The nationwide breakdown in law and order has hit Georgia hard as  well. The city of Atlanta now has per capita rates of homicide and  assault that are even actually worse than Chicago.   And the people of Georgia saw their State attacked, called racist,  called Jim Crow 2.0 by the sitting President of the United States, and  boycotted by major corporations over a voting law that just  facilitated--listen to this--historic ballot access, record turnout,  and low wait times for Georgia voters.   So where do Georgia taxpayers and small businesses go to get their  money back after the liberal smear campaign that led to the boycotts?  But the day after the election, President Biden took to the podium and  triumphantly promised that he plans to learn no lessons and change  nothing at all. Here was the quote:         I'm not going to change the direction.    Thirteen-plus percent inflation over 2 years, historic levels of  dissatisfaction at Americans' kitchen tables, and President Biden says  he will keep doing precisely what he has been doing: more inflation,  more crime, more chaos, more open borders.   If Washington Democrats do not want to pivot to sanity and common  sense, if they will not help us address the ways their policies are  hurting families, they will encounter stiff resistance from the sizable  Senate Republican Conference that half the country has elected to be  their voice, to be their champions, to fight for them.   So to sum it up, we are going to fight hard for the American families  this administration is leaving behind.    Mr. President, last month, Kentucky lost a statesman,  a model gentleman, and one of the key mentors of my early career.  Former Kentucky Court of Appeals Judge Tom Emberton of Edmonton, KY,  passed away this October in a tragic house fire, a sudden and  devastating loss for the entire Commonwealth. Today, I ask my  colleagues to join me in honoring Tom's legacy of public service and  paying tribute to his extraordinary career.   Tom was born and raised in south central Kentucky and prioritized  service to that distinctive community from the outset of his career. He  served a 4-year tour of duty with the U.S. Air Force then returned to  the Commonwealth for an undergraduate degree at Western Kentucky  University and a law degree from the University of Louisville School of  Law. Not long after, he moved to Metcalfe County to serve as county  attorney, beginning his long work on behalf of the region.   I first got to know Tom a few years later when, upon returning to  Kentucky after a stint in Washington, DC, I got involved with his 1971  gubernatorial campaign. Four years prior, Louie B. Nunn had become the  Commonwealth's first Republican Governor in two decades, and Tom bet he  could build on his success to bring another four years of conservative  leadership to the Commonwealth. Tom's campaign was instructive for me;  he traveled all across Kentucky, including to deeply Democratic  strongholds, to preach the Republican policies that most Kentuckians  agreed with but, historically, did not vote for. Ultimately, Tom  couldn't pull out a win that year--my future colleague in the U.S.  Senate Wendell Ford was elected--but he earned respect from leaders and  voters across Kentucky.   Tom was undeterred by his electoral loss and returned to Metcalfe  County  [[Page S6646]]  to continue his work on behalf of his neighbors and build his law  career. In recognition of Tom's outstanding service to the Commonwealth  and ability to breach partisan divides, a Democratic Governor appointed  him to a vacancy on the Kentucky Court of Appeals in 1987. Voters  reelected him to that position twice, and his peers appointed him to  serve as chief judge of the court of appeals, a position he held until  2004. By the time of his retirement, the entire Kentucky legal  community recognized this once-upstart conservative as a widely revered  senior statesman.   Throughout the course of his career, Tom made sure to expand the  scope of his service beyond the courtroom and the ballot box. He  maintained lifelong involvement with the WKU community, serving with  distinction on the school's board of regents and as the WKU Alumni  Association Board President. He received repeated recognition from  community organizations based in and around Metcalfe County, including  the local chamber of commerce and area development district. The  Kentucky Transportation Cabinet even named Thomas D. Emberton Bridge in  Metcalfe County in his honor.   Along the way, Tom and his wife Julia Lee built an amazing home and  family in Metcalfe County. His two children, Laura and Tom Jr., five  grandchildren, and recently arrived great-grandchildren were the light  of his life. I had the pleasure of visiting the Emberton family over  the years and reminiscing with Tom about his campaign days and  discussing the current state of politics and policy in the  Commonwealth. He and Julia Lee also built a special relationship with  my wife, Elaine, that all of us have cherished for many years.   I was shocked to hear of Tom's sudden passing last month in a fire,  when he heroically saved his wife's life and perished inside his home.  Elaine and I are mourning alongside the entire Emberton family and hope  they can find some solace in this difficult time. On behalf of the  entire Senate, I honor Tom for his service to Kentucky and offer  prayers to the Emberton family as they memorialize Tom's incredible  life and career.                            ____________________     Mr. President, following a decade of service as Trigg  County Judge-Executive, Hollis Alexander is retiring. He has spent 35  years in service to his constituents in a variety of roles and is now  looking forward to spending more time with his wife, children, and  grandchildren. Today, I ask my colleagues to join me in thanking Hollis  for his work on behalf of Kentucky and honoring him for his service to  the Commonwealth.   Hollis got his start in public service through his work with the  Cadiz Police Department, which he led as chief for nearly two decades  before entering elected office. Through his career in law enforcement,  he became a well-known face to Trigg County locals. His work also  caught the eye of statewide leaders, and when Trigg County's previous  judge-executive stepped down to take a seat in the State senate,  Kentucky's Governor appointed Hollis as his replacement.   Though originally a Democrat, Hollis joined scores of other Kentucky  elected officials to switch his party registration and better reflect  the conservative values of most of his constituents. Since his original  appointment in 2013, Hollis won reelection twice--first as a Democrat,  then as a Republican--and earned the trust and confidence of his  neighbors.   Hollis lists Trigg County's fiscal strength as one of his proudest  accomplishments in office. Through his successful stewardship of county  revenues and expenses, he was able to upgrade local government  facilities and equipment. Hollis has left Trigg County's government  better than it was when he found it, making a mark on his community  that his neighbors will feel for years to come.   Judge Alexander says he is looking forward to spending more time with  his family--and especially his four grandchildren--after he takes a  step back from his current role at this year's end. I know he certainly  deserves it after three-and-a-half decades of fine service to Trigg  County. On behalf of my Senate colleagues, I wish Hollis the best of  luck in the next step of his life and express my deep gratitude for his  service to Kentucky.                            ____________________     Mr. President, after 20 years of service as Hardin  County judge-executive, my good friend Harry Berry is retiring. Over  the past two decades, he has built a Kentucky-wide reputation for  steadfast leadership and selfless service. Today, I ask my Senate  colleagues to join me in thanking Judge Berry for his work and wishing  him well in his retirement.   Harry took a circuitous route to public service in Hardin County. A  Missouri native, he spent much of his early career in the Washington,  DC, area, working with the CIA, Army, and other defense agencies to  coordinate engineering projects around the world. When Harry decided to  retire from that role, he and his wife Jill chose Hardin County as  their new home; the county was close to Jill's parents in Hopkins  County and offered robust services to the former military personnel who  settled in the area after service at Fort Knox.   Harry is a self-described introvert who prefers to approach the world  with the quiet, analytical approach he developed as a military engineer  rather than the bombast common in politics. Still, he has a keen eye  for organization and development, honed through 20 years in the Army  and, upon moving to Hardin County, spotted several local issues he  thought he could try his hand at improving. His first run for public  office was unsuccessful, but after living in Hardin County for only a  few years, he won the county judge-executive race in 2002. He was the  first Republican to ever occupy the office.   Twenty years later, Harry says his retail politicking has improved.  But his real accomplishments in office have been largely behind the  scenes: sound financial management, improved hiring and public  services, upgraded government facilities, and extensive economic  development spurred by his steady, capable leadership. Under Harry's  purview, Hardin County has grown at a quick clip, leveraging its close  connections to the Fort Knox military installation to foster new  business and growth.   Beyond his public service, Harry has grown roots in Hardin County  that will continue to deepen in his retirement. He has leaned into his  community's extensive slate of organizations dedicated to caring for  veterans, including the Disabled Veterans Association, the VFW, and the  Military Officers Association. He promotes philanthropy and  volunteerism through the Lions, Masons, and Shriners. As Harry takes a  step back from elected office, I am sure these organizations will  welcome his interest and energy.   Few leaders can move to a new community and, within only a few years,  win an election to be that community's chief elected official. Fewer  still can do so without any experience in public office. But Harry did  so seamlessly and, 20 years later, has become an indispensable part of  Hardin County government. I know I speak for many Kentuckians when I  say I am sorry to see him leave this role but thankful for the two  decades of service he dedicated to our Commonwealth. On behalf of my  Senate colleagues, I congratulate Judge Harry Berry on his well-earned  retirement.                            ____________________     Mr. President, Fleming County Judge-Executive Larry  Foxworthy is stepping down after 20 years of work on behalf of his  constituents. His keen management of Fleming County's finances and  efforts to shore up government services have left a deep mark on his  community. Today, I ask my colleagues to join me in thanking Judge  Foxworthy for his sound leadership and congratulating him on his  retirement.   Larry and his wife Joyce are both lifelong residents of northeastern  Kentucky's Fleming County, part of a region of the Commonwealth noted  for its rolling farmland and historic small towns. Larry has dedicated  himself to both preserving that area's heritage and charting a course  toward a more vibrant future. As the county has grown in population and  economic development over the past two decades,  [[Page S6647]]  his leadership has been proven a success.   Judge Foxworthy takes a hands-on approach to leadership. Beyond the  fiscal court, he offers input on several boards that impact Fleming  County's economy and public services: the Fleming-Mason Airport Board  of Directors, the Fleming County Hospital Board of Directors, and the  Fleming County Industrial Authority Board of Directors, to name a few.  He has taken his expertise region- and Commonwealth-wide, helping the  Kentucky Association of Counties advocate for favorable policies on the  State and Federal level, and directing economic initiatives in  northeastern Kentucky through service as the Buffalo Trace Area  Development District Chairman.   Future generations will feel Larry's impact on Fleming County through  several tangible improvements he brought to his community. He  spearheaded the expansion of the Fleming County Nature Preserve,  inviting more tourists to his part of the Commonwealth. He helped  protect the Fleming County Hospital from insolvency, guaranteeing  continued medical care for his constituents. He has left Fleming  County's finances better than he found them, allowing local government  to continue to provide the services its citizens rely on.   Larry and Joyce chose to raise their three children in Fleming County  and have been blessed to become grandparents in recent years. I know  that, in retirement, Larry will cherish the opportunity to spend more  time with his growing family and foster the next generation of leaders  in Kentucky. I thank Larry for his service and, on behalf of my Senate  colleagues, honor him as he charts the next chapter in his life and  career.                            ____________________     Mr. President, Daviess County Judge-Executive Al  Mattingly has served his community with distinction since 2011, earning  three terms in office and leading Owensboro toward a bright, prosperous  future. Last year, Al announced he would not seek a fourth term in  office, following in his predecessors' footsteps by deciding to serve a  maximum of 12 years as judge-executive. Today, I ask my colleagues to  join me in honoring Al for his service to Daviess County and thanking  him for his effective leadership.   Al felt called to public service early in life and hasn't let up on  his commitment since. Following his graduation from Owensboro's Brescia  College, he joined the U.S. Army to help protect and defend our Nation.  Not long after, he married his wife of more than 50 years, Judy Wolfe,  and then returned to his hometown for a career in the private sector.   Al has remained involved in Owensboro's thriving small business  community since then and currently serves as president of the family- owned Acme Plumbing and Heating company. However, two decades ago, he  realized he could make his mark on Daviess County beyond that role and  ran for the Owensboro City Commission. After winning election in 2003  and again in 2007, Al earned the title of Owensboro mayor pro tem in  2007. This served as the perfect primer for his county-wide service as  judge-executive, which began in 2011.   Over the past decade, Al has marked a number of important milestones  in Owensboro's history. In just the last year, Owensboro earned the  title of ``Bluegrass Capital of the World,'' cementing a yearslong  effort to foster the musical arts in Daviess County and bring tourists  to the cradle of Bluegrass music in the surrounding region. Al  leveraged Owensboro's access to the Ohio River to expand Daviess  County's riverport infrastructure and waterfront attractions, inviting  economic development for the whole county. But more than anything, Al  says his chief achievement has been his unique ability to sit down with  his constituents and listen to their concerns, one-on-one. That kind of  personal relationship with his neighbors and voters has always been the  lynchpin of Al's career.   Al says he looks forward to spending more time with his wife and  family during his retirement and is also likely to expand his lifetime  involvement with his church, Our Lady of Lourdes. After his decades of  service to Daviess County, he has certainly earned the right to take a  step back from the public eye and enjoy his retirement. On behalf of  the Commonwealth and the U.S. Senate, I would like to express my  immense gratitude to Al for his work on behalf of Daviess County and  wish him well in the next step in his career.                            ____________________     Mr. President, after three terms as Lyon County judge- executive, my good friend Wade White is stepping down from his position  and has been nominated to serve on the Tennessee Valley Authority Board  of Directors. His proven leadership in local government has caught the  eye of Federal leaders, but I know his focus remains on Kentucky and  helping his community access the inexpensive, reliable power TVA  promises to provide to a wide swath of our Commonwealth. Today, I ask  my colleagues to join me in honoring Wade for his public service and  wishing him the best in the next step in his career.   Wade's heart has always been in serving his neighbors and home State.  Even before his community elected him to serve as their top county  official, he made a mark on Kentucky as a youth minister and insurance  adjuster--in both roles, helping people as they went through tough  times. Twelve years ago, he threw his hat in the ring and successfully  pursued election as county judge-executive. He has lent his top-tier  leadership and expertise to Lyon County ever since.   During his tenure, Wade's focus has been set squarely on some of the  long-term challenges facing Lyon County. As one of the two Kentucky  counties encompassing Land Between the Lakes, Lyon County and its  leaders play an important role in advocating for prudent Federal land  management policies. Wade and I have worked together closely to ensure  Land Between the Lakes continues to offer economic and recreational  opportunities for generations of Kentuckians to come.   Wade has also prioritized two pressing issues facing waterways in his  region of Kentucky: improving Barkley Dam and addressing the ongoing  Asian carp infestation. His work on these issues served as strong  preparation for his nomination to the TVA Board, which plays a key role  in managing Kentucky's waterways. The board also lacks representation  from our State, despite serving 215,000 Kentucky households; Wade's  unique perspective promises to bring balance to the organization and  its priorities.   Though Wade is taking a step back from elected office, his career in  public service is far from over. He will continue to steward Kentucky's  development, just as he did during--and even before--his tenure as Lyon  County judge-executive. On behalf of my Senate colleagues, I thank Wade  for his hard work on behalf of Kentucky and look forward to his future  service to our Nation.                            ____________________
