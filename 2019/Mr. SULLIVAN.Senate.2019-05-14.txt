 Madam President, I would like to take a moment  today to recognize and congratulate an incredible group of young  Alaskans on their victory in the 2019 USA Hockey National Championship.  On April 8, 2019, the Anchorage North Stars beat the McKinney North  Stars of Texas 4-3 to win the Youth Tier II 16U National Championship.   USA Hockey is the major governing body for ice hockey in the United  States. There are almost 600,000 players across the various age groups.  Make no mistake; the best youth hockey players in the country were  competing in this tournament, which makes the North Stars' victory all  the more significant.   The Anchorage North Stars traveled nearly 4,000 miles to compete with  11 other teams for the title. Early on in the tournament, during round- robin play, the Anchorage North Stars lost to the McKinney North Stars  in a hard-fought 3-2 battle. However, like many great sports stories,  the Anchorage North Stars found redemption.   Late in the championship game, the teams were tied 3-3, but Hayden  Fox, who had already scored one goal in the third period, scored the  game-winning goal for the Anchorage North Stars with less than a minute  left on the clock. The Anchorage North Stars held their lead and came  home with a national championship, the first for an Alaska youth hockey  team since the mid-90's.   Hockey is a way of life for many Alaskan families. Many of these  players have been in the sport since they were young kids. The North  Stars' victory is a testament to the years of hard work and commitment  by each and every player and coach, not to mention all the support from  parents and other family members who were there from the beginning  providing support, driving the players to and from practice, and  cheering them on to victory. This achievement was a long time in the  making, and I think it is important to recognize that kind of  dedication.   Throughout the season, the North Stars adhered to two mottos--``Let's  Leave No Doubt'' and ``Together We Can.'' This spirit of confidence and  comradeship took the North Stars all the way to the final round, and  they showed the entire country what kind of team they are. They  performed at the highest level on the biggest stage, and I think it is  safe to say that there is no one doubting them now.                            ____________________
