 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 5473) to amend certain laws relating to disaster  recovery and relief with respect to the implementation of building  codes, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5473         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Promoting Resilient       Buildings Act of 2023''.       SEC. 2. PREDISASTER HAZARD MITIGATION.         Section 203 of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and       Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5133) is amended by       adding at the end the following:        ``(m) Latest Published Editions.--For purposes of       subsections (e)(1)(B)(iv) and (g)(10), the term `latest       published editions' means, with respect to relevant       consensus-based codes, specifications, and standards, the 2       most recently published editions.''.       SEC. 3. HAZARD MITIGATION REVOLVING LOAN FUND PROGRAM.         Section 205(f)(5) of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief       and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5135(f)(5)) is       amended--        (1) in the paragraph heading by striking ``Establishing''       and insert ``Implementing'';        (2) by striking ``establish'' and insert ``implement'';        (3) by inserting ``2'' after ``latest''; and  [[Page H6755]]         (4) by inserting ``, including any amendments made by       State, local, Tribal, or territorial governments to such       codes, specifications, and standards,'' after ``standards''.       SEC. 4. RESIDENTIAL RETROFIT AND RESILIENCE PILOT PROGRAM.         (a) Establishment.--The Administrator of the Federal       Emergency Management Agency shall carry out a residential       resilience pilot program through the program established       under section 203 of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief       and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5133) to make       available assistance to States and local governments for the       purpose of providing grants to individuals for residential       resilience retrofits.        (b) Amount of Funds.--The Administrator may use not more       than 10 percent of the assistance made available to       applicants on an annual basis under section 203 of the Robert       T.

(e) Report.--Not later than 4 years after the date of       enactment of this Act, the Administrator shall submit to the       Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure of the House       of Representatives and the Committee on Homeland Security and       Governmental Affairs of the Senate a report that includes--        (1) a summary of the grant awards and projects carried out       under this section;        (2) a detailed compilation of results achieved by the grant       awards and projects carried out under this section, including       the number of homes receiving retrofits, the types and       average costs of retrofits, demographic information for       participants in the program, and estimate avoidance in       disaster impacts and Federal disaster payments as a result of       the grant investments; and        (3) any identified implementation challenges and       recommendations for improvements to the pilot program.        (f) Applicability.--This section shall only apply to       amounts appropriated on or after the date of enactment of       this Act.        (g) Residential Resilient Retrofits Defined.--        (1) In general.--In this section, the term ``residential       resilient retrofits'' means a project that--        (A) is designed to increase the resilience of an existing       home or residence using mitigation measures which the       administrator determines reduce damage and impacts from       natural disaster hazards and risks that are most likely to       occur in the area where the home is located; and        (B) to the extent applicable, are consistent with the 2       most recently published editions of relevant consensus-based       codes, specifications, and standards, including any       amendments made by State, local, tribal, or territorial       governments to such codes, specifications, and standards that       incorporate the latest hazard-resistant designs and establish       criteria for the design, construction, and maintenance of       residential structures and facilities that may be eligible       for assistance under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief       and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5121 et seq.) for the       purpose of protecting the health, safety, and general welfare       of the buildings' users against disasters.        (2) Inclusion.--In this section, the term ``residential       resilient retrofits'' includes--        (A) elevations of homes and elevations of utilities within       and around structures to mitigate damages;        (B) floodproofing measures;        (C) the construction of tornado safe rooms;        (D) seismic retrofits;        (E) wildfire retrofit and mitigation measures;        (F) wind retrofits, including roof replacements, hurricane       straps, and tie-downs; and        (G) any other measures that meet the requirements of       paragraph (1), as determined by the Administrator.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material into the Record on H.R. 5473,  as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, first, I thank the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr.  Edwards) for introducing H.R. 5473, the Promoting Resilient Buildings  Act of 2023.   H.R. 5473 cuts red tape and improves resiliency against disasters by  making a technical correction to the Stafford Act and extending the  building code of 2018, which expired earlier this year.   This bill ensures that there is flexibility in how the Federal  Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA, applies definitions for building  codes and promotes individual States' abilities to consider what is  best for their communities.                                time  1515    This bill also supports homeowners in mitigating against future  disasters through a pilot program intended to test and analyze whether  such assistance will help reduce future costs and save some lives.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this legislation, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the  gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Edwards), a former T&I Committee  member.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time to close.   This bill extends the current building code definition set in the  Disaster Recovery Reform Act of 2018 to allow greater flexibility for  States and local governments, ultimately ensuring that disaster victims  have an easier time rebuilding after a disaster.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this legislation, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 6503) to amend title 49, United States Code, to  extend authorizations for the airport improvement program, to amend the  Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to extend the funding and expenditure  authority of the Airport and Airway Trust Fund, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 6503         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and insert extraneous material into the Record on H.R. 6503.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   H.R. 6503 extends the statutory authorities of the Federal Aviation  Administration through March 8, 2024. This bill also authorizes the  continued collection of aviation excise taxes, which are user fees that  are critical to ensuring the safe operation of our air traffic control  system and for capital infrastructure projects at airports all over the  country.   This subsequent extension is necessary because the Senate has yet to  finalize their FAA reauthorization bill. The House did its part to  provide for a long-term reauthorization when we passed H.R. 3935 in an  overwhelmingly bipartisan fashion on July 20 with more than 350 votes.   I commend my House colleagues for their commitment to reauthorizing  the FAA on time and ahead of schedule. I remain committed to enacting a  long-term comprehensive FAA bill as soon as possible, and I know that  that goal is shared by our counterparts in the Senate. In the meantime,  however, we have to keep the lights on at the FAA to ensure continued  safe operation of the national airspace system.   Failure to enact this legislation would result in a loss of revenue  totaling $50 million per day from the Airport and Airway Trust Fund. In  other words, not passing this bill would directly and immediately  increase our national debt by more than $50 million a day and leave our  aviation system less safe.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage all Members to support this bill so that we  can maintain safety in the national airspace system in the absence of a  long-term reauthorization. I urge support of this legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the words of the  gentleman from Tennessee.  [[Page H6758]]    I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Collins), a  member of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the  gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Graves), the chairman of the Aviation  Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   Again, I urge all Members to support this must-pass bill so we can  keep our aviation system operating safely. Failing to pass an extension  would cost the Federal Government more than $50 million a day in those  lost revenues.   What is more, the FAA would be prohibited from making new obligations  from the aviation trust fund to fund FAA's important safety,  operational, and research functions.   To be clear, and I want to be clear to my colleagues, this bill  provides a clean extension of FAA authorities. This bill does not  include any policy riders at all.   Again, I know there is an appetite across the Capitol to enact a  long-term and comprehensive FAA bill, and that continues to be my  priority. I urge the Senate to act soon on its FAA bill so that  Congress can deliver certainty to the aviation industry and the FAA.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support for the bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
