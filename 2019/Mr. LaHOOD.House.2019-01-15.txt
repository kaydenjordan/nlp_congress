 Madam Speaker, this month, we celebrate Human Trafficking  and National Slavery Prevention Month, and I rise today to draw  attention to the importance of combating this epidemic.   Human trafficking takes many forms, including sex, forced labor, and  domestic servitude. Educating individuals about human trafficking is  essential to thwarting this modern day form of slavery.   This need for increased awareness is why I have partnered with the  Center for Prevention of Abuse in Peoria, Illinois, and also the U.S.  Department of Homeland Security to host two human trafficking awareness  prevention roundtables in my district, bringing together State, local,  and Federal officials. We held valuable dialogues with those on the  front lines of this crisis about ways to end human trafficking for  good.   This week, I am proud to be joining my colleague, Congresswoman Val  Demings from Florida, to introduce a resolution to formally recognize  January as National Trafficking and Modern Day Slavery Prevention Month  in Congress.   As I have learned firsthand, combating human trafficking will take a  multifaceted approach, but if we continue to educate and make resources  available at all levels, important strides can be made and we can end  this crisis.                            ____________________
