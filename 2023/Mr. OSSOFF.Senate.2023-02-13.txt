 Madam President, I rise to honor Ms. Lauren Fins  for her compassion and leadership in the Savannah community.   Ms. Lauren Fins has dedicated her time to assisting veterans and  other members of her community who suffer from posttraumatic stress  disorder and other trauma-related illnesses through her organization  Fins Animal Training, fondly earning her the title of ``hometown  heroine'' across coastal Georgia.   Over the last 10 years, Ms. Fins has committed more than 1,000 hours  of her personal time to training service dogs that uplift people in  need across Savannah, and she was recognized with the President's  Volunteer Service Award in 2022 for her commitment to this feat.   In addition to her work with Fins Animal Training, she also trains  dogs for SD Gunner Fund, a local nonprofit that provides service dogs  to people who need them.   In many cases, Ms. Fins has helped dogs grow from young pups to loyal  companions who can help support individuals' everyday quality of life,  including by helping a person off the floor, pulling a wheelchair, or  by picking up a prosthetic limb.   As Georgia's U.S. Senator, I recognize and commend Lauren Fins for  her commitment and dedication to Georgia's veterans.                            ____________________     Madam President, I rise to honor an exemplary  member of the Appling community, Ms. Tonya Gambrell.   Ms. Tonya Gambrell serves as the principal of North Columbia  Elementary, where she works each day to engage, enrich, and inspire  each of her students.   Last year, thanks to Ms. Gambrell's leadership, North Columbia  Elementary School was named a National Blue Ribbon School by the U.S.  Department of Education for their overall academic excellence and work  to reduce learning gaps among their students, a recognition given to  less than 300 schools nationwide.   As Georgia's U.S. Senator, I recognize and commend Tonya Gambrell for  her profound impact on Georgia's children and congratulate North  Columbia Elementary on this excellent honor.                            ____________________     Madam President, I rise to honor Ms. Joy Hendrix,  recreational specialist and supervisor of  [[Page S350]]  the Frank Chester Senior Center in Columbus, Georgia.   For more than 45 years, Ms. Hendrix has served her beloved community,  working for the Columbus Parks and Recreation Department in different  roles since she was a high school student looking for a summer job.   The Frank Chester Recreation Center offers a variety of programs for  senior citizens to engage in arts and crafts, fitness and sports, and  banquets. The center is also a place for local families and children to  enjoy outdoor activities.   Joy Hendrix is passionate about promoting health and wellness for all  seniors who take advantage of the services the center offers. She  represents Columbus' best values and continues to be a champion for  seniors in her community.   As Georgia's U.S. Senator, I recognize and commend Joy Hendrix for  her service and dedication to the Columbus community and to the State  of Georgia.                            ____________________     Madam President, I rise to honor a great champion  for young people across central Georgia.   June O'Neal serves the executive director of the Mentors Project in  Macon-Bibb County, which matches mentors with young people across  central Georgia.   Founded in 1990 by the Education Committee of the Greater Macon  Chamber of Commerce, the Mentors Project aims to help young people who  may be struggling.   Mentors work with middle and high school students to help them reach  their full potential, providing guidance, support, and encouragement.   Ms. O'Neal leads a team of more than 100 mentors and volunteers who  encourage students to work hard and stay in school, and they have  dedicated substantial time to give back to others. Today, the program  has grown to partner with 14 schools in Macon-Bibb County and has  helped hundreds of young people in middle Georgia.   As Georgia's U.S. Senator, I recognize and commend June O'Neal for  her tireless work to support Georgia's youth.                            ____________________     Madam President, I rise to honor a leader of  Georgia's agricultural community.   Few are known better in the peanut industry than Georgia's own Tyron  Spearman, who serves as executive director of the National Peanut  Buying Points Association.   In 1978, Spearman helped initiate the American Peanut Council's  Export Promotion program. He has visited a dozen countries promoting  the U.S. peanut industry and has served as a two-time chair of the  board of directors for the American Peanut Council.   Locally, Spearman is well-known as editor of the Peanut Grower  Magazine, which is mailed to 8,000 peanut farmers. In 2013, he was  awarded the Peanut Hull of Fame Award, the highest honor in the  industry.   Last year, the National Peanut Buying Points Association and several  other companies and associations announced the creation of the Tyron  Spearman CAES Scholarship Fund, providing support to agricultural and  environmental science students at the University of Georgia.   I recognize and commend Tyron Spearman for his lifetime of service  and work advancing Georgia's and the United States' peanut  industry.                            ____________________
