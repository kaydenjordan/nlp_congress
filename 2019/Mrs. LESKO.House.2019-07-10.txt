 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  Transportation Security Officers at the Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport for  their bravery and dedication to their mission to keep our airports  safe.   Last month on June 18, a man rushed a TSA security checkpoint at the  Phoenix Airport, injuring and knocking over several TSOs in the  process. I would like to thank the following TSOs who showed courage in  subduing the attacker, even as he attempted to hurt and push past the  officers:   Donna Potts O'Brien, Cynthia Baker, Christopher Cotton, Sandra  Thompson, Patricia Miller-Davis, Gladys Recinos, Michael Malloy, Melvin  Gorham, Adam Ervin, Kenneth Fetter, Robert Morelos, Michael Wilmoth,  and Roberto Lopez.   I am grateful to these heroic officers and commend their actions to  keep the Phoenix Airport secure.                            ____________________
