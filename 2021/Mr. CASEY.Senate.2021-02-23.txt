 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise tonight and, again, it is my  privilege to come before the Senate, as I have since my very first year  here, to celebrate Black History Month in a particular way by paying  tribute to a number of Pennsylvanians.   I am honored again to have the opportunity to highlight the  extraordinary leadership of Pennsylvanians who dedicate their lives to  improving their communities and who wake up every day to rededicate  themselves to that effort. This year I am grateful to be able to  recognize three honorees--Glynis Johns, Justan Parker Fields, and Dr.  Ala Stanford--and to recognize each of these individuals in a very  personal way in terms of their work in their communities in  Pennsylvania. Each of them are having a remarkable impact in their  communities.    The theme of this year's recognition is ``Bending the Arc:  Celebrating Catalysts for Change.'' We know that Dr. Martin Luther  King, Jr., spoke of ``bending the arc'' on many occasions, but, most  notably, in his address at the conclusion of the Selma to Montgomery  March in 1965 in March of that year, when he said:         The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends towards       justice.    Our late and beloved colleague here in the Congress, Congressman John  Lewis, carried that same spirit with him. He lived it, and he believed  that we will get there someday, get there to a better day for justice.  Congressman Lewis also said:         We will redeem the soul of America, and in doing so, we       will inspire people around the world to stand up and speak       out.    We know that justice, of course, takes hard work. In the face of  adversity and exhaustion, to be the voice that stands up and speaks  out, as John Lewis suggested, is not a decision that a person makes  once and then just follows a well-worn path. It, of course, requires  perseverance. It requires hope and faith.   Dr. King reminds us that justice is the--to use his words--is the  ``fierce urgency of now.'' Dr. King and Congressman Lewis understood  that while the arc of the moral universe does bend toward justice, this  is not something to which one can attach themselves a path that you can  follow passively. To bend that arc toward justice requires strenuous  exertion that often gets you enemies before it makes you any friends.  It does not bend on its own but bends only--only--under the weight of  acts of courage and the hard work of those who have committed  themselves to the struggle for justice and equality.   President Obama, as well, in his work every day of his Presidency,  did work to bend the arc on issues of racial, economic, and global  justice, and he continues to do so in his years as a former President.  Congressman Lewis not only gave all of us words to live by and  inspiration, he also gave all of himself to the cause of justice. But  his example, the example of John Lewis, still serves as an inspiration  for the next generation of leaders. It is why Dr. King spent his entire  life fighting for racial equality, voting rights, nonviolence, and the  rights of the poor. King's work for the lives of others cost him his  very own. We should honor his sacrifice daily and not simply during  Black History Month.   But we know that behind every man and every woman leading the fight  for justice stands a multitude. Behind Dr. King, millions labored and  labor still for civil rights and voting rights. We saw that this summer  when millions of Americans across our Nation took to the streets to  condemn the mistreatment of Black Americans at the hands of law  enforcement. And we saw it just last month when African Americans voted  in extraordinary numbers in the Georgia special elections to send Rev.  [[Page S806]]  Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff to the U.S. Senate.   For every leader who rises to national prominence--Dr. King,  President Obama, Congressman Lewis, Vice President Kamala Harris,  Stacey Abrams, just to mention a few--there are leaders and communities  across the country who are themselves doing transformational work, who  are doing their part to bend the arc of the moral universe, and to bend  it, of course, toward justice.   Today, it is my privilege to highlight three such leaders from  Pennsylvania. I will start in my home region and in my hometown,  Scranton, PA, Glynis Johns.   First, I speak as a son of Scranton, the city I was born in and still  live in. I was proud to honor a daughter--or I should say am proud,  tonight, to honor a daughter from Scranton, Glynis Johns. Glynis is the  founder and CEO of the Black Scranton Project, a nonprofit  organization, a local heritage initiative and public history venture  dedicated to archiving and celebrating the Black history of our  hometown that too often has been overlooked and has been obscured. She  received a B.A. and an M.A. in sociology from St. John's University and  is currently a doctoral student at Rutgers.   Glynis did not always plan to become a local historian, but like so  many, she became one because she saw a need, and she responded to it.  While working on a research project during her master's program at St.  John's, the stories called to her, and she knew she needed to share  these stories. For her project, she investigated why the Black  community is overlooked and seen as transient in a city like Scranton.  She kept uncovering stories through old newspaper archives and  historical memorabilia, and she knew she had to return to her hometown  to share these stories and rebuild a community.   She is proud to shift local perspectives on culture, inclusion,  representation, and history within the city of Scranton. As a native  and as a resident, I am grateful for her work to uncover these stories  for our entire community to learn and to enjoy.   I first met Glynis just last year, 2020. It was the Juneteenth  Jubilee, which she organized in our hometown, along with her fellow  Black Scranton board members. It was both a celebration and a call to  action, and that was in the midst of a summer of Black Lives Matter  rallies and marches.   From the moment I arrived at that event and saw hundreds of, at that  time, socially distanced and masked attendees, I saw her dedication. I  saw her commitment firsthand. In addition to events like the Juneteenth  Jubilee, Glynis and her colleagues at the Black Scranton Project are  hard at work on their plan to reopen the Black Scranton Project Center  for Arts & Culture. The center will provide a safe, secure, and diverse  environment that will lead to equity and inclusion for all residents by  offering support like job assistance, career readiness training for  adults, and also afterschool and summer programs for children. The  plans for the center are ambitious, and I know that Glynis and her team  are up for this important task. I am looking forward to walking through  the doors of the center to see their work for myself as soon as it  opens.    Having spaces for the community to come together to learn is  necessary. It is necessary to build up and support the community, and I  am grateful for Glynis's commitment to do this work in our hometown. I  know firsthand how Scranton can benefit from young people like Glynis  moving up and dedicating their time to making our city and region a  better place to live. We are lucky to have her talents and her drive.   We know that in March of 2020, she was named one of the most  ``Influential Women of Northeastern Pennsylvania'' in Happenings  magazine and was also named a ``Top 20 under 40 Young Business  Professionals'' as part of the 2019 honors, and that was in the  Northeastern Pennsylvania Business Journal. Glynis has already  accomplished so much, and I am looking forward to watching her  contributions to our hometown over the years to come.   Our second honoree for Black History Month is Justan Parker Fields  from the Lehigh Valley, just south of Northeastern Pennsylvania, where  the city of Allentown is, and it is right on the New Jersey border.  Justan is a resident of the city of Allentown.   Following the deaths of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor just last  year, Justan decided to gather a few of his friends in the city of  Allentown, in the downtown, to bring attention to these and other  injustices against the African-American community. This gathering  gained attention across the city and was attended by hundreds,  including the mayor of Allentown, the police chief, and elected  officials from across the Lehigh Valley. This event gave the residents  of Allentown an opportunity to express their thoughts and frustrations  surrounding racial injustice, and from there, Justan and his colleagues  founded Black Lives Matter Lehigh Valley. They founded it in order to  create a platform to initiate real change in their community.   Since then, Justan's activism has only increased. He worked to form a  collective with other local community and nonprofit leaders in the area  to brainstorm about new initiatives for racial justice, for equity, and  for equality for Black and Brown residents of the Lehigh Valley, and  his work is not going unnoticed.   I spoke with Justan and his colleagues shortly after their first  event, and over the past year, he has remained in regular communication  with my office to discuss the progress that Black Lives Matter Lehigh  Valley is making in Allentown and in surrounding communities. He has  also provided testimony to the Pennsylvania House Democratic Policy  Committee, partnered with the city of Allentown to review their use of  force policy, and he has also worked with the Allentown City Council to  draft recommendations for police reform in the city.   His activism has been inspiring to me and to so many others, and I  know that that same inspiration draws other young people to his work.  His hope is that those who attend his rallies or follow Black Lives  Matter Lehigh Valley on social media are motivated to jump-start their  activism and their fight for equality.   Justan lives in Allentown with his partner Kevin and children,  Shyllee and Shamaer. There is no doubt that Justan's work in Allentown  is creating a healthier and more inclusive community for his children  and others like him.   Justan and Kevin have founded Change Now, a local nonprofit that  serves families in need in the greater Lehigh Valley. They have hosted  food drives, delivered emergency food relief packages to families,  hosted a Friendsgiving Dinner for the city, and sponsored Christmas  presents for over 100 children. Justan said that if there is anything  this pandemic taught him, it was that anyone, any family was just an  illness away from needing serious help.   Through his work with both Change Now and Black Lives Matter Lehigh  Valley, Justan continues to make Allentown and the Greater Lehigh  Valley a better place to live. And I thank him, and I know I speak on  behalf of so many Pennsylvanians in thanking him for the many  contributions to his community and to our Commonwealth.   Third and final, going further south to the southeastern corner of  our State in the Philadelphia region, Dr. Ala Stanford. As we recognize  changemakers this year, I am honored to recognize the contributions of  Dr. Stanford.   She is an experienced physician, board certified by the American  Board of Surgery in both general adult and pediatric general and  thoracic surgery. She founded the Black Doctors COVID Consortium. It  goes by the acronym BDCC. So many people have heard about them in our  State and beyond. This consortium is an initiative established to  provide African Americans, who, of course, we know are suffering  disproportionately from the incidence of and the mortality surrounding  COVID-19--this consortium provides those Americans, those  Pennsylvanians, with testing and education. Her work addresses not only  the urgency of the present moment due to the pandemic but also a legacy  of systemic structural racism that has left the Black community with  significant health disparities--I think that is an understatement--and  a mistrust of the healthcare system.   I have had the privilege of engaging with Dr. Stanford on many  occasions.  [[Page S807]]  She has provided her subject matter expertise to my office countless  times, and she has been an unrelenting and passionate advocate for the  communities, the people, and the families whom she serves.   It is important to note that Dr. Stanford started the consortium,  BDCC, with her own funds, her own money, which is a true testament to  her commitment to delivering quality care to Black Americans. Dr.  Stanford stepped up at an extremely volatile and uncertain time for the  people of our State. This speaks volumes about her leadership and her  dedication to addressing the enormous disparity in healthcare, both  healthcare access and healthcare outcomes, for African Americans.   Last month, I was honored to, again, participate in the annual  celebration of the life and legacy of Dr. King at Girard College, where  BDCC set up a testing site, which they have done in every neighborhood  throughout the city of Philadelphia. At that event, someone shared a  powerful yet sobering quotation of Dr. King. Here is that quotation:         In March of 1966, at a press conference ahead of his       address to the Medical Community for Human Rights in Chicago,       [Dr. King] said that--    And I am quoting Dr. King here--       ``of all the forms of inequality, injustice in health is the       most shocking and the most inhumane because it often results       in physical death.''    So said Dr. King about the terrible inequity in healthcare.   Visionary leaders and health experts like Dr. Stanford are on the  frontlines every single day, working to fix a broken system--a system,  frankly, that has been unfair to so many communities of color. However,  Dr. Stanford is committed--committed--to making change happen in our  healthcare system so it can better serve the African-American  community.   She and her team have made national headlines and garnered the well- deserved attention and support of many across the Nation as a result of  the work of this consortium. So I thank Dr. Stanford for being an  advocate, for being an anchor for the community, and, of course, a  trusted leader.   As I conclude, I think it goes without saying that this year has been  a long, difficult, and dark year. I have to say, though, in the midst  of all of that darkness and all of the pain--we just left the front of  the Capitol in remembrance of the 500,000 Americans who have died from  COVID-19--despite all that pain, all that loss, all that darkness, this  month of February, which just happens to be Black History Month, gives  me some hope. In so many ways, I think our hope can be renewed.   While the pandemic still rages, especially in those communities of  color I spoke of, we also see that with continued education and  leadership and courage, such as someone like Dr. Stanford provides,  and, of course, with vaccines available, COVID-19 will begin to recede,  and we will once again be able to hug our friends and family members  and to move on from this pandemic. So we commend and salute people like  Dr. Stanford who are helping us through this difficult time, providing  some light in that darkness.   Leaders like Justin Parker Fields have stood up to confront injustice  and to proclaim to law enforcement and elected officials that the lives  of Black men and women matter and are deserving of the same protection  as any other life.   As we saw people go through the polls this fall voting, and then  others voting in January in Georgia, all of these Americans refusing to  be intimidated by misinformation and threats, I was more hopeful. Young  leaders in communities of color have insisted on telling their own  stories and writing them into the book of history that for too long has  been kept hidden from them, just as Glynis Johns is doing in our  hometown of Scranton.   Each of our honorees, and so many like them, have indeed bent the arc  of the moral universe toward justice, and for those brave acts, for  those courageous acts, we honor them today in Black History Month. May  God bless their work.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session and be in a period of morning business,  with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.
