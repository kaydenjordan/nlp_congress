 Moments ago, the Senate returned to our full 100- person strength as Nebraska's new junior Senator took the oath of  office.   The Cornhusker State expects a lot from its leaders. For the last 8  years, Nebraskans could rest easy knowing they had Deb Fischer and Ben  Sasse on the job here in Washington. And during that same time, of  course, they also had an outstanding leader even closer to home. As  Governor, Pete Ricketts applied private-sector savvy to the work of  public administration with great effect. He secured for Nebraska  families and small businesses the biggest tax relief in that State's  history. He championed parents' rights and defended civics education.   In the face of a global pandemic, he built the State's response on  common sense--saving lives but also safeguarding livelihoods;  preserving liberties and protecting kids' educations, all at the same  time. The people of Nebraska chose wisely in electing and re-electing  Governor Ricketts by huge margins. And their new Governor chose wisely  in sending his predecessor here to this Chamber.   I know I speak for the entire Senate in extending a warm welcome to  Senator Ricketts and his wife Susanne.   Pete, we are glad to have you here on the team.                                118th Congress    Madam President, on another matter, the American people want and need  this 118th Congress to work differently than the past 2 years that were  just finished. We just had 2 years of one-party Democratic control, 2  years of spending us into record inflation on party-line votes, 2 years  of ignoring top priorities of the American people like violent crime  and open borders, two years of Senate Democrats procrastinating on  basic government duties in order to push radical proposals like an  unprecedented elections takeover and unlimited abortion on demand for  all 9 months.   The American people put an end to that one-party government because  they wanted change.   This year, the Senate leadership must not put off our most basic  jobs, like intelligently funding our Federal Government and providing  for our Armed Forces, before the very last minute. Basic duties like  the appropriations process and the National Defense Authorization Act  need more thoughtfulness, more bipartisanship, and more regular order.  And they must not be shoved into late December after the Senate  Democrats waste literally months looking for ways to placate the  radical left.   The American people elected a bipartisan, divided government. The  country voted to change Washington. So this Chamber's Democratic  leadership needs to change accordingly.
