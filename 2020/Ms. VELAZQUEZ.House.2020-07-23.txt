 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   My friends, at times like this, it will benefit us all to remember  what the word ``Congress'' actually means. ``Congress'' means a coming  together. That is the entire point of this institution.   People from different regions of the country, with varying political  views, individuals of different backgrounds, ethnicities, sexual  orientations, and, yes, genders come together to solve problems on  behalf of the American people who elect us.   That is where the word ``Congress'' originates from. A coming  together.   We will frequently disagree heatedly. We argue on this floor and in  committee hearings and meetings. We may even disagree on the steps of  the Capitol. However, let us disagree agreeably.   The words being discussed today did not live up to those ideals, and  the gentleman must say that he is sorry. He must apologize. It is not  to apologize to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. He must apologize to his  wife, to his daughters, to women in this country.   Today, our political discourse is too often infected with an anger  and a malice unbecoming of our democratic traditions. As elected  officials, we are expected to do better, to act as an example of how we  can debate passionately but treat one another with compassion, dignity,  and respect.   It saddens me that the words that we are discussing today failed to  live up to that standard.   For those reasons, Madam Speaker, I stand with my friend from New  York in condemning the remarks that were made.   Madam Speaker, I ask all of us to do better. We must do better.                                time  1045
