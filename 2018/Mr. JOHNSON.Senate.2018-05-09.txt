 Mr. President, I rise today to encourage all my Senate  colleagues to vote to confirm Michael Brennan as a judge on the U.S.  Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. Michael Brennan has an  exemplary resume, including degrees from the University of Notre Dame  and Northwestern University School of Law, two Federal clerkships, work  as a prosecutor, and almost a decade on the State trial court bench  before returning to private practice. His accomplishments in practice  are noteworthy, but I would like to focus my remarks today on Mike's  commitment to public service and his reputation as a jurist.   Becoming a Seventh Circuit judge will not be a huge adjustment for  Mike because he has already spent 9 years as a judge. Anyone who spends  time with Mike will be struck not only by his intellect but by his  humility and strong commitment to justice and the rule of law. This  explains why the attorney general of Wisconsin and the State's public  defender--fierce adversaries in the courtroom--were able to come  together to write a letter enthusiastically supporting his nomination.  I have a sense those two don't often agree, but when it comes to who  they want deciding their cases, they both point to Mike.   By the way, that is just one of many letters that influential members  of the legal community in Wisconsin have written in support of Mike's  nomination. Included in the outpouring of support are letters from 2  former Federal defenders, 5 former U.S. attorneys, more than 40 judges,  and 15 former presidents of the State Bar of Wisconsin, Democrats and  Republicans--all joining together to support Michael Brennan's  confirmation.   One letter, signed by over two dozen Wisconsin judges from across the  political spectrum, sheds light on the kind of judge Mike has been and  will continue to be. It states:         To the litigants who appeared before him, Judge Brennan was       a wonderfully kind and patient judge with a humble demeanor.    Another letter attests that those same qualities have now made Judge  Brennan one of the most sought-after mediators and arbitrators in  Wisconsin. I am sure the litigants in the Seventh Circuit will have the  same experience and reaction to his hearing their cases.   In this climate that has hyperpoliticized the judiciary, I want to  bring my colleagues' attention to one very important paragraph in the  letter supporting Mike that was signed by Wisconsin judges. It reads:         Finally and significantly, Mike is not an ideologue, and he       has never worn his politics on his sleeve. You could ask any       number of lawyers who appeared before him, or his colleagues       who worked alongside of him, and they will confirm that Judge       Mike Brennan never let his personal, religious, or political       views influence his legal decision in any case. He is       brilliant, experienced, hard working, and fair-minded. Rest       assured, they don't come any better than Mike Brennan.    I agree with that assessment. We all know that type of bipartisan  praise isn't given; it is earned. In Mike's case, his longstanding  dedication to law and public service, coupled with his ability and  temperament, has won him the support of many Democrats and Republicans  in Wisconsin, and it has earned him the rating of unanimously ``well  qualified'' by the American Bar Association. Let me cite a few  statistics to prove the ABA rating is well deserved.   In Wisconsin, a party can ask for a different judge, and they can  make this request for any reason. Of the 9,000 cases Mike heard as a  judge, fewer than one-tenth of 1 percent--let me repeat that--fewer  than one-tenth of 1 percent of the litigants decided to go with another  judge. That is an extremely telling statistic about his even-keeled  temperament, his neutrality, and his legal skills.   Judge Brennan's low reversal rate also demonstrates his commitment to  following the law and his dedication to performing his job with  excellence. In 2005, out of 240 trial judges, Brennan was the most  affirmed judge in the entire State of Wisconsin. He was No. 1 out of  240. Of the 9,000 cases Mike heard as a judge, he was reversed in only  a handful of cases--fewer than 20--and in some of those, the Wisconsin  Supreme Court ended up reversing the court of appeals and reinstating  Brennan's original decision.   As final proof of the strong bipartisan support Michael Brennan  enjoys within Wisconsin's legal community, let me provide more  extensive quotes from a letter of support my office received from  former Milwaukee County district attorney E. Michael McCann. Mr. McCann  is a lifelong Democrat who served as the elected district attorney of  Milwaukee County for 37 years. He is recognized as one of the most  distinguished and accomplished district attorneys in the entire  country. This is what Mr. McCann had to say about Mike Brennan on first  working with Mike Brennan:         Key personnel in our office and I, in short order, became       impressed with Mr. Brennan's high energy, his mastery of the       law, his integrity, and his good judgment. As an assistant       district attorney, he was assigned to some very challenging       cases. Mr. Brennan continued to exhibit those qualities of       scholarship, integrity, and judgment which had initially       earned him our respect.    On Brennan's work as counsel for Wisconsin's truth-in-sentencing  committee, Mr. McCann said:         Mr. Brennan provided splendid research and appropriate       materials to the committee and with his gracious manner moved       the committee through its very substantial workload so       felicitously that the contentious disputes I and others had       expected simply did not occur.    On Brennan as a judge, McCann--whose office had lawyers before Judge  Brennan every day--said:         He was an excellent judge in all regards. He was properly       respectful of lawyers, witnesses, victims and of the rights       of defendants. His courtroom was a model of judicial decorum.       In jury trials and trials to the court and in the hearing of       motions, he was thoughtful, patient, knowledgeable, and       scholarly. He had mastery of the law and was cognizant of the       problems in the justice system. He was fair, unbiased, devoid       of prejudices and committed to justice. The comparatively       very few motions for change of judge filed in his court       quietly speaks eloquently of the perceptions of lawyers and       litigants that they were receiving justice from him.    Mr. McCann finished his letter by saying:         I urge you to confirm this nomination. Michael Brennan is       an honorable man of immense integrity, ideally qualified by       fine intellect, even disposition, extensive judicial  [[Page S2575]]       experience, a strong work ethic, sound judgment, good       character and a firm commitment to justice. He will be an       excellent appellate judge.    This strong endorsement is not from a Republican; it is from a  lifelong Democrat who is one of the two longest serving district  attorneys in any major city in America.   Based on this record, based on those endorsements, I am hopeful that  when my Senate colleagues fully study his background and see the same  virtues that garnered such ringing endorsements, their review will  produce a strong bipartisan vote to confirm Michael Brennan to serve as  judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.   Mr. President, that concludes my prepared remarks about what a  quality judge and jurist Judge Brennan would be, but I just have to say  that I am very disappointed at the partisan nature of the cloture vote.  It was unfortunate that it was completely party line for somebody who,  as I have described, has bipartisan support within the Wisconsin legal  community.   The Judiciary Committee majority issued an excellent memorandum dated  November 2, 2017. I would like to discuss and address the primary  objection that led to that unfortunate party-line vote on cloture. I am  really hoping our colleagues on the other side of the aisle will take  this to heart and take the background--the bipartisan support from the  Wisconsin legal community--when they cast their final vote on  confirmation.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record  the Judiciary Committee's November 2, 2017, memorandum.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:       To: Members of the News Media      From: Senate Judiciary Committee Majority      Date: November 2, 2017      Re: History and Context of the Blue Slip Courtesy                                  Highlights         The blue slip process is a courtesy extended by Committee       chairmen, not a binding Senate rule.        Since the blue slip courtesy was created in 1917, only two       chairmen (Sens. James Eastland and Patrick Leahy) had strict       policies requiring two positive blue slips from home-state       senators before the Judiciary Committee would consider a       nomination.        In 25 of the 36 years before Senator Grassley became       Chairman, chairmen have allowed hearings on nominees despite       negative or unreturned blue slips.        The same senators who changed the Senate rules to ignore       the views of 41 senators after evaluating a nominee now want       to enable a single senator to block a nomination before the       Committee can even review the nominee's background and       qualifications.                        History of Blue Slip Courtesy         The blue slip represents an aspect of senatorial courtesy       premised on an understanding that home-state senators are in       a good position to provide insights into a nominee from their       home state. Throughout its 100-year history, Senate Judiciary       Committee chairmen have applied the courtesy differently.       However, a vast majority of chairmen have not required two       positive blue slips as a prerequisite for further       consideration by the Committee.        Only two Chairmen--Senators James Eastland and Patrick       Leahy--strictly required positive blue slips from both home-      state senators before proceeding on a nomination. Senators       Edward Kennedy, Strom Thurmond, Joseph Biden, and Orrin Hatch       adopted policies that were more consistent with pre-Eastland       policies, in which the lack of two positive blue slips did       not necessarily prevent action on a nomination. (Senator       Arlen Specter did not announce a blue slip policy during his       two-year tenure as Chairman.) But Senators Biden and Hatch       also emphasized the need for the White House to have engaged       in consultation with home-state senators before they would       allow a nomination to proceed without two positive blue       slips.    1917-1956--All 11 Chairmen--Committee could consider nominees with a                      negative or unreturned blue slip         The blue slip was instituted during the 65th Congress by       the Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee to obtain the       opinions of senators on the nominees to federal courts       located in their home states. The policy of all 11 chairmen       for the next nearly forty years was that the return of a       negative blue slip did not preclude the Committee's further       consideration of a nominee. For example, in 1917, Senator       Thomas Hardwick of Georgia returned a negative blue slip on a       nominee for the Southern District of Georgia. The Committee       nevertheless reported the nominee negatively to the Senate,       where the nominee was rejected. In 1936, Senator Theodore       Bilbo of Mississippi objected to a Fifth Circuit nominee, but       the Committee nevertheless reported the nominee to the       Senate, where he was confirmed.   1956-1978--Chairman James O. Eastland--Allowed a negative or unreturned                        blue slip to block a nominee         Chairman James O. Eastland changed the Committee's blue       slip policy so that a negative blue slip or the failure to       return a blue slip by one home-state senator was considered       an absolute veto of a nomination.        It is not precisely clear why Chairman Eastland adopted       this policy. But some scholars maintain that its purpose was       to empower federal courts in the South to resist       implementation of Brown v. Board of Education. Villanova Law       Professor Tuan Samahon explains, ``[w]hen segregationist       `Dixiecrat' Senator John Eastland chaired the Judiciary       Committee, he endowed the blue slip with veto power to, among       other things, keep Mississippi's federal judicial bench free       of sympathizers with Brown v. Board of Education.'' Because       the Supreme Court ``largely delegated the task of       implementing Brown to local federal trial judges . . . it       mattered a great deal who sat on federal district courts in       the segregated South.''       1979-1981--Chairman Edward M. Kennedy--Committee could consider              nominees with a negative or unreturned blue slip         The blue slip policy was again revised under Chairman       Edward M. Kennedy. During a Committee hearing in 1979, he       stated:        If the blue slip is not returned within a reasonable time,       rather than letting the nomination die I will place before       the committee a motion to determine whether it wishes to       proceed to a hearing on the nomination notwithstanding the       absence of the blue slip.        Chairman Kennedy did not articulate an express policy with       respect to negative blue slips, but there is at least one       example of the Committee moving on a nominee despite the       return of a negative blue slip. Senator Harry F. Byrd, Jr.       returned a negative blue slip for a Virginia judicial       nominee, but Senator Kennedy nevertheless held a hearing.    1981-1987--Chairman Strom Thurmond--Committee could consider nominees                  with a negative or unreturned blue slip         Chairman Strom Thurmond announced that he would continue       Senator Kennedy's blue slip policy and clarified that he       would assume a blue slip that remained unreturned after seven       days meant there was no objection. Chairman Thurmond       proceeded on several nominees when senators returned negative       blue slips.        In 1981, the Committee held a hearing and moved John Shabaz       to the Senate despite a negative blue slip from Senator       William Proxmire of Wisconsin. Shabaz was confirmed to a       district court seat.        In 1982, the Committee held a hearing and moved John L.       Coffey to the Senate despite a negative blue slip from       Senator Proxmire. Coffey was confirmed to the Seventh       Circuit.        In 1983, the Committee held a hearing and reported the       nomination of John P. Vukasin, Jr. despite California Senator       Alan Cranston returning a negative blue slip. The Senate       ultimately confirmed Vukasin to a district court seat.        In 1985, the Committee held a hearing on the nomination of       Albert I. Moon, Jr. despite both Hawaii senators returning       negative blue slips.     1987-1995--Chairman Joseph R. Biden, Jr.--Committee could consider              nominees with a negative or unreturned blue slip         Chairman Biden articulated his blue slip policy in a letter       to President George H.W. Bush shortly after his inauguration:        The return of a negative blue slip will be a significant       factor to be weighed by the committee in its evaluation of a       judicial nominee, but it will not preclude consideration of       that nominee unless the Administration has not consulted with       both home state Senators prior to submitting the nomination       to the Senate.        Chairman Biden proceeded on the nomination of Bernard       Siegan to the Ninth Circuit despite Senator Cranston's return       of a negative blue slip. The Committee rejected Siegan's       nomination by an 8-6 vote. Likewise, Chairman Biden proceeded       on the nomination of Vaughn R. Walker despite Senator       Cranston's return of a negative blue slip. Although Chairman       Biden said that Cranston's opposition would ``affect Walker       negatively,'' the Committee held a hearing and reported       Walker to the Senate, where he was confirmed.      1995-June 5, 2001--Chairman Orrin Hatch--Committee could consider              nominees with a negative or unreturned blue slip         At the start of his chairmanship in 1995, Senator Hatch       sent a letter to White House Counsel Abner Mikva stating that       he would follow the policy articulated by Chairman Biden in       1989 that did not preclude review of nominees with negative       blue slips unless the Administration did not consult with       home-state senators. In 1997, Chairman Hatch sent another       letter to the White House that reaffirmed this policy and       articulated in more detail what meaningful consultation       should look like.      June 5, 2001-2003--Chairman Patrick Leahy--Allowed a negative or                  unreturned blue slip to block a nominee         Senator Patrick Leahy became Chairman in June of 2001 after       Democrats took control of the chamber. He sent a letter to       White House Counsel Alberto Gonzalez essentially endorsing       Chairman Hatch's 1997 blue slip policy statement. But       Chairman Leahy made statements to the press indicating he       would  [[Page S2576]]       move forward only when he received two positive blue slips       from home-state senators. During the 107th Congress, seven       nominees (five circuit court and two district court nominees)       did not receive hearings because of blue slip issues. In       fact, Chairman Leahy went even further and stopped Committee       action with respect to two Sixth Circuit nominees for seats       in Ohio because the Democratic senators from Michigan       objected.   2003-2005--Chairman Orrin Hatch--Committee could consider nominees with                     a negative or unreturned blue slip         The Republicans again took control of the Senate after the       2002 elections, and Senator Hatch again became Chairman of       the Judiciary Committee. Chairman Hatch reiterated that ``a       single negative blue slip from a nominee's home state won't       be enough to block a confirmation hearing.'' He said he would       give ``great weight to negative blue slips'' but would not       allow senators to hold up ``circuit nominees.''        Chairman Hatch held hearings and votes on five of the six       circuit court nominees who had blue slip issues. For example,       Chairman Hatch held a confirmation hearing for Sixth Circuit       nominee Henry W. Saad despite negative blue slips from       Michigan Senators Levin and Stabenow. The Committee voted to       send Saad to the Senate floor, where the Democrats       successfully filibustered him as well as each of the other       nominees. At the same time, Chairman Hatch did not move on       any district court nominees with blue slip issues.   2005-2007--Chairman Arlen Specter--Unclear whether a specific blue slip                           policy was established         Senator Hatch stepped down as Chairman of the Judiciary       Committee at the beginning of the 109th Congress due to term       limits. Senator Arlen Specter became Chairman. It is not       clear what Chairman Specter's policy was with respect to blue       slips or if he even had a stated policy. At least one       reputable secondary source indicates that, under Chairman       Specter, a ``[n]egative blue slip killed a nomination for       district court judges, but not necessarily for circuit court       judges.''     2007-2015--Chairman Patrick Leahy--Allowed a negative or unreturned                        blue slip to block a nominee         Senator Leahy again became Chairman of the Senate Judiciary       Committee in 2007. He announced that he was reinstituting his       policy that he would proceed on a nominee only when both       home-state senators returned positive blue slips. During the       110th Congress, Chairman Leahy did not proceed on sixteen of       President Bush's nominees (six circuit court and ten district       court nominees) who did not have the support of both home-      state senators.        Chairman Leahy continued this policy throughout his       chairmanship. In 2011, he explained that his blue slip policy       was meant to encourage consultation between the White House       and home-state senators. But he also warned that he expected       senators not to abuse the policy to delay filling vacancies.       When the Republicans were in the minority from 2009-2014,       Republican senators returned blue slips for 25 circuit court       nominees, withheld a blue slip for one nominee (for lack of       consultation), and rescinded positive blue slips for one       nominee after his hearing (this seat was ultimately filled by       another nominee of President Obama). (By contrast, Democratic       senators have withheld blue slips for three circuit court       nominees in the first ten months of the Trump       Administration.) The Republicans' restrained use of the blue       slip to block nominees meant that there was no need for       Chairman Leahy to deviate from his strict blue slip policy.       It is unclear what Chairman Leahy would have done had the       Republicans abused the blue slip process for President       Obama's Judicial nominees under Leahy's chairmanship.                   Blue Slips and the End of the Filibuster         Since 1949, the Senate rules required a supermajority of       the Senate to end debate for lower court nominations. This       longstanding rule was the primary tool for senators in the       minority party opposite the president to block nominees.       Under this rule, senators who intended to oppose a nominee       could return a positive blue slip in Committee and then       filibuster the nominee on the Senate floor. For example,       during the Bush Administration, Senator Feinstein returned a       blue slip for Carolyn Kuhl, who was later reported out of the       Committee. Feinstein and other Democrats then filibustered       Kuhl's nomination on the Senate floor, preventing       confirmation. In instances in which the Committee reported       nominees with negative or unreturned blue slips, those       nominees could still be filibustered by the full Senate. For       example, in 2003-2004, the Democratic caucus, which was in       the minority at the time, filibustered several of George W.       Bush's nominees for federal court seats in Michigan for whom       Senators Levin and Stabenow had returned negative blue slips.       This practice helps explain why few nominees with blue slip       issues have been confirmed by the full Senate.        However, in 2013, Senate Democrats, then in the majority,       unilaterally abolished the rule, ending the ability of a       minority of senators to block confirmation of a lower court       nominee. The Democrats argued that a minority of senators       should not be empowered to block nominees who earned majority       support after the committee has reviewed a nominee's       background and qualifications. One of the leading proponents       of abolishing the filibuster, Senator Jeff Merkley of Oregon,       defended the move by saying.        ``Advice and consent'' was never envisioned as a check that       involved a minority of the Senate being able to block a       presidential [nomination].        A blue slip policy allowing a single senator to block a       nominee from even receiving Committee consideration is a more       extreme example of a counter-majoritarian practice.        By eliminating the filibuster rule, the Democrats removed a       tool for the minority to block nominees with negative or       unreturned blue slips after the committee has evaluated       nominees' qualifications. They are now, because of their own       actions, in the position of having to rely on an ahistorical       interpretation of the blue slip courtesy at the Committee       level to attempt to defeat nominees they oppose on       ideological or political grounds before the full Committee       reviews a nominee.        Mitchel A. Sollenberger, The History of the Blue Slip in       the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, 1917-Present,       Congressional Research Service 8 (Oct. 22, 2003).     Mr. President, rather than read this excellent  memorandum, which I would encourage my colleagues to do, let me give a  brief history, a little summary of what that memorandum states on the  history of the blue slip.   The blue-slip courtesy was created in 1917, so it has basically been  around for 101 years. Only 2 of 18 Judiciary Committee chairmen have  allowed the blue slip to become an absolute veto blocking consideration  and confirmation of judges. Those two chairmen were James Eastland  between 1956 and 1978--so that was for a 22-year period--and then  Senator Patrick Leahy for about 10 years. So of the 101 years that the  blue-slip courtesy has been around, for only 32 of those years has the  blue slip been used as an absolute veto by any Senator.   Looking further at the history--and I think it is relevant to a  confirmation for Wisconsin's seat on the Seventh Circuit--in 1981,  Wisconsin Senator William Proxmire returned a negative blue slip on  Judge John Shabaz, a nominee to be a district judge. The Senate took  that negative blue slip into consideration, but the committee still  held a hearing, and the Senate voted to confirm the judge as a district  judge. The next year, 1982, Senator Proxmire again returned a negative  blue slip on a circuit judge nominee, Judge John Coffey. Once again,  the committee took that blue slip into consideration but still held a  hearing, and the Senate confirmed Judge Coffey later that year.    It is apparent that a blue slip--historically and by precedent for  two-thirds of the 101 years in which the blue slip has been around--has  not been used as an absolute veto by one single Senator but basically  as advice, a particular Senator's view on a judge. I would suggest that  is exactly the way the blue slip should be handled in the future,  particularly in light of Senator Harry Reid, the majority leader in  2013, who employed the nuclear option and changed the Senate forever.  He changed the rules of the Senate as they relate to confirming  nominations with a mere majority. That, in effect, eviscerated the blue  slip's possibility of being used as a veto because then there was no  way a minority could block or actually support and confirm that blue  slip. Harry Reid's precedent of changing the rules of the Senate with  just 51 votes--changing the rules so that only a majority vote would  confirm a judge--has pretty well rendered the blue slip moot from the  standpoint of being able to block a judge.   The blue slip, from my standpoint, should be used primarily as the  advice and consent of one Senator expressing opinion on a judge from  their State. That is just a general description of the history of the  blue slip.   I would like to address specifically the comments made around this  particular circuit court vacancy and my role in it because I think  there has been a lot of distortion. Let me correct the record. It is  true that this circuit court vacancy is the longest in history. It has  dragged on for a variety of reasons, but let me give you the history.   On January 17, 2010, Judge Terence Evans retired from the Seventh  Circuit. President Obama was in office, and Wisconsin had two  Democratic Senators, Senator Kohl and Senator Feingold. Five days  later, on January 22, those two Senators, Kohl and Feingold,  recommended four candidates to President Obama.   On July 14, 2010, President Obama nominated Victoria Nourse for that  [[Page S2577]]  Seventh Circuit slot. Ms. Nourse was not really a member of the  Wisconsin legal community. She was an adjunct professor temporarily in  Wisconsin. There was some tie there, but basically she had no other  ties to Wisconsin. She was actually a former staffer and would become a  future staffer of Vice President Biden.   On November 2, 2010, Wisconsin held an election for the Senate. To  Senator Feingold's surprise, he was retired; I replaced him. There was  no action taken from the date of July 14, when President Obama had  nominated Victoria Nourse. In a Senate with a majority of Democrats and  a Democratic President, there was no action taken prior to Congress  expiring--the 111th Congress. So that nomination expired.   On January 3, 2011, the 112th Congress was sworn in. Within a few  days, I received two blue slips on judicial nominations--one for a  district judge and Victoria Nourse's nomination for the Seventh Circuit  judgeship. I had just been elected. More than a million Wisconsinites  voted for me. I had no role whatsoever in the nomination of this judge.  So I decided not to return the blue slip.   This was during a time period when Chairman Leahy was using the blue  slip as an absolute veto. It was still the precedent in the Senate that  it would require 60 votes to confirm any judge. Any minority member of  the Senate who objected to a judicial nomination would be backed up by  his party, and the nomination could be thwarted.   I continued to work with Senator Kohl, trying to become involved in  the nomination of someone who I felt would be more appropriate for that  seat--someone who actually had a connection to the Wisconsin community.  Unfortunately, Senator Kohl did not have a great deal of interest in  working with me, so the entire 112th Congress passed, and the seat  remained vacant.   Let me remind you that through the entire year of 2010, the Seventh  Circuit seat from Wisconsin was vacant when we had two Democratic  Senators and President Obama. They could have nominated and confirmed  someone any time during 2010. I was given no input into this  nomination. The only thing I could really do was withhold the blue slip  and work with Wisconsin's Democratic Senator to come up with a nominee  who would be a good consensus choice.   Senator Kohl decided not to run for reelection. Senator Tammy Baldwin  was elected in November 2012 and began her term in 2013. Because I felt  it was so important that the judicial nominations be made and that we  have a process to work on a bipartisan basis, I recommended a  commission--a compact with Senator Baldwin, which she agreed to. I  would have three commissioners, and she would have three commissioners  of people tied to the Wisconsin legal community--people dedicated to  filling those judicial vacancies. The beauty of it was that it forced a  consensus pick. We would forward to the President only someone who  would receive support from five out of the six commissioners. It worked  well.   The commission was set up. We nominated and confirmed district court  judges for the Eastern District, Pam Pepper, and the Western District,  James Peterson.   It would be a little more difficult to fill the seat on the Seventh  Circuit. Our commission started working on that. One part of our  compact required that four recommendations for judges be sent to the  President. Because the applicant pool was limited, only two received  the requisite five out of six votes. During the discussion of what we  should do--because we hadn't fulfilled the terms of the compact that  required four judges--I agreed to submit just the two. For whatever  reason, Senator Baldwin decided to forward to President Obama all eight  applicants. She breached the compact. She violated the confidentiality  of the process because part of the problem was that some of those  applicants received zero to one or two votes.   In the end, President Obama nominated Don Schott. He is a fine man. I  have no problem with who Mr. Schott is, but let's be honest, he is  probably not my first pick for a judge on the Seventh Circuit. However,  because the commission had nominated him and agreed on it, I returned  the blue slip.   Unfortunately, because of the politicization of the commission by  Senator Baldwin, the Senate Judiciary did not act on that nomination,  nor did the Senate, and that nomination expired, which brings us to the  114th Congress and Judge Brennan's nomination.   Again, I have spent probably about 10 minutes reading in detail the  strong bipartisan support for Michael Brennan. There is no reason  whatsoever that he should not receive a strong bipartisan vote for  confirmation. I have described what happened specifically. I described  the general precedent of the use of blue slips--not to be used as a  veto but simply to indicate a Senator's opinion of a particular judge  nominated from their State. It should not be used for a veto.   I urge all my Senate colleagues to provide a strong bipartisan vote  of support for a fine man, a fine jurist, and someone who will make a  wonderful judge on the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals.   With that, I yield the floor.
