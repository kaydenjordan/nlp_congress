 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the Article of  Impeachment. The President's responsibility for the violence and  insurrection that occurred last Wednesday cannot go unanswered. The  President has had multiple opportunities to modify his behavior to  bring this country together. Instead, he uses his power to further  divide us. He is unrepentant.   Congress must act for the good of this country.
