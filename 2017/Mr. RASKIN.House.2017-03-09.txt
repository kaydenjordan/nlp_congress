 Mr. Chairman, I yield myself as much time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chairman, we have seen a number of bills this session which are  designed to shut the door on victims of corporate misfeasance and  negligence and to nail the door shut. H.R. 725 is part of this wave of  legislation.   Like most other bills we have seen this session with brazenly  Orwellian titles, the so-called Innocent Party Protection Act of 2017  has nothing to do with protecting innocent parties. Rather, it is just  the latest attempt to tilt the civil justice system dramatically in  favor of big corporate defendants by making it much more difficult for  plaintiffs to pursue State law claims in State courts under the system  of federalism designed by our Founders.   Again, this is a familiar experience because the bill addresses a  completely nonexistent problem. If there had been a real problem, the  Judiciary Committee might have held a hearing in which we could have  invited groups to come forward who support tort victims. They could  have come and testified about why it was so important for the interests  of civil justice for us to pass this legislation.   But there was no hearing at all. We didn't hear any witnesses, much  less the testimony of those groups that represent victims of mass toxic  torts, asbestos poisoning, lead poisoning, sex discrimination  lawsuits--none of it.   In fact, the groups that we would have called, if we were interested  in the testimony of victims and people seeking civil justice, oppose  this legislation overwhelmingly: the Alliance for Justice opposes it;  the Center for Justice and Democracy opposes it; the Consumer  Federation of America opposes it; the National Association of Consumer  Advocates opposes it; the National Consumer Law Center opposes it; the  Natural Resources Defense Council opposes it; Public Citizen opposes  it; the Sierra Club opposes it.   Under current law, a defendant may remove a case, alleging State law  claims, to a Federal court only if there is complete diversity of  citizenship between all plaintiffs and all defendants. If the plaintiff  adds an instate defendant to the case solely for the purpose of  defeating jurisdiction, this constitutes fraudulent joinder today; and  in such circumstances, the case may be removed directly to Federal  court.   In determining whether a joinder was fraudulent, the court considers  only whether there was any basis for a claim against the nondiverse  defendant. The defendant must show that there was no possibility of  recovery or no reasonable basis for adding the nondiverse defendant  to the suit.    This very high standard has guided our Federal courts for more than a  century and it has functioned well, and the bill's proponents offer no  objective evidence to the contrary. And again, we have had no hearing.  For a new Member of Congress like me, who comes from the Maryland State  Senate, I am absolutely astonished and amazed that we would think of  overturning a standard fixture in our civil justice system without so  much as a hearing as to what the problem is.   H.R. 725 would replace a time-honored standard with an ambiguous one  that would dramatically increase the costs and burdens of litigation on  plaintiffs in Federal courts. It would try to strip our State courts of  their basic powers to hear cases relating to their citizens. This is an  assault on federalism.   The measure would require a court to deny a motion remanding to the  State  [[Page H1970]]  courts unless the court finds, one, that it is ``plausible to conclude  that applicable State law would impose liability'' on an instate  defendant; two, that the plaintiff had a ``good faith intention to  prosecute the action against each'' instate defendant or to seek a  joint judgment; and three, that there was no ``actual fraud in the  pleading of jurisdictional facts.''   This gauntlet of hurdles suddenly shifts the burden and creates a  presumption that a Federal court should hear the case, making it far  more expensive and difficult for plaintiffs to have their cases heard  in State court.   H.R. 725 would effectively overturn the local defendant exception,  which prohibits removal to Federal court even if complete diversity of  citizenship exists when the defendant is a citizen of the State where  the suit was filed.   The bill's radical changes to longstanding jurisdictional practice  reveal the authentic purpose behind the measure. It is simply intended  to stifle the ability of plaintiffs to have their choice of forum and,  possibly, even their day in court.   In addition, H.R. 725 would sharply increase the cost of litigation  for plaintiffs and further burden the Federal court system. For  example, the meanings of terms like ``plausible'' and ``good faith  intention'' are ambiguous and will spawn substantial litigation over  their proper interpretation and application, further postponing  decisions and justice.   Additionally, these standards would require a court to engage in a  mini-trial during the early procedural stages of the case without any  opportunity for the full development of evidence. Again, this would  sharply increase the burdens and costs of litigation for ordinary  citizens, for plaintiffs, which appears to be, to my mind, the only  possible contemplated result of this legislation.   Finally, we need to focus on the fact that this bill offered by the  majority raises profound federalism concerns, which I would have hoped  they would be attentive to. Matters of State law should be decided by  State courts, subject to certain exceptions as set forth in the  Constitution.   It was our constitutional design that matters of civil dispute and  conflict go to State courts, State judges, and State juries, all of  them closer to the people themselves, unless you have a Federal  question, a matter of Federal statutory law, a matter of Federal  constitutional law, or you have got diversity jurisdiction.   H.R. 725 bulldozes this key federalism constraint and casts a shadow,  unnecessarily and improperly, over State courts, the courts of the  people. By applying sweeping and vaguely worded new standards to the  determination of when a State case must be remanded to State court, the  bill denies State courts the ability to decide and, ultimately, to  shape the unfolding of State law. This is completely contrary to the  design of the Founders, many of them Virginians, like Thomas Jefferson  and James Madison and George Mason, who wanted the State courts to be  the central arena for the resolution of civil conflicts and tort  disputes.   Simply put, H.R. 725 tramples State sovereignty and our basic  constitutional structure. For these reasons and for the fact that  nobody has demonstrated there is a real problem, I urge the House to  resist this unnecessary and flawed legislation, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I very much appreciate my colleague's remarks there. I want to make  one point before I yield to my distinguished colleague from New York.   Mr. Chairman, my colleague asked us to reckon with the fact that it  is emotionally devastating for people to be sued, and, undoubtedly, it  is in certain cases. But compare whatever it might feel like to be sued  in whatever case he might have in mind with the outrageous emotional  devastation caused by asbestos poisoning, by lead poisoning, by mass  sexual harassment, sex discrimination, race discrimination, all of the  torts that come to dominate what takes place in our courts. So if we  are going to have a new emotional devastation standard, I would put the  plaintiffs up against the large corporate defendants any day.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to my distinguished colleague from  New York (Mr. Nadler).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Johnson).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Johnson).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Johnson).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Johnson).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Johnson).    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, I think that we are actually progressing in our  discussion of the issue because we presently have a law against  fraudulent joinder. They simply want to make it far more difficult for  plaintiffs to get justice in State courts. The law already makes it  impossible to fraudulently join someone.   So in the case offered by the distinguished gentleman from Georgia, I  could very much see an out-of-State corporate behemoth that owns  nursing homes across the country saying that all of this should be in  Federal court because the person who actually committed the sexual  assault instate is judgment-proof because they don't have any money and  that is not really a plausible opportunity to recover, and, therefore,  it should stay in Federal court.   The grand irony here, Mr. Chairman, is that the party which sings  lullabies about federalism and states' rights is in the business of  stripping our State courts and our people of the opportunity to get  into State court. All of this is about forcing everybody into Federal  court. I remember a President who recently said in his inaugural  address that the whole sum and substance of his administration is to  give power back to the States and back to the people, but this  legislation is designed to wreck federalism and to force everybody into  Federal court where the big corporate defendants and the fancy lawyers  have every conceivable advantage over people who are just trying to get  justice when they have been injured in their State.   Mr. Chairman, the substantive issues at stake here are obviously  complex, and I would invite all Americans to try to research what is  going on. But if you don't have the time to actually study the more  than a century in which we have had current fraudulent joinder rules  and you don't have time to go and examine the bill as submitted by the  majority, then just consider the procedure that has gotten us to this  point.   There has been no hearing on this bill, there has been no call for  this bill by anybody who has been injured in a civil tort case, and all  of the groups that try to stand up for citizens against the largest  corporations who are bankrolled by billions of dollars and are trying  to force everybody these days into arbitration and to shut the  courthouse door, all of those groups are opposed to the legislation  because they understand what it is going to do.   It is going to make it far more difficult for people to prosecute  civil  [[Page H1972]]  claims when they have been injured in something like a sexual  harassment case, a sexual violence case, a discrimination case, an  asbestos poisoning case, or a mass toxic tort. It is going to be far  more difficult for people to get justice in their State courts.   Apparently, the interests of the large corporate polluters and  inflictors of injuries--tortfeasors--are so important that we are  willing to trample the basic principles of our constitutional design  which is that these kinds of cases go into State court for State  resolution, we reserve the Federal courts for complicated questions of  Federal law and real cases of diversity jurisdiction, not phony cases  of diversity jurisdiction where they try to eliminate the instate  defendant, but real cases of diversity jurisdiction where nobody else  is involved.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, the Soto amendment is an excellent  amendment and I can't see why anybody would oppose it. I can't see, in  the first instance, why anyone would want to keep the people's cases  out of the people's courts in their own States.   It seems as if there is a move somewhere in this Congress that is so  intent on protecting polluters and the manufacturers of auto defects  that they are willing to trample our basic principles of federalism and  invade the proper province of the courts.   The Soto amendment would exempt from this bill all cases in which the  plaintiff seeks compensation for public health risks like fracking or  any other kind of water contamination. Water contamination is  devastating to our communities regardless of the source, as  demonstrated by the ongoing Flint water crisis in Michigan.   This bill makes it easier for large corporations to remove State law  claims to Federal court, where they think they have got a better chance  of beating the claims of the small guy. The Soto amendment at least  would carve out cases where there are public health risks at stake,  such as those caused by fracking, which has been proven to generate  earthquakes, well contamination, and the poisoning of local water  supplies.     Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.   The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further  proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Florida will  be postponed.                  Amendment No. 2 Offered by Mr. Cartwright    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 2  printed in House Report 115-27.    I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 985, the so-called  Fairness in Class Action Litigation and Furthering Asbestos Claims  Transparency Act of 2017.   I want to thank my distinguished colleague from Texas for his  presentation and for also making clear that the overriding purpose here  is really to give the class action mechanism the guillotine. Now, this  doesn't formally abolish the class action mechanism. It is not the  guillotine, but it is a straitjacket. Let's be very clear, the whole  purpose of this legislation is to make it virtually impossible for  class action lawsuits to be brought by groups of citizens who share a  common injury from things such as consumer rip-offs, pharmaceutical  drug mistakes, faulty product design, sex discrimination, sexual  harassment, poisonous breast implants, asbestos poisoning, lead  poisoning, and so on--all of the billions of dollars worth of tort  actions, nothing fraudulent about them, all of them already determined  by courts and by juries to have taken place against our citizens, and  they want to make it virtually impossible for people to proceed in  court under the class action mechanism.   I began with a very important process observation which I noted  before, Mr. Chairman. There has been no hearing on this legislation.  There have been  [[Page H1976]]  no calls for this legislation from people allegedly suffering the  horrors of the reviled class action lawyers. I notice that while my  thoughtful colleague from Texas uses much of his time to deplore the  work of plaintiffs' lawyers, he says nothing about defendants' lawyers,  who have defended guilty parties in all of the cases we have mentioned  before--all of the mass toxic torts, all of the drug injury cases, all  of the environmental crimes and torts, all the asbestos poisoning and  so on--and they have got a right to do that. They are simply doing  their job. But the plaintiffs' lawyers have a right to do their job,  too. That is how our system works.   I find it fundamentally disturbing that anybody would be out  denouncing lawyers for representing people who have been injured in a  tort case. But I oppose this misguided legislation because it sends  another huge Valentine and wet kiss to large corporate polluters and  tortfeasors but gives the finger to millions of American citizens who  suffer injuries from these defendants.   This legislation would shield corporate wrongdoers by making it far  more difficult for them to get together to obtain justice in a class  action lawsuit. So whether it is by making it almost impossible for  Americans to pursue their day in court through the class action vehicle  or threatening the privacy of asbestos victims, it is clear that H.R.  985 wants to give corporate polluters and tortfeasors the power to play  hide-and-go-seek with their victims in Federal court whenever they want  to.                                time  1600    And it raises the broader question of who rightfully should hold  power in a representative democracy like ours. Should it be large,  private corporations, who are seeking rightfully their own profits? Or  should it be the people, who are supposed to be sovereign?   I say it is the people.   This bill only favors the interests of the already powerful, to the  detriment of the vast majority of the American people.   In cases seeking monetary relief, the bill requires a party seeking  class certification to show that every potential class member suffered  the same type and scope of injury at the certification stage, something  that is virtually impossible to do. This requirement alone would sound  the death knell for class actions, which are the principal means we  have in court for consumers to hold wrongdoers accountable, without  having to engage in multiple duplicative actions all over a State or  all over the country, piling up the expenses for courts.   Most importantly, class actions make it feasible for those who have  smaller but not inconsequential injuries to get justice. These injuries  include diverse matters like products liability, employment  discrimination, sexual harassment, and so on.   It is already very difficult to pursue class actions. Under current  law, the courts strictly limit the grounds by which a large group of  plaintiffs may be certified as a class, including the existing  requirement that their claims raise common and factual legal questions,  and that the class representative's claims must be typical of those of  the other class members.   Finally, title II of H.R. 985 gives asbestos defendants--the very  entities whose products have injured millions of Americans--new weapons  with which to go out and harm their victims. This part of the bill  would require a bankruptcy asbestos trust to report on the court's  public case docket--which is then made immediately available on the  internet--the name and exposure history of each asbestos victim who  gets payment from a trust, as well as the basis of any payment made to  that victim.   As a result, the confidential personal information of asbestos  claimants, including their names and entire exposure histories, would  be irretrievably released into the public domain. Imagine what identity  thieves, reporters, insurers, potential employers, lenders, and data  collectors could do with this sensitive information.   The proper title of this section of H.R. 985 should be the  alternative fact act, not the FACT Act, because it penalizes the  victims while favoring the perpetrators.   The bill requires the trusts to make intrusive disclosures of  victims' personal information, but it makes no comparable demands on  asbestos manufacturers, some of which intentionally concealed the life- threatening dangers of their products not just for months or years, but  for decades, the result of which millions of unsuspecting workers and  consumers were exposed to this toxic substance.   Essentially, this bill re-victimizes asbestos victims by exposing  their private information to all of the world--information that has  absolutely nothing to do with compensation for asbestos exposure.   Accordingly, I must oppose also this highly flawed provision of the  legislation.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, I am afraid that the eloquence of my opponent might  cloud the issue for some of the people in America. So rather than  having us go back and forth disputing the character of the legislation  before you, I urge everybody to go to it. But let's go to some of the  people who care most about protecting innocent Americans from corporate  wrongdoing and injury in the marketplace and in the workplace, and  let's see what they have got to say about it.    Mr. Chairman, I have a letter to the House from groups who oppose  this legislation as an assault on the rights of consumers and workers,  including the Alliance for Justice, the American Association for  Justice, Americans for Financial Reform, the Asbestos Disease Awareness  Organization, the California Kids IAQ, the Center for Justice and  Democracy, the Center for Science in the Public Interest, Central  Florida Jobs with Justice, Coal River Mountain Watch, the Committee to  Support the Antitrust Laws, Consumer Action, Consumer Federation of  America, Consumer Watchdog, Consumers for Auto  [[Page H1977]]  Reliability and Safety, Consumers Union.   I have just gone through the Cs. I am not going to take us all the  way through the Zs, Mr. Chairman. But America's consumer groups are  opposed to this legislation, and America's workers' groups are opposed  to this legislation. It is a wolf in sheep's clothing, Mr. Chairman.   I have also gotten, specifically on the asbestos point, a letter from  groups concerned with occupational health and safety who strongly  oppose the Furthering Asbestos Claim Transparency Act, saying that this  bill will drain critical resources that have been set aside to secure  justice for victims of asbestos diseases, while simultaneously  publishing those victims' personal information on the internet.  Included in this very long list of opponents are the Asbestos Disease  Awareness Organization, the Communications Workers of America, the  Maine Labor Group on Health, the National Council for Occupational  Safety and Health, the New Jersey State Industrial Union Council, and  on and on.   So, again, they pushed this legislation through the House of  Representatives at the speed of light, but under the cloak of darkness  with no hearing at all. And then they come out and say: It is really  for you, trust us. We are the Federal Government. We are here to help  you. We are going to move all of the cases into Federal Court, and we  are going to make it a lot easier to nullify class actions.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr.  Nadler).    Mr. Chairman, I thank Mr. Nadler for his excellent  comments.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.  Johnson).    I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentleman.    I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentleman.    Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Rhode  Island (Mr. Cicilline).    Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Rhode  Island (Mr. Cicilline).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Minnesota (Ms. McCollum).   Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chair, asbestos is a deadly poison. It can cause  lung cancer and mesothelioma. Once detected, these patients survive  only, on average, 8 to 14 months. It was true for Congressman Bruce  Vento, who proudly served the families of Minnesota's Fourth District  for more than 23 years in this House.   Bruce was a friend, and he died from mesothelioma 8\1/2\ months after  he was diagnosed. Congress has a responsibility to find real solutions  to support mesothelioma victims and their families, but H.R. 985 would  not support the families. In fact, it exposes families at a time of  great vulnerableness.   It exposes them by putting their identity, their name, their address,  and the last four digits of their Social Security number on a public  website--a public website--when this information has already been given  in a confidential manner.   It is especially outrageous to me that once again this legislation is  on the floor and it fails to protect children who are victims of  asbestos exposure from having their information shared publicly.  Parents should have the peace of mind knowing that their child's  privacy is secure and not on the internet where who knows who would be  out possibly preying on them.   I ask my colleagues to stand with me, stand with the mesothelioma  victims, stand with their families, stand with their children, and  oppose this bill, as they have asked me to do.    Mr. Chair, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Scott.)    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   We obviously have a different vantage point on what is taking place  in the civil courtrooms of America today. On our side, we look out over  America and in the courts and we see millions of our neighbors, our  fellow citizens who are suffering the effects of asbestos poisoning,  which is real, not imaginary; lead poisoning, which is real, not  imaginary; and manufacturing defects by large automobile manufacturers  and others.   They look at it and all they see is fraud, and they want to put the  class action mechanism in a straightjacket to make it extremely  difficult, if not impossible, for people to pursue class actions. They  want to put the names of asbestos victims up online for the whole world  to see.   Obviously, we have got a division of opinion within the legislative  branch. What about the judiciary itself?   Well, the Judicial Conference of the United States, the policymaking  arm of the Federal judiciary, and the American Bar Association both  strongly oppose H.R. 985. The conference report that has been studying  class actions for 5 years has considered many of the issues addressed  in H.R. 985. It strongly urges Congress not to amend the class action  procedures found in rule 23 outside the Rules Enabling Act process.                                time  1630    Likewise, the ABA observes the many problems of advancing  comprehensive class action reform without a hearing to examine all the  complicated issues involved with so many rule changes.   Mr. Chairman, the other side invoked some hearings. I was astonished  to hear it because I have been here for several months. I just joined  Congress. I didn't have any hearings. It turns out I understand they  were referring to  [[Page H1980]]  hearings that took place last year, perhaps the year before, where I  understand--but all of it is hearsay to me because I wasn't here--that  actual victims of asbestos poisoning were not permitted themselves to  testify. It was a completely one-sided, lopsided process, and I will  try to get to the bottom of that in order to determine it.   This is what happens when they are moving legislation through this  body at lightening speed, but really in the thick of darkness because  we don't have any meaningful, transparent communication about what the  underlying issues are.   Well, I restate my opposition to this. The class action mechanism has  been a central vehicle for justice for Americans for many decades. And  now without so much as a hearing, without the mobilization of any proof  that this should be done over the objections of the Judicial Conference  of the United States, over the objections of the American Bar  Association, and over the objections of every consumer group and worker  group that has written in that I have seen, they are purporting to be  acting in the name of the American people. In fact, what they are doing  is they are pulling the rug out from underneath the class action  vehicle.   Class actions have been so central to vindicating the rights of  people who have been victimized by corporate polluters and toxic  contaminators and automobile manufacturers who knowingly put defective  instruments into cars, leading to people's deaths and injuries, and  they want to make it more difficult for people to pursue justice in the  courts.   I urge all of my colleagues to study this legislation the best they  can and to reject it.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Maryland is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the manager's  amendment to H.R. 985 with all due deference to the chair of our  committee.   Although the amendment makes a number of mostly technical amendments  to the bill, it still fails to address the numerous fundamental flaws  that we have identified in the underlying legislation, which is a  dagger pointing at the heart of class action lawsuits in America.   The major substantive change that I noted under the manager's  amendment was that class certification would still be prohibited when a  named plaintiff or class representative is a relative or employee of  the class counsel, but made some other changes narrowing the scope of  the conflict of interest provision slightly. The amendment still fails  to address the fundamental problem with that provision, which is that  there is no justification for concluding that the specified  relationships are, per se, problematic or that class certification  should be denied just because such a relationship exists.   The general problem pervading the legislation remains. The first is a  procedural problem, which we have identified.   I was delighted that the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Farenthold)  responded to our complaint that we had had no hearings on the bill. In  response to that, he directed my attention to a hearing that took place  in 2011, 6 years ago.   There are nine members of the Judiciary Committee who just joined  this year and many dozens of Members who have joined the House since  2011. It is true that we could go back and read it within the 24 hours  we had to do that before the markup took place. We could also go back  and just read at that point the Constitution of the United States,  which guarantees to everybody a jury trial which attempts to establish  civil justice in America.   What we are getting instead is an attempt to put class action  lawsuits and civil liability into a straitjacket. It is an attempt to  make it far harder for people to see their rights vindicated when they  have been violated by an auto manufacturer, someone who is putting  asbestos into materials that are being used near servicemembers, those  who are selling poisonous breast implants, and so on.   I am rising in opposition to the amendment simply because it does  nothing to answer the many massive objections leveled against this  legislation by consumer groups like the Consumer Federation of America,  by groups defending civil justice, like the Alliance for Justice, and  indeed by the Judicial Conference of the United States and the American  Bar Association, both of which strongly oppose this legislation because  they do not think it is warranted. They don't think that it responds to  any problems that are really out there.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to have this time on behalf  of the minority and the Progressive Caucus. We have a number of very  distinguished Representatives who want to talk about what is going on  with people's health care in America and the attacks leveled against it  this week in Congress.   Before we begin, I yield to my distinguished colleague from New York  (Mr. Jeffries).              honoring christopher ``notorious b.i.g.'' wallace     Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to have this time on behalf  of the minority and the Progressive Caucus. We have a number of very  distinguished Representatives who want to talk about what is going on  with people's health care in America and the attacks leveled against it  this week in Congress.   Before we begin, I yield to my distinguished colleague from New York  (Mr. Jeffries).              honoring christopher ``notorious b.i.g.'' wallace     Thank you very much to the distinguished gentleman from  New York. We are going to go from the Notorious B.I.G.'s music to the  notorious GOP healthcare proposal being considered in Congress this  week.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include extraneous materials in the Record on the subject of this  Special Order.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Maryland?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I am going to yield to my colleague from  Minnesota, Mr. Ellison. It was 7 years ago in March 2010 that President  Obama signed the Affordable Care Act into law extending access to  affordable health insurance coverage to more than 20 million previously  uninsured Americans.   Insurance companies under the new law could no longer deny you  insurance because you had a preexisting condition, and, surely, that  makes sense. The fact that you have a preexisting medical condition  should be the reason that you get health insurance, not the reason you  get denied health insurance.   Also, under the new ACA, young people up to age 26 could stay on  their family plans, which helps families like mine because I have got a  22-year-old, a 20-year-old, and a 25-year-old. And believe me, they  would not have health insurance if not for the Affordable Care Act, and  I think my situation is that of millions of people across the country.   But today, the ACA is in mortal danger. The House GOP finally  unveiled their plan for repealing and replacing the ACA with something  else, which I call the unaffordable care act, that will cost millions  of people their health insurance, increase everybody's premiums, reduce  everybody's coverage, and bring incoherence and chaos into the system.   Mr. Speaker, I am going to yield to Mr. Ellison in just a moment to  talk about what is going on with this legislation. But I do want to say  something about the process by which we arrived here, because back when  the Affordable Care Act was being debated--and I  [[Page H2007]]  wasn't in Congress then, so I approach this just as a historian--there  were multiple complaints from the GOP Members about how fast things  were going, how the legislation was being rammed through.   For example, our now-Speaker Paul Ryan said about the ACA: ``Congress  is moving fast to rush through a healthcare overhaul that lacks a key  ingredient,'' he said, ``the full participation of you, the American  people.''   Greg Walden, the Energy and Commerce chairman from Oregon, said: On a  bill of this significance, you would think we would at least allow  people to come in who are affected by the extraordinary changes in this  bill, and have a chance to let us know how it affects them.   And the Ways and Means Committee chairman today, Kevin Brady, said:  The Democratic Congress and White House simply aren't listening. The  Democrats are ramming it through over the public's objections.   Well, let's go back and look at how long it took the Democrats to get  the Affordable Care Act passed and how much public participation and  debate there really was.   Here in Congress, there were 79 hearings--I repeat, 79 hearings--on  the Affordable Care Act.   There were 181 witnesses, both expert witnesses and members of the  public, citizens coming to testify about the need for expanded health  insurance coverage for the American people because of the high expenses  of health insurance and the rip-offs of various insurance companies.   There were multiple scores that were received from the Congressional  Budget Office during that time, as there was constant attention to the  budgetary and fiscal implications of the Affordable Care Act.   Now, fast-forward to today. We took a year-and-a-half to get to the  Affordable Care Act. How about them? Well, let's see.   The Republicans introduced their bill on Monday. They passed their  bill in the dead of night, at 4:30 in the morning, 3 days later. There  have been no hearings on the bill. There have been no witnesses to  testify on the bill. There have been no expert witnesses. There have  been no witnesses from the public.   There is no analysis from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office  on how much the bill will cost American taxpayers, American citizens,  on their plans or how many Americans will lose their health care at  all.   In other words, the party that complained about how fast the  Affordable Care Act came into being, which was over the course of a  year and a half with dozens of hearings, and dozens and dozens--more  than 100 witnesses and lots of public debate where we went back to our  districts and had townhall meetings, where there was orchestrated  opposition against the plan, but we still stood there and we engaged in  the dialogue, and we stood up for the Affordable Care Act. The people  who said that that was too fast are now ramming through, at  unprecedented, breakneck, lightning speed, a bill that will wreak  devastation on the healthcare rights of the American people.   That is what is taking place. If you have got a contaminated,  clandestine, secret, closed process, it will produce a terrible,  undemocratic, and unhealthy result. That is what we are going to  describe to you tonight.   I am delighted to yield to my colleague from Minnesota (Mr. Ellison.)    Mr. Speaker, I hope the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr.  Ellison) will stick around. I want to salute him and congratulate him  on his new position, not only as a leading Member of the United States  House of Representatives, but now as vice chairman of the Democratic  National Committee.   All of your colleagues are beaming with pride about your  accomplishments and about your national political leadership, and we  are delighted that the rest of the country is going to get to share in  your leadership now in your new aggressive role out organizing  opposition to what is taking place in Washington today.   I want to take a little break from railing about this unaffordable  care act that is going to drive everybody's rates up and throw millions  of people off their health insurance.   I want to say a couple of good things that President Trump said as a  candidate because he attacked ObamaCare, but he said he wanted a system  that covered everybody. He's been quoted many times speaking in favor  of a single-payer plan that would cover every citizen. Now, that talk  has completely dried up. It has vanished and disappeared.   I urge President Trump to go back to his original instinct, which is  that, if you are going to repeal and replace ObamaCare--the Affordable  Care Act, as he keeps saying--let's replace it with the kind of system  they have in Canada, they have in Europe, and just cover everybody.  That would be the direction to go in. But to go backwards to throw  millions of people off their health care is precisely what the American  people don't want.   Now, here is another proposal that President Trump mentioned in  passing when he stood in this Chamber the other night. He said: Let's  repeal the special interest lobbyist provision that was snuck into  Medicare part D, saying that the government could not negotiate for  lower drug prices with the pharmaceutical companies.   Again, that was a very popular talking point for Donald Trump when he  was running for President. He campaigned like Williams Jennings Bryan,  but he is governing like William McKinley; that is, a cabinet filed  with CEOs and billionaires. He did mention that. That was one tiny  crumb, a remnant of the populist campaign he ran.   I urge my Republican colleagues to throw this terrible bill that they  are going to waste everybody's time on, that cannot pass, which their  Freedom Caucus is totally opposed to; and, instead, focus, at least, on  something we can agree on, which is that the 25 or $30 billion that  that special interest provision is costing us should be saved. We  should allow the government to negotiate for lower drug prices in the  Medicare program the way we are allowed to negotiate for lower drug  prices in the Medicaid program and in the VA program.   So we can work together in a bipartisan basis. However, we are not  going to allow anybody to throw millions of Americans off of their  health insurance plan while driving up everybody else's rates and  bringing the whole healthcare system to the brink of ruin.   When I got elected to Congress, I went down to the basement of the  Longworth House Office Building after I was sworn in to sign up for my  health care because we get health care as part of our jobs as Members  of Congress. We pay for it through the local ACA healthcare exchange in  the District of Columbia, but we are guaranteed the right to get that  because of the Affordable Care Act.   When I went down that morning, I was signing up and I was looking  [[Page H2009]]  through the memo about what we would be doing during my first week in  Congress here. Sure enough, I saw that the GOP leadership had put on  there a procedural proposal to set the stage for the dismantling of the  Affordable Care Act.   I looked up to see a line of my new colleagues waiting to come and  sign up for their health care. Some of them I recognized as my  Democratic colleagues, and some of them I recognized as my new  distinguished Republican colleagues. And I said to myself: Wait a  second. Please tell me that we are not going to have new Members of  Congress come in here and sign up for their own health care that they  get as part of their job as Representatives in the United States House  of Representatives and then go upstairs to this floor to vote to strip  millions of people of their health care.   Surely that is not what democratic representation means in the 21st  century; that we get to have health care through our jobs, but we are  going to take away the health care that other people have. But, my  friends, I am sorry to say that is the reality that we are in this  week.   Congressman Ellison is right, we are not taking the position that the  Affordable Care Act is perfect. Far from it. I wasn't in Congress then.  I don't know if the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Ellison) was. I  wasn't in Congress then. But had I been in Congress, I would have been  fighting for a single-payer plan.   I am on legislation this session to support a single-payer plan. In  other words, the Affordable Care Act, for me, doesn't go far enough in  guaranteeing that everybody has health care and in dramatically  reducing the role of the insurance companies so we can spend more money  on health care and less money on red tape and bureaucracy.   So the Affordable Care Act, which I support with all of my heart  right now against all the attacks to dismantle it, was a compromise. It  was a very carefully crafted compromise. Remember, we had more than 100  witnesses come and testify about it. They had zero on their crash-and- burn legislation this week. We had dozens and dozens of hearings where  we had witnesses come and testify about it. They have had zero on their  crash-and-cash legislation--crash the system and give cash to the  insurance companies and the wealthiest people in the country. So we had  an open process, and it was a compromise.   I remember very clearly as a State senator in Maryland watching  President Obama on TV saying, if we are starting from scratch, he would  be in favor of a single-payer plan. He said that would be the logical  way to go. It is what they have in Europe. It is what they have in  Canada and Mexico.   He said we are path dependent. We are on a particular path. We  understand the role that the big insurance companies play, and they  have got a lot of political power, and we have got everybody on the GOP  side screaming and shouting for the insurance companies. So he said  let's figure out a plan where we keep the insurance companies involved.   Guess what? That plan was hatched at The Heritage Foundation, a  conservative think tank in Washington, much beloved and revered by the  GOP Members of this body. It was the exact same plan that Governor Mitt  Romney, their standard bearer running for President a couple of  elections ago, put into place in Massachusetts.   The Affordable Care Act was the compromise. Now everybody is on their  case because they are hiding under their desks, they are running away  from their constituents, and they are canceling their townhalls. Nobody  could get a plan out of them.   Suddenly they pull a plan out of their sleeve in the middle of the  night. They rush it through this body. They voted on it at, I think,  4:30 in the morning after a 27-hour hearing. Everything is meant to be  under the cloak of darkness, and people are making fun of them about  how silly it is.   I sympathize with them because there is nothing they can do because  the Affordable Care Act was the compromise. Now, they wanted to name it  ObamaCare, of course, because they couldn't stand the idea that  President Obama would get the political credit for bringing tens of  millions of Americans health insurance. So they had to name it on him  and then make up all of these stories about how terrible it was.   Guess what? They wake up today. Nobody is calling it ObamaCare  anymore. President Obama is doing his own thing. They are calling it  the Affordable Care Act, and people are defending it all over the  country in 50 States in every congressional district.   You have got indivisible groups that have grown up all over the  place, and my dear colleagues on the Republican side of the aisle are  afraid to face their own constituents. They are canceling their  townhalls, they are hiding under their beds and behind their office  sofas, which, in many cases, are the exact same pieces of furniture  because they sleep in their offices here. They don't want to face the  people and the fact that we do not want to turn the clock back and go  backwards and wreck this system. It is a lot easier to destroy things  than to build things.   So we urge the GOP: If you want to meet to make real substantial  improvements, expansion of the Affordable Care Act to include more  people, to reduce the cost of the bureaucracy, let's do it. But your  plan is a terrible plan. Your plan is one that is going to throw  millions of people off of their health insurance. Your plan is one that  is built around a huge tax break and transfer of wealth upwards in the  country--one of the biggest transfers of wealth in the country ever to  go in the northward direction.   It is an amazing thing that that is how they have designed their  plan.   So it is a huge tax break to the insurance companies and to the  wealthiest people, and millions of others are thrown off of their  insurance plans. Everybody else's premiums are going to be soaring, and  the whole system is likely to come crashing down.   If a foreign government like Russia, for example, were trying to do  this to us, we would consider it an act of aggression, an act of war  against the American people in our health care. But this is, instead,  coming from what used to be one of our great political parties, the  party of that President who talked about government of the people, by  the people, and for the people.   We have, instead, a wrecking ball targeted right at you, the American  people, coming after your health insurance, your health care, your  ability to participate as a citizen in our healthcare system. That is a  remarkable thing to be taking place in 2017.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the thoughtful gentleman from Minnesota (Mr.  Ellison).    I thank the gentleman so much and, again, I salute him  for his incredible work for the people of Minnesota and the people of  America.   Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have left?   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Faso). The gentleman from Maryland has  20 minutes remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I just want to tie up some loose ends by  exploring a few of the points that Mr. Ellison raised. But one of the  very messy features of this legislation that is barreling through  Congress this week is that the GOP leadership understood how popular  the ban on denial of coverage for preexisting conditions is. That is  going to be a mainstay of American life.    People should not be denied health care because they have a  preexisting condition. That is the reason they should get health care,  because they have a preexisting condition and they need it.   So they don't want to get rid of that. They understand that that is  politically toxic. But they don't want to have the mandate for  individuals to have to purchase insurance under the Affordable Care  Act. That has been the major problem they have with the ACA. That is  their major anathema. They can't stand that.   But guess what? You can't have one without the other. And if they  believe in economics and they are being honest, they will have to  concede that. Why?   Well, if I am a healthy young person, as I used to be, I will say to  myself: Wow, an insurance company has got to cover me, even if I have  got a preexisting condition, and I am perfectly healthy now, and I  don't have to buy the insurance. So I am just going to go on my merry  way, la-di-da, until maybe 1 day I have got a problem, I am in an  accident, or I get some kind of diagnosis. At that point, I go to an  insurance company, and they are going to cover me.   So they have kept the preexisting condition provision of ObamaCare,  which is wildly popular in the country now. They are terrified to touch  it now, although they were opposed to it before. But their proposal  gets rid of the individual mandate, and it doesn't work. It will  bankrupt the entire system. It is not going to work.   Now, another thing is that they are ignoring the extraordinary  success of the Affordable Care Act. With whatever flaws it has got, it  has been extraordinarily successful. It has dramatically reduced the  number of uninsured people. It has insured more than 20 million people  who did not have insurance before, and, therefore, it has dramatically  reduced the number of people  [[Page H2011]]  showing up at the hospital in the emergency room with no insurance, and  the hospitals have been obligated to see them.   And who pays for that? Guess who pays for it? You do, I do, the  American public does when people show up without insurance. But the  Affordable Care Act reduced, in a very significant way, the number of  people showing up like that.   Now, in my home State of Maryland, we have seen extraordinary  reductions in the numbers of people showing up in the emergency room  without insurance because of the ACA. We have cut the uninsured rate by  more than one-third in Maryland. We had a rate of 10.6 percent. Now it  is down to 7 percent since the ACA was implemented.   All of the people who run the hospitals and our healthcare system are  terrified that, if the GOP bull in the china shop wrecks the Affordable  Care Act, what is going to happen is we are going to have hundreds of  thousands of more visits every year in emergency rooms by people who  are not covered by insurance, which means that the taxpayers get stuck  with the bill again.   Now, let me tell you about my congressional district, the beautiful  Eighth Congressional District, of which I am very proud. Everybody  loves their district, but I do have the most beautiful, the most  extraordinary district in the country. In Montgomery County, Maryland,  in Frederick County, Maryland, and in Carroll County, it is gorgeous.  Please come out and visit us in Bethesda, in Rockville, throughout  Carroll County, throughout Frederick County. Come to Middletown, go to  Thurmont, check it all out. It is beautiful. Come and visit us.   Look what has happened in the Eighth Congressional District. Well, as  I said, we have reduced the uninsured rate by a third. We have 444,600  people in the district who have health insurance that covers preventive  services today, like cancer screenings and flu shots, without any  copays, without any coinsurance or deductibles, and they now stand to  lose this access if the majority succeeds in eliminating the ACA  provisions requiring health insurers to cover preventive services  without cost-sharing.   We have got more than a half a million people in my district with  employer-sponsored health insurance who are at risk of losing important  consumer protections like the prohibition on annual and lifetime  limits, protection against unfair policy rescissions, and coverage of  preexisting health conditions if the ACA is entirely or partially  repealed.   We have 21,400 people in the district who have purchased high-quality  marketplace coverage, who now stand to lose their coverage if the  marketplaces are dismantled.   We have 16,000 people in the district who got financial assistance to  purchase marketplace coverage in 2016, who are now at risk of coverage  becoming unaffordable, if they have their way and they eliminate the  premium tax credits, and so and so forth.    Everything is dismantling the protections you have, making your  premiums go up, throwing millions of people out of health insurance,  and transferring lots of wealth upwards through the tax breaks that  they want to give to wealthy people and insurance companies.   By the way, as I understand it, there is a provision that they want  to repeal which capped the tax deductibility of insurance company  executive salaries beyond a half a million dollars. They want to repeal  that, so that would continue to be tax deductible. You could pay them  millions of dollars, and they get the tax break because, of course,  that is going to be their first priority, making the wealthiest  executives in the health insurance companies whole.   Who cares what happens to everybody else, whether they lose their  insurance, their premiums go sky-high? They know exactly where their  bread is buttered. And that is just the icing on the cake.   Mr. Speaker, I don't think that their legislation can pass because  the American people are too smart for it and will not stand for it. I  don't think it will pass.   The President is already distancing himself from it. We all started  calling it TrumpCare. The word went out that he didn't want it called  TrumpCare. We think he knows that it is not going to pass, or, if it  does pass, it is going to be a debacle of historic significance and  moment.   None of them want it to be named after them. We have offered  RyanCare, we have offered TrumpCare. None of them want to be associated  with it.   I don't think it is going through. I understand that the Freedom  Caucus, which thinks that there should just be a total free market, is  going to vote against their plan, which they say is worse than  ObamaCare, which they hated from the beginning. Although they are  ideologically opposed to it, they know that ObamaCare is working, and  they know that lots of people are being covered on it. And now they are  going to be throwing millions of people off of ObamaCare, but they  don't get what they want, which is a total free market.   Of course, a free market in health care doesn't work because health  care is not a social domain where the market operates.                                time  2030    If you get sick or if you get injured, then you are just taken to the  hospital. You don't have a lot of time to shop around for the best  hospital or the best doctor. You just need to go in, which is why the  civilized countries of the world that can afford it have gotten to the  point of a single-payer plan. But they want to take us from the  Affordable Care Act backwards. They want it to be a dog-eat-dog medical  care system.   The American people are not going to accept that. They don't have a  majority in Congress to do it, and it is the job of the minority in  Congress which represents a majority of the people. Remember that the  Democratic candidate for President received 1.9 million votes more than  the Republican candidate for President. So it is the job of the  minority which represents the majority of the American people, and it  is the job of the people of the United States to say that we reject  this sloppy, terrible plan that they are trying to rush through  Congress. If they want to have discussions about actually improving  things, we are very happy to do it. Otherwise, this cannot be accepted,  and the American people need to pay very close attention to what is  taking place in Congress this week.   I yield back the remainder of my time, Mr. Speaker.                            ____________________
