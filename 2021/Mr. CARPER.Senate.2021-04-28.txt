 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of S.J.  Res. 14, which we will vote on later today. I want to thank Senator  Heinrich, Senator Markey, and Senator King for their leadership on this  resolution. And I might be mistaken here, but I understand that when  the Presiding Officer was Governor of Colorado, the Presiding Officer  might have set the precedent for the creation of this point of view  that is expressed in the resolution before us. So the Navy salutes  Colorado.   The American people rely on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency  to ensure that our Nation has clean air, clean water, a clean  environment, and a safe climate. Unfortunately, in 2020, under the  previous administration, the EPA strayed from its mission any number of  times.   One of those missteps was that Agency's methane rescission rule,  which deregulated methane emissions from the oil and gas industry--our  Nation's largest industrial source of this dangerous greenhouse gas. By  passing this resolution, Congress, today, will reject and nullify this  dangerous rule and restore clean air and climate protections from our  Nation's largest sources of methane pollution.   Let me explain what methane is and why it is so harmful to our  climate and to our health.   Methane is a super pollutant that damages our lungs and our planet.  Compared to carbon dioxide, methane is a small part of our overall  greenhouse gas emissions. Having said that, though, scientists tell us  that methane is responsible for roughly--get this--one-quarter of the  manmade global warming that we are witnessing today. Let me say that  again: Methane is responsible for roughly one-quarter of the manmade  global warming that we are experiencing and witnessing today.   Over a 20-year period, methane is 84 times more harmful to our  climate than carbon dioxide--84 times. For a small molecule, methane  punches above its weight when it comes to its contributions to climate  change.   The oil and gas industry is our Nation's largest source of methane,  responsible for nearly 30 percent of total methane emissions. For  comparison, this amount of methane pollution has the same climate  effect as the emissions from our Nation's entire fleet of passenger  vehicles in a year.   In addition to damaging our climate, methane emissions also  contribute to ground-level ozone, known as smog. Breathing in smog  harms our lungs, and it aggravates lung diseases like bronchitis and  asthma. Exposure to smog has been linked to premature death, and  children and the elderly are particularly vulnerable to these health  risks. If we want to meaningfully tackle the danger to our health and  our climate, we need to reduce methane emissions from the entire oil  and gas sector.   In 2016, as I was alluding to earlier, the EPA acted to do just that.  Building on State actions, such as in Colorado, whose former chief  executive is presiding at this moment, the EPA put into place  commonsense Clean Air Act regulations that required the oil and gas  industry to update its equipment. The rule also required the industry  to inspect frequently in order to find and repair leaks and  malfunctions that are such a big source of our methane problem.   Based on feedback from the oil and gas industry meeting, these new  emission requirements did not place an undue burden on companies or  raise costs for consumers. In fact, many oil and gas companies and  industry groups supported the measures, and they still do. That is why  it was so surprising when, in September of 2020, the EPA issued the  final methane rescission rule to roll back what so many believed to be  commonsense approaches for reducing methane risks.   While the Trump administration moved forward with this damaging  policy, the consequences of climate change were roiling--roiling--our  Nation. California, for example, experienced its worst wildfire season  on record, with historic forest fires covering an area about the size  of the State of Rhode Island. Other Western States--including Oregon,  Montana, and Colorado--were ablaze with unprecedented damaging  wildfires.   At the same time, other parts of our country were being battered by  violent, extreme weather. The people of Iowa experienced one of the  most costly thunderstorms in history, with hurricane force winds,  causing $7.5 billion in economic damage. It flattened, I am told, over  half of that State's corn and soybean crops in one day.   Coastal towns in Southern States like Florida, like Louisiana, and  like South Carolina were battered by hurricane after hurricane after  hurricane. In the summer of 2020, last summer, we saw the most  hurricanes in the Atlantic Ocean in recorded history.   Despite all of this, the Trump administration took a step to undo one  of the key tools available to us to combat methane emissions that  contribute greatly to climate change. The methane rescission rule was a  stark departure from the widely accepted, science-based, and  commonsense view that we should protect people and our planet from the  dangers of methane.   In promulgating the methane rescission rule, the Trump administration  ignored the global scientific community, including EPA's own Agency  scientists, who warned that the extreme weather events of 2020 were  just the tip of the iceberg of consequences we can expect if we don't  keep global warming below an increase of 1.5 degrees Celsius between  now and 2040.   The bottom line is that the Trump methane rescission rule would allow  more methane pollution, increase public health dangers, and bring us  ever closer to the brink of irreversible climate catastrophe. It is  this Trump EPA action that my colleagues and I reject today through the  resolution before us.   The methane rescission rule stated that methane couldn't be regulated  under the Clean Air Act. We reject that. The methane rescission rule  stated that EPA couldn't regulate the entire oil and gas sector from  wellhead to storage. We reject that. The methane rescission rule stated  that greenhouse gasses couldn't be regulated. We reject that. The  methane rescission rule also reversed EPA's longstanding position on  what is required to regulate a pollutant, making it harder for EPA to  implement clean air and climate protections. We reject that as well.    With approval of this resolution, though, EPA can and should still  move forward to strengthen methane standards for the oil and gas sector  in the future. This effort is also very timely, coming on the heels of  President  [[Page S2270]]  Biden's climate commitment for our Nation to reduce emissions by 50  percent from 2005 levels by the end of this decade--by 2030.   Passing this resolution will be good for our health. Passing this  resolution will be good for our planet. And passing this resolution  will be good for America's economy. That is why so many States, so many  environmental groups, and even a number of significant oil and gas  companies support this resolution.   Joining over 60 environmental groups, as well as 20 State attorneys  general, seven major oil and gas companies support today's resolution  to reinstate requirements to control methane emissions. From the  Environmental Defense Fund to Shell, from the League of Conservation  Voters to BP, from the Natural Resources Defense Council to Equinor,  there is a broad consensus among stakeholders with different  interests--different interests--that Congress should reject and nullify  the methane rescission rule.   So why do a number of oil and gas companies want Congress to reject  the Trump rule, restore existing regulations, and pursue further  regulations? They know the best way to boost growth in their sector and  across the economy is to keep methane and other climate pollution in  check. With unchecked methane releases in its operations, natural gas  production and use become part of the climate problem, not a part of  the solution as we endeavor to drive toward lower carbon fuels.   Companies know where the global market is heading. They know  regulations will support innovation and technology deployment in their  industry, bringing down emission reduction costs for everyone.   I sometimes like to quote Albert Einstein, who said, among other  things: ``In adversity lies opportunity.'' Think about that: ``In  adversity lies opportunity.'' We can see that in the issue of methane  pollution and in climate change. It presents plenty of challenges. Yes,  that is true. But it also presents a remarkable opportunity. It is an  opportunity for us to protect our planet, improve the air that we  breathe, and strengthen our economy.   At the same time, the product that the oil and gas industry is  capturing can be sold to fuel more homes and businesses across the  country. I want to say that again, too. At the same time, the product  that the oil and gas industry is capturing can be sold to fuel more  homes and businesses across the country. That is why today I will  gladly vote for this resolution, which reaffirms that the Clean Air Act  requires EPA to take action to protect Americans from dangerous  pollution like methane.   In passing this resolution today, Congress is rejecting the Trump  rule's baseless interpretation of the Clean Air Act and, in its place,  reinstating commonsense methane public health and climate protections  across the entire oil and gas sector. We are also clearing a path for  additional protections from methane and other hazardous climate  pollutants.   As a Senate, we are making our intent clear: The Clean Air Act gives  EPA the authority and the mandate to establish methane emissions  standards, even stronger than the ones we reinstate with this  resolution. This includes all facets of the oil and gas industry now  and moving forward, from production to processing and from transmission  to storage.   We are saying to EPA loud and clear: It is your mission to protect  the environment, to protect human health and public welfare from the  dangers of climate pollutants like methane. And there is a lot of work  still to do before that mission can be achieved. It is time that we get  to that work. We don't have a lot of time to waste.    I have a couple of unanimous consent requests I would like to offer.  One is to place supportive materials into the Record. I ask unanimous  consent to enter into the Record several of my materials in support of  S.J. Res. 14 that is before us today; first, the Biden administration's  Statement of Administration Policy supporting passage of the  resolution; second, two letters of support for passing this joint  resolution--one from the 57 leading environmental and advocacy groups  and another, the Shell Oil Company.   These letters demonstrate the breadth of support for regulating this  harmful pollutant and rejecting the methane rescission rule.   I ask unanimous consent for these to be inserted into the Record as  appropriate   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                     Statement of Administration Policy        S.J. Res. 14--A joint resolution providing for congressional  disapproval under chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, of the rule  submitted by the Environmental Protection Agency relating to ``Oil and    Natural Gas Sector: Emission Standards for New, Reconstructed, and                         Modified Sources Review''                  (Sen. Heinrich, D-NM, and 23 cosponsors)         The Administration supports passage of S.J. Res. 14, a       joint resolution providing for congressional disapproval of       the rule ``Oil and Natural Gas Sector: Emission Standards for       New, Reconstructed, and Modified Sources Review,'' published       at 85 Fed. Reg. 57018 (September 14, 2020). This action would       ensure that this rule, which eliminated pollution standards       for methane emissions from the oil and gas sector and       eliminated all emission standards for the transmission and       storage segments of that sector, will have no force or effect       and reinstate the pollution reduction requirements       established under the Clean Air Act in 2012 and 2016.        Addressing methane leaks through detection and repair by       using already cost-effective technologies can spur the       creation of good-paying jobs fixing leaking equipment and       pipelines--all while minimizing waste and reducing this       powerful source of pollution. Today, the oil and gas sector       is the largest industrial source of methane emissions--a       potent climate-disrupting greenhouse gas that is responsible       for approximately one-third of the global warming and the       resulting climate disruption we are already experiencing from       climate change. In order to effectively mitigate climate       change, addressing methane pollution from this and other       sectors is an urgent and essential step.        Every American has a fundamental right to breathe clean air       and drink clean water. These methane emissions--leaking       during oil and gas production, transmission, and distribution       activities--also contribute to the formation of smog, or       ground-level ozone, which is harmful to both human health and       agriculture. Oil and gas production is also a significant       emitter of carcinogenic and smog-forming volatile organic       compounds into frontline communities. These communities, as       well as children, the elderly, outdoor workers, and       individuals with respiratory conditions, are at higher risk       of experiencing harmful health outcomes due to exposure to       such pollution. Oil and gas pollution can also be carried by       the wind and intensify air pollution problems in communities       along that path, including across state boundaries.        The Clean Air Act authorizes the Environmental Protection       Agency (EPA) to protect Americans from dangerous air       pollution, including methane and volatile organic compounds.       Nonetheless, the rule that this resolution disapproves of       took four harmful actions that increased the amount of       harmful pollution to which Americans are exposed: (1) the       elimination of pollution standards for methane emissions from       the oil and gas sector; (2) the elimination of all air       pollution standards for the transmission and storage segments       of the oil and gas sector; (3) removal of the predicate that       establishes EPA's obligation to address the extensive methane       pollution emitted by existing sources; and (4) establishment       of a new, non-statutory requirement that EPA make an       additional, pollutant-specific finding of significant       contribution to endangerment before addressing harmful air       pollution from a sector already regulated under the Clean Air       Act. All four of these actions would be reversed by the       passage and signature of the resolution.        S.J. Res. 14 will restore robust Clean Air Act pollution       standards for this sector, protecting American communities.       The resolution will also clear the pathway for EPA to       evaluate opportunities to promulgate even stronger standards       under section 111 of the Clean Air Act to address dangerous       methane and other pollution from both new and existing       sources across the oil and gas sector. The Administration       looks forward to working with the Congress to restore these       critically important pollution standards.                                   ____                                                     April 26, 2021.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      Minority Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Charles Schumer,      Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington. DC.      Hon. Mitch McConnell,      Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Pelosi, Majority Leader Schumer, Minority       Leader McCarthy, and Minority Leader McConnell: On behalf of       our collective millions of members and supporters, we write       to express our full support of Senate Joint Resolution (S.J.       Res.) 14 and House Joint Resolution (H.J. Res. 34), providing       for congressional disapproval of recent executive action to       roll back the 2016 methane and volatile organic compound  [[Page S2271]]       standards. We urge Congress to swiftly vote to pass this       resolution, an action which would allow the Environmental       Protection Agency (EPA) to accelerate strengthening       safeguards against methane and other pollution.        As you know, methane is a potent pollutant that is       responsible for around 25 percent of the impacts of climate       change we are experiencing today. In 2016, the Environmental       Protection Agency (EPA) established regulations to tackle       methane and other dangerous emissions from new and modified       sources within the oil and gas sector, which is the largest       industrial source of methane pollution. This action took       concrete steps to implement science-based standards to combat       previously unchecked emissions. The oil and gas sector is       likewise a significant source of smog-forming volatile       organic compounds and hazardous air pollutants in communities       across the nation.        In the waning days of the previous administration, EPA       finalized a rule that eliminated safeguards that protect our       climate and communities from oil and gas pollution and       attempted to erect barriers to the promulgation of future       standards. Many oil and gas operators, natural gas users like       utilities, states, and environmental and health groups       support federal standards to regulate methane emissions. Many       environmental and health groups, state and local governments,       utilities and other gas purchasers, oil and gas operators,       and even the American Petroleum Institute (API), have       expressed support for federal rules to curb the oil and gas       industry's wasteful methane releases--wasted gas worth $2.4       billion, which could be used to heat approximately 12.5       million homes in a year. Adopting S.J. Res. 14 and H.J. Res.       34 will reinstate pollution protections and clear the path       for EPA to move forward with widely-supported, sensible       safeguards for methane and other pollution from oil and gas       production.        We must take early action to reduce harmful methane       emissions as a necessary step to combating the climate       crisis. Regulation of dangerous methane emissions is critical       to lowering the magnitude of warming we will experience       around 2050. We need leaders who will fight for a healthier       future and seek ambitious next-generation standards for new       and existing oil and gas facilities. S.J. Res. 14 provides       the EPA with a clean slate to get back to a regulatory       process that makes scientific sense and gets our goal of       ambitious methane emissions reductions back on track, while       advancing our collective climate and environmental justice       goals.

Hon. Tom Carper,      Chairman, Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works,           Washington, DC.      Hon. Shelley Moore Capito,      Ranking Member, Senate Committee on Environment and Public           Works, Washington, DC.      Hon. Frank Pallone,      Chairman, House Committee on Energy and Commerce, Washington,           DC.      Hon. Cathy McMorris Rodgers,      Ranking Member, House Committee on Energy and Commerce,           Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Carper, Ranking Member Capito, Chairman       Pallone, and Ranking Member Rodgers: Shell supports passage       of a proposed joint resolution of disapproval under the       Congressional Review Act (CRA) to rescind the 2020 rule ``Oil       and Natural Gas Sector: Emission Standards for New,       Reconstructed and Modified Sources Review'' and reinstate the       direct regulation of methane emissions from new and modified       sources established by the Environmental Protection Agency in       2016.        Beginning in 2015, Shell worked with EPA and industry peers       to develop a workable approach to regulating methane from       onshore oil and gas sources. Shell was the first oil major to       signal support for the rule. Beginning in 2017, Shell urged       the Trump Administration to make desired refinements to the       regulation, but to maintain the direct regulation of methane       from onshore sources established by the previous       Administration.        The efficient regulation of methane from onshore oil and       gas production makes good business sense, as methane captured       is methane sold, advances the energy transition and expands       the role of natural gas as a transition fuel. The 2016 rule       sparked innovation, contributing to the development of more       efficient and affordable pneumatics, better cameras and new       airborne imagery, tools that help us better understand and       control methane leaks from our assets.        I have appreciated the leadership of those in Congress       working to advance this joint resolution. I have attached an       oped in support of the resolution published last week in the       Houston Chronicle.            Sincerely,                                                  Gretchen Watkins,                                                         President.     Now, Mr. President, I will yield the floor, but before I  do, I want to salute you for your role in an earlier day, in an earlier  place, your State of Colorado, for helping get this started. We are in  your debt. Good work. God bless.   With that, I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate be  in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak  therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate resumes consideration of S. 914 on Thursday, April 29, the  following amendments be reported by number and that they be the only  amendments in order to S. 914: Rubio-Scott amendment No. 1471, as  modified; Shaheen amendment No. 1461; Kennedy amendment No. 1469; and  Lee amendment No. 1472.   Further, that at 11:30 a.m. on Thursday, April 29, the Senate vote in  relation to the amendments in the order listed, with 60 affirmative  votes required for adoption of the Lee amendment and passage of the  bill; further, that upon disposition of the amendments, amendment No.  1460, as amended, if amended, be agreed to; the bill be considered read  a third time, and at 1:45 p.m., the Senate vote on the passage of the  bill, as amended, with 2 minutes for debate equally divided prior to  each vote; and finally, the motions to reconsider be considered made  and laid upon the table, all with no intervening action or debate.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 186, submitted earlier today.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  resolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and that the  motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table, with  no intervening action or debate.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to consideration of S. Res. 187, submitted earlier today.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  resolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and that the  motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table, with  no intervening action or debate.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  recess until 8:25 p.m. today, and upon reconvening, proceed as a body  to the Hall of the House of Representatives for the joint session of  Congress provided under the provisions of H. Con. Res. 30; and that  upon the dissolution of the joint session, the Senate adjourn until 10  a.m. on Thursday, April 29, 2021; that following the prayer and pledge,  the morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be  approved to date, and the time for the two leaders be reserved for  their use later in the day, and morning business be closed; and that  upon the conclusion of morning business, the Senate resume  consideration of Calendar No. 34, S. 914, Drinking Water and Wastewater  Infrastructure Act of 2021, as provided under the previous order.    We will gather in the Senate Chamber at 8:15 p.m. this  evening to proceed as a body to the House of Representatives for  President Joe Biden's address.   Joe Biden is the first Delawarian ever elected President of the  United States.   If there is no further business to come before the Senate, I ask that  it recess under the previous order.                            ____________________
