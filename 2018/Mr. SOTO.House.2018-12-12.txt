 Mr. Speaker, it has been a long road, but it looks like we  are bringing it in for a landing, and America is thankful for a farm  bill that we can all be proud of. That includes central Florida.   We saw huge issues included to help out our orange growers in central  Florida facing citrus greening, which is really hurting our local  growers and hurting that iconic orange juice coming from Florida.   We saw the inclusion of the National Animal Health Vaccine Bank,  which helps out ranchers both in central Florida and throughout the  United States.   We saw a SNAP program that will continue to help out needy families.   We saw prioritizing conservation, which is a win for both farmers and  conservationists alike in an ever more crowded Florida.   We also saw four bills that we crafted and put forward included, and  I thank the gentleman from Texas and the gentleman from Minnesota for  their help with that.   The veterans with disabilities language that provides technical  training, that was something that I got an idea of when I was out in  Midland speaking to one of the gentleman from Texas' constituents.   The bill that allowed for authorization of agricultural research  between the United States and Israel is a program that needed a long  time to be authorized, and we are excited to have it.   Algae-based research to look at biofuels is helpful.   And just to conclude, we are also developing high-tech sensors in  central Florida for agriculture.   I thank all of the people on the committee for their good work.  [[Page H10148]]
