 Mr. President, the Food and Drug Administration plays an  important part in our families' everyday lives. When people across the  country do anything from using a medical device, to getting a  prescription filled, to sitting down together to eat, they rely on the  FDA to keep them safe and healthy.   There is a lot at stake for our families, and it is critical that we  know the FDA's leadership will uphold its gold standard of safety and  effectiveness and put people's health and well-being first. I am not  convinced that is the case under Hahn's leadership.   I have reviewed his records and carefully considered his answers on  key issues. I want the Senate to know I was particularly concerned by  his evasive response when it came to how to address skyrocketing youth  e-cigarette use. Just a few months ago, the Trump administration  promised it would take action and pull non-tobacco-flavored e-cigarette  products from the market until after the FDA had reviewed them, only to  reverse its course.   We need a leader at the FDA who will fight for our families and stand  up to this administration on this important policy. When Members from  both sides of the aisle asked him about this, he refused to commit to  follow through on the promising step President Trump decided to  abandon. So given his answers--or lack thereof, really--on this  concerning issue, I am voting no on this confirmation.
