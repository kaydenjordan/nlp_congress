 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 91 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                 H. Res. 91         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to consider in the House the joint resolution (H.J.       Res. 44) disapproving the rule submitted by the Department of       the Interior relating to Bureau of Land Management       regulations that establish the procedures used to prepare,       revise, or amend land use plans pursuant to the Federal Land       Policy and Management Act of 1976. All points of order       against consideration of the joint resolution are waived. The       joint resolution shall be considered as read. All points of       order against provisions in the joint resolution are waived.       The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the       joint resolution and on any amendment thereto to final       passage without intervening motion except: (1) one hour of       debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and       ranking minority member of the Committee on Natural       Resources; and (2) one motion to recommit.        Sec. 2.  Upon adoption of this resolution it shall be in       order to consider in the House any joint resolution specified       in section 3 of this resolution. All points of order against       consideration of each such joint resolution are waived. Each       such joint resolution shall be considered as read. All points       of order against provisions in each such joint resolution are       waived. The previous question shall be considered as ordered       on each such joint resolution and on any amendment thereto to       final passage without intervening motion except: (1) one hour       of debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and       ranking minority member of the Committee on Education and the       Workforce; and (2) one motion to recommit.        Sec. 3.  The joint resolutions referred to in section 2 of       this resolution are as follows:         (a) The joint resolution (H.J. Res. 57) providing for       congressional disapproval under chapter 8 of title 5, United       States Code, of the rule submitted by the Department of       Education relating to accountability and State plans under       the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965.        (b) The joint resolution (H.J. Res. 58) providing for       congressional disapproval under chapter 8 of title 5, United       States Code, of the rule submitted by the Department of       Education relating to teacher preparation issues.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Polis),  pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During  consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose  of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 91 provides for  consideration of three separate joint resolutions intended to address  government overreach by using the Congressional Review Act process. The  first measure deals with the Bureau of Land Management's Planning 2.0  rule. This rule represents a remarkable overreach that encroaches on  State and local authority.   By law, BLM is required to coordinate with local governments, but  this rule would disrupt that longstanding principle. Under the Planning  2.0 rule, faceless bureaucrats in Washington would be tasked with  micromanaging much of our Nation's land and resources. The rule also  disregards the Department of the Interior's multiple-use mission. If  left intact, the rule will harm grazing, timber, energy, mineral  development, and recreation on our public lands.   This is government overreach at its worst. The Federal Government  should not be telling communities and States what works best for them.  Decisions should be made on the local level, with site-specific  considerations, not landscape-level analyses as called for in this  rule.   For 4 years, I had the privilege of serving on the Planning  Commission for the city of Mobile. Land use planning is and has  historically been, in the United States, a local function.   Imagine a Washington bureaucrat trying to tell planning commissions  in municipalities or counties anywhere in the United States how they  are going to manage land down to the landscaping level. That is not the  role of the Federal Government. That is not what our Founding Fathers  had in mind when they created this government. Yet this regulation  would take us somewhere we have never been before.   Making matters worse, this regulation was pushed through in the  waning days of the Obama administration, making it one the many  midnight regulations jammed through at the last minute.                                time  1230    This Congressional Review Act measure is supported by over 60  organizations, ranging from the American Farm Bureau Federation to the  National Association of Counties, to the National Mining Association.  There is broad support for revisiting this misguided rule.   This rule also provides for consideration of Congressional Review Act  measures for two rules from the Department of Education. Now,  typically, in America, we think of education as a local and State  endeavor. The Federal Government provides 15 percent, on average, of  the funding for local school systems. Yet, we know that the Federal  Government comprises over 50 percent of the requirements for red tape  and paperwork. That imbalance harms our ability to deliver education at  the local level where it matters the most.   As a member of the House Education and the Workforce Committee, I  have been a consistent advocate for ensuring control over education is  largely left in the hands of local school boards, teachers, parents,  and administrators who know their students best.   I was very pleased to see Congress pass the Every Student Succeeds  Act in 2015, which replaced No Child Left Behind and fundamentally  changed our Nation's K-12 education policies. Even better, this was a  bipartisan effort that brought Members from both sides of the aisle  together; and, yes, it was signed by President Obama.   The Wall Street Journal called the Every Student Succeeds Act ``the  largest devolution of Federal control to the states in a quarter- century.''   A major goal of our reform bill was to empower States to create their  own accountability systems. This is something else that has been  consistent throughout American history. We have looked to the States to  put in these accountability systems. I served on the Alabama State  Board of Education. This is much of what we did.   While there are broad-guiding principles outlined in the law, the  intent of Congress was for there to be very little Federal involvement  in the accountability process. Despite clear efforts in the Every  Student Succeeds Act to limit the influence of the Federal Secretary of  Education, the rule proposed by the Department of Education dealing  with accountability gave far too much control to the Secretary, which  ultimately harms our students.   Most concerning, the rule will restrict the flexibility that was at  the core of the philosophy behind the Every Student Succeeds Act.   We heard from local administrators, local school board members, State  superintendents of education, State school board members from all over  the country, from all types of States and all types of communities.  They wanted to have more flexibility. They wanted to have their own  control over their accountability programs.   When the rule was first proposed, leaders in the House and Senate  sent a very clear and thorough explanation of their concerns to the  Department of Education. In fact, I even expressed my concerns about  the proposed rule's contradiction of the statute directly to the  [[Page H1024]]  then-Secretary of Education. Unfortunately, most of the concerns of  Congress went unaddressed. The final rule gives far too much authority  to the Federal Department of Education and stands in direct contrast to  law passed by Congress.   As States work on their accountability plans, it is important that  they have certainty that the Federal Government will not continue to  exert undue power and influence over the process. Through this  Congressional Review Act challenge, we can ensure control is at the  State and local level and prevent unnecessary Federal overreach into  our classrooms.   Finally, this rule provides for a Congressional Review Act resolution  overturning the Obama administration's teacher preparation regulation.  This is yet another rule that would exert far too much Federal  authority over an area that has been traditionally reserved for the  States. Teacher preparation is critically important to the success of  our Nation's education system, but it is a process that has been  successfully controlled and implemented at the State level with some  grant assistance from the Federal Government.   What might work to prepare a teacher in one State is totally  different from what might work in another State. This rule makes no  acknowledgment of that fact. This regulation sets up a one-size-fits- all Federal system, which is not what Congress intended.   As a former member of the Alabama State Board of Education, I can  attest that we have highly qualified people who worked very hard every  day to make sure we have skilled teachers in our schools who are  adequately prepared. These school board members do not need the Federal  Government to intervene and place additional burdens and requirements  on them. The challenges are serious enough as it is.   Sadly, this regulation is just another attempt to allow bureaucrats  in Washington to micromanage our States and local school districts.  Groups like the American Council on Education and The School  Superintendents Association expressed their concerns with the Federal  overreach created by this rule. This resolution would block this  unnecessary Federal involvement and keep control in the hands of the  States, where it belongs.   Each of the three bills covered by this rule focus on taking power  away from bureaucrats in Washington and, instead, empowering States and  local communities. Heavy-handed policies from Washington have failed  time and time again. It is critical that we use our power to overturn  these overreaching regulations. It is clearly what the American people  elected to us do.   Many on the other side of the aisle claim that, while they disagree  with portions of these rules, Congress should not use the CRA process  because it blocks the agencies from reissuing a rule in ``substantially  the same form.'' However, this argument ignores the fact that the  statute clearly states an agency may enact a similar rule if it is  subsequently authorized by law. Thus, the CRA gives Congress the  ability to rein in an out-of-control agency until we, the legislative  branch, can give it further instruction.   Members on both sides of the aisle should welcome the chance to use  this tool to make sure our legislative intent is actually followed by  those implementing the law.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support House Resolution 91 and  the underlying bills.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to respond just briefly to a couple of  points that my colleague from Colorado made, and I want to compliment  him and his service on our committee. He is a tremendous member, and we  appreciate his leadership.   We had a little bit of a constitutional law lesson there. The truth  of the matter is, the Department of Education only exists because of an  act of Congress. The only powers it has are the powers that we give  them through the authorizing legislation. What we authorize, we can  unauthorize.   The Every Student Succeeds Act took back a number of things we had  authorized under No Child Left Behind. This is no violation of the  separation of powers under the Congressional Review Act when we look at  a rule-making authority that we have given to a Federal agency and see  that they have done it in a way that is contrary to congressional  intent and we take it back. We have the authority to do that, and we  should take it back when we see overreach like this.   He also brought up how this might tie the hands of our new Secretary  of Education, and I will take this point in time to congratulate her on  her confirmation. What this will require her to do is to work with the  Congress to make sure that we are on the same page.   I remember very clearly when the former Secretary of Education came  before our committee. I, and many others, pleaded with him not to put  out this rule because we told him this is not in keeping with the  intent of Congress and with the words of Congress in the statute. He  went forward anyway.   I believe Secretary DeVos is going to work with Congress to make  sure, as the Department of Education, under her management begins to  implement this law, it is done so in keeping with the letter and the  spirit of the law.   I hope that that is what we will do between the legislative branch  and the executive branch and every department of government, but, in  the last 8 years, we didn't see very much of that. We basically had the  executive branch of government force feeding things to us.   I think it is high time that we take action, whatever party we are  in, to exercise our Article I powers to make sure we maintain control  over the things we created through our authorizing statutes.   So I don't foresee the problems with the incoming Secretary of  Education that my good friend from Colorado does.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Babin).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the passionate remarks of the gentleman  from New York. The Holocaust is something that all of us should learn  more about and take seriously.   There are people today who would seek to destroy the Nation of  Israel. The leadership of Iran has said that over and over again, yet  the previous administration reached an egregious deal with them that  puts the Nation of Israel at risk.   So I take no back seat to anybody in standing up for the Jewish  people, as I and many other people in this body have done, but we are  here today to talk about two education bills and a third bill dealing  with the Bureau of Land Management. I would like to redirect our debate  to those subjects.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, the gentleman talks about regular order. This particular  regulation from the Bureau of Land Management was enacted very quickly  and hurriedly without input from State and county governments. So,  essentially, this was a hurried-through rule that didn't have the  regular order input that it should have had, yet another reason why it  should be reversed through this Congressional Review Act.   But it is also the case that this doesn't mean the BLM doesn't have  any authority here. They can go back to their old regulation, which was  already in place, and they can come up with a new rule so long as it is  not a substantially similar rule, or they can come to us and seek  specific authorization. The truth of the matter is this particular  regulation has had so many problems, it cannot be tweaked or amended.  They need to start all over again and take input from State and local  government.   Now, I heard the gentleman talk about people who hunt and fish. I am  a lifelong hunter and fisherman. In fact, I believe the gentleman has  invited me to come to Colorado to go fishing with him, and I have  invited him to come to the Gulf to come fishing with me. I spend a lot  of my time with people who hunt and fish all over the country, and I  have never heard anybody in the hunting and fishing community say: I  really want the Federal Government to tell me when and how and where I  can hunt and fish. Quite the opposite. My friends who hunt and fish  want the Federal Government to stay out of it. They would rather let  local and State people make those sorts of decisions, particularly as  they pertain to land use management.   On the education issues, as I said before, I was an 8-year member of  the Alabama State Board of Education. My colleague from Colorado said  something that is so true: getting a high-quality, well-trained, caring  teacher in the classroom is the most important thing we can do for our  schoolchildren. I don't trust the Federal Government to do that better  than I trust State and local officials to do it.   We had this law, No Child Left Behind, that gave the Federal  Government the power to determine when a teacher was highly qualified  or not. I don't think anybody in Washington knows better how to assess  whether a teacher is highly qualified or not than the principal and  superintendent that that teacher works for, than the local school board  that that teacher works for. There is nobody up here who can know that  better than they can.   There is nobody up here who can do a better job of looking at the  teacher preparation programs and saying they are good or bad than State  school boards, most of whom, like me, were elected by the people,  accountable to the people, instead of somebody up here who sits in some  office and makes that decision for them.   Do we really think that is what the American people want? The  American people want control of their lives back. They are tired of  Washington bureaucrats telling them what to do, and they are really  tired of the Federal Government telling the people they entrust with  the education of their children what to do and what not to do. They  want the people who make those decisions to be the people who live in  their communities, that they see in church, that they see at the  grocery store, that they interact with at the school every day. That is  what they want. And they want us, the Federal Government, to get out of  the way.                                time  1315    I talked to dozens and dozens of people who are school board members  and teachers and people involved in the school administration who said  this regulation by the Department of Education Accountability is way  over the line, please don't let them go through with that. So we are  being responsive to those people in doing this, and I am proud that we  are.   Mr. Speaker, I again urge my colleagues to support House Resolution  91 and the underlying joint resolutions.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Polis is as follows:              An Amendment to H. Res. 91 Offered by Mr. Polis         At the end of the resolution, add the following new       sections:        Sec. 4. Immediately upon the adoption of this resolution       the House shall proceed to the consideration, without       intervention of  [[Page H1030]]       any point of order, in the House of the resolution (H. Res.       78) reiterating the indisputable fact that the Nazi regime       targeted the Jewish people in its perpetration of the       Holocaust and calling on every entity in the executive branch       to affirm that fact. The resolution shall be considered as       read. The previous question shall be considered as ordered on       the resolution and preamble to adoption without intervening       motion or demand for division of the question except one hour       of debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and       ranking minority member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs.        Sec. 5. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of House Resolution 78.                                   ____           The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a       vote about what the House should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to       a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to       yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first       recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no       substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''       But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the       Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in       the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,       page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous       question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally       not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member       controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule . . . When the       motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the       time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering       the previous question. That Member, because he then controls       the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for       the purpose of amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on       Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further       debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:       ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a       resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control       shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous       question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who       controls the time for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools for those who oppose the Republican       majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the       opportunity to offer an alternative plan.     I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the  previous question on the resolution.
