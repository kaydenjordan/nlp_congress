 Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague,  Congressman Joyce, who has been a great leader on these issues relating  to our nursing workforce. I appreciate working with him as co-chair of  the House Congressional Nursing Caucus, where we are able to bring a  lot of these issues and challenges to life.   We all know that nurses and caregivers are the heartbeat of our  healthcare providers. Day in and day out, they provide lifesaving care  with empathy, compassion, and care in the most trying and stressful  situations. But across the country, we continue to see nursing  workforce shortages, especially in our rural and underserved  communities, like many in my home State of Hawaii where people on  different islands are literally separated by a body of water sometimes  from getting access to the care that they need.   In the next 2 years alone, the United States is on track to face a  shortage of nearly 200,000 nursing professionals. These shortages not  only drive up the cost of healthcare for those most in need, but they  actually endanger the wellbeing and care of our patients.   As our healthcare system faces heightened and complex challenges,  like an aging population, increase in chronic diseases, an ever- worsening opioid epidemic, and so much more, our healthcare workers  must have the training they need to address the needs of our  communities.   Reauthorizing Federal funding for vital programs that provide nurses  with training, education, and support, will help grow our nursing  workforce, both in my home State of Hawaii and across the country, and  expand access to the quality care for our children, our veterans, our  seniors, and all of our communities.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan  legislation, and empower our nurses and healthcare professionals to  continue serving and caring for the people in our communities.    Mr. Speaker, for decades, bad data and misinformation  have fueled the failed war on drugs that has wasted billions of  taxpayer dollars, incarcerating Americans for nonviolent marijuana  charges.   Our outdated marijuana policies have turned everyday Americans into  criminals, strained our criminal justice system, cost taxpayers  tremendously, and torn families apart, all for a substance that is  proven to be far less harmful and dangerous than alcohol.   Our Federal policy should be based on actual science and fact, not  misplaced stigma and outdated myths. However, the fact that marijuana  is currently classified as a schedule I drug, the same category as  heroin and cocaine, restricts and even discourages scientific research  on marijuana, limiting our ability to create science-based policies.   I will be introducing the bipartisan Marijuana Data Collection Act  with my colleague Congressman Carlos Curbelo so that we can get studies  to set the record straight. Our bill would authorize a nonpartisan  evidence-based report that analyzes current marijuana policies across  the country and their effects on our communities.   I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan legislation.                            ____________________
