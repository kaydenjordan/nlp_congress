 Mr. President, today we remember the life of Christopher  ``Chris'' Cousins, who passed away suddenly last week at the age of 42.  Chris was a political reporter for the Bangor Daily News and recently  named by the Maine Center for Public Interest Reporting as one of the  most respected journalists in Maine. Chris was well-liked by all who  met him, and he leaves behind his wife, Jen; two sons, Caleb and Lucas;  his mother; sister Jen Cousins; and many other family members and  friends. He will be greatly missed by his colleagues, his readers, his  friends, and all who knew him and his work.   Chris was a consummate professional who embodied the best ideals of  journalism. He was devoted to the truth, tenaciously pursued the  stories most important to the people of Maine, and had a passion for  the communities he served. Chris's death leaves a hole in Maine  journalism that will not be easily filled.   Chris began his journalism career at the Advertiser Democrat in  Norway, ME, then joined the Times Record in the early 2000s as a  reporter and city editor. He left the Times Record to join the State  House News Service before moving to the Bangor Daily News in 2009,  where he began covering southern Penobscot and Somerset Counties. Chris  quickly moved on to politics, covering the 2010 Maine Governor race,  and by 2013, he was appointed State house bureau chief.   Those who worked with Chris remember him for his storytelling  abilities, his laugh, and exceptional abilities as a journalist. Chris  had a huge heart and also fought for the truth from government leaders  at the State house, holding them accountable without being caustic.  Maine is a better place because of Chris and his relentless pursuit of  the truth on behalf of Maine people.   For me, Chris's political coverage shined when he covered people.  Chris was an incredible storyteller, and he was such a great journalist  because he got to know the people involved. No assignment was ever too  much for him, and his standard response was, ``I am not afraid.'' That  fearlessness resulted in clear stories that his editors loved,  heartfelt narratives that his readers could relate to, and more  passionate articles from his coworkers.   Chris exemplified what so many aspire to be: respected by their  peers, a loving husband and father, and a great friend. We have much to  be thankful for in Maine because of Chris's dedication and service to  the State and our Nation, and he will be deeply missed by so many.                            ____________________
