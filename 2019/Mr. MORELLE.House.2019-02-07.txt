 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 105 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 105         Resolved, That at any time after adoption of this       resolution the Speaker may, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule       XVIII, declare the House resolved into the Committee of the       Whole House on the state of the Union for consideration of       the bill (H.R. 840) to amend title 38, United States Code, to       direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to provide child       care assistance to veterans receiving certain medical       services provided by the Department of Veterans Affairs. The       first reading of the bill shall be dispensed with. All points       of order against consideration of the bill are waived.       General debate shall be confined to the bill and shall not       exceed one hour equally divided and controlled by the chair       and ranking minority member of the Committee on Veterans'       Affairs. After general debate the bill shall be considered       for amendment under the five-minute rule. It shall be in       order to consider as an original bill for the purpose of       amendment under the five-minute rule an amendment in the       nature of a substitute consisting of the text of Rules       Committee Print 116-3. That amendment in the nature of a       substitute shall be considered as read. All points of order       against that amendment in the nature of a substitute are       waived. No amendment to that amendment in the nature of a       substitute shall be in order except those printed in the       report of the Committee on Rules accompanying this       resolution. Each such amendment may be offered only in the       order printed in the report, may be offered only by a Member       designated in the report, shall be considered as read, shall       be debatable for the time specified in the report equally       divided and controlled by the proponent and an opponent,       shall not be subject to amendment, and shall not be subject       to a demand for division of the question in the House or in       the Committee of the Whole. All points of order against such       amendments are waived. At the conclusion of consideration of       the bill for amendment the Committee shall rise and report       the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been       adopted. Any Member may demand a separate vote in the House       on any amendment adopted in the Committee of the Whole to the       bill or to the amendment in the nature of a substitute made       in order as original text. The previous question shall be       considered as ordered on the bill and amendments thereto to       final passage without intervening motion except one motion to       recommit with or without instructions.        Sec. 2.  House Resolution 86 is hereby adopted.        Sec. 3.  It shall be in order at any time through the       legislative day of February 15, 2019, for the Speaker to       entertain motions that the House suspend the rules as though       under clause 1 of rule XV. The Speaker or her designee shall       consult with the Minority Leader or his designee on the       designation of any matter for consideration pursuant to this       section.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Woodall),  pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During  consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose  of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members be  given 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, on Wednesday, the Rules Committee met and  reported a rule, House Resolution 105, providing for consideration of  H.R. 840, the Veterans' Access to Child Care Act, under a structured  rule.   The rule provides for 1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled  by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Veterans'  Affairs.   The rule makes in order 21 amendments, each debatable for 10 minutes.  The rule also provides for adoption of H. Res. 86, a resolution  providing interim funding for our two new select committees.   Lastly, the rule provides suspension authority through next Friday,  February 15.   Mr. Speaker, the Veterans' Access to Child Care Act would make  permanent the VA's childcare pilot program, allowing more veterans to  access cost-free childcare when they receive mental or other intensive  healthcare treatment through the VA.   A nearly identical piece of legislation passed in the House last year  under a Republican majority with bipartisan cosponsors and without  objection. It is my hope that this Congress will support these efforts  to make it easier for our brave servicemembers to get the care they  need while supporting their families.   Millions of working families across the Nation are struggling to  afford the rising cost of childcare. Families in my own State of New  York often pay upwards of $15,000 each year to place one child in a  childcare center. Some parents may find themselves owing their entire  salary each month to provision of daycare. This cost can be so  debilitating that parents are being driven out of the workforce--many  of them women.   For veterans, these struggles can be even more acute. Many veterans  are primary caregivers to their children or even their grandchildren.  These brave men and women rely on the VA for their healthcare, but many  of them are forced to miss appointments or forgo treatment altogether  because they  [[Page H1400]]  have no childcare options. For many, that can be devastating. We have  seen the harm that can be done when military veterans do not receive  high-quality mental health services.   This Nation is facing a crisis. Each day, 20 American veterans take  their own life. Studies have shown that mental health disparities are a  leading cause of high suicide rates among veterans who struggle with  depression or post-traumatic stress.   The Department of Veterans Affairs has shown that the suicide rate  has increased faster among those veterans who have not recently  received treatment through the VA system. Addressing inadequate access  to lifesaving mental health and intense health services is critical as  we seek to reform our veterans' healthcare system, and we know that  making care more accessible will save lives.   Currently, the Department of Veterans Affairs operates a pilot  program to provide cost-free childcare to help primary caregivers  seeking mental health treatment at selected VA facilities across the  country. This program has been extended by Congress several times and  has provided care for more than 10,000 children already.   Congress now has an opportunity to extend not only this pilot, but to  expand this essential service to every VA facility in the Nation. This  will allow thousands more veterans to receive cost-free childcare,  ensuring that they never have to choose caring for their family over  caring for their own mental health well-being.   This legislation is especially important for female veterans across  the Nation, many of whom are single parents or primary caregivers. An  increasing number of female veterans have been in combat. One in five  female veterans seen by the VA report military sexual trauma.   It is clear that female veterans face unique health challenges and  unique barriers to accessing the care they need. This legislation will  work to dismantle those barriers so the VA can build on the progress we  have made in treating female veterans.   For many veterans, it is not only essential that they receive mental  and intensive healthcare, but that they receive care quickly. When  facing a serious mental health crisis, veterans shouldn't have to worry  about their babysitter dropping out or how they will pay for a day of  daycare or how they will find someone to take care of their child while  they go to the hospital and receive services. We must ensure that the  men and women who have laid their lives on the line for our Nation have  timely access to the lifesaving services they need and that we have  promised to provide.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote for this rule and the  underlying legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   First of all, I appreciate the comments by my distinguished and  wholly entertaining colleague, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.  Woodall). I do want to just make a couple of points related to his  comments.   First of all, as the gentleman indicated, the amendment that he  talked about was not germane, not before the House, and that was ruled  such yesterday. But, as it relates to the paygo rule, we are entirely  in compliance with that. In fact, the Congressional Budget Office  advised us that there is no direct spending in the bill.   As my mother is often wont to say: You can't be holier than the  church. CBO has ruled on it and indicated that the bill does not add a  single penny to our deficit or to the national debt, period.   I do, Mr. Speaker, however, find it somewhat ironic. I was thinking  about this just yesterday after our conversation in the Rules  Committee, and I do note that the appropriation over the next 5 years,  $120 million--that is million with an M, not billion with a B, and  certainly not trillion with a T. And I do find it ironic to some agree  that the gentleman and his colleagues last year would enact a tax cut  which provided that 83 percent of its benefits went to the wealthiest  Americans.   And, if we were here each day, Mr. Woodall and I, for 365 days a  year, for the next 30 years--10,000 days, 10,000 times--that tax bill  would have spent more money than this would during that time, if we did  this for 10,000 days. Think about it.   The work that we do here: authorized spending on a program for  veterans, not our wealthiest Americans; those who are struggling; those  who have,  [[Page H1401]]  during their time, provided great service and sacrifice to our country;  those who have kept us safe. And I know Mr. Woodall and I share an  appreciation for all the work our veterans do.   But this is a policy bill, Mr. Speaker. It is not an appropriations  bill, and it has no direct spending. What it does: It helps save the  lives of veterans, and it helps put them on a safer, more sound bearing  for the future.   The cost for implementing it is, as I said, $120 million over the  next 5 years. And it seems to me, it seems to my colleagues, that this  is appropriate given the priorities we have for our Nation and for our  veterans.   So the next step, as the gentleman knows, is to provide funding  through the appropriation process, and I hope that this Congress does  invest in our veterans, particularly those who have challenging health  issues, whether they be physical, mental, or behavioral, who also  happen to be the parents or caretakers of our young children.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I inquire of the gentleman whether or not  there are other speakers or whether I should use this opportunity to  close.    Mr. Speaker, I apologize. I am still learning this. The  lingo on the floor of the House is much different than the lingo on the  floor of the New York State Assembly, where I had the privilege of  serving, and I do appreciate the gentleman's help through this. He has  me at a bit of a disadvantage.   I do want to just reiterate before I yield that, in fact, this is a  policy that we set with this bill and this rule. It will be up to the  appropriators to make a decision about whether this is a priority as  they go through this process and determine whether there will be  funding for it in the appropriations bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms.  Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Georgia for his indulgence  and his patience as I hopefully will get the training wheels off at one  of these points, but I appreciate his comments.   I do want to note that this bill, the amendment which the gentleman  speaks of, will not have been germane in the previous Congress either,  and it was not ruled germane during the Rules Committee deliberations.   But, Mr. Speaker, I do want to thank all my colleagues for the words  of support for H.R. 840, the Veterans' Access to Child Care Act. The  Veterans' Access bill, I want to especially thank the sponsor,  Congresswoman Julia Brownley and Chairman Mark Takano of the Veterans'  Affairs Committee, as well as the ranking member, Mr. Roe, for their  work in supporting our Nation's veterans.   I am proud that this rule provides for the consideration of so many  diverse ideas, including minority and bipartisan amendments, something  that would not be allowed in the previous Congress. I am proud we have  taken this bipartisan approach, and I appreciate all the work that  Chairman McGovern has done to make sure that that is part of the work  that we do.   I urge a ``yes'' vote on the rule and a ``yes'' vote on the previous  question.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Woodall is as follows:         At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 4. Notwithstanding any other provision of this       resolution, the amendment printed in section 5 shall be in       order as though printed as the last amendment in the report  [[Page H1403]]       of the Committee on Rules accompanying this resolution if       offered by Representative Bilirakis of Florida or a designee.       That amendment shall be debatable for 10 minutes equally       divided and controlled by the proponent and an opponent.        Sec. 5. The amendment referred to in section 4 is as       follows:        At the end, add the following:       SEC. 3. EXTENSION OF REQUIREMENT TO COLLECT FEES FOR HOUSING                     LOANS GUARANTEED BY SECRETARY OF VETERANS                     AFFAIRS.         Section 3729(b)(2) of title 38, United States Code, is       amended by striking ``September 30, 2028'' each place it       appears and inserting ``December 31, 2028''.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.
