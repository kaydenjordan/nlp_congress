 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed  to speak despite the order for recess.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, it has been 2 months since Hurricane Irma  hit Florida and basically covered up the State, and our people are  still hurting because they don't have sufficient housing.   If you lived in a mobile home, if you lived in a low-lying area, your  home was destroyed. It is uninhabitable. The ceiling is collapsing. The  mold and the mildew, because of all the water which has now  accumulated, makes it an uninhabitable home.   FEMA, through individual assistance, is supposed to provide temporary  housing. This is the law. That is what the people of Florida are  entitled to--just like the people of Texas are entitled to in the  Presiding Officer's State--but it is not happening in Florida. Why?  Because they get on the telephone, and they have to wait up to-- documented--4 hours to get somebody on the phone from FEMA or, for home  inspections, it takes 45 days before they can get an inspector to come  out and see the home so they can be declared eligible for individual  assistance. That is just unacceptable.   If they don't have the means--especially if they don't have a job as  a result of the jobs being destroyed in the hurricane--where are they  going to be able to get temporary assistance for housing? It is a fact  that this is happening in the State of Florida, and it has to be  changed.   Thus, you see the bipartisan effort of my colleague from Florida  Marco Rubio and me writing to the head of FEMA today to say: Look, what  happened? Years ago, during the debacle of Hurricane Katrina in New  Orleans, they experienced an average wait time of 10 minutes before  they could get FEMA on the line to help them. Now we have people  waiting as much as 4 hours. I wanted to bring this to the attention of  the Senate.   After a hurricane, 2 months later, we cannot have an aftermath where  our people are hurting, they are suffering. They can't live in a  healthy condition in the homes that have been destroyed in the  hurricane.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
