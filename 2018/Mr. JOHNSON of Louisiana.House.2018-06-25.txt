 Mr. Speaker, I do want to take a moment to  thank Chairman Bishop and his team for their continued support of the  Lake Bistineau Land Title Stability Act. This bill rights a decades-old  wrong when the Federal Government failed to notify landowners of a  resurvey of over 200 acres around Lake Bistineau, located in northwest  Louisiana. When the Federal Government did that, it preempted the  rights of landowners who had legal ownership of the land.   It is unfathomable for many of us here today to imagine a morning  where we wake up and we are told that the land our families owned for  generations is no longer ours, to learn that the Federal Government has  somehow staked claim to our very homes, the place where we were raised,  the place where we are now raising our own families, and the land we  had worked for decades, all of it just gone without so much as an  opportunity to contest it.   That is what happened here. The government's failure to properly  notify landowners of the new boundaries and its claim to the land for  nearly 50 years is shameful. This error led to unnecessary uncertainty  regarding who rightfully owns the land. We genuinely believe the answer  is very clear: the property rightfully belongs to the Louisianans who  have owned the lands since the days the State of Louisiana first  entered the Union.   My bill provides certainty and clarity by directing the Secretary of  the Interior to issue a disclaimer of interest on the disputed acres  and rightfully restore land title ownership to the families that have  lived and worked these  [[Page H5604]]  lands since the State's admittance to the Union.   I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will support this  bill and support the folks in my district who have simply had their  land taken from them without due process.   Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of the bill.
