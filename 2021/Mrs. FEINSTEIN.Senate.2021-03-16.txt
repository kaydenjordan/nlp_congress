 Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the  ``Help Independent Tracks Succeed (HITS) Act,'' which Senator Blackburn  and I introduced today. Representatives Linda Sanchez (D-CA) and Ron  Estes (R-KS) have introduced companion legislation in the House of  Representatives.   Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, I have consistently heard  from independent musicians and producers in California who have lost a  large percentage of their incomes due to concerts, festivals, and other  events being cancelled.   With many live performance stages and venues across the Nation closed  for months as a result of the pandemic, independent musicians and music  makers such as technicians and creators have suffered significant loss  of income.   According to a survey by the Copyright Alliance, 88 percent of  creators have lost income due to the coronavirus pandemic, which is  more than double the national average. Approximately half of survey  respondents had lost 90 percent or more of their income.   Our bill would provide some relief to music creators by allowing  independent musicians, technicians, and music producers to deduct the  cost of producing new musical recordings, putting them on a level  playing field with other arts productions.   The U.S. Tax Code allows film, television, and theater productions to  fully deduct production expenses in the year they are incurred.  [[Page S1572]]    However, recording artists are not given the same treatment, and are  forced instead to amortize their production expenses over a number of  years.   The HITS Act would allow qualified sound recording producers to  deduct 100% of recording production expenses--up to $150,000--in the  year they are incurred, rather than in later years.   Because this change would simply accelerate a tax deduction that  already exists, the bill's expected cost would be minimal.   In addition, because the deduction would be capped at $150,000 per  production, our legislation would benefit smaller, independent  musicians and music producers rather than large companies.   The coronavirus pandemic has had a dramatic impact on music creators  around the Nation. Our bill would help create parity between musical  creators and other creative producers, stimulate the economy, and get  music makers back to work.   I hope my colleagues will join me in support of this bill. Thank you,  Mr. President, and I yield the floor.                                  ______                                         By Mr. THUNE (for himself, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Portman, Ms.          Baldwin, Mrs. Capito, and Mr. Cardin):   S. 773. A bill to enable certain hospitals that were participating in  or applied for the drug discount program under section 340B of the  Public Health Service Act prior to the COVID-19 public health emergency  to temporarily maintain eligibility for such program, and for other  purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.
