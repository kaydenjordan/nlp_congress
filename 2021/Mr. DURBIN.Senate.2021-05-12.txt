 I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum  call be rescinded.    Mr. President, they did it in a closed room. No one in  the public was allowed to watch. They did it by a voice vote so that  there would be no physical record of how individual Congressmen--how  they voted. And they decided to remove a Member of the Republican  leadership in the House of Representatives this morning in that  fashion. These proud, courageous disciples of Donald Trump didn't want  to be on the record publicly as to where they stood on the fate of  Congresswoman Cheney.   This is the same Congresswoman Cheney who was reelected to leadership  in the House just a few weeks ago. This is the same Congresswoman  Cheney who is one of the most ideologically conservative Members of the  House. She voted with President Trump nearly 93 percent of the time  while she was in office. With a name like Cheney, it is hard to  question her Republican credentials.   No, the decision, in private, in secret this morning by a voice vote,  was not about a disagreement over policy but the issue as to whether or  not Liz Cheney dares to tell the truth.   She refused to defend or ignore the big lie that the 2020 election  was stolen from Donald Trump, and in today's Republican Party, it seems  like that is all that is necessary for grounds for removal.   More than 6 months after the 2020 election was held, it is clear that  the big lie has been spread in a big way. And that lie is not just a  threat to the future of the Republican Party, it is a threat to our  democracy.   Since the start of this year, Republican State legislatures, inspired  by Donald Trump's big lie that the election was stolen, have introduced  more than 360 bills with restrictive voting provisions in 47 States-- one of the most notorious examples, the State of Georgia.   Remember, the State of Georgia--hotly contested in the 2020 election,  and then the Trump troops came in and went to court over and over and  over again, suggesting there was election fraud and dishonesty in the  Georgia election. And the Georgia election officials, virtually all  Republicans, stood up and said it was an honest election, a close one,  but it was an honest election. They were challenged over and over  again, to the point where the former President of the United States,  while he was still in power, called an election official in Georgia and  basically threatened him; that if he didn't change the votes and give  President Trump what he thought he needed to win, he would pay a price  for it. It went that far.   To his credit, this election official stood up and said: The results  are accurate and I stand by them and I am not going to change it.   It went that far.   And there was a big turnout in Georgia. In fact, there was an amazing  turnout in the runoff elections for the two Senate seats won by Jon  Ossoff and Raphael Warnock, our colleagues here in the U.S. Senate. So  even with that big turnout and even with the certainty that that  election was honest from start to finish, the Georgia Legislature  decided to change the laws for voting in Georgia. It wasn't volume they  were looking for; it was loyalty. They wanted to make sure that the  voters in the future would be friendlier to the Republicans.   And so they changed the Georgia election law and made it harder for  people, particularly people of color, young people, the elderly, and  people of limited means, to vote. That law--that Georgia voting law-- represents a blatantly political effort to subvert our democratic  process.   Republicans of conscience know this, but it seems there is no future  for those Republicans, if we reflect on the vote taken this morning in  the House of Representatives Republican caucus. Liz Cheney's expulsion  from her role in the Republican conference is just the latest example  of what happens to Republican officials who dare to speak the truth  about the 2020 election. They are not only silenced, they are purged  from the party ranks.   Our own colleague Senator Mitt Romney, not long ago a Republican  candidate for President of the United States, was just censured by a  Republican county organization in his State because he refuses to  support the big lie of Donald Trump. The unfortunate reality is that,  today, the loudest voices within the Republican Party have joined  Donald Trump in declaring war on the basics of our democracy.   That is why we in Congress need to do something. Immediately. This  week, the Rules Committee held a markup on a measure that would combat  voter suppression and protect our democratic process. It is known as  the For the People Act.   This is a democracy defense plan. It will ensure that all eligible  Americans can exercise their constitutional right to vote without  facing burdensome barriers at the ballot box. The For the People Act  invests in election infrastructure, provides State and local officials  with resources to run safe, secure elections   In addition to combating voter suppression, the bill also reforms a  broken campaign finance system that gives wealthy donors and big  corporations far too much influence over our electoral process. By  passing it, we will say, loud and clear, that America's elections are  not for sale to the highest bidder. Above all, this legislation will  strengthen the integrity of our democratic process and put more power  in the hands of the people.   Now, I know some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are  attacking the bill as a ``takeover'' of the Nation's election system.  The truth is, American elections have already been taken over by  special interests. This bill will start to restore our democracy and  make it more accessible to every eligible American.   I would love to know what my Republican colleagues find so  objectionable about the legislation's core provisions. Listen, it  automatically registers American voters when they get a driver's  license; it guarantees at least 15 days of early voting; ends partisan  gerrymandering nationwide; and brings greater transparency to the  campaign finance system. These are reforms that will make our democracy  whole again, and they are desperately needed, particularly at this  moment in our history because in the world's greatest democracy, people  shouldn't have to wait in line for hours on end to have their voices  heard. And yet that is the reality for voters in States just like  Georgia. And it is not an accident; it is intentional. Look at the  people standing in the lines, and you can understand why they are being  discouraged from voting by waiting so long.   Let's be honest about these restrictive voting provisions being  passed in State legislatures across the country, because they are  grounded in one lie after another. The truth is that President Trump's  own officials at the Department of Homeland Security declared that the  2020 election was the most secure election in American history.   The truth is, judges across the country, including many appointed by  President Donald Trump, threw out more than 63 lawsuits that his  followers filed, challenging the results of last year's elections. Why?  There was no evidence, no basis in fact for the big lie.   But the truth is, the big lie won't just die with the 2020 election.  It will sow distrust in our electoral system for years to come, unless  my Republican colleagues act with courage. A few have done so. This  morning, one paid a heavy price.   The question to all of us is: Are we prepared to either discredit  democracy or defend it?   Rejecting the big lie is the defense of our democratic process. We  have to join together in making certain that every American's right to  vote is protected.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    I announce that the Senator from New Mexico (Mr.  Heinrich) is necessarily absent.

(e) Applications.--To be eligible for a grant under the       pilot program, a unit of general local government or a       stormwater management agency shall submit to the       Administrator an application in such form and containing such       information as the Administrator shall require.        (f) Selection of Recipients.--        (1) Annual selection.--Subject to paragraph (2), and to the       submission of approvable applications, in each fiscal year       for which amounts are made available for grants under the       pilot program, the Administrator shall select, from among       applications submitted under subsection (e) for that fiscal       year, 3 units of general government or stormwater management       authorities to receive grants under the pilot program.        (2) Aggregate limit.--Subject only to the submission of       approvable applications, the Administrator shall select, in       the aggregate over the entire duration of the pilot program,       12 units of general government or stormwater management       authorities to receive grants under the pilot program, as       follows:        (A) Tier 1.--Three of the applicants selected shall be       units of general local government, or stormwater management       authorities for those units, each of which has a population       of more than 800,000 individuals, as follows:        (i) Pelagic coastal city.--One shall be--         (I) a unit of general local government that is a pelagic       unit; or        (II) a stormwater authority for a unit described in       subclause (I).         (ii) Non-pelagic coastal city.--One shall be--         (I) a unit of general local government that--         (aa) is a coastal unit; and        (bb) is not a pelagic unit; or         (II) a stormwater authority for a unit described in       subclause (I).         (iii) Non-coastal city.--One shall be--         (I) a unit of general local government that is not a       coastal unit; or        (II) a stormwater authority for a unit described in       subclause (I).         (B) Tier 2.--Six of the applicants selected shall be units       of general local government, or stormwater management       authorities for those units, each of which has a population       of more than 200,000 individuals and not more than 800,000       individuals, as follows:        (i) Coastal cities.--Three shall be--         (I) units of general local government that are coastal       units; or        (II) stormwater management authorities for units described       in subclause (I).

(C) Tier 3.--Three of the applicants selected shall be--        (i) units of general local government, each of which has a       population of more than 50,000 individuals and not more than       200,000 individuals; or        (ii) stormwater management authorities for units described       in clause (i).        (g) Priority.--        (1) In general.--The Administrator shall select applicants       for grants under the pilot program based on the extent to       which the applications of those applicants shall achieve the       objectives described in subsection (c).        (2) Tiers 2 and 3.--In selecting applicants to receive       grants under the pilot program under subparagraphs (B) and       (C) of subsection (f)(2), the Administrator shall give       priority to applicants--        (A) that are highly vulnerable to sea level rise;        (B) within which are located a military installation or       another facility relating to national security concerns; or        (C) that have--        (i) populations that are highly vulnerable to urban       flooding; and        (ii) an uneven capacity for flood mitigation and response       efforts resulting from socioeconomic factors.        (h) Amount.--        (1) Considerations.--In determining the amount of a grant       under the pilot program, the Administrator shall consider the       population of the grant recipient, which may be considered in       terms of the tier under subsection (f)(2) with respect to the       recipient.        (2) Federal share.--The amount of a grant under the pilot       program may not exceed 75 percent of the total cost incurred       in carrying out the activities described in subsection (c).        (i) Duration.--The Administrator shall require each       recipient of a grant under the pilot program to complete the       activities described in subsection (c), which shall be,       subject to subsection (h)(2), carried out using the grant       amounts, not later than 18 months after the date on which the       recipient initially receives the grant amounts under the       pilot program.        (j) Use of Census Data.--The Administrator shall make all       determinations regarding population under the pilot program       by using data from the most recently completed decennial       census by the Bureau of the Census.
