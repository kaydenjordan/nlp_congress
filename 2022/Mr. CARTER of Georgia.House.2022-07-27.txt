 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate Byron  Buxton being named to the Major League Baseball All-Star roster this  season.   This great accomplishment is the culmination of a life dedicated to  the perfection of his craft.   Byron is a great example of hard work paying off. At Appling County  High School, Byron was a top player on his team, and was considered by  many to be the top prospect entering the 2012 Major League Baseball  draft.   While at Appling County High School, Byron played baseball,  basketball, and football.   He eventually committed to play baseball at the University of Georgia  with the intention of playing both baseball and football.   The Minnesota Twins selected Byron with the second overall pick of  the 2012 Major League Baseball draft.   Byron is having an excellent season this year in which he was  selected to participate in the Major League Baseball All-Star Game.   We are so proud of everything Byron has accomplished and will  continue to accomplish. It has been a blast following your career,  Byron. We are looking forward to big things to come.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of my bill, H.R. 4990, the ITS  Codification Act.   As demand for wireless technology continues to grow, we must continue  to focus on identifying potential opportunities to make more spectrum  available for commercial use, including reallocating and sharing  spectrum from Federal users.   In order to protect Federal missions, these reallocation decisions  rely on complex technical testing and analysis that experts at the  Federal Communications Commission and National Telecommunications and  Information Administration evaluate. As policymakers consider  reallocating Federal spectrum for commercial use, it is critical that  the FCC and NTIA have the information they need to make these  decisions.   The Institute for Telecommunication Sciences, or ITS, within NTIA  plays an essential role in conducting the radiofrequency tests that  provide this technical information. The work ITS performs has led to  innovative advancements in the way we manage our airwaves.   These airwaves power faster mobile connectivity for Americans, and  making more spectrum available in the future is critical to beating  China and others in wireless and technological innovation.   The ITS Codification Act will strengthen statutory authority for ITS  and ensure that the work they do to advance United States wireless  leadership remains a critical ingredient to our success.   Furthermore, I am proud that H.R. 4990 went through regular order and  enjoyed unanimous support in both the subcommittee and full committee  markups of the Committee on Energy and Commerce.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the legislation, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today to express my concerns with H.R. 3771,  the South Asian Heart Health Awareness and Research Act of 2022.   Investing in the health of all Americans through innovative and  targeted programming has been a priority for House Republicans. We have  been steadfast in our support for heart health promotion and  cardiovascular research through consistent and robust funding of the  National Institutes of Health and most recently through passage of  Congressman Barr's H.R. 1193, the Cardiovascular Advances in Research  and Opportunities Legacy Act.   Unfortunately, H.R. 3771, the South Asian Heart Health Awareness and  Research Act of 2022, that we are discussing today will do nothing to  meaningfully improve cardiovascular health of Americans.   Energy and Commerce Committee Republicans have repeatedly expressed  concerns throughout the entire legislative process. There are already  numerous Federal initiatives at the CDC, the NIH, and the Patient- Centered Outcomes Research Institute which are already dedicated to  cardiovascular health. What the CDC really needs to do is refocus on  its original mission of controlling and responding to infectious  diseases.   After extending itself in so many directions in their interest of  prevention and public health, the CDC has become nearly incapable of  adequately addressing serious threats posed by infectious diseases,  especially novel ones for which there is little information about  risks, spread, and treatment. Now is not the time to create duplicative  programs when the CDC's management of an ongoing pandemic and the  current monkeypox outbreak has arguably been abysmal.   Former FDA Commissioner Scott Gotttlieb was recently quoted as saying  that it may be too late to control and contain the monkeypox and  compared CDC's response to the start of the COVID-19 pandemic saying  that the U.S. is making a lot of the same mistakes, such as a lack of  testing and not enough vaccines.   I couldn't agree more.   The window to getting this under control is closing fast. There are  other concerning infectious diseases that need to be addressed. Ghana  just recently declared an outbreak of Marburg virus, an incredibly  infectious and deadly virus that needs to be addressed by the global  health community immediately before it gets out of hand.   Addressing and preventing heart disease is important. Make no mistake  about that. But the ever-expanding portfolio of public health issues is  simply not sustainable. We don't need another duplicative public health  prevention initiative that further erodes the CDC's focus.   Madam Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on this bill, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Iowa (Mrs. Miller-Meeks). Dr. Mariannette Miller-Meeks  is someone who is no less than an expert in public health.    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to the  amendment.    Madam Speaker, I rise to express my concerns  with the amendment offered by Representative Sherrill to H.R. 3771, the  South Asian Heart Health Awareness and Research Act of 2022.   The amendment requires the Secretary to enter into an agreement with  the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine, to study  the relationship between COVID-19 and rates of morbidity and mortality  as a result of heart disease in at-risk populations.   This amendment is highly duplicative of ongoing work at the National  Institutes of Health. A basic web search for research on this issue on  the National Library of Medicine's PubMed yields over 13,000  publications, reviews, and clinical trial data.   Furthermore, the NIH has an entire resource page titled ``How Does  COVID-19 Affect the Heart.'' That page links to several studies funded  by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute.   This duplicative amendment will add additional costs to the bill, as  authorizing the National Academies generally requires about $1 to $2  million to conduct studies. What a waste of precious taxpayer dollars.   Madam Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I oppose this amendment. I  think it is duplicative, and I think it is a waste of taxpayers' money.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Madam Speaker, one of my top priorities since I have been a Member of  Congress has been to make sure that healthcare is accessible and  available for all Americans. Telehealth has played a critical role for  patients to access the care they desperately need.                                time  1245    On the Energy and Commerce Committee, we have been discussing the  importance of telehealth flexibilities for years. It is bringing  doctors right into families' living rooms and is an example of how  innovation can improve and save people's lives.   As the coronavirus spread and providers closed their doors, patients  and providers were forced to adapt and utilize telehealth services.  Just months into the public health emergency, Medicare was receiving  over a million telehealth visits a week, an almost 3,000 percent  increase. Those without adequate transportation or in rural areas were  still able to visit with their doctor.   While we have made great strides in making telehealth more broadly  available, we know that Congress can do more. Increasing access to  telehealth means increasing access to quality care for all patients.   I often discuss how, before the pandemic, we had a lot of regulations  and red tape that piled up over the years. So while I will support this  legislation, it is a shame that we did not take something as important  as this through committee to make sure it could be the best possible  product.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Washington (Mrs. Rodgers), the ranking member of the  Energy and Commerce Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Utah (Mr. Curtis), an important member of the Energy and  Commerce Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Burgess).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Johnson), another valuable member of the  Energy and Commerce Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Valadao).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Again, let me be clear about my standing on this bill. I support this  bill. We support telehealth. We are all in favor of telehealth, but we  also support the fact that we have committees that this type of  legislation needs to go through, and we missed an opportunity here to  make this a better bill. That is simply what we are saying.   No one is saying they are not in favor of telehealth. Telehealth has  become an integral part of our healthcare system during this pandemic.  There is no question about that. All of us agree on that. It needs to  be extended.   But, again, the committee process is exceptionally important, and we  need to make sure that we follow that, particularly when we are talking  about subject matter as important as this because it is important.   Again, since I have been a Member of Congress, I have been working to  make healthcare accessible and available, and telehealth does just  that. This is exactly what we want, but there are ways that we could  have made this better.   One example is that we need to make sure there is no waste, fraud,  and abuse. That is one thing that could have been tightened up in this  legislation.   Another example is to make sure that we are not having any  information that is inadvertently or intentionally being released. That  is extremely important as well.   So again, there are ways that we could have made this legislation  better if we had gone through the committee process, which is a process  that is extremely important.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
