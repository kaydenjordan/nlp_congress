 Mr. Chief Justice, today the Senate will conduct up to  8 hours of questions to the parties delivered in writing to the Chief  Justice. As a reminder, the two sides will alternate and answers should  be kept to 5 minutes or less.   The majority side will lead off with a question from the Senator from  Maine.    Mr. Chief Justice.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The majority leader is recognized.    I want to suggest that after two more questions on  each side--I have been corrected, as I frequently am--one more question  on each side, we take a 15-minute break.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you.   The Senator from Kansas.    Mr. Chief Justice, I ask unanimous consent that the  Senate stand in recess until 4 p.m.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 3:38 p.m., recessed until  4:06 p.m. and reassembled when called to order by the Chief Justice.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senator from Oklahoma.    Mr. Chief Justice, the next two questions--one from  each side--would be the last before we break for dinner. I would ask  that following the next two questions, the Senate stand in recess for  45 minutes.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you.   The Senator from Alabama.    Mr. Chief Justice, I recommend we take a break until  10 p.m. and then finish up for the evening.   There being no objection, at 9:44 p.m., the Senate, sitting as a  Court of Impeachment, recessed until 10:07 p.m.; whereupon the Senate  reassembled when called to order by the Chief Justice.    Mr. Chief Justice, my understanding is we will finish  up at about 11 p.m.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you.   The Senator from Georgia.    Mr. Chief Justice, while the question is coming up, I  understand that there are two more Democratic questions and two more  Republican questions.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you.   The question from Senator Murphy is to the President's counsel:         The House Managers have committed to abide by rulings by       the Chief Justice regarding witness testimony and the       admissibility of evidence, and that they will not appeal such       rulings. Will the President's Counsel make the same       commitment, thus obviating any concerns about an extended       trial?    Mr. Counsel SEKULOW. Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the Senate, we had  this question. We will say it very clearly. We are not willing to do  that, and we are not willing to do that because of the constitutional  framework upon which an impeachment is based and the constitutional  privileges that are at stake, with no disrespect at all to the Chief  Justice.   That is not the constitutional design. It is the same thing they are  doing again. Surrender the constitutional prerogatives you have, and  then we will proceed in this way. Give us documents, give us witnesses,  and if you don't, we are going to charge you with obstruction of  Congress.   In this case, it is ``We are willing to live,'' according to the  managers, ``by whatever the Chief Justice decides.'' But that is not  the way the constitutional framework is set up, and it is putting us in  exactly the same spot again: Give up your right to challenge a subpoena  in court; rely only on the person who is here--by the way, again, with  no disrespect to the Chief Justice. The Chief Justice is here as the  Presiding Officer of this proceeding.   So the President is not willing to forgo those rights and privileges  that he possesses under the Constitution, under article II, for  expediency. They tried that below in the House. We trust that will not  be the decision here in the Senate.   Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, counsel.  [[Page S690]]    The Senator from Mississippi.    Mr. Chief Justice, I ask unanimous consent that the  trial adjourn until 1 p.m., Thursday, tomorrow, January 30, and this  order also constitute the adjournment of the Senate.   There being no objection, at 11:05 p.m., the Senate, sitting as a  Court of Impeachment, adjourned until Thursday, January 30, 2020, at 1  p.m.
