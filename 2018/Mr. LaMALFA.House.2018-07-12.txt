 Mr. Speaker, I rise today sadly but, also, in honor of  the passing of a dear friend from Shasta County, Mel Fisher. Melvin  Francis Fisher was born in Detroit, Michigan.   I first came to know Mel and his lovely wife, Kathy--what a character  this couple was--during the first time I went to a Pearl Harbor  survivors event in Shasta County in about 2002.   Mel joined the Navy in 1940 to follow in the footsteps of his father,  who was a fighter pilot in World War I. He couldn't have known what the  journey was going to take him to; so, indeed, when he was in Pearl  Harbor aboard the USS Whitney, that was where they were attacked by the  Japanese. His ship was responsible for shooting down two Japanese  planes that day.   Mel later went on to serve on the USS Indiana, participating in  military engagements in Iwo Jima, Guadalcanal, Okinawa, and more.   In 2010, my family and I had the privilege of accompanying Mel,  Kathy, and their family to the 69th anniversary commemoration of the  Pearl Harbor attack. Indeed, that is something I will always treasure.   His military service was very distinguished, but his family remembers  someone who gave back to his community in service. He loved to fish on  and around Lake Shasta.   He peacefully passed away on Father's Day, surrounded by his loving  family. He will be greatly missed.   It was an honor for me to know such a man as Mel Fisher, who served  his family faithfully and his community with love and is loved by so  many.   God bless you, Mel.                            ____________________
