 Mr. Speaker, this week, as gasoline prices  climb to over $5 a gallon at home, Pennsylvania families are now paying  twice what they paid when President Biden first took office just 18  months ago.   By Biden's canceling of new drilling leases and decision to impose  burdensome standards on our energy producers, the President has turned  his back on the energy crisis that our communities right now are  facing.   A new report out this week finds that at this rate, Americans are on  track to pay over $5,000 a year for gasoline. These prices are  unsustainable, and instead of addressing the problem, President Biden  has chosen to side with the far-left activists instead of the working- class Americans who are paying these prices at the pump.   The answer is clear: We need to produce American energy for American  families to lower the cost of gas and stop the runaway inflation that  is right now crippling our Nation.                            ____________________
