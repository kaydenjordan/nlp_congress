 Mr. Speaker, our constituents sent us here to  represent them, to be a voice for their families, to fight for their  values, to vote in their best interest. I am here for the residents of  Arizona's Second Congressional District. I am here to work for them.   We must reject the culture of corruption here and put the power back  in the hands of the people we represent. Our government works best when  it is focused on people and American families,  [[Page H2378]]  not some special interest group or large corporation.   We can clean up the muddy swamp behaviors by passing H.R. 1. We need  to reduce the role of dark special interest money and to make it easier  to vote. We need to have some accountability here.   I will be voting for H.R. 1 so that our constituents become the top  priority for all of us, not special interest groups.                            ____________________
