 Madam Speaker, I rise today not to offer my words but the  words of a brave Coloradan, Tom Mauser. Tom's son, Daniel, was murdered  at Columbine High School 23 years ago in 1999. He was 15 years old, the  same age as me.   Tom shared with me that in the weeks before his death, Daniel asked  him, ``Dad, did you know there are loopholes in the Brady Bill?''   At 15 years old, Daniel was able to see the gaping holes in our  Nation's gun laws. Tragically, so were the two 18-year-old killers,  teenagers that, in Tom's words, ``saw loopholes big enough to drive a  truck through.''   As Tom said to me today, what has Congress really done to protect our  precious children from gun violence in those 23 years? Shamefully,  nothing.   It is time for Congress to do its job. It is time to act and to  demonstrate that you give a damn about our children. Tom is right. I  beg my colleagues, support this commonsense bill.
