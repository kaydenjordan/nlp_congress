 Mr. President, S. Con. Res. 14, the fiscal year 2022  congressional budget resolution, included a reserve fund in section  3003 to allow the chairman of the Senate Committee on the Budget to  revise budget aggregates, committee allocations, and make adjustments  to the pay-as-you-go ledger for legislation that would not increase the  deficit over the period of fiscal years 2022 to 2031.   The Senate will soon consider S. 610, the Protecting Medicare and  American Farmers from Sequester Cuts Act, as amended by the House,  which meets the condition of being paid for and not increasing the  deficit over the 10-year period. As such, I am filing a revision to the  aggregates and committee allocations under the budget resolution, which  were filed on September 23. Specifically, the Congressional Budget  Office estimates that S. 610 will increase budget authority in 2022 by  $7.65 billion and outlays by $7.144 billion. Over 5 years, budget  authority and outlays will increase by $7.079 billion, while there is  no net increase to outlays over the 10-year period. I am increasing the  aggregate amount of budget authority and outlays for 2022, as well as  the allocation to the Committee on Finance and the Senate pay-as-you-go  ledger, by those amounts.   I ask unanimous consent that the accompanying tables, which provide  details about the adjustment, be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:        REVISIONS TO BUDGET AGGREGATES--BUDGET AUTHORITY AND OUTLAYS  (Pursuant to Section 3003 of S. Con.
