 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, this evening, President Biden will  begin the back half of his term with his State of the Union address to  Congress and to the American people. But the White House's attempts to  script the message for this week have been upset by recent events. Over  the last several days, the country learned that on President Biden's  watch, the state of our Union is apparently under Chinese surveillance  from our own skies.   It is ludicrous to suggest that Canada and the United States had no  choice but to let this thing traipse across the continent from coast to  coast. President Obama's own Defense Secretary, Leon Panetta, says,  ``We should have acted earlier.''   The administration's handwringing and indecision, finally downing the  balloon only after it had toured the length of our country, was typical  of how President Biden and his team have conducted our foreign affairs.   Our top military commanders and civilian experts all say that our  broader strategic competition with China is our most serious challenge.  But this President's last budget request tried to cut funding for our  military after inflation, while Beijing keeps investing in their own  capabilities.   The commander of our U.S. Strategic Command just told Congress that  China now has more land-based intercontinental ballistic missile  launchers than we do. The administration's reckless retreat from  Afghanistan blew past the expert warnings, cost the lives of 13  American servicemembers, let thousands of terrorists waltz out of  prison, and incentivize others to challenge an America that looked  cowardly.   Its hesitating, indecisive, self-deterred approach to helping Ukraine  before Putin invaded and in the earliest days right afterwards left  freedom's friends flat-footed and are making the substantive fight more  difficult than it ever had to be.   And now the Biden administration apparently has pivoted from chasing  another bad nuclear deal with Iran to trying to let terrorists out of  Guantanamo Bay.   These are just some of the reasons why 41 percent of Americans say  the state of our union is weak--weak--and only 13 percent say it is  strong.   Of course, this administration has also created problems for American  families closer to home. A nationwide poll published last week revealed  that just 16 percent of Americans say they are in a better financial  situation today than they were 2 years ago when the President and his  party assumed total control of government.   For 84 percent of Americans, one-party Democratic control of  Washington either failed to live up to its promises or actively made  life worse. Two years ago, over the objections of their own party's top  economists, Washington Democrats misinterpreted a narrow election  victory as a mandate for an unprecedented spending spree.   When President Biden took office, inflation was at 1.4 percent. From  Inauguration Day to today, inflation is over 13 percent.   Working families have seen grocery prices jump 18.6 percent, used car  prices rise 26.2 percent, and energy prices soar by 33.9 percent.  Millions--millions--of Americans have earned pay raises at work, but  runaway inflation has left them with less purchasing power than before.   Our southern border is in crisis, shattering all-time records for  illegal immigrant apprehensions. Streets and neighborhoods are being  swallowed up by violent crime--after local Democrats have cut police  budgets, liberal prosecutors have turned jails into revolving doors,  and national Democrats spent years amplifying the kinds of anti-police  rhetoric that result in more crime.   And President Biden is helping the radical left go on offense and  bring a culture war to the doorsteps of normal American families-- trying to squeeze Catholic hospitals and faith-based daycares out of  business; trying to take school choice and curriculum transparency away  from parents--and on and on and on.   President Biden campaigned on being the adult in the room. But he is  not even calling the shots in his own party. Over and over on issue  after issue, this President hands the car keys to the radical left and  turned himself into a passenger. That is why working families across  the country have voted for change.   They elected a Republican majority in the House of Representatives to  put the emergency brakes on runaway liberal spending. They reelected  all-star Republican governors in places like Texas, Georgia, and  Florida. And they elevated a talented new generation of leaders,  including the youngest serving governor in America--Governor Sanders of  Arkansas--whom the American people will hear from tonight.   Our country may still be struggling to understand what on earth  Washington Democrats think they have actually accomplished in the past  2 years. But they can be absolutely sure where Republicans stand.                            ____________________     I suggest the absence of a quorum.
