 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize National Charter  School Week, during which we celebrate the work that charter schools  are doing to expand education freedom and help students thrive in an  environment that fits their needs.   Gone are the days of one-size-fits-all education solutions. The  COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the flaws of rigid learning systems.  Millions of students were trapped in failing school districts simply  because of their ZIP Code.   Now, parents are waking up and making their choices heard. Education  freedom is the future.   Charter schools offer students an alternative pathway that provides  access to high-quality education options that would otherwise be  unavailable.   As the chairwoman of the Committee on Education and the Workforce, I  will continue to advocate for educational pathways like charter schools  that put students, not politics, first.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from California for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize Marcus Smith, who is the president  and CEO of Speedway Motorsports and the owner of the North Wilkesboro  Speedway.   Marcus and his family have helped lead the charge to restore the 75- year-old racetrack so that countless racing enthusiasts can experience  and celebrate the history of stock car racing.   The entire Wilkes County community is buzzing with anticipation over  the upcoming NASCAR All-Star Race which will be hosted at the North  Wilkesboro Speedway on May 21.   Thanks to the dedication of Marcus and his family in seeing this  project through to fruition, a piece of North Carolina's history is  back in the spotlight for the entire country to see.   This is no small feat, Mr. Speaker.   Congratulations to Marcus Smith and the Smith family on this  monumental accomplishment.                          Recognizing Terri Parsons     Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize Terri Parsons, an  exemplary North Carolinian and someone who has played an important role  in restoring a piece of our State's rich history.   Thanks to Terri's staunch advocacy and support, the North Wilkesboro  Speedway will be hosting the 2023 NASCAR All-Star Race on May 21.   Benny Parson, Terri's late husband and a NASCAR Hall of Famer was  very fond of the North Wilkesboro Speedway. His dying wish was to have  NASCAR return to Wilkes County and to this historic location.   Mr. Speaker, his wish has come true.  [[Page H2156]]    Terri has made the Wilkes County community and all of North Carolina  incredibly proud through her continued work. I congratulate Terri on  this magnificent accomplishment.                 Freedom Must Be Handed Down to Our Children     Mr. Speaker, the National Assessment of Educational  Progress recently revealed that history and civics scores among  students hit record lows. The scores are staggering.   Eighty-seven percent of eighth graders have a basic or below basic  knowledge of American history while only 2 out of 10 of those students  are proficient in civics.   For a decade, we have watched these scores decline. The culprit isn't  a singular event but a culture shift where an ideology-charged  curriculum is rapidly replacing a core understanding of our Nation's  history and our role in it.   Our past matters--the good and the bad. Our civic responsibility  matters. It is the duty every one of us holds. The moment we neglect  these truths from textbooks or classroom discussions is the day America  is no longer free.   Ronald Reagan said that freedom is never more than one generation  from extinction. We did not pass it to our children in the bloodstream.  It must be fought for, protected, and handed on for them to do the  same.   There are no easy solutions to address this problem.   We stand at a crossroads where there are two competing visions for  America: one is predicated on tearing down the pillars that built  America, and one is based on the principles of the Constitution and the  Declaration of Independence.   I stand firmly with the vision of the latter.   Unfortunately, the Biden administration stands with the vision of the  former.   They recently proposed to hijack the Federal American history and  civics grant program to redirect those efforts toward the left's  indoctrination agenda.   We must stand against this radical vision. America is more than a  nation. It represents freedom--an ideal that countless generations  protected and often died for.   These abysmal test scores reflect what happens when we allow  ideologically charged indoctrination to trump basic instruction in our  Nation's history.   We can and must do better. We owe it to those who came before us, we  owe it to those who will come after us, and we owe it to every person  around the world who looks at America as that shining city on a hill--a  beacon of freedom for all.   Let us not take our great Republic for granted.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Kiley for yielding.
