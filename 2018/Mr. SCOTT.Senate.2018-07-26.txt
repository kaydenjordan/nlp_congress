 Mr. President, today I wish to honor SFC Christopher A.  Celiz, who was fatally wounded while conducting operations in support  of a medical evacuation landing zone in Afghanistan last week. Sergeant  First Class Celiz was a Summerville, SC, native and attended the  Citadel before enlisting in the Army, where he subsequently served five  deployments, including Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring  Freedom. Sergeant First Class Celiz was serving as a battalion mortar  platoon sergeant and supporting Operation Freedom's Sentinel when he  sustained fatal wounds and passed away on July 12.   Sergeant First Class Celiz served this country with the utmost  courage and commitment, and his service and sacrifice will never be  forgotten. I ask that he be honored today, and share my deepest  condolences with all of those who knew and loved Sergeant First Class  Celiz.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I would like to recognize South  Carolina native, Maj. Charles D. Hodges for his exceptional service and  bravery in his recent military support efforts in the Thailand cave  rescues. Major Hodges is a U.S. mission commander for the Air Force's  353rd Special Operations unit and led his team of U.S. support in  rescuing 12 young Thai boys and their coach trapped in a network of  caves. With his support and the hard work and bravery of so many  military personnel, all 13 were all rescued safely on Tuesday.   South Carolina and I are very proud to call Major Hodges one of our  own.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I would like to acknowledge Mr. Dan  Walters of Greenwood, SC, for his dedication and willingness to provide  children without families a home of love and support for over 15 years  and congratulate him on receiving the 2018 Angels in Adoption award.   Mr. Walters has truly opened up his heart and home through his  exceptional service for children in the foster care system. Since  entering the foster care program, Mr. Walters has fostered 15 children,  provided long-term care for three children, and also adopted one child.  I had the pleasure of working with one of those children through my  internship program, and he credits Mr. Walters for giving him a  ``second chance at life.'' He truly has made an incredible difference  in the lives of many foster youth.   Aside from being a foster parent, Mr. Walters is also an engaged  member of the community as a businessowner, active Rotarian, and deacon  at Connie Maxwell Baptist Church.   Mr. Walters is an outstanding example of a foster parent, and I  applaud him on his continued commitment and compassion towards helping  foster care children. He truly has been an ``angel in adoption,'' and I  congratulate him on this special recognition.                            ____________________
