 Madam Speaker, last week I officially completed my 39  county tour for 2021, visiting all 39 counties at least twice so far  this year. Whether it was speaking to farmers, manufacturers, Main  Street business owners, families, educators, or students, I have  enjoyed listening to folks all through the Fourth District.   I heard from folks across the district concerned with reckless  spending, especially the Democrats' $3.5 trillion tax and spending  spree.   In Palo Alto County I met a sixth-generation farmer who was concerned  President Biden's plan to eliminate stepped-up basis would threaten his  family farm. I heard this concern everywhere I went, which is why I  have fought so hard to put a stop to this supercharged death tax.   I will continue to be a passionate advocate for the Fourth District,  especially when it comes to defending the men and women who feed and  fuel the world.                            ____________________
