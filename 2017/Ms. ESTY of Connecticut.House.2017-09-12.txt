 Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this  amendment to increase funding for the Manufacturing Extension  Partnership, the MEP program. This amendment would restore $5 million  to MEP, which has helped U.S. manufacturers create and retain good jobs  in Connecticut and in every State in the country over nearly 30 years.   Connecticut's MEP, the Connecticut State Technical Extension Program,  or CONNSTEP, works with facilities in Connecticut advising them on ways  to grow their businesses. And thanks to partnerships with CONNSTEP, in  my district alone, Metallon in Thomaston has increased new sales by  nearly a half a million dollars, Metallurgical Processing in New  Britain increased production by 20 percent, and RTR Technologies in  Canaan increased sales by $6 million.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to restore funding to MEP by $5  million, because passing a budget that grows the economy and retains  and brings good jobs to our communities is exactly what we were sent to  Washington, D.C., to do.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support Representative Torres'  amendment.
