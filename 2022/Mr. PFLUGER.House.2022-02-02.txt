 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss, unfortunately, yet  another crisis. When Russia invaded the Ukraine in 2014, I was actually  an Active Duty Air Force officer stationed in Europe in NATO. Assigned  to a NATO unit, I saw this firsthand. This is much different.   I just returned from Kyiv where we met with many Ukrainian officials,  including the President, the Foreign Minister, and the Defense  Minister. While there, we heard a message that was loud and clear.  Vladimir Putin is acting now because he senses an environment of  weakness. Weakness from this administration in the approach to energy,  in their countless failures, including the most tragic of all, the  Afghanistan evacuation, and then the lack of overall commitment to law  and order, which can be seen so many places, including our southern  border.   All these failures have created this environment of weakness that  Putin is now acting on. To make matters worse, European countries are  completely beholden and dependent upon Russia for their energy. Over 40  percent of the energy flow is coming from Russia.   Ukrainian officials told me directly that without Nord Stream II,  Russia would not be acting out today. This was told to a bipartisan  codel that heard this, both Republicans and Democrats alike.   Since the President took office, every policy failure he has steered  our country into has signaled not strength but weakness. The President  now promises to impose severe sanctions on Russia should they invade  the Ukraine. This is not the way that deterrence works. Deterrence  happens every day; it happens in every policy action. It doesn't happen  after the fact.   Why would Russia expect the Biden administration to respect the  borders of the Ukraine when we refuse to secure our own borders here at  home? President Zelensky said this, ``Border security matters. I will  defend the Ukrainian borders.'' We need a President who is strong, who  will not only protect the United States, but also will send a clear  message to our allies and partners abroad that law and order will  stand, that sovereign borders will be protected.   We need an administration that is capable of standing up to our  adversaries. As I said before in this Chamber, we need a President who  will choose Midland over Moscow. If President Biden is not going to  take action, Congress must. I will be working to impose strong  sanctions on the Nord Stream pipeline.   Energy security is national security. The Ukrainian people understand  this, the European continent understands this, and the Russians now  have a stranglehold on Europe by imposing their will with the Nord  Stream projects. We need Democrats and Republicans alike. We were  unified on this codel.   Mr. Speaker, I am asking my Democrat colleagues to understand the  severity of this problem. In 2022, we have a sovereign country that  could be invaded by an aggressor, that aggressor who has been  emboldened by an environment of weakness. We must stand strong. So many  people, including myself, have served overseas and have done the hard  work. It is well past time that we end these crises, that we show  strength in the face of an aggressor who would impose their will on the  rest of the world and change world order that that greatest generation  80 years ago fought for.   Now is not the time to back down. As Putin goes to China and stands  side-by-side with Xi Jinping in these Olympic Games and asks for his  blessing to invade a sovereign country, it is time for all of us to not  identify by our parties but to identify as Americans, to come together  and be strong on our actions.                             Honoring Diana Jones     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to offer my sincere  condolences to a public servant of Cresson, Texas. In August 2020, the  city of Cresson lost one of its bravest servants, Diana Jones.   Diana was an EMT, a member of the Cresson Volunteer Fire Department  for nearly 5 years, and often traveled to California, to the West  Coast, to offer her skills in firefighting. Tragically, Diana passed  away during one of these firefights.   Last month, the Cresson community voted to name the volunteer fire  department's training center the Diana Jones Memorial Training Center.  Now all who step foot through that door will feel the sacrifice and the  leadership that she has done in honoring her memory.   The Diana Jones Memorial Training Center will forever remind the  community of the example she set--learning to better one's self to  serve others. Her legacy is continued through her sons as well as the  Cresson community. We are proud to honor the life that she dedicated to  serving her community.                            ____________________
