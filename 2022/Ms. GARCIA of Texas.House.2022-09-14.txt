 Madam Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the  recent passage of the Inflation Reduction Act. My fellow colleagues,  yesterday, I joined many of my House Democrats alongside Democratic  President Biden as we celebrated the passage of this new law at the  White House.   During the White House visit, I kept thinking of the millions of  Americans this monumental law will help. I also kept thinking about the  Texans and constituents across my district who will benefit  significantly from the impact of this law. The Inflation Reduction Act  will lower families' costs with savings ranging from healthcare to  energy costs. But if we look closely, we see just how important and  lifesaving this law is. This law lowers prescription drug prices, like  insulin, which is critical, by finally giving Medicare the ability to  negotiate prices of prescription drugs--not just simply accept what Big  Pharma says but negotiate prices.   It also prevents greedy price hikes and caps out-of-pocket costs to  $2,000 to Medicare beneficiaries--capping out-of-pocket at $2,000.   Madam Speaker, for residents like those in my district, Texas' 29th  District, these savings can literally save lives.   My district is 77 percent Latino. Studies from the CDC show that  Latinos are 70 percent more likely than white non-Hispanics to be  diagnosed with diabetes, and they are 1.3 times more likely to die from  diabetes complications. On top of this, about 11 percent of Texans have  diabetes.   Shockingly, studies show that one in four diabetics in Texas have  rationed their insulin to make ends meet. They are literally putting  themselves at risk of death and more complications because of the price  of insulin.   Let's just let that sink in, Madam Speaker. One in four diabetics  ration a lifesaving drug simply because the prices are high and because  our country has higher prescription drug prices than any other  developed country in the world.   This simply breaks my heart. It is tough to think about this because  this issue also does hit very close to home. I know all too well people  who have family members that are suffering from diabetes. I know their  pain, and I know how it impacts their livelihoods and their  pocketbooks.   My mother faced uphill battles with diabetes before passing away from  complications due to diabetes.                                time  1015    Now, I am 1 of 10 children. Five of us are also affected by diabetes  and are on insulin, and a brother is on dialysis. So, I know firsthand  how important insulin is to one's health, and I can't fathom a country  where people can't afford this lifesaving drug.   While more must be done for those diabetic patients not on Medicare,  this law is a monumental, great step forward in making insulin  accessible to all. But I promise to keep fighting for those who are not  on Medicare, those who are not insured, and those who are too poor to  get access to insulin.   The Inflation Reduction Act also reduces the cost of health insurance  for millions by extending the Affordable Care Act subsidies for 3 more  years. This will lock in lower healthcare prices that will save 13  million people across our country an average of $800.   Now, $800 may not sound like a lot to some people, but in my district  and across America, hardworking families know the value of $800. In my  district, Madam Speaker, there are about 55,000 people who are enrolled  in health insurance plans through the Affordable Care Act. That is  about $800 for these Texas families to use for school supplies, for  food, for gas, and for other basic necessities.   So, the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act is a massive victory  for the people in my district and districts across America.   This is what happens when we have strong leadership in the White  House and when House Democrats work together, because they put people  first.   Madam Speaker, it is all about putting people first.                            ____________________
