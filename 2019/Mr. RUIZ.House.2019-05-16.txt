 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor Seymour Kaplan, known  as Sy, a local hero and World War II veteran who passed away on April  19 at the age of 95.   Sy was born on February 28, 1924, to Morris and Fannie Kaplan. At  just 17 years old, Sy enlisted in the U.S.  [[Page H3847]]  Army--17--and, boy, was his father mad. But from a young age, Sy didn't  let anything get in the way of serving others.   During World War II, Sy served this country bravely in the 2nd Army  2nd Corps Division under General George S. Patton.   Sy fought for 3 years, advancing through Italy, France, and Germany.  Sy was severely wounded while building a bridge to cross the Rhine  River into Germany. For his heroism, Sy earned three Battle Stars and  two Purple Hearts.   But Sy's service to our Nation did not end with his military service.  Sy was a lifelong advocate for our local veterans. For 25 years, Sy  served as the commander of the Disabled American Veterans Chapter 78 in  the Coachella Valley. His leadership helped countless veterans find  healing, community, and a sense of purpose. Over the years, Sy also  helped many homeless veterans find homes and jobs. Sy would show up to  every townhall, every event, and every community forum, always ready to  make his voice heard.   Shortly after I became a Member of Congress, I remember Sy knocking  on my door and asking: ``Who is this young guy? What does he know about  veterans?''   I sat down with Sy, and I immediately recognized his expertise and,  more importantly, his heart. That is why I asked Sy to serve on my  veterans advisory board and help my office connect veterans with the  healthcare and benefits they have earned and deserve.   Sy said: ``Hell, yeah. Let's do this.''   When Sy came to our meetings, he would often bring along a veteran in  need, and before we started the day's agenda, Sy would give that  veteran the space to tell their story. That was Sy Kaplan: a devoted  advocate who recognized that good leaders also have to be good  listeners.   Sy became one of the visionaries behind Veterans University, my  annual event to connect veterans with local and Federal resources.  Among his many accomplishments, Sy was instrumental in bringing the  Palm Desert VA Clinic to the Coachella Valley. Sy would often visit the  clinic to, in his own words: ``Make darn sure all of my vets from the  Coachella Valley are getting good care.''   Last year, it was my honor to present Sy with the Shirley Powell  award in recognition of his service to local veterans in our  communities. I looked to Sy as a trusted adviser and a dear, dear  friend.   Sy was preceded in death by his beloved wife, Doris, and his daughter  Ellen. He is survived by his daughter Ilona and a loving community  grateful for his leadership and compassion.   I will always remember Sy's blue Disabled Veterans of America shirt,  his baseball cap, his energy, and his infectious smile. In Sy's honor,  let's make ``darn sure,'' as he would say, that we carry his memory in  our hearts.                            ____________________
