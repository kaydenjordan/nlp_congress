 Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I rise in opposition to H.R. 2936, the so-called Resilient Federal  Forests Act of 2017. Perhaps a better name would be the ``Log America's  Forest Act of 2017.''   But before I address the many concerns with the underlying bill, I  must commend my colleagues across the aisle for attempting to deal with  the biggest barrier to improved management of our national forests: the  enormous cost and impact of wildfire suppression on the Forest Service  budget.   Over 50 percent of the Forest Service budget is eaten up by wildfire,  and if things don't change, the agency predicts that it will increase  to two-thirds in just 5 years. Unfortunately, the budget fix in this  bill falls short.   First, it requires Congress to appropriate an amount equal to the 10- year average before emergency funding is available. We know that  climate change results in longer and more intense wildfire seasons,  making the 10-year average irrelevant to the ever-increasing need for  funding. Because the average is too low, the real number will keep  growing, meaning the amount of funding that must be taken from the  Forest Service accounts will continue to grow. Fighting fires will  continue squeezing out money for the active management my Republican  colleagues are so eager to prioritize.   Second, requiring the President to declare each fire a national  emergency before releasing funds is unnecessarily bureaucratic and  could delay emergency operations.   We need a holistic fix for the wildfire budget that makes money  available in advance of a critical emergency, but Republicans would  rather play politics with fire to undermine environmental safeguards.   This is not the first time we have seen the bill, this piece of  legislation. House Republicans sent a version to the Senate in the  113th and the 114th Congresses, where it languished on the shelf  because our colleagues on the other side of the Capitol found it too  extreme.   Rather than view that experience as an opportunity to seek compromise  this time around, today we are considering a bill that is even more  extreme and polarizing. They doubled the environmental review waivers,  added language to undermine the Endangered Species Act, and scaled back  protections for national monuments and roadless areas.   We are told that this is all in the name of decreasing wildfire risk  and protecting communities. The truth is that it is just more of the  same from House Republicans who will look for any excuse to advance  their extraction-above-all agenda.   Wildfires are a huge problem in this country due, in large part, to  climate change, something this bill ignores. By the way, they are  becoming more frequent and more intense, and they pose a growing threat  to public safety and local communities.   This bill is not about forest health or wildfire mitigation. It is  about increasing the number of trees removed from our forests.  Republicans would rather scare us into weakening environmental  safeguards than work on a possible bipartisan solution to wildfire  management.  [[Page H8334]]    A serious proposal would recognize the Forest Service and the  Department of the Interior have ample authority within current law to  conduct fire treatment on our public lands. In fact, the 2009  Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program, established the  last time Democrats controlled the House, has resulted in the treatment  of over 1.45 million acres of national forests to reduce the risk of  catastrophic fire and the improvement of over 1.33 million acres of  wildlife habitat.   In just 5 years, the program generated more than $661 million in  local labor income and an average of 4,300 jobs per year. The projects  have attracted new partners and strengthened community relationships,  leveraging over $76.1 million in partner matching funds. Collaborative  programs like this bring people to the table and result in more acres  treated, more local jobs, and more successful projects. Again, all of  this has taken place within the framework of the current law.   Increased funding for programs like Collaborative Forest Landscape  Restoration should be a priority for Republicans, but this program was  zeroed out by the Trump administration budget, and extreme proposals  like this bill chip away at the principal pillars of law that make  collaboration possible. Our constituents and our forests deserve  better.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Oregon (Mr. DeFazio).   Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, I remember, 13 years ago, after another  spate of catastrophic fires in the Western United States, we came  together in a truly bipartisan fashion and passed something called the  Healthy Forests Restoration Act. It authorized up to 20 million acres  to be treated to remove  [[Page H8336]]  hazard fuels in what is called the WUI, the wildland-urban interface,  and in threats to municipal water supplies. We also authorized $760  million a year.   Well, it has been 13 years. We authorized 20 million acres of work.  What has been done? 2\1/2\ million.   Is it because of litigation, lawsuits, or, you know, obstruction? No.  It is because of this body, the United States Congress, which is  refusing to put up the money to do the work.   In my State alone, there are 1.8 million acres waiting for treatment.  They have gone through all environmental reviews. There is no potential  for litigation or any other blocking, but they don't have the money.   Does this bill fix that? No. We are addressing problems that don't  exist in terms of addressing the wildfire problem.   This is really, you know, kind of a lost opportunity, a missed  opportunity. Yes, it does a partial fix of the wildfire borrowing,  which devastates the Forest Service every year. I appreciate that. But  the fact is, we have got 44 million homes that are now at risk in terms  of wildland-urban interface, and we have only treated 2\1/2\ million  acres because this Congress isn't putting up the money.                                time  1600    And this year, yet again, they are proposing like one-half of what we  authorized. What does one-half get you? It gets you half the acreage.   So if we had appropriated at the levels we authorized over the last  13 years, they would have treated 5 or 6 million acres. Again, they  weren't blocked by litigation. They weren't blocked by appeals. The  HFRA Act became virtually noncontroversial because it didn't do away  with judicial review, which this bill will do on a certain number of  projects in each region every year.   I wish that this was a bipartisan approach, it isn't, and I cannot  support the legislation.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. McEachin).   Mr. McEACHIN. Mr. Chairman, I thank the ranking member for yielding.   Mr. Chairman, the goal of forest management should be to make our  forests more resilient--more resilient to the impacts of climate  change, drought, and wildlife--but contrary to its title, H.R. 2936,  the so-called Resilient Federal Forests Act of 2017, does not achieve  these goals.   This bill includes exemptions from analyses required under the  National Environmental Policy Act, restricts judicial review of certain  forest management activities, amends the Equal Access to Justice Act to  limit payment of attorneys' fees, and scales back the wildlife  conservation efforts of the Endangered Species Act.   Mr. Chairman, this bill desperately needs improvement, and I am  disappointed that my commonsense amendment--offered both in committee  and again to Rules, this time with my colleague, Mr. Beyer from  Virginia--is not being considered by the House.   My amendment would have struck two sections of this bill that are  designed to allow approval of timber projects without adequate  consideration of the impacts to some of the most vulnerable living  creatures on Earth: those listed as threatened or endangered under the  Endangered Species Act.   The first offending section would put the U.S. Fish and Wildlife  Service on a 90-day shot clock to complete consultations required under  section 7 of the ESA. Such a provision is both unnecessary and deeply  harmful.   The second section my amendment would have struck is designed to  prevent ESA consultation from happening altogether when FWS lists a new  species or designates critical habitat for a listed species. This  simply defies logic.   Getting ESA consultation right--and ensuring that it happens in the  first place--is a small price to pay for preserving irreplaceable parts  of our natural heritage.   Mr. Chairman, H.R. 2936 attacks responsible forest management policy  and promotes commercial logging at the expense of sound environmental  review.   Instead of giving gifts to special interests, Congress should be  addressing the effects of climate change, working to reduce the risk of  wildfire, and fixing the wildfire budget.   Mr. Chairman, this bill takes us many steps in the wrong direction,  and I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''    Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from California (Mr. Huffman).    Mr. Chairman, may I inquire how much time is remaining  on both sides.   The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Williams). The gentleman from Arizona has 3  minutes remaining. The gentleman from Utah has 5 minutes remaining.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   As we have talked about H.R. 2936, this is something that has been  before two previous Congresses and went nowhere; and as a consequence,  we continue to not confront the issue of appropriate and necessary  funding for the Forest Service to conduct wildfire suppression. That is  the gap in this. This flawed attempt to try to fix the funding issue  does not.   In fact, Congress has provided appropriate tools to conduct  restoration, reduce hazardous fuels, and restore ecological balance on  national forest and public lands.   Congress should fix the wildfire budget--that is the issue--not use  this as leverage to subsidize the timber industry and also overturn  essential environmental laws.   This legislation has an attack on NEPA, has an attack on the  Endangered Species Act, has an attack on judicial review and access to  justice, has an attack on the Antiquities Act, and continues the  process of fire borrowing.   H.R. 2936 is not about forest health or reducing wildfire risk. It is  intended to make it easier to advance commercial logging and sales on  our national forests and public lands.   A flawed attempt to fix the wildfire funding problem, it does nothing  to change the anti-environmental provisions in the underlying bill.   We have a serious issue, validated because of all the studies that  have been done, including GAO, which found that climate change is a  contributor, scientists have found that climate change is a  contributor. That is not discussed because that is a hoax, my  Republican colleagues say, created by the Chinese. So we will not talk  about climate change as a major factor, which it is, to the increasing  intensity and length of wildfires across our public lands and across  private and State lands as well.   This legislation is about undermining environmental law. It does  nothing about the funding necessary to fight wildfires in this country.  It does nothing about involving the stakeholders in proactive  restoration and reducing the threat of wildfire in this country.   Mr. Chair, I urge a ``no'' vote on H.R. 2936, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Arizona is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Arizona is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment doubles down on the bad  ideas that are in the underlying bill. The 150,000 acre categorical  exclusion to remove timber from Gila, Lincoln, and Cibola National  Forests has the potential to do more harm than good, and cuts the  American public out of the decisionmaking process.   The Forest Service doesn't need this waiver to harvest trees in New  Mexico. Last year, the Cibola produced 12,000 metric board feet, and  Lincoln and Gila each between 5,000 and 6,000 metric board feet. These  are average production numbers across the region.   So I am not sure what problem this amendment is trying to address or  how exempting 150,000-acre projects from the environmental review helps  the Forest Service meet their mandate of protecting habitat,  watersheds, and providing recreational opportunities.   This amendment also exempts the Forest Service from the consultation  requirements and the Endangered Species Act. Logging projects  untethered from the bedrock environmental protections could potentially  impact several species which depend on these forests for habitat,  including the Mexican spotted owl and the Gila trout.   Active forest management is not a bad thing if it is done  responsibly. If NEPA and the Endangered Species Act are followed, we  get good projects, safe habitat restoration--not clear-cutting and loss  of critical habitat. Unfortunately, this amendment undermines both of  these fundamental laws and should be rejected.   Mr. Chair, I urge a ``no'' vote on the amendment, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, this amendment would not resolve the issue  that my friend from New Mexico has just brought up. The Statement of  Administrative Policy from the executive branch raises the concerns of  H.R. 2936 and of the land management reforms, which are in the  legislation.   It says: ``The administration, however, has concerns about the  legislation's revision to the Stafford Act, which would force  competition for funding between wildfires on Federal land and other  disasters already covered by the Stafford Act, including hurricanes.''   It also says that the legislation doesn't really address the issue of  fire borrowing, which is central to dealing effectively and proactively  with wildfires, both prevention, and suppression, as the resource is  needed.   Mr. Chairman, I include in the Record the Statement of Administrative  Policy by the Trump administration. I also include another Statement of  Administrative Policy dated July 8, 2015, which is on the same  legislation, but by then-President Obama, which mirrors and reflects  the same concerns brought up by the executive branch of President  Trump.                     Statement of Administration Policy   h.r. 293--resilient federal forests act of 2017--rep. westerman, r-ar,                             and 18 cosponsors         The Administration strongly believes that funding for       wildland fire management must be addressed in order to enable       the Forest Service and the Department of the Interior to       better manage the Nation's forests and other public lands.       The Administration's second disaster funding request,       submitted to Congress on October 4, 2017, underscored this       belief. The request also noted the Administration's belief       that land management reforms are critical to solving the       problem of ``fire borrowing''--taking funds from forest       management programs to cover fire costs that exceed       appropriations--in a comprehensive manner, rather than       through a funding-only approach.        The Administration appreciates the intent of H.R. 2936, the       Resilient Federal Forests Act of 2017, and is supportive of       land management reforms like those outlined in the       legislation. The Administration, however, has concerns about       the legislation's revisions to the Stafford Act, which would       force competition for funding between wildfires on Federal       land and other disasters already covered by the Stafford Act,       including hurricanes.      Wildland Fire Management Funding        Last year, Federal wildfire suppression spending reached       $2.9 billion, an amount that signals clearly the need for       Congress to address the rising cost of fire suppression       operations. The dependence on ``fire borrowing'' to cover       funding shortfalls in times of severe wildfire impedes the       missions of our land management agencies, including by taking       critical funding from programs that help reduce the risk of       catastrophic fire, restore and maintain healthy functioning       ecosystems, and yield timber production.        The Administration, however, has concerns with re-purposing       the Stafford Act to address wildfires. The purpose of the       Stafford Act is to assist State, local, tribal, and       territorial (SLTT) governments that become overwhelmed when       responding to and recovering from natural disasters affecting       their jurisdictions. H.R. 2936 would modify the Stafford Act       by creating a new type of disaster declaration to address the       cost of wildfire suppression on Federal land, thereby       changing long-standing principles governing Federal support       to SLTT governments. As we have seen in this year's historic       Atlantic hurricane season, the Federal Emergency Management       Agency (FEMA) must continue to be focused on its existing       mission, and the Stafford Act's Disaster Relief Fund must       remain dedicated solely to that mission.        Instead of the approach outlined in H.R. 2936, the       Administration supports a separate, annual cap adjustment for       wildfire suppression operations, which will resolve concerns       about the sufficiency of funds for wildfire suppression and       avoid unnecessary competition for Stafford Act funds.      Improving Forest Management        The Administration appreciates H.R. 2936's recognition that       fixing the funding component of fire borrowing will not, on       its own, stop the worsening trend of catastrophic wildfires.       Meaningful forest management reforms to strengthen our       ability to restore the Nation's forests and improve their       resilience to destructive wildfires must be a part  [[Page H8356]]       of any permanent solution. H.R. 2936's provisions that       expedite environmental approval for proactive forest       management, including hazardous fuel reduction and post-fire       timber salvage and reforestation actions, are important steps       forward. The Administration supports and will continue to       work with Congress on the details of the forest management       reform proposals.        Although the Administration has concerns with H.R. 2936's       modifications to the Stafford Act, the Administration will       continue working with Congress to enact a sustainable       solution to ``fire borrowing'' that does not adversely affect       FEMA's critical disaster relief funding and that recognizes       the need for a comprehensive solution to the problem of       wildfires.                                   ____                      Statement of Administration Policy   h.r. 2647--resilient federal forests act of 2015--rep. westerman, r-ar,                             and 13 cosponsors         The Administration strongly opposes H.R. 2647. The most       important step Congress can take to increase the pace and       scale of forest restoration and management of the national       forests and Department of the Interior (DOI) lands is to fix       fire suppression funding and provide additional capacity for       the Forest Service and DOI to manage the Nation's forests and       other public lands. H.R. 2647 falls short of fixing the fire       budget problem and contains other provisions that will       undermine collaborative forest restoration, environmental       safeguards, and public participation across the National       Forest System and public lands.      Wildland Fire Management Funding        The Administration appreciates that there is bipartisan       agreement that wildland fire management funding needs a       legislative fix. The reasons are clear: in fiscal year (FY)       1995, the Forest Service in the Department of Agriculture       (USDA) spent 16 percent of its budget on firefighting. Today       the agency spends more than half of its budget on fire       management activities. This fundamentally impedes its       missions, including taking critical funding from programs       that help reduce the risk of catastrophic fire, maintain       healthy functioning ecosystems, and yield timber production.        The wildland fire funding fix in the President's FY 2016       Budget provides the necessary resources for the Forest       Service as well as DOI to address wildland fire suppression       and rehabilitation needs without resorting to detrimental       transfers from other critical forest landscape resilience       priorities. Under this fix, which includes a discretionary       budget cap adjustment, the Forest Service and DOI could tap       disaster funds once they spend 70 percent of their 10-year       average of suppression spending, which is the amount of       suppression funding requested within the discretionary budget       caps. Providing this certainty would preserve critical       resources for hazardous fuel reduction and other essential       landscape restoration projects, allowing for more acres to be       treated, and thereby reducing the risk of fire, and the       degree of fire destruction.        The Administration's proposal would immediately increase       the Forest Service's capacity to plan and execute restoration       projects--including the FY 2016 Budget projection for timber       volume sold from 2.9 billion board feet in FY 2014 to 3.2       billion board feet.        In contrast, the requirement in H.R. 2647 to fully fund the       ten-year average for wildland fire suppression would mean       that less funding is available each year in the agencies'       budgets for restoration and risk reduction programs as it is       diverted to the ever-increasing ten-year average.        Additionally, the bill repurposes the Stafford Act. The       purpose of the Stafford Act is to provide Federal assistance       to State, local, and tribal governments to alleviate disaster       suffering and facilitate recovery. This bill would instead       establish a sub-account within the Department of Homeland       Security's Federal Emergency Management Agency's Disaster       Relief Fund (DRF) to provide funding for USDA and DOI to       perform wildland fire suppression operations on Federal land       when suppression funding is exhausted and the President has       issued a disaster declaration for such fires. A proposed sub-      account under the DRF should not be used to redirect DRF       resources in support of non-Stafford responsibilities or to       circumvent existing major disaster declarations processes.      Undermining Fundamental Environmental Safeguards        The Administration takes seriously the management of       Federal lands consistent with the principles of multiple-use       and sustained-yield that are fundamental to the National       Forest Management Act and the Federal Land Management and       Policy Act and in accordance with long-standing environmental       laws including the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA),       the Clean Water Act, and the Endangered Species Act, among       others. Application of these environmental laws ensures that       management activities recognize the economic benefits of       Federal lands and the wide range of goods and services that       these lands produce.        At the President's direction, Federal agencies, like the       Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management, are working       diligently to promote efficiencies in the permitting and land       management process. For example, the Forest Service has       established additional categorical exclusions for restoration       work, has expanded the use of focused environmental       assessments, is using adaptive management to allow decisions       to last longer, and is better training employees to take       advantage of new efficiencies. The Forest Service is also       developing new approaches in the wake of catastrophic fires,       such as the response to the Rim Fire, which burned 257,000       acres in the summer of 2013, in which the Stanislaus National       Forest finalized its NEPA work for restoration and salvage in       one year. The Forest Service is also developing projects       across larger areas, thereby utilizing efficiencies and       providing a longer term and more certain timber supply for       local mills. For example, the Black Hills National Forest is       implementing a landscape scale approach across 200,000 acres       for treating current and future pine beetle outbreaks.        H.R. 2647 includes several provisions that will undermine       collaborative, landscape-scale forest restoration by       undermining public trust in forest management projects and by       limiting public participation in decision-making. The       Administration has substantial concerns with the design and       scale of the categorical exclusions, provisions related to       post-fire salvage and restoration (including unrealistic       timelines for environmental assessments), and unrealistic       targets for reforestation given current budgetary resources.        The Administration has serious concerns with provisions in       the bill related to the Resources Advisory Committees (RACs).       The Administration opposes provisions that limit the       discretion of RACs by requiring 50 percent of Secure Rural       Schools Act Title II funding be spent on timber management       projects. H.R. 2647 also assumes RACs can fulfill the role of       local forest collaboratives in designing forest restoration       projects, though the RACs were not specially set up to do       this and in many cases may not have the breadth of       stakeholder interest and expertise to do so effectively.       Additionally, the Administration opposes restrictions in the       bill on the membership of RACs.        Furthermore, the Administration opposes provisions in the       bill that require litigants to post a bond when challenging       forest restoration projects. As the Forest Service has       demonstrated, the best way to address concerns about       litigation is to develop restoration projects in partnership       with broad stakeholder interests through a transparent       process informed by the best available science. Lastly, the       bill should include stronger protections for ecologically       sensitive areas, tribal sacred sites, and other important       lands.        For the reasons set forth above, the Administration       strongly opposes H.R. 2647. The Administration looks forward       to continued engagement with Congress to address forest       management issues, which must begin by providing the Forest       Service and DOI with a comprehensive fix to the fire budget       problem.
