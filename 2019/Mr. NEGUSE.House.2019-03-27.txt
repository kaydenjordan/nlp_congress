 Madam Speaker, today, I want to share the story of a  family in my district. In 2015, the Cerrato family was in the NICU,  fighting for the life of their son Ethan. At just 10 days old, he had  undergone two major surgeries, had been the subject of dozens of  procedures, and had spent the first days of his life traumatized and  struggling through pain.   After only 10 days, the Cerrato family had accumulated a hospital  bill of over $250,000. While little Ethan was fighting for his life,  Christine and Matthew Cerrato were grappling with the thought of filing  for bankruptcy.   At this moment, the question became: What could they rely on? The  answer was the Affordable Care Act, which was passed into law this week  9 years ago.   Earlier this week, the Department of Justice called on the Federal  courts to overturn the ACA in its entirety, the latest attack from this  administration on the affordable healthcare of millions of families,  including many in my State of Colorado and in my district.    These relentless efforts to repeal this law would have harmful  impacts on families across the country, like the Cerrato family.   We cannot move backward on the progress we have made to provide  affordable healthcare to American families. Instead, we must move  forward to lower drug prices, to lower the cost of healthcare, and to  ensure that Colorado families and families all over America can get the  care they need.                            ____________________
