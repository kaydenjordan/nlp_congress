 Madam Speaker, I am voting ``no.''   Impeachment is not in the best interest of this country. In fact, it  has only deepened the partisan divide that truly plagues this country.   When the Sun comes up tomorrow, I pray with all my heart that the  anger and the division in this Chamber will give way to an  honorableness, a productivity, and a time of working together.
