 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this  time.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize someone we all know well, a  true American patriot, the Honorable Louise M. Slaughter. It is truly a  privilege to have introduced H.R. 7293 honoring Louise and her husband,  Bob Slaughter. It is particularly fitting to do so in the 115th  Congress, with so many colleagues who worked side by side with this  remarkable woman.   Louise loved Monroe County and everyone who called it home. Through  her dedicated work in public service, she made immeasurable  contributions to our region, our State, and our Nation.   That is why I am proud to sponsor this legislation to dedicate the  United States Post Office located at 770 Ayrault Road in Fairport to  Louise Slaughter and her devoted husband, Bob Slaughter.   The new Louise and Bob Slaughter Post Office Building, located in  their hometown just blocks from their house, will be a fitting tribute  to a truly remarkable couple.   On a personal note, it was Louise Slaughter who counseled me at a  young age and encouraged me to run for public office. Louise, Bob, and  their family remained dear friends for nearly 40 years.   Our entire community grieves her loss and misses her dearly, but  Louise left behind an incredible legacy that everyone in this room  witnessed firsthand.   She was the first and only woman to chair the Rules Committee of the  House. Louise was not only a fierce and influential legislator but a  true champion for those in our Nation in real need of champions.   From landmark healthcare legislation to education and infrastructure  projects that have strengthened our local and national economy, Louise  was a trailblazer who, with every success, shattered glass ceilings.   She was a friend, a colleague, a mentor, and a role model for so many  people, both in this room and in my community back home in Rochester,  New York. She and Bob Slaughter are more than deserving of this honor,  and I look forward to the day when the Louise and Bob Slaughter Post  Office is open for business to serve Fairport residents and honor their  memory.   I am grateful to my colleagues in the New York delegation who have  joined me in cosponsoring this legislation. Its widespread bipartisan  support is a testament to the profound impact Louise Slaughter has had  on all of us and will have on us all for many years to come.    Mr. Speaker, I regrettably missed the vote on S. 3191,  the Civil Rights Cold Case Records Collection Act, on Friday, December  21, 2018. I had intended to vote ``yes'' on rollcall vote No. 482.                             PERSONAL EXPLANATION
