 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2228) to provide support for law enforcement agency efforts  to protect the mental health and well-being of law enforcement  officers, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H. R. 2228         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Law Enforcement Mental       Health and Wellness Act of 2017''.       SEC. 2. SUPPORT FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES.         (a) Interagency Collaboration.--The Attorney General shall       consult with the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of       Veterans Affairs to submit to Congress a report, which shall       be made publicly available, on Department of Defense and       Department of Veterans Affairs mental health practices and       services that could be adopted by Federal, State, local, or       tribal law enforcement agencies.        (b) Case Studies.--The Director of the Office of Community       Oriented Policing Services shall submit to Congress a       report--        (1) that is similar to the report entitled ``Health,       Safety, and Wellness Program Case Studies in Law       Enforcement'' published by the Office of Community Oriented       Policing Services in 2015; and        (2) that focuses on case studies of programs designed       primarily to address officer psychological health and well-      being.        (c) Peer Mentoring Pilot Program.--Section 1701(b) of the       Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (34 U.S.C.       10381(b)) is amended--        (1) in paragraph (21), by striking ``; and'' and inserting       a semicolon;        (2) in paragraph (22), by striking the period at the end       and inserting ``; and''; and        (3) by adding at the end the following:        ``(23) to establish peer mentoring mental health and       wellness pilot programs within State, tribal, and local law       enforcement agencies.''.       SEC. 3. SUPPORT FOR MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDERS.         The Attorney General, in coordination with the Secretary of       Health and Human Services, shall develop resources to educate       mental health providers about the culture of Federal, State,       tribal, and local law enforcement agencies and evidence-based       therapies for mental health issues common to Federal, State,       local, and tribal law enforcement officers.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte) and the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson  Lee) each will control 20 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia.  [[Page H9450]]                                     General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and to include extraneous material on H.R. 2228, currently under  consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Virginia?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and to include extraneous material on H.R. 2228, currently under  consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Virginia?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Today we are voting on H.R. 2228, the Law Enforcement Mental Health  and Wellness Act. This bill is designed to equip local law enforcement  agencies with information and resources to address mental health  challenges faced by officers.   Our policemen and -women report for duty every day, facing and  responding to danger on our behalf. We often see them and we always  appreciate them. However, we often don't consider the mental aspect of  the challenges facing our officers who put themselves in harm's way to  protect our communities.   Today we consider the toll their jobs take on their psychological  well-being. Every day, these brave men and women face some of the  highest stress situations one can imagine. When officers hang up their  badges at the end of a shift, they cannot easily hang up the lingering  effects of their high-stakes encounters. As this stress accumulates, it  can lead to serious physical and mental health problems. Research has  shown time and again that police officer occupational stress is  directly correlated to heart disease, divorce, alcohol abuse, and major  psychological illnesses, including acute stress disorder, post- traumatic stress disorder, depression, and anxiety disorders.   Over 900,000 men and women serve as sworn law enforcement officers in  the United States. Each year, more of them die from suicide than from  gunfire and traffic accidents combined. Many departments have started  mental health programs as preventative measures. These programs have  been successful in reducing the number of police officer suicides from  300 in 1998 to 126 in 2012. But in departments where mental health and  wellness programs remain absent, these problems continue. We must  address this gap.   H.R. 2228 directs the Department of Justice, in consultation with the  Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs, to equip local law  enforcement agencies to address mental health challenges faced by  police officers. It also permits DOJ's Office of Community Oriented  Policing Services to award grants to peer mentoring pilot programs, and  it directs the Attorney General to make recommendations on how to make  these and other programs more effective.   Mr. Speaker, we all recognize the profound challenges faced by law  enforcement in this country. Today we also acknowledge the unseen toll  that these challenges can take on the health of these brave men and  women.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Mrs. Brooks from Indiana for introducing this  bill, and my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for this important  step in providing law enforcement agencies with the resources to treat  severe mental and physical stress. Our men and women in blue deserve  the appreciation and support of all of us.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I wish and hope that all of my colleagues and Americans  had a wonderful Thanksgiving.   I thank the men and women of the United States military for their  service. It is particularly noteworthy that they serve in this time  when families are gathered.   I thank Mr. Goodlatte for collaborating on this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2228, the Law Enforcement  Mental Health and Wellness Act of 2017. Ensuring the mental health and  well-being of our law enforcement officers is paramount to the safety  of our communities and the people our officers take a solemn oath to  protect.   I am also very pleased to acknowledge Val Demings, a colleague and a  member of the Homeland Security Committee, of which I serve. We are  better off for the experience, commitment, and professional career that  she had as a law enforcement officer and chief. She is one of the  cosponsors of this legislation and I look forward to hearing from her.   Let me also take note of the fact that Texas experienced a depth of  sadness over the holiday weekend when we lost one of our Department of  Public Safety officers, who was killed by a perpetrator during the  Thanksgiving weekend. We pray for him and his family.   H.R. 2228 is intended to provide support for law enforcement agency  efforts to protect the mental health and well-being of law enforcement  officers. I support this legislation as a good first step towards  Congress addressing the various matters surrounding the mental health  of our law enforcement officers.   We must recognize that law enforcement officers play a special role  in our communities, with exceptional responsibilities to protect and  serve where they see, encounter, and respond to horrendous situations  that are dangerous, stressful, and often life-threatening.   Imagine those officers who came upon that scene Sunday morning in  Texas a few weeks ago where 27 Texans were murdered in church and 20  were injured. Imagine churches that are frightened about worshipping.  Imagine, as I left my hometown Houston, that there were law enforcement  officers who were gathered to meet with pastors to give them comfort.  They are there for us.   As well, for example, law enforcement officers have had to respond to  several recent tragedies, which include the Pulse nightclub shooting in  Orlando, Florida, where 49 people were killed and 53 others were  wounded; the killing of 5 officers and the wounding of 9 other  officers, along with 2 civilians in Dallas, Texas; the San Bernardino,  California, shooting of 14 innocent employees; the Las Vegas, Nevada,  massacre, where a gunman killed 58 innocent concertgoers and injured  nearly 500 others; and, again, most recently, as I indicated, on  November 5, the deadliest mass shooting by an individual in Texas, the  fifth deadliest mass shooting in the United States, as well as the  deadliest shooting in an American place of worship in modern history,  where 26 were gunned down in Sutherland Springs, Texas, including an  18-month-old child, a pregnant mother, and where 20 others were  injured.    These horrific occurrences have become all too common in today's  society. These chilling tragedies continue to affect us all. Imagine  the impact that they have collectively on our law enforcement officers  with whom these traumatic situations remain long after the threats are  reduced. Everyone has returned home and communities they serve have  regained a renewed sense of safety.   Imagine that officer that comes upon a horrific traffic accident that  kills a family. Imagine their pain and their concern. Requiring these  officers to continue to serve without providing them an effective  avenue to process the day-to-day crisis does an injustice to them. That  is why this is a very important initiative and I am really excited to  support it.   I want to also raise for my colleagues that I have been a  longstanding advocate for helping police officers, as we have worked  together with the chairman of the committee and other members of the  committee.   I want to make mention of the Law Enforcement Trust and Integrity  Act, which takes a comprehensive approach to addressing policing  issues, including recognition of the importance of sustaining the  mental well-being of our officers.   This piece of legislation addresses tragedies where we have seen  actions take place. Countless unfortunate incidents have happened maybe  because of the lack of deescalation.                                time  1730    This bill, I hope we can move along, as this bill that we have, the  underlying bill, requires the Attorney General to perform an initial  analysis of existing law enforcement accreditation standards and to  recommend areas for development. That gives training, and it also takes  into account mental health needs and funding needs.  [[Page H9451]]    It authorizes the Attorney General to make grants to States, units of  local government, Indian tribal governments to study law enforcement  agency management and operations and to develop pilot programs to  implement best practices.   It requires the Attorney General to study the prevalence and impact  of any law, rule, or procedure that allows a law enforcement officer to  delay the answer to questions posed, as quickly as possible, by any of  the authorities investigating situations.   It authorizes appropriations for expenses related to criminal and  civil enforcement activities by the Civil Rights Division of the  Justice Department.   It requires the Department of Justice to establish a task force to  assist in local investigations, and it requires each Federal, State,  and local law enforcement agency to report to the Attorney General on  the actions in that particular department to help that department  assess its own work.   It requires the Department of Justice to cooperate with the National  Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund--something that was very  important to me--to create and provide a distinctive medallion to be  issued to the survivors of law enforcement officers killed in the line  of duty or memorialized on the National Law Enforcement Officers  Memorial.   This is in sync with the task force that was held in the last  administration that offered to discuss ways to improve policing and to  help our individual police officers.   We want to be partners for safety and security and community police  relations, and we want them to have good health and the ability to  serve the public in a good health mindset.   Under today's bill, the Attorney General shall review current mental  health practices and services of Federal agencies and report to  Congress, develop resources to educate mental healthcare providers  about the law enforcement culture across the board, and develop  evidence-based therapies as a result.   I believe this legislation and the Law Enforcement Integrity  Legislation, if passed, will create an atmosphere where law enforcement  officers will be comfortable in sharing their thoughts or their  assessments or best practices.   Under this bill, the underlying bill, the Director of Community  Oriented Policing Services shall conduct case studies that focuses on  programs designed primarily to address officer psychological health and  well-being and submit such a report to Congress.   The Attorney General shall also consult with the Secretary of  Homeland Security and the heads of Federal agencies to examine the  mental health needs of Federal law enforcement officers and the  efficacy of expanding peer mentoring programs; ensure the  recommendations, resources, or programs protect the privacy of  officers--that is extremely important--and report these findings to the  Congress no later than 1 year after enactment.   Mr. Speaker, the key to all of this is to build the trust between  community and police, the police community and the police families and  families of those who come within the range of law enforcement.   If we can all work together, we can trust each other, we will have a  better system of justice. This bill is a good first step, and I look  forward to working as well with other law enforcement bills, including  the Law Enforcement Integrity bill that I have just so noted.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2228, the ``Law Enforcement  Mental Health Act of 2017.'' Ensuring the mental health and well-being  of our law enforcement officers is paramount to the safety of our  communities and the people our officers take a solemn oath to protect.   H.R. 2228 is intended to provide support for law enforcement agency  efforts to protect the mental health and well-being of law enforcement  officers.   These horrific occurrences have become all-too common in today's  society. These chilling tragedies continue to affect us all. Imagine  the impact they have collectively on our law enforcement officers, with  whom these traumatic situations remain long after the threats are  reduced, everyone has returned home and communities they serve have  regained a renewed sense of safety.   Requiring these officers to continue to serve, without providing them  an effective avenue to process these day-to-day crises does an  injustice to them.   For example, law enforcement officers have had to respond to several  recent tragedies which include: the Pulse nightclub shooting in  Orlando, Florida, where 49 people were killed and 53 others wounded;  the killing of five officers and wounding of nine other officers along  with two civilians in Dallas, Texas; the San Bernardino shooting of 14  innocent employees; the Las Vegas massacre, where a gunman killed 58  innocent concert-goers and injured nearly 500 others; and again, most  recently on November 5, the deadliest mass shooting by an individual in  Texas, the fifth-deadliest mass shooting in the United States, as well  as the deadliest shooting in an American place of worship in modern  history, where 26 were gunned down in Sutherland Springs, including an  18-month-old child and a pregnant mother, and where 20 others were  injured.   This is why I have been a longstanding advocate for adoption of the  ``Law Enforcement Trust and Integrity Act,'' which takes a  comprehensive approach to addressing policing issues, including a  recognition of the importance of sustaining the mental well-being of  our officers.   This piece of legislation addresses the tragedies in some of our most  recent cases such as: Tamir Rice, Brown, Freddie Gray and Garner and  the countless others that do not receive publicity.   The bill provides seven substantive approaches towards improving law  enforcement management and misconduct prosecution tools:   (1) It requires the Attorney General to perform initial analysis of  existing law enforcement accreditation standards and to recommend areas  for development.   (2) It authorizes the Attorney General to make grants to States,  units of local government, Indian Tribal Governments, to study law  enforcement agency management and operations and to develop pilot  programs to implement best practices.   (3) It requires the Attorney General to study the prevalence and  impact of any law, rule or procedure that allows a law enforcement  officer to delay the answer to questions posed by a local internal  affairs officer, prosecutor, or review board on the investigative  integrity and prosecution of law enforcement misconduct.   (4) It authorizes appropriations for expenses related to criminal and  civil enforcement activities by the Civil Rights Division of the  Justice Department.   (5) It requires the Department of Justice to estabijsh a task force  to coordinate the investigation, prosecution and enforcement efforts of  Federal, state and local governments in cases related to law  enforcement misconduct.   (6) It requires each Federal, State, and local law enforcement agency  to report to the Attorney General data on the following: (1) traffic  violation stops; (2) pedestrian stops and detentions; and (3) the use  of deadly force by and against law enforcement officers.   (7) It requires the Department of Justice, in cooperation with the  National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund, to create and provide  a distinctive medallion to be issued to the survivors of law  enforcement officers killed in the line of duty or memorialized on the  National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial.   These are all measures similar in nature to those undertaken by the  Obama Task Force Initiative. In short, the Law Enforcement Integrity  and Trust Act would help law enforcement officers do their jobs,  knowing that they have our support. This is why it was endorsed by a  broad range of legal, community-based and law enforcement groups  nationwide.   Under today's bill, the Attorney General shall review current mental  health practices and services of Federal agencies and report to  Congress, develop resources to educate mental health care providers  about the law enforcement culture across the board, and develop  evidence-based therapies as a result.   Under this bill the Director of Community Oriented Policing Services  shall conduct case studies that focus on programs designed primarily to  address officers' psychological health and well-being and submit such  report to Congress.   I support this legislation as a good first step towards Congress  addressing the various matters surrounding the mental health of our law  enforcement officers.   We must recognize that law enforcement officers play a special role  in our communities, with exceptional responsibilities to protect and  serve, where they see, encounter, and respond to horrendous situations  that are both dangerous and stressful, and often life-threatening.   The Attorney General shall also consult with the Secretary of  Homeland Security and head of Federal agencies to examine the mental  health needs of Federal law enforcement officers and the efficacy of  expanding peer mentoring programs; ensure the recommendations,  resources, or programs protect the privacy of officers; and report  these findings to Congress no later than one year after enactment.   As this is a good first step, I support the bill and ask my  colleagues to do the same.  [[Page H9452]]    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to  the gentlewoman from Indiana (Mrs. Brooks), the chief sponsor of this  legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Nadler), a distinguished and senior member of the  Judiciary Committee, the chair of the Subcommittee on Courts,  Intellectual Property, and the Internet.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, again, let me thank the two prior  speakers, Congresswoman Demings and Congressman Nadler, for very  insightful, very important remarks on this particular legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr.  Pascrell), someone who I know has a passion for first responders, as we  have worked together even more closely after the heinous tragedy of 9/ 11.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Let me, first of all, thank Congresswomen Brooks and Demings for a  very astute initiative, and I look forward to us working together,  along with the chairman, on other items that impact the service of our  officers and the better police practices. And I cite, of course, the  Law Enforcement Trust and Integrity Act.   Mr. Speaker, I say to the chairman, I wanted to make mention of the  fact that we have been meeting on police issues for almost 2 years in  the Police Working Group, and it has been very impactful. I look  forward to us igniting another meeting and being able to hear from both  police and community, because we want a safe community and we want safe  law enforcement.   Let me also say, as I close, that many police officers are veterans,  and they have been in a war situation, and that means they have faced  crises, they have faced the violence of war, and they, obviously, have  experienced bouts, possibly, of PTSD or, as we know that they do, they  may not yield to it and may not know it and go right into serving;  whether they are fire or police, they go right into serving the  community. Therefore, this legislation will be enormously helpful to  them.   So, as I said earlier, this is a good first step to helping to  enhance the mental health or the mental well-being of our law  enforcement officers. These officers endure stressful events on our  behalf in the interest of protecting their communities, and so we will  all benefit from the effective implementation of this legislation.   Therefore, I support this bill, even as I encourage us to continue  our work on additional legislation to help foster better coordination  between our police officers and the communities they serve.   One final point, that I have listened to officers, and they have said  to me, with all that they deal with, coming upon a circumstance where a  child has been injured or killed is one of the most devastating  experiences they have had to have. Just imagine that.   This mental health bill will work on all of the issues that they have  to address, and I ask my colleagues to support the underlying  legislation, which is the Law Enforcement Mental Health and Wellness  Act of 2017, H.R. 2228.   Mr. Speaker, as I said earlier, this is a good first step to helping  to enhance the mental well-being of our law enforcement officers.   These officers endure stressful events on our behalf, in the interest  of protecting their communities. And so, we will all benefit from the  effective implementation of this legislation.   I therefore support this bill, even as I encourage my colleagues to  work together on additional legislation to help foster better  coordination between our police officers and the communities they  serve.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I want to again thank the gentlewoman from Indiana (Mrs. Brooks) and  the gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. Demings) for their leadership on  this issue.   I will say again how much I appreciate the work of the gentlewoman  from Texas on a whole host of law enforcement and criminal justice  reform issues; and it is my hope that we will move a great many of  these reforms through this House in the very near future. The  gentlewoman certainly has my support for working together in a  bipartisan way to accomplish that. This piece of legislation is a great  step in that direction.   You can't expect law enforcement to keep all of us safe if we are not  looking out for their mental health, which I  [[Page H9454]]  can only imagine how stressful the job is. I have had the opportunity  to do several ride-alongs over the years with police officers in my  district, and they have my utmost respect.   I hope that every Member of this House will vote for this important  legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
