 Madam President, yesterday the Senate confirmed a  well-qualified jurist chosen by President Trump to serve on the Third  Circuit Court of Appeals. Paul Matey of New Jersey will bring a wealth  of experience to the bench, and I was proud to support his nomination.   We also voted to advance the nomination of Neomi Rao to the DC  Circuit. This nominee is yet another of the President's excellent  choices to serve as a Federal judge.   Ms. Rao graduated with honors from Yale and the University of Chicago  School of Law. Her record includes a distinguished tenure in academia,  public and private sector legal experience, as well as a clerkship on  the U.S. Supreme Court.   Most importantly, in testimony before our colleagues on the Judiciary  Committee, she demonstrated a commitment to maintaining the public  trust and upholding the rule of law. So the committee favorably  reported Ms. Rao's nomination, and soon the Senate will have an  opportunity to continue fulfilling our advice and consent  responsibilities by voting to confirm her to the Federal bench.   We will also vote this afternoon on the nomination of William Beach,  who has been waiting for over a year to take his post as Commissioner  of Labor Statistics. Our colleagues on the HELP Committee recommended  Mr. Beach to the floor in December of 2017. A full year later, with no  progress, he was returned to the White House. Now he is finally getting  a floor vote. This pointless obstruction needs to change, but I am glad  we can at least confirm Mr. Beach this week.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.
