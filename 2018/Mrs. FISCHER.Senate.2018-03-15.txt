 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise today to continue my tribute to  Nebraska's heroes: the current generation of men and women who lost  their lives defending our freedom in Iraq and Afghanistan. Each of  these Nebraskans has a special story to tell.                    Sergeant Lonnie ``Calvin'' Allen, Jr.    Today, Mr. President, I will recall the life and service of Sergeant  Lonnie ``Calvin'' Allen, Jr., a native of Bellevue, NE.   Calvin grew up in a military family. His father, Lonnie Allen, Sr.,  was a senior master sergeant in the Air Force. When Lonnie Sr. was  assigned to Offutt Air Force Base in Bellevue, both he and his wife  Sallie thought they would be there only for a short time. However, they  enjoyed ``the good life,'' and soon after the birth of their two sons,  Nuru and Calvin, they decided to stay.   As a young child, Calvin spent much of his time in the kitchen. His  mother still talks about how Calvin learned to cook at the age of 5.  Sallie has vivid memories of Calvin in the kitchen in the early  mornings or on the weekends, experimenting with new recipes or dishes.  There were times when she would still be in bed and Calvin would bring  her food or a new dish to try. She said that he was always open to  trying new things, whether it was in the kitchen or elsewhere. This  also pertained to sports, where Calvin played basketball and football,  ran track, and wrestled.   Calvin also had a caring attitude, which extended to church on  Sundays. Calvin was widely known amongst the congregation at Mount  Carmel Baptist Church in Bellevue. He often volunteered to be an usher  and displayed his musical talent in the choir. Calvin had a personal  and very open relationship with God, and he happily shared it with  everyone he met.   Throughout his high school years at Bellevue East, Calvin spent much  of his time with friends and family. Sallie recalled many video game  parties and sleepovers at their house, which would end with many of  Calvin's friends sprawled out on the Allen living room floor.   Calvin was a member of a close-knit family who spent time playing  games together. Whether it was card games or board games, the  competitive spirit would always come out in the Allen boys. They loved  to compete.   After graduating from Bellevue East in 1998, Calvin enrolled at  Northeastern Junior College in Sterling, CO, to study criminal justice.  He long envisioned a career in law enforcement and thought this would  be a good starting point for him to launch his career.   After completing 2 years at Northeastern, Calvin enrolled at Colorado  State to finish his criminal justice degree. Soon after enrolling at  Colorado State, however, he returned home to Bellevue. Calvin's vehicle  had been involved in a wreck, which left him without any means of  transportation. Due to this, he enlisted in the Army as a way to pay  for a new vehicle, while also pursuing his law enforcement career while  serving his country. Sallie still laughs about the fact that Calvin  returned to Nebraska due to a wrecked car. Although many expected he  would follow in his dad's footsteps by enlisting in the Air Force,  Sallie knew better. Calvin wanted to pave his own road in the Army.   Following his enlistment, Calvin soon shipped off to Fort Benning to  complete his One Station Unit Training for the infantry. Shortly after  graduation, he was assigned to a station in Germany. It was in Germany  where Calvin met his wife, Brigit, a German native. After dating for  some time, Calvin was assigned to Fort Drum in New York as part of the  2nd Battalion, 22nd Infantry, 1st Brigade Combat Team, 10th Mountain  Division. Brigit came with him to New York, where they wed in 2004.   Shortly after their marriage, Calvin served in Iraq for the first  time, and Brigit moved to Bellevue to be closer to Calvin's family  while he was deployed. After a brief stint at home, he deployed to Iraq  for a second time. In August of 2005, Calvin was stationed near  Baghdad.   During Sergeant Allen's second deployment, patrols became  increasingly dangerous. At the time, the Baghdad area experienced a  large increase in suicide bombings and sectarian fighting. On May 18,  2006, while on patrol in Baghdad, Sergeant Allen's Humvee was struck by  an improvised explosive device, killing him and three other  servicemembers.    Sergeant Allen's memorial service was held at the Capehart Chapel in  Bellevue. Over 500 people attended the standing-room-only ceremony to  pay their respects, including over 200 Patriot Riders, who lined up  with American flags. Calvin was laid to rest on May 30, 2006, in  Arlington National Cemetery--the day after Memorial Day.   Fellow friend and Air Force Capt. Bill Eckley talked about how Calvin  was a man of honor. Bellevue also honored him by naming a street after  him,  [[Page S1758]]  and his high school established the Sgt. Lonnie Calvin Allen, Jr.  Scholarship.   Sgt. Lonnie ``Calvin'' Allen, Jr., received the Bronze Star and  Purple Heart posthumously.   I join Nebraskans and Americans across our country in saluting his  willingness and his family's sacrifice to keep us free. I am honored to  tell his story.   I thank the Presiding Officer.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I have 7 requests for committees to meet  during today's session of the Senate.
