 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of our bipartisan  legislation to both fund the government and for the COVID relief  package. As Speaker Pelosi just noted, this bill is far from perfect,  but we can't let the perfect be the enemy of the good.   Madam Speaker, today, is the darkest day of the year. It is a fitting  symbol of the misery and suffering that so many people are facing in  our country right now. The effects of this pandemic have been cruelly  uneven.   Some people have remained relatively unscathed. Some people can work  remotely, still have their jobs, no one around them has gotten sick or  died within their immediate circle, while others are awash in misery:  unable to return to work, unable to pay their rent, to pay their  utilities; people around them have gotten sick.   People have lost their lifesavings in their small business, and many  hundreds of thousands have died, including my 92-year-old father-in- law, who, in April, was diagnosed with the coronavirus and died within  48 hours.   Today's relief package--and that is what it is is relief--will  provide much-needed help for millions of Americans.   So while today is the darkest day of the year, every day will get a  little brighter, and spring will surely follow our dark winter. But we  must remember that, while spring is on its way, there is so much more  that needs to be done.   Our State and local governments must have relief from their massive  loss of revenues. Without our help, police officers, teachers, and  other heroes on the front line will face layoffs.   Madam Speaker, we need to continue today's spirit of bipartisanship.                            ____________________
