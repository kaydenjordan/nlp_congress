 Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the privilege to be  recognized to address you here on the floor of the House of  Representatives.   Having listened to the gentleman ahead of me, Mr. Louie Gohmert and  some of the discussion that he had, I would pick up with the beginning  here, Mr. Speaker, with one of the places where he left off, and that  is what happened before the United States Supreme Court yesterday and  the statements that were made by the minority leader of the United  States Senate.   I may have a bit of a different perspective than some in this House  or Senate or across this land, but here is the language that was deemed  offensive from Senator Schumer. I watched the video, and he was  pointing. He pointed at the United States Supreme Court, and he used  the names of two Supreme Court Justices. He said this: ``I want to tell  you, Gorsuch, I want to tell you, Kavanaugh, you have released the  whirlwind, and you will pay the price. You won't know what hit you if  you go forward with these awful decisions.''                                time  1330    That was stunning. It was stunning to hear two Justices called out in  that fashion before the Supreme Court. And I know that there was a  crowd over there that was happy to hear those words. But as a  constitutionalist and former chairman of the Constitution Subcommittee  in the House of Representatives, I am troubled by the effort to try to  sway judges through what appears to be verbal intimidation before the  Supreme Court.   I have stood on those same steps and delivered any number of  speeches, but I always confine them to the constitutional principles  that were involved. I wanted the Justices to hear my speech. I didn't  want them to ever hear it as a threat. I wanted them to hear it as a  rational approach in a way as if I were actually arguing before that  Supreme Court, before that Bench.   They are all well-learned and very, very capable people who are  deeply steeped in our Constitution and in case law. They have their  different philosophies, and that is clear. We often see a 5-4 decision  on the Court.   Mr. Speaker, I thought when I first arrived in this town a number of  years ago, I looked forward to going over to the Supreme Court to hear  what I expected to be the profound constitutional arguments before that  Bench. So I began going over there for some of the important cases,  with that expectation. I recall sitting there, listening to an argument  before the Court, and I understood--actually, this would be the Kelo  decision before the Supreme Court. The Kelo decision is the decision  that I believe amended the Constitution by the Supreme Court decision.   It was this. Let's see, New London, Connecticut. There was property  there that was owned and utilized by owners who didn't want to sell  that property to the developers. The local government wanted that  property in the hands of the developers because they would develop that  property into, I believe, a shopping mall, and then the taxes would be  the revenue going into local governments. So local governments had an  incentive in encouraging the development of the property, but the  property owners sat there with a constitutional guarantee in the Fifth  Amendment of the Constitution that says: ``nor shall private property  be taken for public use, without just compensation.''   That was the guarantee that, first of all, only governments could  confiscate property. They needed to maintain that within their own  possession, and it has to be for a public use. It can't be for a  private use. It was a private business that they handed that property  over to in New London, Connecticut.   Mr. Speaker, when I listened to the argument, I expected the argument  would go back to the very language of the Fifth Amendment, and that  would be argued, perhaps, certainly, on both sides. And I come down on  the side of: The Constitution means what it says, and it means what it  was understood to mean at the time of ratification by the people who  voted to ratify it.   We can't go back and assign different definitions to words or simply  say that it is a living, breathing Constitution that can adapt itself  to changing times. If that were the case, there wouldn't be a provision  to amend this Constitution provided by our Founding Fathers. The  Constitution is an intergenerational, contractual guarantee between one  generation of Americans to the next generation of Americans.   So, I hoped to hear those--in fact, expected to hear--those arguments  before the United States Supreme Court. What I heard instead were  arguments that were made to Justice O'Connor, and I think they  considered her to be the swing vote. And she came down on, I believe,  the constitutional side of it in the end. But there were just little  tweaks that had to do with her background.   She was raised on a ranch. I think it is a B&B ranch down in southern  Arizona, and I think it goes across into New Mexico, as I recall. I  read her books years ago. And some of the ranch land that she grew up  on was part of the Gadsden Purchase that came in right at the end of  the U.S. and Mexican war.   But growing up on a ranch, property values matter, and property  rights matter, and water rights matter in that part of the country. And  her book is replete with those kinds of narratives. It is a really  interesting way to get some insight into Justice O'Connor. But she  understood this case in a way I didn't know until later.   But I came down here to the floor, and we brought a resolution in the  House of Representatives, a resolution of disapproval to what was  called the Kelo decision. In that Kelo decision, it upheld the decision  of local government in New London, Connecticut, to confiscate private  property, houses and residences that had a deed, and to take that land  and compensate them for what they deemed the value was--condemnation-- and hand them over to the private investors so they can take that  [[Page H1531]]  land, develop it, and make money with it. That is completely contrary  to the reason that we have that guarantee within our Fifth Amendment.   As I listened to those oral arguments and saw how they were focused  on Justice O'Connor, I understood what was going on. And that is, they  weren't profound constitutional arguments; they were personalized  arguments that were designed to get to the psyche of the swing Justice  who was there. Of course, it wasn't Justice O'Connor, as it turned out.   By the way, I have been critical of some of her decisions--not on  this one.   Mr. Speaker, I want to put this narrative in the Record because I  think she is worthy of some significantly positive comments. And one of  the decisions that she had made--a different one, obviously, I was  railing away on my disagreement with the rationale that Justice  O'Connor had come down with. And so someone in the room said: You  shouldn't criticize her until you walk a mile in her shoes.   And I said: I would be happy to walk a mile in her shoes. I will walk  a thousand miles in her shoes. Appoint me to the Supreme Court, and I  will walk with her. And I bet you I can convince her.   I made some remark like that. And then, as I was talking, I said: You  know what? If I can't do that, why don't I just invite her to dinner?    So I followed through. I gave my word I would do that, and I went  back to my desk in my office and sat down and wrote a letter to Justice  O'Connor that invited her to a dinner, just to sit down, have a  conversation, get to know each other, be civil with each other, and  listen to each other's philosophical discussion.   I sent the letter over there, not expecting to get an affirmative  response. But what I did get was an invitation to come to her chambers  and do a lunch there. I don't remember the year, but I know the date  was March 18 of whatever year it was, in the earlier part of the  previous decade.   So, I went over at that time, and she had a lunch all prepared. She  had baked a pie that was, I presume, for me because it was fresh. It  was cut and served right there in her chambers. And we had a delightful  discussion.   She took me from each of the portraits of the Chief Justices and  walked me through the history of the Courts, from the beginning all the  way up to what was current at the time.   When I left that gracious dinner with Justice O'Connor, I decided she  has a good judgment on her; she has a good set of character; she has a  compassionate heart, a deep understanding of history and law. And  disagreeing with her, that is all it is, just disagreeing with the  rationale.   But I am forever grateful that I took the trouble, and I am really  grateful that she accepted the request that I made and then invited me  over there to dinner.   So, I wanted to put that in, that our Justices are human. And when  they get threatened, those threats sometimes cut deep, and the family  feels that.   These threats that were delivered yesterday in front of the United  States Supreme Court were threats that, might I say, intimidate judges.  The judicial branch of government, the American Bar Association,  everybody involved in that feels that. And they pride themselves in  their independence.   But I better conclude the Kelo decision before I get too far from it.  In any case, the Kelo decision came down, and they allowed for the  confiscation of private property handed over to other private interests  in order to generate tax revenue for local government.   That case still stands. But I was furious that they would do such  damage to the Constitution in a 5-4 decision. By the way, Justice  Scalia has said that he believes that case will be overturned one day.   But we brought a resolution of disapproval to the floor. It is the  only time that I know we have done that and spoken out in that fashion  on a Supreme Court decision. I noticed that at that time the gentleman  from Massachusetts, Barney Frank, came down to give his speech. I was  queued up next.   Mr. Speaker, I sat right here with my notepad ready to take notes  because I expected to get up and rebut most everything that I heard Mr.  Frank say. We found ourselves in disagreement on issue after issue, so  it was my full expectation that when he was finished talking, I would  have a page full of things to stand up and rebut. That has been my  style, and we had had many debates like that.   But as I listened to Mr. Frank that day, I realized he had exactly  the same opinion that I had. He expressed it a little bit differently,  but he came down in support of the resolution of disapproval and in  support of the Constitution and in support of the property rights that  are there in the Fifth Amendment.   Mr. Speaker, when I stepped up here to this particular podium, my  speech really was to reject the decision made by the Supreme Court. And  when I spoke that in the Record, I said effectively what they have done  is they have pulled the words out of the Fifth Amendment ``for public  use.''   ``Nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just  compensation,'' and the effect of it was to pull the ``for public use''  out of there. Now, the effect of the Fifth Amendment after the Kelo  decision just says ``nor shall private property be taken, without just  compensation,'' which means the government can't come in and take your  property away from you, unless they write you a check, but they can  give it to anybody they want to in the private sector.   Whatever their motive might be, it was approved by the Supreme Court  with the Kelo decision. And I think that will be abused at some point  and a more reasonable Court may be seated at that time and restore the  Constitution on the Kelo decision.   But my real point here is that we can't be seeking to intimidate the  Court. They are human. Justice O'Connor--a gracious heart and a nice  lady. And we used to have receptions over there with the Committee on  the Judiciary and members of the bench just to take some of the  temperature down between the natural disagreements that exist between  the legislative branch and the judicial branch of government.    Mr. Speaker, when you have the minority leader, the most powerful,  highest ranking Democrat in the United States Senate, go stand before  the Supreme Court, point his finger at that building that was behind  him and say, ``I want to tell you, Gorsuch; I want to tell you,  Kavanaugh: You have released the whirlwind, and you will pay the price.  You won't know what hit you if you go forward with these awful  decisions.''   Going forward with an awful decision means Chuck Schumer has already  decided what he thinks the Court decision is going to be on the  requirements that are part of the, I will say, the abortion laws that  are coming out of Louisiana. And I have been one of the lead voices on  pro-life issues here in this United States House of Representatives.   There is on my lapel a heart that represents the heartbeat bill. It  is a bill that I introduced in the previous Congress, and that bill  protects unborn babies. It essentially says this: If a heartbeat can be  detected, the baby is protected.   And we know that the heartbeat is the first, certain sign of life.  When that heart starts to beat, you know that there is a live baby  there. You can't call it anything else. It is a live baby.   And this little baby has all the components of a growing human being.  It just needs to develop them out to full size and to full term.   And anybody who has picked up and held--especially a loved one--a  newborn baby and gazed with awe at the miracle in their hands has to  know that that baby's life didn't begin at the moment of birth or at  the moment of first breath and that that baby's life began well before  a minute before the baby was born.   Mr. Speaker, I know when I held my firstborn son, I looked at him in  awe. There was an aura about him. The miracle was in my hands. And I  thought: How can anybody take his life now? He is a few minutes old.  How can anybody take his life now? How could they take his life a  minute before he was born, or an hour before, or a day, or a week, or a  month before he was born? Or a trimester or three trimesters before he  was born? At what moment did his life begin? Because human life is  sacred in all its forms.                                time  1345    And we only have to choose when did life begin. It is not that hard a  question. Because it is a continuum; it is a  [[Page H1532]]  gradual growing continuum from the moment of conception on.   But that heartbeat says this is a live baby here. And when that heart  stops, we call that death. When the heart starts, we know that is life.  Even though life began at the moment of conception, medically, we can't  pinpoint that precisely enough, but I am willing to go there if we can  get there.   Right now, we are at heartbeat. And in the last Congress, I was able  to get 174 cosponsors, and those 174 cosponsors all signed on with an  expectation that we would protect all babies. When a heartbeat could be  detected, the baby is protected.   We didn't make exceptions for rape or incest or any other provisions.  These babies are sacred. If there was a crime committed that resulted  in conception, that is on the rapist; that is not on the baby. And  those babies are as precious to God as my own grandchildren are to God;  and, of course, my grandchildren are extraordinarily precious to me.   So I hope one day we get to that and that question.   But as we move on, with this superaggressive utilization of freedom  of speech and Senator Schumer, I look back at some of this discussion.  And Chief Justice Roberts had a response, which is exceptionally rare,  to have a statement come out of the Supreme Court. But out of the Chief  Justice, he said, and I quote: ``Threatening statements of this sort,  from the highest levels of government, are not only inappropriate, they  are dangerous.'' And Justices, quote, ``will continue to do their job,  without fear or favor, from whatever quarter.''--Chief Justice John  Roberts.   I appreciate that language that the Justices will ``continue to do  their job, without fear or favor, from whatever quarter.'' That  language will live a long time in the way that that is adeptly put  together, and that is how it needs to be.   If we want to convince the Supreme Court to take a new look at  things, we need to make the constitutional arguments, Mr. Speaker, not  the threatening arguments. And where I come from, when somebody  threatens you, that means that you are done doing business with that  person, and they are very unlikely to get cooperation.   But there is another part of this that, even though there would be a  measure of justice involved if the decisions made in the Supreme Court  went against the interests of Senator Schumer, I would like to  reiterate here into this Congressional Record, and I hope it echoes  across this land, that, if you think you are going to get even with  somebody, the result in this business, whether it is in the  legislative, the executive, or the judicial branch of government, if  you think you are going to get even with somebody, you invariably hurt  the wrong people.   And so that is not an avenue that has merit, and I hope that and I  expect that that wisdom exists within all of our Justices, all nine of  them over there, that payback to Schumer can't be in the cards from any  decision that would come down from the Court, it has got to be balanced  and objective, as described by Chief Justice Roberts, and that they  ``continue to do their job, without fear or favor, from whatever  quarter.''   I believe the Justices will stick to that, and I am hopeful that  Senator Schumer will learn not to utilize those tactics anymore.   This is the American Bar Association, the ABA. Their comments came  down to this. They said they are ``deeply troubled'' by Schumer's  remarks, that ``there is no place for threats--whether real or  allegorical.''   And then the ABA, American Bar Association, continued with this:  ``Personal attacks on judges by any elected officials, including the  President, are simply inappropriate. Such comments challenge the . . .  independence of the judiciary and the personal safety of judicial  officers. . . . ''   Well, Mr. Speaker, I know that is true. I know that when you turn up  the dialogue and you hear this radical rhetoric coming out of elected  officials in particular, things do happen out in our society. And the  Chief Justice is concerned that there could be acts of potential  violence that could be stimulated by that kind of dialogue.   And I am hopeful that--Senator Schumer seemed to dial it down on the  floor of the Senate today. That is good. I didn't notice that he had  called upon people to refrain from violence and refrain from threats.  He did say that he is from the Bronx and they talk a little more  clearly there than other places. I don't doubt that. But this language  went to the world, and the world saw it today, Mr. Speaker.   And so I am hopeful that Senator Schumer will call upon his  supporters to calm down, be logical, make constitutional arguments, and  refrain from that kind of rhetoric.   And here are the consequences. I had some serious rhetoric applied  against me over the last 1\1/2\ years, and each of those situations  that were--a good number of them were manufactured firestorms that were  fired at me.   But also, we saw Members of this House of Representatives that went  forward and said, when people go into a restaurant, when they stop to  get gas and you see them there, if they happen to be--I am not sure  exactly how they defined it, but if they happen to be conservatives, go  confront them, make their lives miserable. That kind of discussion was  delivered from people who sit over on this side of the aisle, and it  had its physical results.   It had its physical results, at least in my case, where I sat down in  a restaurant last April, and from completely outside my peripheral  vision, I was assaulted. That individual has been convicted of  assaulting a Federal officer, or a United States Congressman. There is  a provision for that.   And, by the way, today, he goes before a Federal judge in Sioux City  for sentencing.   So I won't comment any more on that, because I don't want to be  accused of seeking to influence a decision that may or may not have  been made, but it is ironic that I am here today having this discussion  on Senator Schumer while there is an individual being sentenced for  assaulting me back in Iowa, which I believe is a clear result of this  kind of radical rhetoric that was poured out.    And it wasn't based on truth, in my case, when they attacked me. It  was planned. It was orchestrated. It was ginned up. And then you have  people out there that take that seriously.   And so that is what happened that day, and the sentencing is taking  place today. I will trust the judge to make an objective decision. I  have written my opinion in longhand and sent that to the court for  their consideration. That is where I will leave that recommendation. I  have had my chance to weigh in.   But let's take this a little further, Mr. Speaker, and that is on  this concept of freedom of speech. Now, there are those that want to  censure Senator Schumer, and it sounds like Senator Hawley is going to  introduce a censuring motion tomorrow in the Senate.   I am of the opinion that the most important freedom we have is a  robust freedom of speech and that, if we let that be diminished by  intimidation tactics, let alone by any kind of laws that would perhaps  be found unconstitutional--but watching the Kelo decision, maybe not be  found unconstitutional.   I want the body to understand this, Mr. Speaker, that freedom of  speech is a precious, precious right, and our Founding Fathers  understood that if you can't speak, if you can't speak freely, then you  can't convey your ideas at all. And then when you can't convey your  ideas, they never get tested against anybody else's ideas or  embellished or supported by other people's ideas, and that means, then,  that human knowledge would diminish, it would atrophy, and it would  essentially stop forming around us.   Our Founding Fathers envisioned a robust nation that would be  regularly and constantly engaged in discussions of public policy, like  we are in Iowa as the first-in-the-Nation caucus, like New Hampshire  is, and let's just say South Carolina is among those States, too, where  there is an intense focus on politics, free discussion.   I have spent time in Cuba and learned that they don't have that  freedom. They are afraid--even among their families sitting around the  table, they are afraid to speak to each other because there might be an  informant among them that has been hired by the, at that time, Castro  administration. So they don't speak to each other about those things.  They don't criticize. They accept what government serves up to them.  [[Page H1533]]    That is what King George wanted to happen in this country. And if our  predecessors here, the revolutionary Founding Fathers, had accepted the  edict from King George, we would have never developed this great Nation  that we are. We would be stuck back in the mud somewhere back there,  because our ideas wouldn't have been brought forward. They wouldn't  have been tested against each other, then creating other new ideas.   And, you know, we are the Nation that produces more patents, more  creativity, than any other nation in the world by far. We are so good  at this and we create so much with our intellectual freedoms that we  have that are tied into freedom of speech that the Chinese look to us  and they steal a half a trillion dollars worth of American intellectual  property every year--a half a trillion dollars. And that doesn't  include what they steal through cyber. That is called IP piracy.   I have been over to China. Years ago, I wrote a bill from Beijing  that called upon the U.S. Trade Representative to conduct a study to  determine the value of U.S. intellectual property that is stolen by the  Chinese, apply a duty on all products coming to the United States from  China in an amount equal to that loss, and then collect that and  distribute it to the rightful property rights holders. That was a bill  then. It is still a good idea today, but they have accelerated their  piracy.   Mr. Speaker, to give you an example of how this works, we know a  little bit about how freedom of speech, thought, and expression works  in the United States because we see--actually, in the past, we have  seen a more robust freedom of speech on our campuses. Today, they are  diminishing freedom of speech on the campuses. They are defining things  as hate speech and trigger words and safe places. We don't need that.  We have got to be strong enough to face language and let it flow and  then accommodate ourselves in a way that we are not influenced if it  isn't logical or rational.   The Greeks, for example, in their city-states, would banish a  demagogue for 7 years from the city-state because they didn't like what  he had to say, and that wasn't constructive.   But what is constructive is our freedom of speech, our young people  sitting in college, sitting up all night long discussing metaphysics  till the Sun comes up, new ideas: What is the limitation on what we can  do with science? with math? with space travel? All of those things that  have made America the leader in the world, they are all tied back to  freedom of speech.   If you can't speak, you can't express your thoughts. You can't just  hold your thoughts in your head and think you are going to do something  good with them. If we had taken Albert Einstein and sat him into a  phone booth and said, ``We will let you out when you write the theory  of relativity,'' first of all, it never would have been created; second  of all, nobody could have understood it. You have got to have the  interactivity of minds.   And people will say: We have the Second Amendment; therefore, we are  never going to lose our freedom of speech. I don't see anybody using  the Second Amendment to defend their freedom of speech, and I don't  recommend that they do. We have to utilize our freedom of speech and  push back when it is diminished.   So I am not calling for a sanction on Senator Schumer. I am saying  this:   Senator Schumer, you know what you said. You know whether it is right  or wrong. You have to operate in an arena over there and get reelected  by the people in your district. Let we, the people, decide. Not a  leader here in the Senate, not a leader here in the House, but let we,  the people, decide.    And, in fact, as a former chairman of the Constitution Committee, the  three branches of government, there are tensions between each of those.  Our Founding Fathers didn't envision that they would be equal. They  believed the judicial branch would be the weakest of the three. But  they knew there would be tension as that territory got marked out, and  there is always going to be a gray area where there is a little bit of  a tug-of-war over who has what territory.   But in the end, if you analyze it--I can make your argument for the  legislature, even the House and the Senate. I can make it for the  executive branch. I can make it for the judicial branch. But in the  end, if any branch of government gets out of whack, that means out of  sync with the American people, we, the people, solve that problem in  the election box.   Sometimes it takes time. But that is the best solution is for we, the  people, to make that decision, not a decision that sanctions freedom of  speech, diminishes freedom of speech, or intimidates people so that  they don't utilize their freedom of speech, because we have got to  remain the most creative society in the history of the world, and in  doing so, we will be the most successful people also in the history of  the world.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 1 o'clock and 58 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until Monday,  March 9, 2020, at noon for morning-hour debate.                            ____________________
