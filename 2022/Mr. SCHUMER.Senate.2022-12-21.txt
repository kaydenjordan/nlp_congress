 Mr. President, I see the Presiding Officer is in your       Ukrainian yellow and blue, as am I, and that is appropriate because       this will be a day to remember in the history of the U.S. Congress when       we welcome President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine. This is President       Zelenskyy's first trip outside Ukraine since the beginning of Russia's       invasion. The President of this young democracy will address Members       from both Chambers in a joint meeting of Congress. It is always a high       honor to welcome a foreign head of state to Congress, but it is nearly       unheard of to hear from a leader who is fighting for his life, fighting       for his country's survival, and fighting to preserve the very idea of       democracy. It shows the importance President Zelenskyy places on us       continuing to give him robust help.        Where Winston Churchill stood generations ago, so, too, President       Zelenskyy stands, not just as a President but also as an ambassador to       freedom itself.        Let me say that again because it is so important. Where Winston       Churchill stood generations ago, so, too, will President Zelenskyy       stand here today, not just as a President but as an ambassador to       freedom itself.        President Zelenskyy could not arrive at a more crucial moment for the       Senate. We are not only voting to approve more emergency wartime       funding, but today, here in the Senate, we will also vote to confirm       the U.S. Ambassador to Russia, Lynne Tracy, who will be tasked with       standing up to Putin.        We should complete our work on both the omnibus with Ukrainian aid       and the confirmation of our new Ambassador to Russia very quickly.        I hope all House Republicans will attend the Zelenskyy address this       evening, and when they do, they should listen to President Zelenskyy       describe the horror his people have endured at the hands of Vladimir       Putin.        I hope that Donald Trump's friendship with Putin is not motivating       House Republicans to turn a blind eye to Ukraine's suffering and       desperate need for help, because the so-called friendship between Putin       and Trump was a sour relationship that was deeply damaging to our       country and to the international order.        This week marks 10 months since Vladimir Putin began his unprovoked,            [[Page S9712]]            immoral, and savage invasion of Ukrainian territory. While the conflict       is sadly not near its conclusion, Russia's military is on its heels       after a series of humiliating defeats--a testament to the Ukrainian       people's bravery, resilience, and commitment to defending their       homeland.        Ukraine's success also shows that American support is working. To       date, our funding has put more weapons in Ukrainian hands and more       victories under their belt. Now is not the time--not the time--to take       our foot off the gas when it comes to helping Ukraine. The single worst       thing we can do right now is give Putin any signal that we are wavering       in our commitment to defend democracy in Ukraine and around the globe.        By passing this omnibus and confirming a new ambassador, we can send       President Zelenskyy back to Ukraine with the message that the Senate,       the Congress, and the American people stand unequivocally behind the       people of Ukraine, and we are backing that up with real dollars and       real resources.        I commend President Zelenskyy for his courage. I thank him for his       leadership. And I will happily join Congress in welcoming him to the       Capitol later this evening.                                                  Omnibus              Now on the omni, as we speak, Democrats and Republicans are working       on the final significant achievement of a truly significant 2 years in       Congress: a yearlong funding bill to avert a shutdown and keep the       government working well into the next fall.        Earlier this week, the appropriators released the text of the       omnibus, a bill overflowing with good news--good news for our kids, our       parents, our troops, our small businesses, and more.        The Senate took the first step to passing this bill last night,       voting 70 to 25 to begin debate. Note the margin, 70 to 25. That is a       strong signal that both sides are keen to finish funding the government       very soon.        We must finish our work before the deadline of Friday midnight, but       in reality, I hope we can vote on final passage much sooner than that,       even as early as tonight. There is no reason for the Senate to wait and       plenty of reasons to move quickly before a potential blizzard makes       travel hazardous for Members, their staff, and families right before       the Christmas season. In an effort to reach final passage soon, both       sides will continue negotiating a number of amendments that I hope we       can begin voting on later today, but, again, that is going to require       cooperation.        So I urge my colleagues not to stand in the way of moving this       process forward. Nobody wants a shutdown. Nobody benefits from a       shutdown. So I hope nobody here will delay this process to fund the       government ASAP.        Now, as I said yesterday, this bipartisan package is chock-full of       good news for our kids, our veterans, our small businesses, and even       for our democracy.        For one, we will pass long-sought reforms to the Electoral Count Act       after a lot of hard work from Senators Manchin and Klobuchar and       Collins and Blunt and many others. The 117th Congress began under the       shadow of a violent insurrection, so it is fitting that one of our       final actions will be passing a bill safeguarding our elections from       future dangers.        The omnibus also represents a major win for kids and parents across       the country. It increases childcare assistance by 30 percent. Our       childcare agencies are struggling. This 30 percent increase is a huge       shot in the arm to help them. It is a massive boost for the tens of       millions of families who can't afford this basic necessity. We have a       shortage of workers; one of the reasons--not good childcare. This helps       alleviate that situation because moms and dads who want to take care of       their kids but have to go to work can't go to work unless there is       adequate and good childcare.        We are also taking a temporary program that helped kids eat during       the summer during COVID and making it permanent, so parents won't have       to worry about their kids going hungry during a day when school is not       in session.        I am also proud that we got many of the best elements of the Momnibus       in this package. We will ensure new mothers on Medicaid and CHIP can       have a full year of postpartum coverage. That is a great breakthrough.        We are increasing funding to train nurses and healthcare workers as       well as beef up support for mental health services, which I fought for       very hard. Discrimination in maternal care and at birth is a real blot       on our country. That people of color have higher rates of mortality,       for the moms and the kids, is a disgrace, and this goes a good way       toward trying to rectify that blot on our country's pride.        There is also some other good stuff. At a time in which we are seeing       a surge in union activity because workers realize that to get adequate       pay, adequate benefits, a union can help them, Democrats heeded the       call and broke the nearly decade long funding freeze on the NLRB.        The NLRB was one of the very few Agencies that got no increase in       funding for years and years despite the increase in mission. It is a       very important priority to Democrats and for working Americans because       the NLRB is one of the most important pro-worker Agencies, and it has       been utterly starved for resources for about a decade.        So let me say it again. Kids, parents, veterans, nurses, workers--      these are just a few of the beneficiaries of our bipartisan funding       package. So there is every reason in the world for the Senate to finish       its work as soon as possible. No one got everything they wanted--that       is how this works--but we got a lot of good things in there to help       America.        I want to thank all of my colleagues from both sides of the aisle for       their work. Let's finish the job today, if possible, by working       together and cooperatively.        I yield the floor.                                     Recognition of the Minority Leader               Mr. President, before the HELP staff leaves, I just want       to thank all of you and, of course, Chair Murray for the amazing job       you have done in the last 2 years. I know that many of you will       continue working to continue to help people with their health, their       education, and their labor policies But it has been a great 2 years for       the Senate, and it couldn't have been done without Patty's leadership       and your great staffing of that committee. So thank you all.        I suggest the absence of a quorum.        The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.        The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.         Madam President, I just met with President Zelenskyy,       and he made it clear that without this aid package, the Ukrainians will       be in real trouble and could even lose the war. So that makes the       urgency of us getting this legislation done all the more important and       getting it done quickly without flaw.        So for the information of all Senators, we are still working on an       agreement to vote on amendments and pass the omnibus tonight. We aren't       there yet. We are making progress. But if we do not reach agreement,       because of the urgency of getting this done, I will file cloture this       evening for a Friday cloture vote. And we are going to have a rollcall       vote on the Schaefer nomination following the joint meeting.                              Unanimous Consent Agreement--Executive Calendar              Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate       reconvenes from recess this evening, it proceed to executive session       for the consideration of Executive Calendar No. 780, Agnes Schaefer, to       be Assistant Secretary of the Army; that there be up to 5 minutes for       debate on the nomination, equally divided between the two leaders or       their designees; and that upon the use or yielding back of time, the       Senate vote on the confirmation as provided for under the previous       order.         Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate       stand in recess subject to the call of the Chair.        There being no objection, the Senate, at 6:56 p.m., recessed subject       to the call of the Chair and reassembled at 8:10 p.m. when called to       order by the Presiding Officer (Mr. Kelly).                                      ____________________                Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.         Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order       for the quorum call be rescinded.         Mr. President, now, we are making good progress. As a       procedural safeguard, I am filing cloture, but I am hopeful--very       hopeful--we will lock in an agreement shortly.                                               Cloture Motion               Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the motion to       concur in the House amendment to the Senate amendment No. 4 to the bill       with an amendment to the desk.         I suggest the absence of a quorum.         Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order       for the quorum call be rescinded.         Madam President, first, let me thank you, Madam       President, and the entire staff for being here at 2 in the morning, but       getting this omnibus bill done is an important thing to do. It is my       expectation that we will be able to lock in an agreement on the omnibus       tomorrow morning. We are very close, but we are not there yet. I ask       Members to be alerted to be here at 8 in the morning when we will have       the first vote on a nomination to bring everybody here, to get final       agreement, and then to move forward.                                      ____________________                Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate       proceed to executive session to consider the following nominations en       bloc: Calendar Nos. 774, 995, 451, 1258, 768, 1281, and 1282; that the       Senate vote on the nominations, en bloc, without intervening action or       debate; that the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon       the table; that the President be immediately notified of the Senate's       action; and that the Senate resume legislative session.         Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that when the       Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 8 a.m., Thursday,       December 22; that following the prayer and pledge, the morning hour be       deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the       time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day,       and morning business be closed; that upon the conclusion of morning       business, the Senate proceed to executive session to consider Executive       Calendar No. 781, Franklin R. Parker, of the District of Columbia, to       be an Assistant Secretary of the Navy; and that the Senate vote on the       confirmation of the Parker nomination, as provided under the previous       order.         Madam President, if there is no further business to come       before the Senate, I ask that it stand adjourned under the previous       order.        There being no objection, the Senate, at 2:01 a.m., adjourned until       Thursday, December 22, 2022, at 8 a.m.                                      ____________________
