 Mr. President, I rise today with a heavy heart  to pay tribute to Stew Leonard, Sr., a visionary entrepreneur and  Connecticut icon, who passed away on April 26, 2023, at the age of 93.  He will be remembered for creating Stew Leonard's, a beloved chain of  grocery stores.   A lifelong Connecticut resident, Stew graduated from Norwalk High  School and the University of Connecticut's School of Agriculture and  went on to work for his family's dairy business. At the time, the  family farm--Clover Farms Dairy in Norwalk, CT--was known for its  state-of-the-art operation with a pasteurizing and bottling plant and  delivery trucks outfitted with plastic cows that ``mooed'' for the  neighborhood children.   By the late 1960s, Stew had the insight to recognize that the milk  delivery business was waning. When a new highway was being built with  Clover Farms Dairy in its path, Stew made the bold decision to  transform the family business. He decided to build a dairy store, with  a farmer's market atmosphere and opportunities for children to watch  milk being bottled while their parents shopped.   In December 1969, Stew opened a 17,000-square-foot store, carrying  only eight items. Through his ingenuity, inventiveness, and  determination, Stew Leonard's grew from its humble beginnings into a  lasting, beloved Connecticut institution. The flagship store in  Norwalk, CT, was named the World's Largest Dairy Store, according to  Ripley's Believe It or Not, and also earned a Guinness World Record for  having the highest sales per square foot of selling space. Now a chain  of seven stores across three States, Stew Leonard's has retained its  family-friendly atmosphere, focus on freshness and quality, and  reputation for superior customer service.   Ultimately, Stew Leonard's is a family business, run today by Stew's  son Stew Leonard, Jr., with support from his siblings and five of  Stew's grandchildren. Collectively, the Leonard family maintains Stew's  commitment to excellence and service, gaining generations of loyal  customers and friends.   The company has a long track record of charitable endeavors, from  hosting community food and clothing drives, to Stew's ``Wishing  Wells.'' Placed at the entrance to every store, the wells collect  change that is donated to a local charity at the end of every month,  matched by a donation from the store. For more than 50 years, Stew  Leonard's stores have become deeply engaged in their communities, a  testament to Stew's generous spirit.   I was privileged to know the Leonard family and to attend many events  with them over the years. I have also been a long-time customer,  enjoying visits to the Norwalk store with my four children decades ago  when they would marvel at the mooing cow and other attractions. Stew's  entrepreneurial spirit, work ethic, and dedication to the people of  Connecticut were inspiring, and he will be deeply missed. My wife  Cynthia and I extend our deepest sympathies to Stew's family during  this difficult time, particularly to his wife Marianne, his four  children, and many grandchildren and great-grandchildren. I hope my  colleagues will join me in honoring Stew Leonard's life and legacy,  both large and lasting.                            ____________________
