 Madam Speaker, I rise today as I do every day in  strong support of the millions of undocumented immigrants whose  contributions to our communities cannot continue to be overlooked.   We have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to provide sound immigration  reform through reconciliation, and I urge my colleagues to join me in  prioritizing this timely and long-overdue effort. We must find the  collective will in this House, in the Senate, and in the White House to  finally resolve this pending issue.   The American Dream is for all of us, Madam Speaker. It is for TPS  recipients. It is for Dreamers. It is for farmworkers and essential  workers who put their lives on the line during the pandemic.   How can we build back better without providing real reform for our  undocumented immigrants? Or are we to abandon a nation of immigrants?  That is the question.   Let me be very clear, Madam Speaker: Including immigration reform in  budget reconciliation is not without any precedent. While the Senate  Parliamentarian's decisions have not gone our way, we must forge ahead  and continue to bring solutions to this community.   If not now, then when? How many times will we be able to tell vital  members of our communities to wait in line to be treated fairly and  equally in our country?   These are our neighbors, Madam Speaker. These are folks who helped us  through the pandemic. These are the food delivery people who came to  our homes while we shivered in fear during the pandemic. These are the  over 400,000 farmworkers who picked the fruits and the vegetables that  we put on our table during the pandemic. These are the home care  workers that took care of our very frail seniors, that scrubbed  themselves clean before they went to work, and when they went back  home, had to do the same not to infect their children.   They are heroes. These are American heroes who kept us alive during  the pandemic.   This is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to pass much-needed  legislation that reforms our broken immigration system. More than two- thirds of all undocumented immigrants work in frontline jobs and are  essential workers in industries such as healthcare, home care,  transportation, agriculture, food production, and construction, among  others.   Including sound immigration reform would advance our economic  recovery from the pandemic, reduce our national deficit, raise wages,  add a cumulative $1.5 trillion to the GDP over a decade, and create  more than 400,000 new jobs.   President Biden and Vice President Harris have repeatedly  demonstrated their commitment to pass immigration reform and have  expressed strong support for including immigration reform in our budget  reconciliation process. It is also broadly supported by the American  people.   Congress has not passed substantial immigration reform in more than  35 years, Madam Speaker. Due to the Senate filibuster, a cynical  remnant of Jim Crow, budget reconciliation provides the only glimmer of  hope that will turn this into a reality.   It is an unfortunate truth that the other side of the aisle has  rejected every proposal, Madam Speaker, every single proposal, and  obstructed every single piece of immigration reform legislation that we  have put forward. The filibuster has once again blocked our progress  every step of the way.   For decades, we have failed to sign into law permanent legislative  solutions to this problem. Budget reconciliation is the only tool we  now have available.   Millions of immigrants in our country have lived their lives in fear  and uncertainty for far too long. They are counting on us to get this  done, and I am committed to making it happen. I will always stand  behind asylum seekers, refugees, and families who come to this country  to make a better life for themselves, just as I once did. That is the  promise of America, Madam Speaker.                            ____________________
