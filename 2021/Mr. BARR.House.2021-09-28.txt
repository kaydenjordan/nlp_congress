 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to honor the life of a devoted  public servant, Ray Larson of Lexington, Kentucky.   Ray served as assistant deputy attorney general for the Commonwealth  of Kentucky, but later, for 32 years, Ray was one of the most  consequential Commonwealth's attorneys in our great State's history,  dedicated to our community and the rule of law.   He was an outstanding prosecutor, always laser focused on deterring  crime, relentlessly pursuing justice, advocating for victims' rights,  and keeping central Kentucky families safe.   Ray was an unapologetic and principled fighter, leading by example  and advancing the cause of law and order. He believed in defending, not  defunding, the police.   Ray was a faithful member of Good Shepherd Episcopal Church, where he  served as a Eucharist minister and taught high school Sunday school for  over 30 years.   On a personal note, Ray was a dear friend and an important mentor to  me.   Mr. Speaker, Ray Larson was a great American patriot who made a  positive difference, and he will be deeply missed. God bless him and  his family, and I appreciate the opportunity to pay tribute to a great  American.                 IRS Financial Institution Reporting Mandate     Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to the Biden  administration's proposal to mandate banks, credit unions, and other  financial institutions to report the inflows and outflows of customer  bank accounts to the IRS.   Think big government has too much of your personal data now? Just  wait until the Biden administration and congressional Democrats require  banks to submit the financial transactions of millions of Americans to  the IRS.   Let me repeat that. For the Americans watching on C-SPAN right now,  President Biden, as part of his massive job-killing tax increase, wants  the IRS to have unfettered power to spy on your bank accounts, your  deposits, your withdrawals, and your payments.   While I was pleased to see that the Ways and Means Committee did not  include this provision in their bill during markup, news reports  suggest there are still negotiations with the administration for its  inclusion. A higher account threshold or other minor policy shifts will  not solve the fundamental flaws with this proposal.   The mandatory reporting of Americans' transactions violates their  privacy and puts an undue burden on financial institutions that could  cripple community banks that helped get government aid to struggling  small businesses during the pandemic, and it is predicated on the Biden  administration's assumption that every American is somehow a tax cheat.  How offensive. This is a disgusting example of Big Government  overreach, and I am sounding the alarm.   I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to actively oppose  this misguided and dangerous proposal.    Irresponsible Vote to Increase the Debt Ceiling Without Fiscal Reforms     Mr. Speaker, I rise today as a member of the House  Financial Services Committee in strong opposition to the Democrats'  reckless and irresponsible vote to increase the debt ceiling without  any fiscal reforms and provide a blank check for the Democrats'  socialist tax and spending spree, which they intend to ram through  Congress later this week or in the coming weeks.   Everybody understands we cannot default on our debt. But don't let  the Democrats and their allies in the media fool you. This debt limit  increase does not cover funds already spent. The ceiling suspended in  2019 accommodated 100 percent of the spending under the previous  administration, including five bipartisan COVID response bills and then  some.   But Democrats chose to pass, on a partisan basis, $2 trillion in new  spending, less than 10 percent of which actually responded to COVID,  and that is what has brought us to this new debt limit. Republicans did  not vote for that $2 trillion, and now President Biden and Democrats  want an additional $5.5 trillion, $4.3 trillion of which has zero  Republican support. So it is Democrat partisanship that has resulted in  a partisan debt limit vote.   Let's be clear. This debt limit vote enables massive amounts of new  spending, not old spending. Even with the largest tax increase in  American history, a tax increase that would make the tax burden on  American businesses higher than in communist China, this is a bill that  will add at least $2.4 trillion to the national debt, even with all of  those new historic tax increases.   And the hypocrisy of those who criticize the job-producing and  revenue-producing Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, claiming that it would  massively increase the deficit, where are they now? The hypocrisy is  breathtaking. These are the same people who support adding trillions to  the national debt.  [[Page H5468]]    I came to Congress to save this country from bankruptcy, and I will  not stand idly by as such dangerous legislation is pushed on a partisan  basis through the Congress.   Mr. Speaker, oppose this tax and spending spree.                            ____________________
