 Mr. Speaker, today, September 26, is now 5 days and  counting for the start of the next fiscal year which, if Congress does  not act within this next 5 days, the U.S. Government will shut down.  [[Page H4469]]    I have been around Congress for a while. I was here in 2013 when the  government shut down for 17 days. In 2019, all the agencies under the  Department of Homeland Security were shut down for 35 days. This is a  disaster for the American people and for our standing in the world if,  God forbid, this does not come together in the next 5 days.   Mr. Speaker, I represent a district that is a strong defense  district. We have the largest military installation in New England, the  Naval Submarine Base New London in Groton, Connecticut. We have about  16 attack submarines that are located there, tied up there that are  deploying at a heel-to-toe pace constantly. There are about 2,000  civilian employees that make that base operations function as they  should.   I also have a district which is the home of the Coast Guard Academy.  That institution is building the future leaders, young men and young  women, for the Coast Guard, who are doing important work not just in  the littoral areas of our Nation and the rivers, but also overseas in  terms of providing critical assistance to allies who again are really  struggling with gross violations of the international convention for  law, the sea treaty. Again, the Coast Guard is looked at around the  world as really the gold standard in terms of providing quality  training and examples for that critical function to take place.   In the past, when we had shutdowns, despite some of the ridiculous  comments that are made by some of my colleagues in this Chamber that,  oh, there is nothing to worry about, Active-Duty people still have to  report, they are going to get paid retroactively, the concerns about  that are overblown.   I will tell you, Mr. Speaker, that that is, in my opinion, some of  the most irresponsible, dangerous rhetoric that can be uttered at a  time like this. The fact of the matter is, there is a hardship for  people who are wearing the uniform. Many of them go literally from  paycheck to paycheck. In 2019 when the Coast Guard was shut down along  with the Department of Homeland Security in New London, we had pop-up  food banks to help Coast Guard families put food on the table for  themselves and their family members.   In terms of the 17-day shutdown, the submarine base, again, all of  the civilian support staff, DOD employees who were told they were not  essential, they didn't have to come to work. We didn't have crane  operators doing their job on the base, we didn't have all the support  and maintenance staff in terms of making sure the operations of that  base functioned.   This is a totally unnecessary, unforced error which will cause havoc  in every other military installation and every other DOD facility  around the country.   Mr. Speaker, there is a pathway here. There is a roadmap, and we know  that because at the end of May when we passed the Fiscal Responsibility  Act, which avoided a default on the full faith and credit of this  country, Democrats and Republicans came together, a center-left,  center-right coalition that passed those measures. The final vote on  May 31, when we passed the Fiscal Responsibility Act, passed 314-117.  There were 165 Democrats and 149 Republicans that came together to  avoid that catastrophic consequence of a default, something that hasn't  happened since the War of 1812.   On the rule vote that led up to the Fiscal Responsibility Act, again  it was a center-left, center-right coalition that got that measure to  the floor. Fifty-two Democrats voted for the rule, which is unheard of  in this town to have the minority party vote to support the majority  party for a rule, but 52 of us did that. Honestly, I have been here a  while, I consider that one of my proudest votes to make sure that we  were going to look beyond party and do what is right for our country,  in terms of making sure that critical functions at a time like this,  when both domestically and overseas there was so much at stake in terms  of having a stable, functioning government so that we can do the work  for the American people.   Mr. Speaker, there is a military saying which I think Members should  be thinking about today as we approach this critical week, and it says  ``Lead, follow, or get out of the way.'' There is clearly going to be a  bipartisan measure that is going to get put together in the Senate. It  is happening right now as we speak. It is a 45-day extension to keep  the government open, allow the Appropriations Committee to finish its  work. We need to pass that. We need to lead, follow, or get out of the  way.                            ____________________
