 Madam Speaker, April 30 we will commemorate the 46th  anniversary of Black April and the Fall of Saigon. On this day we are  reminded of the pain of losing your homeland and the sacrifices made in  the search for freedom from tyranny.   When Saigon fell in 1975, thousands of families were forced to flee  their home or be brutalized in reeducation camps. Today, the refugees  of Vietnam are proud Americans who are a very important part of our  community and our country.   The United States must always be a beacon of hope to those without  hope. We must continue to stand up for human rights and religious  freedom around the world.                            ____________________
