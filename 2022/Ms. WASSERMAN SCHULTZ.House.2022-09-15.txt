 Madam Speaker, it is my great pleasure to  announce to our colleagues in the United States House of  Representatives that the Congressional Women's Softball Team last night  snapped a 7-year dry spell and beat the press team, the Bad News Babes,  6-5. I am surprised that they are not here to participate in this  exuberance.   It has been 7 long years in the wilderness, and we are so proud to  stand before you and tell you a couple of important things. One is that  our greatest source of pride is that this team is bipartisan.   Madam Speaker, the greatest source of pride for us as a team is that  this team is bipartisan. Ever since our inception in 2009, the  Congressional Women's Softball Team has played across the aisle, in  both Houses, and really tried to set an example every day of how we can  come together, leave our differences off the field, and make sure that  we can come together for a common purpose, and that is fighting breast  cancer and making sure that we can raise awareness about breast cancer  in young women; and, also, to make sure that we can demonstrate that  coming together can help build relationships and foster collaboration  once we leave the field and the game is over.   Most importantly, I am so proud to tell you that our charity, the  Young Survival Coalition, which is a young women's breast cancer  organization that helps young women deal with the unique challenges  that we face when diagnosed with breast cancer, we have raised, in the  last 14 years, $2.6 million for the Young Survival Coalition and, last  night, raised a record, more than $530,000 for YSC.   Very briefly, because I know we are all in a hurry, without the  leadership and dedication of our board of directors, led by Atalie  Ebersole, who is our intrepid committee chair, year in year and out,  she just does an amazing job with the whole organizing committee, and  also--I am annoying. I am going to  [[Page H7858]]  embarrass you--Natalie Buchanan Joyce, please join us. Coach Nat, you  have got to come up here. Tori Barnes, Coach Natalie, Coach Ed, they  are--and Jim Kiley--they are the glue that help make sure that we know  what we are doing and that we can come together as a team every single  year. So thank you.   And then lastly, I acknowledge both Ed Perlmutter and Cheri Bustos.  We occasionally have retirements amongst our colleagues. This year, we  are losing two of our really dear colleagues who have been with us  since the beginning of their time in Congress, and we appreciate their  efforts so much.   And really, lastly, before I turn it over to Congresswoman Bice, for  those of you that have not met me or have not heard my story, I won't  make it lengthy, but I was diagnosed with breast cancer almost 15 years  ago, when I was 41 years old.   One day I was the picture of health. The next day, after doing a  self-exam in the shower, I found a lump and, a few days later, realized  it was breast cancer; and that I had the genetic mutation, BRCA2, which  made me five times more likely of getting breast cancer.   I didn't know I was at that kind of risk as an Ashkenazi Jewish  woman. And if I didn't know, as involved as I had been in the fight  against breast cancer, then I realized, my gosh, how many women don't  know.   So thank you to these incredible women who help us raise awareness  about our Capitol Hill family. Think about all the young woman that  work in this process; and that we can make sure, pay attention to their  breast health; know what is normal for them so they know when something  feels different. And when you catch breast cancer early, you are so  much more likely to survive it.   So thank you to my colleagues. Go Congress. We beat the press. We are  beating cancer.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Oklahoma (Mrs. Bice).    Madam Speaker, go Congress. Beat the press  again next year.                            ____________________
