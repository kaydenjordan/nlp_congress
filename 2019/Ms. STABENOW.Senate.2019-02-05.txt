 Madam President, I am very proud to be a cosponsor of  the Peters amendment, as well as other amendments that Senator Peters  has put forward, and I thank him very much for his leadership.   To me, this is common sense. I am very disappointed that this will  not be included in this bill. I will join Senator Peters in advocating  in the House for this clarification and other changes that will make it  very clear about an individual's right to be able to have freedom of  speech in all of its forms.   It is very unfortunate today that we could not have adopted this  commonsense approach that would have made this bill, I think, stronger  than it is now.   I thank Senator Peters for his hard work on this.
