 Madam Speaker, I thank Ranking Member  Granger. I appreciate her leadership during this trying time of a  pandemic.   Madam Speaker, the last thing that the United States of America needs  right now in the midst of a pandemic is a lapse in government funding  that was set to expire at the end of this month. We need to do better  when it comes to bipartisan agreements.   I am extremely disappointed that it took us this long to get the CCC,  the Commodity Credit Corporation, replenished in this agreement and not  held hostage by the majority. Our farmers, our producers in middle  America that don't know what the market conditions are going to be like  when they harvest their crops, they needed the certainty of knowing  that the United States Government was going to fully fund the risk  management programs that we put in place in a bipartisan way.   I also say thank you to those who were negotiating with Ranking  Member Granger for also including language that provides the USDA with  waiver authority that provides kids, our students, with free meals.  That is something I have been working on over the last few weeks with  my colleagues, Congresswoman Spanberger, Congressman Bacon, and  Congressman Costa.   With this language, we now give our schools, families, and school  nutrition professionals certainty throughout the upcoming school year  in the midst of a pandemic where many may not be able to get that hot  meal that they have been used to getting during the normal school year.   Madam Speaker, I look forward to working with Sonny Perdue, Secretary  Perdue, and the USDA to implement this important language.   Madam Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on this package.
