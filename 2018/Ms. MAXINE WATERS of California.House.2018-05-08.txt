 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to S.J. Res. 57, a  Congressional Review Act resolution to repeal a very important guidance  on indirect auto finance lending that was issued by the Consumer  Financial Protection Bureau all the way back in 2013, in order to  prevent discriminatory lending.   Indirect auto lenders are lenders such as banks that work with car  dealers to finance car loans for consumers. Mr. Speaker, first let me  say that this is an inappropriate and misguided use of the  Congressional Review Act that sets a dangerous precedent. While  congressional Republicans so far have been very active in using the  Congressional Review Act to tear down important regulations that  protect Americans, today they are expanding their harmful efforts even  further to now go after regulatory guidance issued by the Consumer  Bureau years ago. This is a clear overreach that goes way beyond how  the Congressional Review Act was intended to be used.   This resolution is one part of a widespread Republican effort to make  it more difficult to hold financial institutions accountable. The  Consumer Bureau's 2013 guidance on indirect auto lending was issued to  provide clarity to indirect auto lenders and protect auto loan  borrowers from discrimination. This is a market where discriminatory  practices have well been documented. Since its establishment, the  Consumer Bureau has levied more than $140 million in fines and  penalties against lenders for engaging in discriminatory auto lending  practices.   Just this January, an investigation by the National Fair Housing  Alliance found that, 62 percent of the time, highly qualified minority  borrowers seeking purchase and financing options for a car receive more  costly pricing options than less qualified White borrowers receive for  the same vehicle. According to the same report, less qualified White  borrowers were presented with more financing options 75 percent of the  time.   The guidance issued by the Consumer Bureau simply clarified that  indirect auto lenders would be held accountable for violations of the  Equal Credit Opportunity Act, or ECOA, if they took part in  discriminatory practices in the pricing of auto loans. Under ECOA, it  is illegal for a creditor or a lender to discriminate against a person  because of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status,  age, or receipt of income from any public assistance program.   So the issuance of this guidance, which also provided a number of  steps to indirect auto lenders that they could use to ensure that they  were in compliance with the law, was a commonsense action that has both  protected borrowers from unfair practices and helped lenders stay on  the right side of the law.   Proponents of this resolution say to the Consumer Bureau: Oh, you had  no authority to regulate auto dealers. But that is not what is at issue  here today. Let's be clear. The Consumer Bureau's guidance applies to  indirect auto lenders, not automobile dealers.   This resolution would set back efforts to prevent discriminatory auto  lending, make it harder for responsible businesses to follow the law,  and harm consumers. It would not only repeal the Consumer Bureau's  regulatory guidance on auto lending but could also prevent the Consumer  Bureau from ever again issuing ``substantially similar'' guidance on  the matter.   Furthermore, by setting this terrible precedent of repealing  regulatory guidance, the majority is opening up a Pandora's box that  could have deeply harmful consequences for the public and badly impede  the important work of regulators, not just of the financial services  industry but of all industries.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly oppose the resolution and urge Members to  vote ``no.''   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, this is about  discrimination. This is not about false accusations. It is documented  that these car  [[Page H3817]]  lenders have discriminated against people of color.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Wisconsin (Ms.  Moore).    Mr. Speaker, the chairman just said  that junk science was used; however, Republicans put out a report  called, `` `Disparate Impact' Claims Against Vehicle Financing  Businesses.'' Here it is. And guess what. The Center for Responsible  Lending said that was junk science.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr.  Ellison), a senior member of the Financial Services Committee and a  tireless advocate dedicated to combating discrimination.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to  the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline), the ranking member of  the Subcommittee on Regulatory Reform, Commercial and Antitrust Law on  the Judiciary Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I would encourage the  gentlewoman to continue reading so that she can see, under the CFPB  rule, that they have the ability to oversee the lending; and what she  is talking about is the exemption of the automobile dealers,  themselves, but not the lenders.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr.  Takano), the vice ranking member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee.                                time  1545     Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to  the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Foster), a Member who has shown true  leadership in speaking out against this harmful resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1  minute to the gentleman from Illinois.    Mr. Speaker, I can't believe that in  2018 we are on the floor of Congress seeing the denial of some of my  colleagues about discrimination in the auto lending business and  defending the automobile lenders despite the fact there has been a  study that shows that there has been discrimination.   The study should have included women, because they discriminate  against women also. They think women are stupid and don't know how to  negotiate a loan. Women have been taken advantage of too.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs.  Carolyn B. Maloney), the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Capital  Markets of the Financial Services Committee.                                time  1600     Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am sitting here  appalled at what I am hearing from the opposite side of the aisle, the  fact that they would use the Congressional Review Act to attack  guidance and then have the audacity to say in the resolution that they  can never, ever again in perpetuity ever have anything like this again.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   I would ask the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Kelly) to please not  leave, because I want you to know that I am more offended as an  African-American woman than you will ever be.   And this business about making America great again, it is your  President that is dividing this country.   And don't talk to me about the fact that we don't understand. That is  the attitude that has been given toward women time and time again.    I respect the Chair, but don't stop  me in the middle when you didn't stop him in the middle. So I shall  continue.   Don't you dare talk to me like that and think that somehow women  don't understand what goes on on the floor of automobile dealers.    And I am saying that I will continue  to do that. However, I don't appreciate that you did not interrupt him  when he was making those outrageous remarks about him knowing more  about discrimination than I know about discrimination. I resent that.   And I resent the remark about making America great again. He is down  here making a speech for this dishonorable President of the United  States of America.   Having said that, I reserve the balance of my time.  [[Page H3822]]         Mr. Speaker, there are times on the  floor of this Congress that we hear some of the most outrageous  comments in defense of some of the most outrageous practices.   This resolution is yet another harmful piece of legislation from the  majority that should be rejected. Week after week, instead of working  to benefit hardworking Americans and protect the public from abusive  financial institutions, Republicans have advanced legislation to  undermine and remove consumer and investor protections, threaten the  stability of our economy and financial system, and benefit bad actors  in the financial services industry. They are taking our system of  financial regulation in precisely the wrong direction.   Today, as we have discussed, the majority is putting forth a  Congressional Review Act resolution that would repeal important  Consumer Financial Protection Bureau guidance to prevent discrimination  by indirect auto lenders.   This resolution would set back efforts to prevent discriminatory auto  lending, harm consumers, and make it harder for responsible businesses  to follow the law. It is senseless and misguided.                                time  1615    The resolution would also set a dangerous precedent by repealing  years-old regulatory guidance, which is not how the Congressional  Review Act was intended to be used. Opening the door to inappropriate  uses of the Congressional Review Act like this one threatens the  important work of regulators, not just of the financial services  industry, but of all industries.   So I call upon my colleagues across the aisle to work with the  Democrats on policies that strengthen consumer protections, rather than  the harmful rollbacks like the one before us today. I urge Members to  oppose the resolution.   And I want my friends on the opposite side of the aisle to know that  we don't easily get up and talk about discrimination against minorities  and people of color. We don't like to have to do this. We wish that we  had come to a time in the history of this country where it did not  happen.   But I am appalled when the opposite side of the aisle stands up in  strong defense of discrimination. If they were really interested in  working with the Democrats they would say we have a better methodology  of determining whether or not there is discrimination. We want to work  with you. We want to do whatever is necessary to ensure that no one is  discriminated against, yet I hear from Members like Mr. Kelly who come  to the floor talking about we don't know what we are talking about, we  don't understand it, we have never been on the floor of a dealership.   Oh, yes I have. My husband was in the car business. I know a lot  about it.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
