 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise to call up my amendment No. 1588,  which is cosponsored by Senators Graham and Lujan, Barrasso, and  Collins.   This amendment would establish a Foundation for Energy Security and  Innovation, a nonprofit Foundation to support the Department of  Energy's mission to help raise private capital to accelerate the  commercialization of new and cutting-edge technologies.   As China has dramatically ramped up their R&D funding, our Federal  funding has remained stagnant, threatening U.S. competitiveness and our  potential to develop, bring to scale, and export clean energy  technologies.   This amendment will take a model already proven by Foundations  affiliated with the NIH, the CDC, the Department of Agriculture, and  create a Foundation to channel private sector investments into our  world-class scientific innovation institutions, our National Labs.   This new Foundation would support the great work already happening at  [[Page S3493]]  the Department of Energy by leveraging public-private partnerships to  address tech transfer barriers.   Working on this bill over the years, I have heard significant  interest from the private sector and philanthropists looking for an  entity to coordinate their investment.   This bipartisan and bicameral bill passed the House last year with  the leadership of now Senator Lujan, and I urge my colleagues to  support its passage.   I want to thank my partners, Senators Graham and Lujan, for their  leadership and thank Senators Barrasso and Collins for cosponsoring,  Senators Schumer and Manchin for their support, and Senators Wicker,  Cantwell, and Young for their leadership on the Endless Frontier Act.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.
