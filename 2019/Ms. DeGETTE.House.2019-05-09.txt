 Mr. Chair, I thank Chairman Pallone for yielding.   Mr. Chair, I rise in strong support of the Protecting Americans with  Preexisting Conditions Act.   Frankly, if my colleagues on the other side of the aisle were so firm  in their commitment to protecting Americans with preexisting  conditions, they would support this bill, because all it says is that  section 1332 will not stop the protections that we have under current  law.   The Trump administration guidance that allows States to undermine the  preexisting condition provisions of the ACA is, frankly, in clear  violation of congressional intent.   Let's be clear about something. When we say we are going to protect  people with preexisting conditions, we actually mean it. That is  exactly what this legislation does.   I would welcome support from my friends on the other side of the  aisle.   According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, over 750,000 people just  in my little State of Colorado would be at risk of losing their  healthcare coverage if it wasn't for the protections of the ACA.   The administration's repeated attempts to take these protections away  from people and deny them their right to obtain healthcare coverage is  the difference for many of them between life and death.   We are not going to let this happen. This Congress is going to make  sure that the goals of the ACA to give full healthcare coverage to  every American, including people with preexisting conditions, is going  to be preserved. We have come too far to turn back the clock now.   Mr. Chair, I am glad that we have this bill on the floor now. I thank  my colleague, Ms. Kuster, for sponsoring it, and I urge every Member of  this body to support it.
