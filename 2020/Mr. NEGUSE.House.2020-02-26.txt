 Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 560) to amend section 6 of the Joint Resolution entitled ``A  Joint Resolution to approve the Covenant To Establish a Commonwealth of  the Northern Mariana Islands in Political Union with the United States  of America, and for other purposes'', as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 560           Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives       of the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.           This Act may be cited as the ``Northern Mariana Islands       Residents Relief Act''.       SEC. 2. LONG-TERM LEGAL RESIDENTS OF THE COMMONWEALTH OF THE                     NORTHERN MARIANA ISLANDS.           Section 6(e)(6)(B) of the Joint Resolution entitled ``A       Joint Resolution to approve the Covenant To Establish a       Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands in Political       Union with the United States of America, and for other       purposes'', approved March 24, 1976 (48 U.S.C. 1806), is       amended--          (1) in clause (iii), by inserting ``except in the case of       an alien who meets the requirements of subclause (VI) of       clause (v),'' before ``resided continuously and lawfully'';       and          (2) in clause (v)--          (A) in subclause (IV), by striking ``; or'' and inserting       a semicolon;          (B) in subclause (V), by striking the period at the end       and inserting ``;''; and          (C) by adding at the end the following:           ``(VI) was admitted to the Commonwealth as a Commonwealth       Only Transitional Worker during fiscal year 2015, and during       every subsequent fiscal year beginning before the date of the       enactment of the Northern Mariana Islands U.S. Workforce Act       of 2018 (Public Law 115-218); or          ``(VII) resided in the Northern Mariana Islands as an       investor under Commonwealth immigration law, and is presently       a resident classified as a CNMI-only nonimmigrant under       section 101(a)(15)(E)(ii) of the Immigration and Nationality       Act (8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(15)(E)(ii)).''.       SEC. 3. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.           The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, H.R. 560, which was introduced by my colleague, the  Delegate from the Northern Mariana Islands (Mr. Sablan), will address  an issue involving certain long-term residents in his district that was  not addressed when we extended the U.S. immigration laws to the CNMI in  2009.   The Natural Resources Committee held a markup of the bill on  September 18, 2019, and ordered the bill reported favorably to the  House by voice.   Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman  from the Northern Mariana Islands (Mr. Sablan) to explain his  legislation.    Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2427) to amend the Chesapeake Bay Initiative Act of 1998 to  reauthorize the Chesapeake Bay Gateways and Watertrails Network, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2427         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Chesapeake Bay Gateways and       Watertrails Network Reauthorization Act of 2019''.       SEC. 2. REAUTHORIZATION OF CHESAPEAKE BAY GATEWAYS AND                     WATERTRAILS NETWORK.         Section 502(c) of the Chesapeake Bay Initiative Act of 1998       (54 U.S.C. 320101 note; Public Law 105-312) is amended by       striking ``2019'' and inserting ``2025''.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, H.R. 2427, introduced by Representative Sarbanes,  would reauthorize the Chesapeake Bay Gateways and Watertrails Network.   The Chesapeake Bay Gateways and Watertrails Network is a State,  local, and Federal partnership that helps the National Park Service and  its partners connect people to the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries.   This system of more than 170 sites tells the story of the connection  between people and nature throughout the region and has been critical  for expanding public access to the Chesapeake Bay, supporting enhanced  interpretation, education, youth employment, and recreation associated  with the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries.   This program is a great example of collaboration and partnership, and  I want to thank my colleague from Maryland for his hard work to ensure  that it succeeds.   The Chesapeake Bay Gateways and Watertrails Network deserves our  support, and so I urge my colleagues to support this bill and authorize  this program for an additional 5 years.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague from California for  his support of the bill.   In closing, Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 473) to authorize the Every Word We Utter Monument to  establish a commemorative work in the District of Columbia and its  environs, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 473         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. AUTHORIZATION TO ESTABLISH COMMEMORATIVE WORK.         (a) In General.--The Every Word We Utter Monument may       establish a commemorative work on Federal land in the       District of Columbia and its environs to commemorate the       women's suffrage movement and the passage of the 19th       Amendment to the Constitution, which gave women the right to       vote.        (b) Compliance With Standards For Commemorative Works.--The       establishment of the commemorative work under this section       shall be in accordance with chapter 89 of title 40, United       States Code (commonly known as the ``Commemorative Works       Act'').        (c) Prohibition on the Use of Federal Funds.--        (1) In general.--Federal funds may not be used to pay any       expense of the establishment of the commemorative work under       this section.        (2) Responsibility of the every word we utter monument.--      The Every Word We Utter Monument shall be solely responsible       for acceptance of contributions for, and payment of the       expenses of, the establishment of the commemorative work       under this section.  [[Page H1205]]         (d) Deposit of Excess Funds.--        (1) In general.--If upon payment of all expenses for the       establishment of the memorial (including the maintenance and       preservation amount required by section 8906(b)(1) of title       40, United States Code), there remains a balance of funds       received for the establishment of the commemorative work, the       Every Word We Utter Monument shall transmit the amount of the       balance to the Secretary of the Interior for deposit in the       account provided for in section 8906(b)(3) of title 40,       United States Code.        (2) On expiration of authority.--If upon expiration of the       authority for the commemorative work under section 8903(e) of       title 40, United States Code, there remains a balance of       funds received for the establishment of the commemorative       work, the Every Word We Utter Monument shall transmit the       amount of the balance to a separate account with the National       Park Foundation for memorials, to be available to the       Secretary of the Interior or Administrator (as appropriate)       following the process provided in section 8906(b)(4) of title       40, United States Code, for accounts established under       8906(b)(2) or (3) of title 40, United States Code.       SEC. 2. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, ``Every word we utter, every act we perform, waft unto  innumerable circles beyond.'' Those are the words Elizabeth Cady  Stanton that inspired the movement for H.R. 473, which will create  Washington, D.C.'s first statue memorializing the women's suffrage  movement.   Today, we have the opportunity to honor the diverse and  multigenerational group of women who fought for decades to secure women  the right to vote.   This bill is strongly bipartisan and, in accordance with the  Commemorative Works Act, will cost nothing to the Federal Government.  It received positive feedback from the National Capital Memorial  Advisory Commission and passed the Natural Resources Committee with  bipartisan support in October.   Leading women's organizations are in support of H.R. 473, including  the Women's Suffrage Centennial Commission and multiple chapters of the  American Association of University Women as well as the League of Women  Voters.   I am honored to carry this legislation that recognizes and honors the  suffragists' tireless efforts and the ripples of hope and civic  progress they have elicited for generations.   Madam Speaker, I urge your support for this commonsense tribute to  our Nation's history, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I want to thank my colleague from  California for his remarks, and I couldn't agree with him more. I  appreciate his support of this important bill.   Madam Speaker, I have no further requests for time, I am prepared to  close, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I want to thank my colleague and neighbor from the Third District for  his very kind remarks and for his support of this bill, and my fellow  Members of the Colorado delegation for their unanimous support of this  bill.   Madam Speaker, I must take a moment to thank the advocates who have  worked on this legislation for many years, Jane DeDecker, who is a  constituent of mine in the wonderful community of Loveland, Colorado,  who conceptualized the statue for which our bill is named; and the  president of the Every Word We Utter board, Jody Shadduck-McNally, who  also worked tirelessly. Both of these women have worked very hard to  ensure that this piece of women's history and the long legacy of  women's civic engagement that followed is commemorated effectively and  can stand as an inspiration for generations to come.   I would close just on a personal note. As the Speaker knows, my  daughter, Natalie, is just a year and a half old now. As she grows up,  I want her to feel represented, empowered, and assured of the  fundamental role that she plays in  [[Page H1206]]  our society. When Natalie visits our Nation's Capitol, she will  hopefully be able to visit this statue and learn of the great struggle  to ensure her equality and be assured America's sons and daughters  stand on equal footing at the doors of opportunity.   In reverence to the brave women who fought for equality in the past,  and on behalf of all of those who will follow, I thank my fellow  Members for their consideration in support of this legislation.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1315     Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2490) to amend the National Trails System Act to direct the  Secretary of the Interior to conduct a study on the feasibility of  designating the Chief Standing Bear National Historic Trail, and for  other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2490         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. CHIEF STANDING BEAR NATIONAL HISTORIC TRAIL                     FEASIBILITY STUDY.         Section 5(c) of the National Trails System Act (16 U.S.C.       1244(c)) is amended by adding at the end the following:        ``(xx) Chief standing bear national historic trail.--The       Chief Standing Bear Trail, extending approximately 550 miles       from Niobrara, Nebraska, to Ponca City, Oklahoma, which       follows the route taken by Chief Standing Bear and the Ponca       people during Federal Indian removal, and approximately 550       miles from Ponca City, Oklahoma, through Omaha, Nebraska, to       Niobrara, Nebraska, which follows the return route taken by       Chief Standing Bear and the Ponca people.''.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, H.R. 2490, introduced by Representative Fortenberry of  Nebraska, would direct the Secretary of the Interior to study the  feasibility of designating the Chief Standing Bear National Historic  Trail.   The proposed trail would extend approximately 550 miles from  Niobrara, Nebraska, to Ponca City, Oklahoma, tracing the route taken by  Chief Standing Bear during Federal Indian removal and their return to  Nebraska.   The trail would commemorate and elevate the story of Chief Standing  Bear, and the trail would memorialize the honor, the courage, and the  fortitude of Chief Standing Bear and the Ponca people as they struggled  to return to their homeland. It would serve as a reminder of their  fight to achieve justice, freedom, and equality.   Madam Speaker, I thank Representative Fortenberry for championing  this important legislation and for his efforts to bring about a greater  understanding of Tribal sovereignty and rights.   Madam Speaker, I certainly urge my colleagues to support this  important bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I again thank my colleague from Nebraska  for his leadership and for bringing this important bill, and I urge my  colleagues to support it.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2819) to extend the authority for the establishment of a  commemorative work in honor of Gold Star Families, and for other  purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2819         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Gold Star Mothers Families       National Monument Extension Act''.       SEC. 2. EXTENSION OF AUTHORITY FOR ESTABLISHMENT OF                     COMMEMORATIVE WORK.         Notwithstanding section 8903(e) of title 40, United States       Code, the authority provided by section 2859 of the Military       Construction Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013 (division       B of Public Law 112-239; 126 Stat. 2164; 40 U.S.C. 8903 note)       shall continue to apply through January 2, 2024.       SEC. 3. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, H.R. 2819, introduced by Representative Kim, would  extend the authorization for the establishment of the commemorative  work to Gold Star Families until 2024.   I thank my freshman colleague, Representative Kim, for bringing  forward this critically important bill and for his leadership in the  Committee on Armed Services and the Committee on Small Business.   The Gold Star Families National Monument would honor the families of  those who have made the ultimate sacrifices for our country. This  commemorative work was initially authorized in the National Defense  Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013, but the authorization expired  in January 2020.   Madam Speaker, the Gold Star is a widely recognized tradition that  dates back to World War I, when families displayed service flags  bearing a blue star for each family member serving in combat. If a  relative was lost in combat, the star's color would be changed to gold.   In November 2015, the Commission of Fine Arts approved a location for  the memorial on National Park Service property immediately west of the  Arlington National Cemetery visitor center. Since then, the National  Capital Memorial Advisory Commission has consulted with the Gold Star  Mothers National Monument Foundation on design concepts for the  memorial.   While we can never repay the debt that we owe our Nation's Gold Star  families, extending the authorization for this memorial helps take a  step toward fully honoring the sacrifices they have made, which is why  this bill is so important and why I would like to, again, thank  Representative Kim for his leadership in introducing it.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  distinguished gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Kim).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation. I thank  Representative Kim and Representative Ratcliffe for bringing the bill  forward.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 3399) to amend the Nutria Eradication and Control Act of  2003 to include California in the program, and for other purposes, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3399         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. NUTRIA ERADICATION.         The Nutria Eradication and Control Act of 2003 (Public Law       108-16) is amended--        (1) in section 2--        (A) in subsection (a)--        (i) in paragraph (1), by striking ``Wetlands and tidal       marshes of the Chesapeake Bay and in Louisiana'' and       inserting ``Wetlands, tidal marshes, and agricultural       lands'';        (ii) in paragraph (2), by striking ``in Maryland and       Louisiana''; and        (iii) by amending paragraph (3) to read as follows:        ``(3) Traditional harvest methods to control or eradicate       nutria have failed. Consequently, marsh loss, loss of public       and private wetlands, and loss of agricultural lands are       accelerating.''; and        (B) in subsection (b), by striking ``the State of Maryland       and the State of Louisiana'' and inserting ``any State that       has demonstrated the need''; and        (2) in section 3--        (A) by amending subsection (a) to read as follows:        ``(a) Grant Authority.--The Secretary of the Interior       (referred to in this Act as the `Secretary'), may provide       financial assistance to a State, in an amount that is in       proportion to the total impacted area of such State affected       by nutria, that has demonstrated to the Secretary sufficient       need for a program to implement measures to eradicate or       control nutria and restore marshland, public and private       wetlands, and agricultural lands damaged by nutria.'';        (B) by striking subsection (b);        (C) in subsection (d)--        (i) in paragraph (1), by striking ``the program may'' and       inserting ``a State program referred to in subsection (a)       may''; and        (ii) in paragraph (2), by striking ``the program may'' and       inserting ``a State program referred to in subsection (a)       may'';        (D) in subsection (e), by inserting ``to a State'' after       ``provided'';        (E) in subsection (f), by striking ``$4,000,000'' and all       that follows and inserting ``$12,000,000 for each of fiscal       years 2021 through 2025.''; and        (F) by redesignating subsections (c) through (f) as       subsections (b) through (e).     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  [[Page H1209]]  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the measure under consideration    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in support of H.R. 3399, the Nutria Eradication and Control  Act of 2003.   In case you were not lucky enough to see the stuffed nutria that the  distinguished gentleman from California brought to our hearing in the  Natural Resources Committee, you are in luck, because I understand that  it is making another appearance here today on the floor.   You can see firsthand that nutria are a large, invasive rodent  species that have infested and damaged wetlands across the United  States.   This species was originally introduced to the United States in 1899  for fur production, but its rapid breeding and destructive burrowing  became a huge problem in areas like the Gulf of Mexico and the  Chesapeake Bay.   In 2003, by way of background, Congress passed the Nutria Eradication  and Control Act to provide assistance to Maryland and Louisiana to  eradicate or control nutria and to restore wetlands destroyed by  nutria. According to some estimates, if these measures had not been  adopted, nutria could have destroyed 17 percent of the Chesapeake Bay's  marshes in a 50-year period.   While this program has been successful in Maryland and Louisiana, now  the nutria have invaded habitats across the United States.   Representative Harder's much-needed bill would expand the Nutria  Eradication and Control Act of 2003 to include any State with a nutria  infestation issue and make them eligible for funding under the act.   It is important to consider this bill in the context of the state of  our wildlife and habitat today. Species are going extinct at a faster  rate than ever before in human history. Habitat loss is a major driver  of the extinction crisis that we are experiencing, and so protecting  and restoring wetlands from invasive species like nutria is an  important piece of the puzzle for protecting biodiversity in our  country.   In the face of the climate crisis, we must do all we can to protect  habitat and wildlife, and eradicating this destructive invasive species  is a step in the right direction.   I thank my distinguished colleague from California for his leadership  in introducing this bill, and I urge my colleagues to support it.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from California (Mr. Harder) and his nutria, whose name is  Nellie.    Madam Speaker, I very much enjoyed this fascinating  debate, and I appreciate the leadership of our colleague from Louisiana  on this issue for many years and, of course, our colleague from  California for initiating the bill before the House.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support it, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1492) to update the map of, and modify the maximum acreage  available for inclusion in, the Yucca House National Monument, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1492         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Yucca House National       Monument Expansion Act''.       SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.         In this Act:        (1) National monument.--The term ``National Monument''       means the Yucca House National Monument in Cortez, Colorado,       established by Presidential Proclamation 1549.        (2) Map.--The term ``map'' means the map entitled ``Yucca       House National Monument Proposed Boundary Addition'',       numbered 318/105,085A, and dated February 27, 2019.        (3) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary       of the Interior.       SEC. 3. YUCCA HOUSE NATIONAL MONUMENT LAND ACQUISITION.         (a) Acquisition.--The Secretary may acquire by donation the       approximately 160 acres of land and any interests in the land       that is identified on the map.        (b) Boundary.--On the acquisition of the land authorized       under subsection (a), the Secretary shall adjust the       boundaries of the National Monument to include the acquired       land.        (c) Administration.--The land and any interests in land       acquired under subsection (a) shall be administered as part       of the National Monument.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1492, sponsored by my  friend and fellow Coloradan, Representative Tipton. This bill would  support access to one of the most significant cultural and  archaeological sites in southwest Colorado, the Yucca House National  Monument.   Yucca House was an important community center for the ancestral  Puebloan people and serves as an enduring example of the history of  these lands. H.R. 1492 would add 160 acres of donated land to the  monument, quintupling the size of the site and guaranteeing permanent  public access.   The addition would also allow the National Park Service to build a  new public entrance to the monument, including parking, visitor  services, and interpretive facilities. This new access will allow more  Americans to utilize and learn about the exceptional ancestral Puebloan  sites protected at the monument.   I congratulate my colleague on his efforts to support access with  respect to this monument and to help enhance our appreciation for the  Native American history enshrined in the kivas, towers, and plazas of  the Yucca House National Monument.   As a fellow lover of Colorado's public lands and public land  heritage, I again thank the gentleman for his leadership on this bill  and certainly urge my colleagues to support it.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, again, I thank my colleague, friend, and  neighbor, Mr. Tipton, for his leadership on this bill. I certainly urge  my colleagues to support it.   I also want to make sure we take a moment to take stock and reflect  on the benefits of the Antiquities Act of 1906, that bedrock law signed  into law by President Teddy Roosevelt so long ago that has enabled us  to move forward with protecting monuments like the one included in the  bill that is before the House today.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
