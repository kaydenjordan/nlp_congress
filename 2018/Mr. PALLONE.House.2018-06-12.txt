 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the opioid crisis has left no one untouched by its  destruction. Every age, sex, race, and socioeconomic class has felt the  weight of the opioid epidemic and the disastrous effects it has on the  lives of those in our Nation.   As this epidemic continues to grow, we have seen a dramatic increase  in the number of children who are suffering opioid overdoses. A study  published in Pediatrics earlier this year found that the number of  children admitted to hospitals from opioid overdoses has nearly doubled  since 2004. Another study found that kids between 12 and 17 accounted  for 60 percent of the opioid overdoses in the pediatric population.   In 2016, nearly 4,000 children and young adults between the ages of 5  and 24 years old died from overdose due to opioids, and that is why I  support H.R. 449. This bipartisan legislation would require the Surgeon  General to report on the public health impacts of synthetic drug use  and abuse by adolescents between the ages of 12 and 18.   Surgeon General reports have produced some of the most preeminent  public health data available on some of the Nation's most pressing  public health crises, from the adverse health consequences of tobacco  use to reports on nutrition, HIV/AIDS, and violence. This is an  important bill because it will allow the Surgeon General to address the  impact of synthetic drug use on the youth population, and highlight the  need for increased prevention efforts in the future.  [[Page H5030]]    This bill, like so many of the bills we are considering today, helps  raise awareness of the opioid crisis, and helps us to continue to chart  a path forward in addressing this epidemic.   But, Mr. Speaker, I am concerned that collectively these 57-plus  bills we will consider in total, do not go far enough in providing the  resources necessary for an epidemic of this magnitude. With 115  Americans dying every day, we must ensure that people have access to  treatment. The bills the House will debate this week do not do enough  to expand treatment for millions suffering from this crisis.   Additionally, Mr. Speaker, I would be remiss if I did not also  acknowledge that the Republicans' ongoing efforts to repeal the  Affordable Care Act gut Medicaid and take away critical protections for  people with preexisting conditions, and would have a devastating impact  on people who suffer from opioid substance abuse.   When discussing the opioid crisis on the floor this week, I urge my  colleagues to remember that protecting and expanding access to care is  the most critical piece of the puzzle. And any efforts to roll back the  Affordable Care Act, such as another Republican-led attempt to repeal  the Affordable Care Act and gut Medicaid, will hurt those who need it  most.   With that said, I am pleased to support H.R. 449 and the other bills  we will consider under suspension of the rules today.   Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as he may consume to the gentleman  from New York (Mr. Jeffries), the sponsor of H.R. 449.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I would also urge my colleagues to support  this legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5473, legislation offered by  my colleagues, Representatives Lujan and Comstock.   H.R. 5473 would provide greater clarity to drug and device  manufacturers regarding the studies that should be conducted for  purposes of making claims on the labeling of medical products that they  may replace, delay, or reduce the use of opioids.   This is practical legislation, Mr. Speaker, that I believe will help  to encourage manufacturers to do the necessary work to determine how we  can identify for providers and patients medical products that can serve  as alternatives to the use of opioids for purposes of pain treatment.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote in support of H.R. 5473,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from New Mexico (Mr. Ben Ray Lujan), who is one of the  sponsors of this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I also ask that my colleagues support this  bipartisan legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3331, sponsored by  Representative Lynn Jenkins and Representative Doris Matsui, and I  commend my colleagues for their work on the bill.   One of the reasons why the opioid crisis is so intractable is the  lack of access to behavioral health services in all of our communities,  and the continued segregation of behavioral health from physical  health.   For decades, we have neglected our behavioral health infrastructure,  and siloed behavioral health from our broader healthcare system. The  lack of integration between behavioral and physical health has had  serious consequences for patients, including poor to non-existent  coordination of care, severe provider shortages, and poor health  outcomes.   One barrier in addressing true integration has been that behavioral  health providers in large part don't have access to electronic health  records, and were left out of the push to update electronic health  records systems. That is an unfortunate legacy that we are still  dealing with today.   H.R. 3331 takes an important step in addressing this problem. It is a  bipartisan bill that would incentivize behavioral health providers to  adopt electronic health record technology, through the Centers for  Medicare & Medicaid Innovation.   While this is an important bill, I want to underscore that it is  incremental and it is limited. I want to reiterate my continuing  concern that while Democrats support working on a legislative package  to address the opioid crisis, we must first assure that we do no harm.   And I must remind everyone that Republican efforts to dismantle and  sabotage the ACA would do serious harm to our healthcare system, and to  folks with substance use disorders specifically.   Just last week, the Trump Administration requested that a federal  court eliminate the protections in the ACA for people with preexisting  conditions. That includes people with opioid use disorders, whose  access to health insurance and vital treatment for opioid use disorders  would be taken away if the Trump Administration is successful.   The opioids package cannot be considered in a vacuum. Mark my words-- Republican efforts to tear down the ACA and the Medicaid program will  not only reverse any gains we may make from these efforts today, but  will to inflict broad, lasting harm to our healthcare system, and to  our ability to fight the opioid crisis.   Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman  from California (Ms. Matsui).    Mr. Speaker, I have no other speakers.   I urge support of the legislation, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4284, the Indexing Narcotics,  Fentanyl, and Opioids Act, or INFO Act.   The opioid crisis is a complex issue that requires an all-hands-on- deck approach. Communities across the Nation are being ravaged by this  crisis, and many are working hard to find ways to stop it.   With 115 people dying every day from opioid overdoses, communities  could benefit from sharing effective interventions to decrease opioid  use disorder and overdose deaths and having one-stop access to Federal  resources, including grant funding announcements, available to support  their efforts.   The INFO Act would create a central repository for information on  programs within HHS related to the reduction of opioid abuse and other  substance use disorders, as well as how communities nationwide are  tackling the opioid epidemic. In this way, folks across the country can  work together and learn from one another.   This easily accessible, electronic public dashboard would allow for  strategies to combat this crisis to be shared and served as a resource  to patients, loved ones of those with opioid use disorder, and local  communities.   The INFO Act also would establish an interagency substance use  disorder coordinating committee to help coordinate response efforts to  the opioid epidemic within HHS.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4684, the Ensuring Access to  Quality Sober Living Act of 2018, introduced by Representative Chu.   This bill would require the Department of Health and Human Services  to work with stakeholders, including individuals with substance use  disorders and recovery housing groups, to develop best practices for  operating recovery housing.   The Energy and Commerce Committee's bipartisan investigation into  disreputable sober homes and associated patient brokers and treatment  facilities has made clear that we must do more to ensure that  individuals with an opioid use disorder are not being taken advantage  of by entities seeking to treat such individuals as commodities rather  than people in need of treatment.   In fact, in far too many instances, these homes and providers offered  no treatment at all. In other instances, where treatment is offered, it  is only provided to increase the provider's profits. In the worst  instances, these rogue providers go so far as to help individuals stop  their illicit use of opioids for the duration of their insurance limit  for a given treatment service, only to supply opioids to these same  individuals after they are released so they can relapse and their  insurance once again can be milked for the duration of the benefit  limit.   Such providers are not only harmful to patients trying to stop their  illicit use of opioids and enter recovery, this substandard treatment  also costs many individuals their lives.   Mr. Speaker, our investigation also has revealed that individuals  with opioid use disorder and their families are particularly  susceptible to such schemes, because there is not adequate information  available to help them determine whether a facility is a quality  provider of recovery housing or to detect the fraudulent intent of such  actors. Many rely on bad information obtained through internet searches  or questionable referrals from individuals who are actually patient  brokers and paid to deliver patients to the highest bidding sober home  or treatment provider.   The bill before us, the Ensuring Access to Quality Sober Living Act,  aims to prevent the often tragic consequences of the patient brokering  schemes that send individuals to low-quality sober homes and treatment  providers.   I want to thank Ms. Chu for all she has done to move this bill. This  legislation requires Health and Human Services, in coordination with  the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and with stakeholders,  to establish best practices that will aid States in establishing  standards for the recovery houses, help recovery housing providers in  establishing and maintaining housing that meets the highest quality of  service delivery, and help individuals and their families identify what  to look for in a quality provider of recovery housing.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Judy Chu), the sponsor of the  legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5002, the Advancing Cutting  Edge, or ACE, Research Act.   This bill would grant NIH other transactions authority that allows  NIH flexibility in entering into agreements for cutting-edge research  that can lead to increased understanding of prevention, diagnosis, or  treatment of diseases or disorders, including substance use disorder,  as well as research that is urgently needed to respond to a public  health threat, such as the opioid crisis.   I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I commend Representative Dingell for her leadership on  this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the  gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. Dingell).    Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers.   I would urge support for this legislation, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak on H.R. 5800, the Medicaid  Institutions of Mental Disease ADDITIONAL INFO Act.   This bill would require the Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access  Commission to conduct a comparative study to assess IMD quality in  States and issue a report on requirements applicable to and practices  of institutions for mental disease under the Medicaid program.   We know that nearly half of all States already have or have applied  for 1,115 waivers that allow for IMD services to be provided to  patients with substance use disorder. Additional States provide IMD  services already to patients in Medicaid through their managed care  programs.   It is important to understand the overall quality of institutions of  mental disease that exists throughout the country. This cannot be  accomplished without data on our current IMDs.   The study will include information on how many institutions for  mental disease are within States coverage limitations, services they  provide, whether States have a waiver to provide such coverage through  Medicaid, and funding involved with such institutions. Additionally,  this study will seek recommendations on how State Medicaid programs can  provide the standards of care provided by IMDs.    Additional data is obviously a good goal, particularly on IMD  coverage, given the controversy surrounding this issue, and so I  support this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I would also urge my colleagues to support  the bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5009.   Mr. Speaker, I support H.R. 5009.   As we know, opioid use a disorder is a medical condition that  requires lifelong management. Even if someone has completed treatment  successfully and is in long-term recovery, the risk of relapse remains.  [[Page H5043]]    A patient recovering from opioid use disorder may visit a healthcare  provider or require medical interventions that typically result in the  need to treat pain.   However, for those affected with opioid use disorder, a prescription  of an opioid medication could cause individuals to relapse into misuse  and lead to an overdose or even death.   H.R. 5009, Jessie's Law, is bipartisan legislation introduced by Rep.  Walberg (R-MI) and Rep. Dingell (D-MI) that would require the  Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to convene appropriate  stakeholders and develop best practices for displaying opioid use  disorder history prominently on a patient's medical records, whenever  requested by a patient.   This legislation would enable patients suffering from opioid use  disorder to choose to share their history with opioids with healthcare  providers and have that information prominently displayed in their  medical record--allowing for better informed, safer pain management  care.   This legislation would also require HHS to annually develop and  disseminate written materials to health care providers regarding  permitted disclosures of certain information to families, caregivers,  and health care providers under Federal health care privacy laws during  emergencies.   This will improve the awareness of providers of instances in which  they may share information about a patient's overdose with their  family.   I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman  from Michigan (Mrs. Dingell), one of the sponsors, Mrs. Dingell.    Mr. Speaker, I also urge my colleagues to support this  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5041, legislation offered by  Representative Walberg, Representative Dingell, and Representative  Hudson, that will allow hospice workers to safely dispose of controlled  substances, thereby reducing the number of unused controlled substances  that are at risk of diversion or misuse.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5041, legislation offered by  Representatives Walberg, Dingell, and Hudson that will allow hospice  workers to safely dispose of controlled substances, thereby reducing  the number of unused controlled substances that are at risk of  diversion or misuse.   The diversion of unused prescription opioids is one of the major  contributors to the opioid crisis facing our country. It has been  estimated that around 70 percent of those who abuse opioids receive  them from a friend or family, making it critical that strategies be put  in place that will limit the ability for leftover controlled substances  to fall into the wrong hands.   Current regulations prevent hospice personnel from handling or  destroying controlled substances following a patient's passing unless a  state or locality allows them to do so under law. As a result, hospice  workers have no choice but to leave behind controlled substances that  may be at risk for abuse or misuse by those who were never intended to  have access to such medications. H.R. 5041 would clarify that hospice  workers would have the authority to handle controlled substances for  purposes of disposal following a patient's passing.   H.R. 5041 also makes clear that hospice workers tasked with disposing  of unneeded controlled substances receive training through a qualified  hospice program on how to properly dispose of these substances to  ensure they cannot be extracted for purposes of further abuse. In  addition, the legislation would also require hospice personnel to keep  records on the disposal of the controlled substance, including what  controlled substances were destroyed, as well as the time and manner in  which the disposal occurred.   I want to thank the sponsors of H.R. 5041, Representatives Walberg,  Dingell, and Hudson for their work on this legislation, as well as the  National Association for Home Care & Hospice and the National Hospice  and Palliative Care Organization for their support and thoughtful  input.   Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to support this commonsense legislation,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the  gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. Dingell).    Mr. Speaker, I also urge my colleagues to support the  bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5102, the Substance Use  Disorder Workforce Loan Repayment Act. This bill would create a loan  repayment program to provide loan repayment assistance to substance use  disorder providers in exchange for providing substance use disorder  treatment and recovery support services in areas with high need for  such services.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.   I thank the main sponsor, Representative Clark, for her leadership  and Representative Sarbanes.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the  gentlewoman from Massachusetts (Ms. Clark).    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Sarbanes).    Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers, so I urge  support for the bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in support of H.R. 5176, Preventing Overdoses While in  Emergency Rooms Act. This legislation would provide grant funding for  emergency departments to develop protocols for treating and discharging  patients who have presented with an opioid overdose or are at increased  risk for overdose.   These protocols will help increase the uptake of evidence-based  treatment services by promoting the initiation of medication-assisted  treatment in emergency departments, as well as referral to community- based providers for treatment and recovery support services.   This is particularly important since an individual's willingness to  seek substance use disorder treatment often increases immediately  following a nonfatal overdose.   The protocols also will help reduce the risk of future fatal  overdoses by such individuals by requiring the provision of naloxone at  discharge. This helps ensure that these individuals at high risk of  overdose have this lifesaving drug available if it is needed to reverse  a potentially fatal overdose.   So I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to voice my strong support for H.R. 5228,  legislation that I authored that will strengthen FDA's ability to  prevent illicit opioids from coming in through our international mail  facilities by providing the agency with additional enforcement  authority and financial resources.   In April, Mr. Speaker, I had the opportunity to visit an  international mail facility in my home State of New Jersey with the  Food and Drug Administration, Customs and Border Patrol, and the U.S.  Postal Service, and to see firsthand the problems that these agencies  are facing when it comes to illegal, unapproved drugs entering our  country through international mail facilities.   FDA staff showed us boxes of pills that had limited labeling,  labeling in foreign languages, or no labeling at all, and were sent  from unknown and unregistered facilities. FDA staff explained that it  takes the agency days to catalog these boxes, identify what products  contained inside are legitimate, and identify what products, under  current law, the agency can destroy.   FDA then had no other option but to return that box to the sender.  This leaves open the possibility that the sender will just drop the box  of illegal pills back in the mail and try to enter the country again  through another international mail facility.   The agency also showed me a series of similarly wrapped and marked  packages that contained little labeling and were misidentified as  gifts. Upon inspection, these packages included bags of drugs, some  labeled and some labeled in another language. Again, the agency faced  the task of trying to identify if the product was a drug before it  could take further action.   Now, the SCREEN Act, the bill before us, which passed the Energy and  Commerce Committee by a voice vote, would give FDA authority to act in  these situations to stop illicit drugs from entering the marketplace  and allow the agency to better target their resources.   Specifically, the SCREEN Act would, first, expand FDA's authority to  refuse or destroy illegal drugs; second, provide FDA with the ability  to order manufacturers to cease distribution or to recall drugs that  pose an imminent or substantial hazard to the public health. Third, it  would allow FDA to refuse admission or to destroy bulk shipments of  drugs from manufacturers, distributors, or importers, if they are found  to be misbranded or adulterated. Then it would authorize new resources  to help provide additional capacity at international mail facilities  and to upgrade infrastructure, equipment, and other needed technology  for screening purposes.   Mr. Speaker, having worked closely with FDA on this legislation, I  know that the authorities outlined in the SCREEN Act will go a long way  toward empowering the agency to take on repeated illicit drug  traffickers and ensure that dangerous, unapproved drugs are stopped at  our ports and at our mail facilities.   I urge my colleagues to vote in support of this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers. I urge my  colleagues to support the bill, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5261, the TEACH to Combat  Addiction Act, and I want to thank Mr. Tonko, the Democratic sponsor of  the bill.   While the evidence is clear that medication-assisted treatment is the  gold standard for treatment of opioid use disorder, many healthcare  providers know little about this lifesaving treatment. Providers'  limited knowledge of and training on substance use disorder treatment  and recovery support services, such as MAT, harms efforts to respond to  patients who suffer from such conditions.   The TEACH to Combat Addiction Act will help improve providers'  knowledge and training on such services by establishing centers of  excellence and substance use disorder education. These centers will  support the development, evaluation, and distribution of evidence-based  curricula for health professional schools on substance use disorder  prevention, treatment, and recovery. Such curricula can be used to help  ensure that we get the right curriculum and training to all different  kinds of healthcare providers.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from New York (Mr. Tonko), our Democratic sponsor.    Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers.   I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill, H.R. 5272, and I want to  thank Mr. Engel, the Democratic sponsor.   The purpose of this legislation is to promote the increased uptake of  evidence-based treatment by individuals with mental health and  substance use disorders.                                time  1630    We know that increasing the utilization of evidence-based treatment  for behavioral health disorders results in improved outcomes. This is  particularly important for individuals with opioid use disorder, as we  know that MAT is the gold standard for treatment and is associated with  improved retention in treatment, decreased relapse rates, and decreased  fatal and nonfatal overdoses.   Expanding access to and uptake of MAT as well as other evidence-based  behavioral health treatments, as promoted by this bill, is a critical  piece to combating the tragic opioid epidemic, so I encourage my  colleagues to support this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman  from New York (Mr. Engel).    Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers. I would ask  support for the bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5327, the Comprehensive Opioid  Recovery Centers Act.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5327, the Comprehensive Opioid  Recovery Centers Act.   More than 21 million individuals in this country need substance abuse  treatment, but we know there are numerous barriers to accessing help  for substance abuse disorder.   One of the many barriers that exists is the gap in healthcare  providers available to treat opioid use disorder.   Worsening the situation, our current healthcare system and the  methods of treating substance abuse disorders is often fragmented,  leading to incomplete patient care.   Without a standardized way of approaching screening or treatment for  opioid use disorder, treatment centers use a range of methods to manage  opioid use disorder, some are more successful than others.   H.R. 5327, bipartisan legislation which would require SAMHSA to  provide grants to develop comprehensive opioid recovery centers will  begin to address some of the deficits in opioid use disorder care.   These centers will provide outreach to help educate the communities  about opioid and other substance use disorders, assist with  coordination of treatment, and offer recovery activities.   The comprehensive opioid recovery centers will use best practices, to  deliver integrated opioid use disorder care, giving other treatment  centers a model to look towards, improving the quality of OUD  treatment.   Improving access to evidence-based substance use disorder treatments  is critical for ensuring patients get the care that they need.   I urge my colleagues to support this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. Gene Green), who is the ranking member of our Health  Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from New Mexico (Mr. Ben Ray Lujan), who is one of the  Democratic sponsors.  [[Page H5057]]         Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers. I urge my  colleagues to support the bill, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5329, the Poison Center  Network Enhancement Act.   I want to thank Mr. Engel, the Democratic sponsor, for his  leadership.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5329, the Poison Center  Network Enhancement Act.   This legislation reauthorizes the Health Resources and Services  Administration's (HRSA) Poison Control Center program.   Poison control centers provide essential support to the public and  healthcare providers nationwide.   They assist with guiding the public to appropriate medical care and  advise physicians and other healthcare providers on the appropriate  medical management whenever an exposure to a poison has occurred.   There are over 70 Poison control centers in the U.S and U.S.  Territories and they serve a vital role in our emergency  infrastructure, operating 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.   The centers handle calls concerning over 430,000 different  substances, but in recent years have seen a huge increase in calls  related to opioid exposure.   Receive nearly 200 consults per day on opioid related exposures  alone.   There is no doubt that Poison control centers play a role in fighting  the national opioid epidemic.   I support this legislation and continuation of the great work our  nation's Poison Control centers do.   I urge my colleagues to support this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman  from New York (Mr. Engel).    Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers. I urge my  colleagues to support the bill, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5353, Eliminating Opioid  Related Infectious Diseases Act.   As the opioid epidemic has grown, so have infectious diseases related  to intravenous opioid drug abuse. These infectious diseases include  serious blood-borne illnesses such as HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis  C, which have devastating health consequences and require long-term  treatment.   In 2015, a community in Indiana experienced an outbreak of HIV in  over 200 individuals related to intravenous use of oxymorphone. These  infections also include infections from skin flora such as MRSA.   Last week, CDC released a report finding that people who inject drugs  are more than 16 times more likely to develop invasive MRSA infections.  In the midst of an opioid epidemic, it is more important than ever to  bolster national surveillance and education efforts on the infectious  diseases related to use of IV drugs.   The Eliminating Opioid Related Infectious Diseases Act of 2018, the  bill before us, authorizes the CDC to improve surveillance of  infections associated with intravenous drug use, such as HIV, infective  endocarditis, and MRSA. The CDC can help reduce the rate of infectious  diseases from intravenous drug use through the development and  distribution of public educational materials on risks associated with  intravenous drug use.   This legislation, Mr. Speaker, would also help by improving the  education and training of healthcare professionals on how to detect and  treat intravenous drug use-associated infections, leading to better  management, fewer complications, and overall improved quality of care  for those suffering from IV-related infectious diseases.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. I have  no further speakers, and I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1700     =========================== NOTE ===========================        June 12, 2018, on page H5060, the following appeared: 1500  Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5483, legislation that will  direct the Drug Enforcement Agency to take action to allow registered  healthcare practitioners to practice telemedicine. I want to thank our  Democratic sponsor, Mrs. Bustos from Illinois.   If we are to end the cycle of opioid abuse and addiction, more must  be done to help provide those suffering with access to treatment.  However, I am optimistic that the legislation before us now authored by  Representatives Bustos and Carter will offer one way forward to  providing more individuals suffering from addiction with access to  treatment by enabling the use of telemedicine.   Telemedicine offers one opportunity to potentially reach more  patients who could not otherwise access treatment, whether due to  geographic reasons, provider access issues, financial concerns about  in-person treatment, or the stigma of seeking treatment.   While DEA has the authority to establish a special registration  pathway for purposes of treating a patient via telemedicine, DEA has  not acted to do so to date. The Special Registration for Telemedicine  Clarification Act of 2018 would direct the Attorney General to issue  regulations establishing a special registration process for engaging in  the practice of telemedicine within a year of enactment.   This approach will enable telemedicine to finally be deployed in  treating patients with addiction, while still allowing DEA to ensure  that there are appropriate safeguards in place to mitigate against the  use of telemedicine in any manner that could further exacerbate the  opioid crisis.   This is practical legislation that I believe will help open access to  treatment, and I urge my colleagues to vote in support of the bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman  from Illinois (Mrs. Bustos), the sponsor of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I also urge my colleagues to support the  bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this bill would require the Department of Health and  Human Services to conduct a study and submit to Congress a report on  the adequacy of access to abuse-deterrent opioid formulations for  individuals with chronic pain enrolled in Medicare Advantage or part D.                                time  1715    While I am hesitant about the true impact abuse-deterrent  formulations can have in addressing this crisis, especially given that  these formulations can still lead to opioid dependance and misuse, I  also recognize that we must be utilizing every tool available to combat  this epidemic.   I am especially glad that this bill includes language to address the  price of abuse-deterrent formulations as well. It is critical, when  evaluating the adequacy of access, to also study the price of such drug  formulations, as cost is a critical component of access.   Mr. Speaker, I support the bill, and I urge my colleagues to support  the bill.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5583, which would require all  Medicaid programs to report on behavioral health quality measures in  Medicaid, and I thank the sponsor, Ms. Clarke.   The Medicaid behavioral health core set of measures contains 16 key  measures used by CMS to measure and evaluate the quality of behavioral  healthcare that is being provided by State Medicaid and CHIP agencies.  Recently, CMS added two additional measures related to opioids.   The core set is designed to help ensure that those with behavioral  healthcare needs are receiving appropriate screening management and  follow-up for their mental health conditions, such as substance abuse  disorder, including opioid use disorders, ADHD, depression, or  schizophrenia.   Currently, the behavioral health core set is a quality measure.  However, given the expanse of the opioid epidemic and need to improve  mental healthcare quality and coordination for those with substance  abuse disorders and all patients, mandatory reporting will ensure we  have a standard nationwide dataset on the quality of behavioral health  treatment that our beneficiaries receive under Medicaid.   Quality treatment is vital to assist in bolstering our Nation's  mental health and substance abuse care and in improving our healthcare  system's ability to fight the opioid epidemic. I urge my colleagues to  support this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as she may consume to the  gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Clarke).    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5685, sponsored by  Representatives  John Faso and Peter Welch. I commend my colleagues for  their work on this important bill.   We know that opioid abuse and misuse is a significant and growing  problem in the Medicare population. We know that we need to do more,  not only to bring down opioid prescribing, but to make seniors aware of  the dangers of opioid addiction and the existence of alternatives.                                time  1730    H.R. 5685 would add educational resources regarding opioid use and  nonopioid pain management alternatives to the ``Medicare & You''  handbook, which is mailed to all Medicare households each fall.   While this is an important bill, I want to underscore that it is  incremental and it is limited. I want to reiterate my continuing  concern that  [[Page H5066]]  while Democrats support working on a legislative package to address the  opioid crisis, we must first assure that we do no harm.   The Trump administration and Congressional Republicans' efforts to  dismantle the Affordable Care Act would do serious harm to our  healthcare system, and to individuals suffering from opioid use  disorders specifically.   For instance, the Trump administration continues to undermine the  individual market by promoting junk insurance plans, such as short-term  limited duration health plans. These plans, which would be medically  underwritten and would exclude individuals with preexisting conditions,  would make coverage in the Affordable Care Act compliant market much  more expensive. This would make coverage for individuals who need  comprehensive coverage, such as individuals with opioid use disorders,  less affordable and accessible.   The opioids package cannot be considered in a vacuum. Make no  mistake, ongoing Republican efforts to sabotage the Affordable Care Act  could not only reverse any gains we may make from these efforts today,  but will inflict broad, lasting harm to our healthcare system and to  our ability to fight the opioid crisis.   Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers. I ask my colleagues to  support this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to express my support for H.R. 4275, legislation  that would help pharmacists detect fraudulent prescriptions by  requiring the Department of Health and Human Services to develop  training materials to provide pharmacists, providers, and patients with  a greater understanding of the ability and responsibility of  pharmacists to refuse to fill potentially fraudulent or forged  prescriptions.   Pharmacists serve on the front lines of the fight against the opioid  epidemic. H.R. 4275 would provide pharmacists the tools they need when  faced with patients suffering from addiction or with other individuals  interested in abusing or misusing controlled substances. Combatting  fraudulent or forged prescriptions is one step in helping to prevent  diversion and reducing the number of opioids available in the supply  chain.   Once enacted, HHS would work with the Drug Enforcement  Administration, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services  Administration, and other relevant stakeholders including pharmacists,  medical societies, licensing boards, health care providers, and  patients to draft and disseminate materials to inform about the  circumstances under which a pharmacist may decline to fill a  prescription and the federal requirements surrounding such a decision.  In addition, HHS will offer guidance on how to decline to fill a  prescription and actions to take after doing so.   This will ensure that all parties understand when and why a  controlled substance prescription may be declined. H.R. 4275 will  empower pharmacists to fight back against forged or altered  prescriptions and help prevent opioids from entering the hands of  people suffering from addiction or who are at risk of becoming  addicted.   I want to thank Representatives DeSaulnier and Carter for their  leadership on this legislation, which is also supported by the National  Community Pharmacists Association.   Addressing our national opioid crisis requires an all-hands-on-deck  approach, and I am pleased that this legislation recognizes the  important role pharmacists can play.   I urge my colleagues to vote in support of H.R. 4275.   Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman  from California (Mr. DeSaulnier), the sponsor of the bill, and thank  him for his work on this important legislation.  [[Page H5067]]         Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5197, the Alternatives to  Opioids in the Emergency Department Act, introduced by my colleague  from New Jersey, Representative Pascrell.   This legislation would create a demonstration program to support  emergency departments in developing, implementing, enhancing, or  studying alternative pain management protocols and treatments that  limit the use of prescription opioids in emergency departments.   Supporting the development of additional protocols for alternatives  to opioid medications as proposed by this bill can help reduce the  number of those put at risk of addiction and lead to fewer fatal and  nonfatal overdoses.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman  from New Jersey (Mr. Pascrell), the sponsor of this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I urge support, urge my colleagues to  support this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5587, the Peer Support  Communities of Recovery Act.   I want to thank Mr. Lujan for sponsoring this bill, but also for  being the major sponsor of many of the pieces of legislation that we  have discussed today and we are passing today as part of this opioid  package.   This bill would amend the existing Communities of Recovery grant  program to allow SAMHSA to provide funding for regional technical  assistance centers. These centers would provide technical assistance  for the implementation of regionally driven, peer-delivered addiction  recovery support services, establishment of recovery community  organizations, and establishment of recovery community centers.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman  from New Mexico (Mr. Ben Ray Lujan).    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume;  and I rise in support of H.R. 5812, the CONNECTIONS Act.   I was pleased to work with Representative Griffith on this bipartisan  legislation. This bill authorizes funding to enhance and improve State  prescription drug monitoring programs, among other prevention efforts.  This legislation codifies CDC's Prevention for States program, which  includes funding to improve State prescription drug monitoring  programs, or PDMPs.   As part of that program, the CDC will implement the activities  described in the National All Schedules Prescription Electronic  Reporting, or NASPER Act, which I was pleased to see receive funding  this year. As the original Democratic sponsor of NASPER, I have been a  longtime champion of PDMPs as public health tools that can prevent and  respond to opioid abuse.    The role of PDMPs in the current opioid epidemic has proven why our  longtime interests and push for investments in this space is so  critical.   As the technology has matured, we have moved from working toward the  goal of ensuring the interstate sharing of PDMP data, to now aiming to  make PDMPs more interconnected real-time, and usable for public health  surveillance and clinical decisionmaking.   Continuing to strengthen PDMPs will improve our ability to prevent  addiction from occurring in the first place and help identify  individuals who could benefit from treatment for opioid use disorder.   I wanted to urge my colleagues, obviously, to support this  legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I know we have been here, I guess, for about 4 hours  now, and we are done with these suspension bills that are part of this  opioid package, and I don't mean to negate in any way this package, I  do think it is important. But I still want to say, as we conclude  today, I want to express my concern that collectively these bills that  we are considering do not go far enough in providing the resources  necessary for an epidemic of this magnitude. There are 115 Americans  dying every day, and we have to ensure that people have access to  treatment. The bills the House is debating and will pass this afternoon  and over the next 2 weeks do not do enough to expand treatment for  millions suffering from this crisis.   I would also be remiss, again, if I did not also mention the  Republicans' ongoing efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act and gut  Medicaid and take away critical protections for people with preexisting  conditions.   The Justice Department just announced, under President Trump and  [[Page H5074]]  Attorney General Sessions, that they are not going to defend a lawsuit  that is being brought by Republican attorneys general in many States  that would basically say that the Affordable Care Act does not have to  protect people anymore from preexisting conditions.   When discussing the opioid crisis on the floor this week and next, I  urge my colleagues to remember that protecting and expanding access to  care is the most critical piece of the puzzle, and any efforts to roll  back the Affordable Care Act, such as another Republican-led attempt to  repeal the ACA or gut Medicaid, will hurt those people who need it  most.   I am pleased to support this bill in this package and the other bills  that we considered on suspension today, and I yield back the balance of  my time.
