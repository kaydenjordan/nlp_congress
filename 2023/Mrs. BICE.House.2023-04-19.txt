 Mr. Speaker, today marks the 28th anniversary of the  bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, a  horrific event that took the lives of 168 individuals.   This day is forever ingrained in our lives. We continue to pray for  those who were senselessly lost and the lives that were changed  forever. Through all this, Oklahomans remain resilient and stood  together. They rallied and have shown the Nation what it means to be  strong, focusing on a message built on hope and love, creating what we  know as the Oklahoma standard.   I will always be grateful for the courage and dedication of our first  responders and the outpouring of support from citizens across the  country and world. The work done at the Oklahoma City National Memorial  and Museum is important in ensuring that we treat each other with  respect and dignity.   Mr. Speaker, at the ceremony today in Oklahoma City, this verse was  referenced, and I find it very fitting:   [[Page H1852]]  Micah 6:8, And what does the Lord require of you? To do justly, to love  mercy, and to walk humbly with your God.                            ____________________
