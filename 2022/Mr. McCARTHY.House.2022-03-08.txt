 Madam Speaker, what would you do with $1,300? Would you  go on vacation? Save for your kids' college? Maybe buy some new  appliances?   Well, under the Democrats' new America last energy policies, most  Americans have little choice but to spend $1,300 extra on gas to fill  up their cars over the course of the next year. Today, the price of gas  hit an all-time high.   Democrats want to blame surging prices on Russia. But the truth is,  their out-of-touch policies are why we are here in the first place.   Remember what happened on day 1 with one-party rule? The President  canceled the Keystone Pipeline, and then he stopped new oil and gas  leases on Federal lands and waters. Then he gave the green light to  Putin's pipeline. These knee-jerk decisions had damaging effects up and  down the supply chain.   Now, Democrats are creating a fake choice between sanctioning Russia  and lowering gas prices. In their twisted thinking, Americans must feel  the pain at the pump in order to punish Putin. It doesn't have to be  this way.   When Democrats' one-party rule started last year, they inherited an  energy independent America. Average prices at the pump were $2.53 a  gallon. Oh, do we wish we had those days again.   It is still possible to get back to that, which is why Republicans  offered a bill last week that would approve the Keystone Pipeline, fast  track oil and gas production on Federal lands and waters and remove all  hurdles to exporting American natural gas.   Do the American people wonder what happened when we offered that? Two  hundred twenty Democrats voted against it.   Then we offered targeted solutions to the immediate crisis, like  approving the six natural gas export permits that are being held up by  the Department of Energy. Just approving those six permits could  increase U.S. natural gas exports by 25 percent.   But Democrats refused to listen. They think our Nation's future is  better with leaving our resources in the ground, even if that requires  us to buy oil from Iran or Venezuela and batteries from China.   It is obvious which party is championing clean, affordable American  energy and which party has given up on it. It is interesting that  American natural gas is 41 percent cleaner than Russian natural gas.  Why wouldn't you want that to go to Europe and everywhere else?    If we want to lower prices and protect the environment, we must  prioritize American energy independence.   What is worse, it is not just the Biden administration; it is  complete throughout the Democrats' administration, for those who are in  governorships as well. Just take a look at my home State, Madam  Speaker, California.   Now, the United States imports from Russia 209,000 barrels of crude  per day. That is 76.3 million barrels of crude per year. Of that,  California imports from Russia 50,265 barrels of crude per day. In  fact, California imported twice as many barrels of oil from Russia in  2021 than from Canada. So that means this money went to Putin to pay  for his war.   Just as the Biden administration chose to stop the Keystone XL  pipeline, apparently Governor Newsom thinks it is better to buy oil  from Russia than from Canada. California domestic production was  374,000 barrels of crude per day in 2021. That has decreased under  Gavin's administration, 89,000 barrels of crude per day less than in  2018.   If you take the analysis, looking at the data, if California rolled  back the Newsom/Biden regulations that are crippling oil production in  California, California could more than offset its use of Russian crude  and then some. The United States could offset 43 percent of its  dependence on Russian crude if California produced its full capacity.   You see, we don't have to be where we are. If the Democrats would  change their policies of harming America and harming the environment by  buying more Russian oil and gas, we wouldn't be where we are today. The  prices would be lower, there would be more Americans working, and the  world would be safer.                            ____________________
