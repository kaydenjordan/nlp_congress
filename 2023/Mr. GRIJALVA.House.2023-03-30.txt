 Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, the underlying legislation would already  roll back all the positive reforms Democrats have made to the oil and  gas leasing program in the Inflation Reduction Act.   For too long, Big Oil paid the taxpayers a pittance for publicly  owned gas and oil they extracted and sold for an enormous profit. In  the IRA, Democrats fixed our outdated royalty rates, bringing them in  line with the royalty rates charged by States. Studies have shown that  this will have no impact on gas prices, but it will bring a fair return  to the taxpayers.   Republicans want to repeal our reforms and lower royalty rates-- again, a giveaway to an industry that clearly doesn't need it. These  low royalty rates are part of the reason this bill increases the  deficit.   So much for that fiscal responsibility and restraint.   Big Oil doesn't need the giveaway. The rich are getting richer.   Mr. Chair, I urge a ``no'' vote on the amendment, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, let me remind everyone that Big Oil giants  reported their largest profits in history in 2022, together making over  a trillion dollars in sales, all while American families were  struggling.   We can't continue to rely on the decades-old Republican ``drill,  baby, drill'' mantra to lower prices for Americans. Policies that make  us more dependent on fossil fuels will keep subjecting Americans to the  whims of dictators and global market shifts, which always means higher  energy prices.   Instead, we can invest in clean energy here at home. We can reach our  true energy independence, bring stability to the American family, and  fight climate change all at the same time.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I would like to, once again, remind everyone  that H.R. 1 is the pinnacle piece of legislation for the Republican  majority. This bill, as the debates have shown throughout these last  few days, is a boondoggle. It is a giveaway.   H.R. 1 puts us back into the position of less protection for the  American people and less protection for our environment, and it sets us  back in the struggle with the ticking time bomb of the climate crisis.  H.R. 1 and this amendment continue that pattern. I urge a ``no'' vote.   As far as H.R. 1, the polluters over people act, if this is the  pinnacle of legislative effort on the part of the Republican majority,  one can only wonder why we are not concentrating on giving time to the  gun violence that is all around us in this country and the recent  deaths of children and adults at the Christian church.   That is not an issue with this Republican majority. In fact, they  have said they can't do anything about it, that the sacrosanctity of  the Second Amendment prevents them from doing anything.   Yet, H.R. 1, the pinnacle, the zenith of their legislative effort,  undercuts basic protections for the American people, fundamental, core  environmental laws that have protected the American people since the  1970s.   H.R. 1 and this amendment deserve to be defeated.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to claim time in  opposition, though I am not opposed.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the amendment.   During our markup of this bill in the committee, Representative Gosar  offered a similar amendment to this one, though it applied only to oil  and gas, not mining. I asked if he would consider adding mining to that  ban, but that was declined.   I also had an amendment to this bill to include mining in this ban,  which was not made in order. However, this Republican amendment, which  is very similar to my own, was made in order.   I am glad to see that at least some Republicans have come around to  the point of including mining as part of the ban.   If we don't want the Chinese Communist Party developing oil and gas  leases on Federal land and water, then we shouldn't be supportive of  the CCP mining our publicly owned minerals.   It isn't hard to find that many foreign-owned parent companies have  terrible records of human rights abuses, environmental degradation,  harming indigenous communities, and destroying sacred sites.   Some foreign companies, specifically several owned by the Government  of China, are known to have horrible records on all of these fronts,  yet they can operate freely on our Federal land, including in my home  State of Arizona, through their subsidiaries.   I have repeatedly heard from my colleagues that we agree that human  rights and environmental abuses are wrong, but so far, they have  refused to address the problem.   As the demand for these minerals increases, let's not rush to open  our lands to just anyone who wants to mine. Let's take a closer look at  who is operating on our Federal lands and work to raise the global  standard.   Let me remind Members that under our outdated 150-year-old mining  law, mining claimants do not pay a cent, not one penny, for the  public's valuable resources that they extract and turn around and  sell--nothing. That is a better deal than even oil and gas get.   We absolutely should not be handing our public mineral resources over  to the CCP with no fair return to the American people, no return to the  American people at all, where the result would be simply just to  destroy our lands.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, let me just give one important example of  what this amendment addresses.   In my home State of Arizona, at Oak Flat, an area sacred to the  Apache people and other indigenous Tribes in Arizona and in New Mexico,  there was a deal made to give Federal land to a foreign-owned mining  company, Rio Tinto. It is a domestic, local subsidiary but owned by Rio  Tinto, which is also partially owned by the Chinese Government. This  company has a horrible track record around the globe.   In 2020, it demolished a 46,000-year-old Australian aboriginal site,  an irreplaceable cultural site, an artifact and sacred site, to expand  an iron mine. This amendment stops rolling out the welcome mat for  these mining companies.   Mr. Chair, I urge support of the amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I ask unanimous consent to claim the time in  opposition to the amendment, even though I am not opposed.    Mr. Chair, I rise in support of this amendment.   Environmental reviews are how we learn about a project's potential  impacts on our lands, water, and public health. They are a critical  safeguard against harmful industry practices.   The section of the bill this amendment amends says that project  sponsors can fund their own environmental reviews. The entire section  is wrong, and this amendment begins to recognize that.   It would ban the Department of Agriculture and the Department of the  Interior from accepting funds for environmental review from the Chinese  Communist Party.   But my question is: Why stop there?   What about other foreign adversaries?   What about the entities that have committed human rights abuses?   What about the entities that have lobbied the Federal Government?   How do we ensure that any outside funding will be clear of conflicts  of interest?   From my view, we can't.   The Federal Government should have the sole responsibility to conduct  unbiased environmental review, because the Federal Government is  responsible for protecting its citizens.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I concur with much of what Chairman  Westerman said. I support the amendment. I don't think it goes far  enough.   I think that as we confront the question that he brought up of  Chinese communism and their influence and their participation in  activities on our public lands and waters, that we need to make sure  that that doesn't occur.   But I would extend that further. I would extend it to cronyism. I  would extend it to insider trading. I would extend it to large  corporate interests, many times foreign-owned companies, dictating our  energy policy and production for this country.   The point that we have here, as Representatives of our constituents  and the Federal Government, is to protect the American people. To  protect the American people is to make sure that their public health  and their right to know and their right to seek redress is protected.   H.R. 1 does not do this. This amendment is a step in that direction,  but the underlying bill does not.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chair, this amendment requires the Department of  the Interior and the Forest Service to do very basic reporting on  funding that the agency would start receiving under the bill from  outside groups for processing permits.   The agencies would only have to report at the end of each year how  much money they got from which outside groups, not which permits that  money funded. This won't do much, if anything, to prevent conflicts of  interest and corruption in permitting.   The section that this amendment amends is very, very bad. To me, this  amendment demonstrates that some Republicans are noticing the  absurdity.   Instead of requiring after-the-fact reporting on outside money  influencing our permitting process, why not prevent conflicts of  interest in the first place?   Again, the Federal Government should have sole responsibility to  conduct unbiased environmental reviews, because the Federal Government  is responsible for protecting its citizens.   Mr. Chair, I urge a ``no'' vote, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chair, there is a way to speed up and deal with the  backlog. We, Democrats, in the Inflation Reduction Act fought for and  included $1 billion to deal specifically with NEPA and the review  process to bring it up to capacity and staff it. The same can be done  for the other agencies that do species reviews, marine reviews, et  cetera. It can be done and it needs to be done by the government.   I think the Federal Government should have the sole responsibility to  conduct unbiased environmental reviews. That would deal with the  backlog. With the $1 billion under NEPA, we will reach that 2-year  threshold that the Trump administration wanted, that the Republican  majority wanted, and Senators, including Manchin, wanted. We can do the  same with the other agencies as well.   It is about backlog. It is not about continuing a self-fulfilling  prophesy. The prophesy has been to starve these departments so that you  can claim that things are not being done in a timely fashion.   This is an opportunity. The President has recommended it in his  budget to fully allow the transfer of money from the IRA to this review  process with other agencies, not just NEPA.   I think this amendment is redundant in the sense that we establish a  dependency on outside funding from potential claimants to leases and  permits within our Federal lands and waters and depend on them to be  able to deal with that backlog.   If we are going to speed this up, let's do it correctly. Let's do it  with the taxpayer and the American public's rights and public health in  mind and fund them fully. We should allow the President and the  departments to transfer money to the areas in which they are needed.  That is what speeds it up.   What we are doing today in terms of requiring a report will have no  real effect on the backlog and opens the doors to conflicts of interest  and corruption in our permitting process.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, this amendment says that if the Secretary of  Defense takes any action under the Defense Production Act related to  solar panels or electric vehicles, it can't be treated as a covered  project under FAST-41. I have my own concerns about FAST-41,  specifically around ensuring that communities have proper input in  project permitting. This amendment is a blatant attack on clean energy  infrastructure, and I cannot support it.   Mr. Chair, I urge a ``no'' vote, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chair, I would be remiss, after the chairman's  acknowledgement of his staff, not to do the same.   I thank the Democrats on our committee for their hard work and their  effort to keep the worst from happening with H.R. 1. Their work has  been phenomenal and all of us on the committee, as members, are very  appreciative.   Let me just go back to polluters over people act, H.R. 1. H.R. 1 is  supposed to be the pinnacle, the apex of legislative action on the part  of the Republican majority. While we are having this discussion,  looming over the Nation is the default--the debt ceiling--and the  negotiations being promoted by the Republican majority and the cuts  that are being promoted to the basic services and programs that the  American people not only depend on, but rely on for their lives.    We are not talking about that. All we are hearing is that if  permitting doesn't happen the way that the industry wants it in terms  of changing the basic laws that protect the American people, their  health, and our environment, then we will make that part of the  hostage-taking in any discussion and any negotiations that we have  around the debt ceiling.   We will continue to work hard, the Republican majority are saying, to  gut NEPA, to gut basic environmental and public health laws in this  country because that is the zenith of the effort.   H.R. 1 is not a legislative effort; it is a giveaway. It is  empowering Big Oil and Big Gas to once again control the energy policy  of this Nation, ignore climate change, and cost the American people  more and more through the cuts that are being anticipated and through  the fact that we are not concentrating on their needs and concentrating  on the needs of Big Oil and Big Gas--an industry that doesn't need our  attention, doesn't need our help, and certainly does not need the  handouts in H.R. 1.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment requires the Government  Accountability Office to study the sufficiency of the current  environmental review process for offshore wind projects.   I think we can all agree that offshore energy projects, including  offshore wind projects, need to be studied thoroughly before being  built, and the National Environmental Policy Act helps us do that  review. However, H.R. 1, the polluters over people act, guts the  National Environmental Policy Act.   If I lived in a coastal community, I would be pretty nervous about  how H.R. 1 makes it harder for stakeholders to weigh in on projects  that might affect my community. This amendment scrutinizes the  environmental review process for renewable energy development, but the  underlying bill guts the review process for all offshore development.   As we have seen in the Gulf, the infrastructure needed for oil and  gas drilling has decimated wetlands, and oil spills like the BP  disaster close beaches and kill wildlife.   Scientists have found that seismic surveys for offshore oil  exploration are far more damaging to marine mammals than surveys for  offshore wind.   A couple-page GAO study on whether environmental reviews of offshore  wind are strong enough doesn't make up for the cuts to those reviews in  H.R. 1. A better path forward is to reject the polluters over people  act and, instead,  [[Page H1669]]  make sure Federal agencies have the tools, capacity, and resources they  need to complete reviews in a timely fashion.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from New York (Mr. Nadler), who is our leader in the  Judiciary Committee.    Mr. Chairman, as we finish the amendment process under  the jurisdiction of the Natural Resources Committee, let me just close  by saying that the polluters over people act, H.R. 1, has one distinct  and sole purpose, and that is to dismantle, weaken, and eliminate basic  laws and legal protections that have been in place for over 50 years  around important issues of public health and environment.   What we have heard today is rationale regarding permitting reform,  rationale regarding energy independence and dominance, but the sole  purpose of these concepts is dog whistles. They are dog whistles for  climate denial and no action. They are dog whistles for having  corporate dominance, not public interest, in charge of the most vital  natural resource, and that is our people.                                time  1015    H.R. 1, the polluters over people act, is a basic assault on public  health, public interest, and it prevents us from dealing with the  reality of climate change and the need to take action now.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chair, I oppose this amendment. While I recognize  the amendment's underlying goal is to make it easier to obtain a Clean  Water Act permit, not all permits have the same potential impacts on  water quality.   We need to take care to distinguish between those permits that can be  expedited because of their minimal impact on the environment and those  that need additional attention and scrutiny.   The Clean Water Act already authorizes the use of general permits to  allow a more expedited process for activities in the wetlands that will  cause only minimal adverse environmental effects when performed  separately and will have only minimal cumulative adverse effects on the  environment.   Current EPA regulations also allow the issuance of general permits  for point source discharges that involve the same or substantially  similar types of operations, such as construction-related activities,  urban stormwater, and the western and central Gulf of Mexico offshore  oil and gas activities.   The amendment attempts to codify existing EPA regulations on general  use permits for point source discharges without the safeguard that the  activities have only a minimal impact on the environment. The amendment  does not prescribe how these new requirements will interact with  existing general permit authority.   Conflicting standards may have the opposite effect that the  Representative intends. It may restrict EPA's authority to determine  which activities are eligible to use the more streamlined process of  obtaining general permit coverage and those activities more  appropriately reviewed under a more rigorous individual permit  authority. Bogging down the EPA with layers of rules will not make  obtaining a permit easier.   The amendment also expands who can apply an expired general use  permit onto new projects. Under current law, current permittees who  file a notice of intent to be covered under a general use permit  scheduled for reissuance remain covered by the previous permit, even if  there should be a lapse between expiration and reissuance.   The amendment requires the new applicant also be allowed to use an  expired permit regardless of whether or not the permit is likely to be  renewed. Allowing automatic expansion of permits that have not been  renewed for legitimate concerns will not improve water quality.   I stand ready to work with Representative Graves or any other  colleague who seeks to achieve sensible permitting reform while  continuing to uphold our Nation's water quality. However, this  amendment does not uphold our Nation's water quality, and that is why I  will oppose it.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   This will be a 5-minute vote.
