 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 7120--George  Floyd Justice in Policing Act of 2020. This legislation has been a long  time coming and for many it has arrive too little too late. Our nation  is a work in progress, and we will continue to fight for equality under  the law in every and all aspects. As we recently celebrate Juneteenth,  I am reminded of what my ancestors have endured, and I know that they  would be proud of the progress we are making today. I know I am.   This essential legislation has critical provision including  supporting the need for more deescalation training for police officers,  something that I have long fought for and which has proven time and  time again to work. The bill will also block the transfer of weapons of  war to police departments, end the no-knock warrants that led to the  murder of Breonna Taylor, ban choke holds that killed Eric Garner and  George Floyd, and finally end qualified immunity which has shielded  police officers from receiving justice for killing or injuring members  of the community.   As a member of the Congressional Black Caucus but more importantly as  a black mother, grandmother, and now great grandmother, I am so proud  to be an original sponsor of the legislation.   Our communities are demanding action, calling for strong and  effective action that will help not only prevent future tragedies  between police and the communities they patrol, but also help increase  trust and build safer communities.   This is a commonsense bill that deserves bipartisan support. This is  the first step to making our union more perfect and I urge all my  colleagues to support it.
