 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to call attention to an  epidemic, a pandemic of unnecessary amputations in our country. In the  21st century, non-traumatic amputations should be a thing of the past,  but they are not.   Poor blood circulation because of peripheral artery disease often  leads to amputations, and minorities are suffering disproportionately.  In fact, African Americans with PAD are more likely to be amputated and  less likely to have their lower limbs revascularized.   Across this country, people are having their limbs and digits  amputated simply because they are poor, simply because they don't have  access to healthcare until it is too late.   Yesterday, Mr. Paulsen and I brought together experts from across the  country to discuss ways Congress can prevent this unnecessary  amputation issue. This is serious.   The problem is no one checks or does any screening prior to  amputations. If a woman went in to her doctor and found a lump in her  breast today and the doctor said well, we are just going to have to do  a mastectomy, we would go crazy. So we need testing in this area as  well because these limbs can be saved and Americans can go on and live  the quality of life that they deserve in this Nation.   This is a serious health issue that affects people in all of our  districts, and I look forward to continuing to work with both Democrats  and Republicans to reduce unnecessary amputations.                            ____________________
