 Mr. President, I reserve the right to object. I will say  to Senator Thune while he is still on the floor, he knows I have great  respect for him and his views on all kinds of issues.    All right. Then I will just wing it. When I do have the  opportunity to object, I want to explain why.   Having said that, Senator Thune knows we look for opportunities to  work together. This is just one of those instances where we don't see  entirely eye to eye.   Mr. President, right now, the American people face two existential  threats to our way of life. One is the threat really to the world order  posed not so much by Russia but by Putin, the President of that  country. The other is the threat of climate change.   The legislation we are discussing today assumes that we must ignore  the threats of climate change in order to wean our Nation off of  foreign oil from countries like Russia, but this is a false choice.   Since the Arab oil embargo of 1973, some have argued that if we  simply drill more oil, we can be free of the price whiplash caused by  international disruptions in the global oil market. This wasn't true  during the Arab oil embargo. It wasn't true during the Iranian  revolution. It wasn't true during the 1990 Gulf war or, more recently,  during the Iraq war. And it is not true today. Yet the legislation  before us clings to a false understanding of oil markets. We have  drilled more, but the oil prices that we pay are still impacted by  global events.   Instead, we need policies that help our economy smoothly transition  off of oil, while at the same time give consumers more choices to fuel  their cars, their trucks, and their vans. We need to give consumers  real fuel choices that are domestically produced, better for the  climate, and that aren't tied to global oil markets. The choices could  include electricity from nuclear energy, an issue on which the  Presiding Officer and I strongly agree; biofuels made by our farmers,  which Senator Thune strongly agrees and has alluded to; and fuel cells  running on clean hydrogen produced in many cases by our refineries. All  of these options are things that we should be pursuing--that we should  be pursuing--and on which there is wide consensus. In doing so, we  buffer our economy against the threat of Russia and the threat of  climate change.   With that, when it is appropriate for me to object, I am ready to  object.   I am yielding the floor to our colleague from Missouri, Senator  Hawley.   And let me say to him, I don't object lightly, and my hope is that we  will--we haven't had a chance to talk about this before today, but I  look forward to that conversation in the days ahead.   I yield the floor.    Reserving the right to object.    Mr. President, our colleague from Missouri was not on the  floor when I spoke earlier. I want him to have the opportunity to hear  some of the concerns that I and a lot of other people in this Chamber  and this country have with respect to the request that he is making.   So I reserve the right to object, and let me just take a minute or  two to again state why that is.   Today, the American people face two existential threats to our way of  life. No. 1 is the threat to the world order posed not by the Russian  people but by Vladimir Putin, their leader. And the other is the threat  of climate change to us.   We just received from the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric  Administration an update 2 weeks ago about what it is going to look  like in this country in the years to come.   We have already seen the sea level rise roughly a foot in the last  several decades, and what we are going to see in the years to come is  more of the same, only faster.   If you add up the GDP of every coastal county in this country--from  the east coast, the gulf coast, the west coast, the Great Lakes--it  adds up to a GDP that would be making the third largest country in the  world. And what we are going to see is a great assault--a continued  assault--on those coastal counties, whether it is New Jersey or whether  it is Delaware, whether it is Louisiana, California--whatever.   In Louisiana, they lose to the sea every 100 minutes a piece of land  the size of a football field. The Presiding Officer spent some time on  a football field. And every 100 minutes--think about that--the size of  land in Louisiana, the size of a football field goes back to the sea.   Our State of Delaware is the lowest lying State in the country. The  seas around us are rising. My State is sinking. We have seen, gosh,  five storms on the west coast bigger than my State. We have seen  winds--hurricane-force winds--in Iowa destroying like half the crops.  We have seen temperatures--90-degree temperatures--in the Arctic  Circle, the hottest summers on record year after year after year.  Something is happening here.    And with apologies to Stephen Stills, it is exactly clear. And what  the problem is--it is way too much carbon in our air, and it is  increasing. We need to address that. We need to address that in ways  that will actually create jobs, a lot of good-paying jobs. I think we  can agree on that, and that is what we ought to be doing.   So having said that, the legislation we are discussing assumes that  we must ignore the threats of climate change in order to wean our  Nation off of foreign oil from countries like Russia. This is a false  choice. This is a false choice.   Since the Arab oil embargo of 1973, some have argued that if we  simply drill for more oil, we can be free of the price whiplash caused  by international disruptions in the global oil market. This was not  true during the Arab oil embargo. This was not true during the  Ukrainian revolution. It was not true during the 1990 Gulf war or, more  recently, during the Iraq war, and it is not true today.   Yet the legislation before us today clings to false understanding of  oil markets. We have drilled more, but the oil prices we pay are still  impacted by global events.   Instead, we need policies that help our economy smoothly transition  off of oil, providing good-paying jobs for a lot of Americans, while at  the same time giving consumers more choices in the way that we fuel our  vehicles--our trucks, our cars, our vans.   We need to give consumers real fuel choices that are domestically  produced, better for the climate, and that are not tied to the global  oil market.   The choices could include electricity from nuclear energy, something  the Presiding Officer and I and others agree on. The choices could  include the biofuels made by our farmers, something that Senator Thune  was speaking about earlier. The choices could include fuel cells  running on clean hydrogen produced by our refineries. All these options  are things we should be pursuing. As it turns out, if we do--and there  is a lot of bipartisan support for doing what I have just outlined--we  will actually address this climate crisis that we face on this planet,  and we will produce one heck of a lot of jobs for people throughout  this Nation. In doing so, we buffer our economy against the threat of  Russia and the very real threat of climate change.   And with that, reluctantly, I must object to the gentleman's  unanimous consent request.    Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce, alongside  the Senator from Arkansas, Mr. Boozman, and the Senator from West  Virginia, Mrs. Capito, the Recycling and Composting Accountability Act.   This bill is the result of true collaboration and reflects a  substantial amount of bipartisan effort to address our Nation's  recycling and composting challenges. This bill aims to improve the  Environmental Protection Agency's ability to gather data on our  Nation's recycling systems and explore opportunities for implementing a  national composting strategy.   The availability of good data is one of the major challenges facing  the public and private sector as they work make investments to improve  our recycling systems. Upgrading recycling infrastructure, expanding  recycling services, and increasing recycling education will all benefit  from the availability of better data.   Specifically, this bill will create a comprehensive database of all  curbside recycling and composting programs nationwide. It will also  assess the materials those programs collect and their rates of  contamination. The bill will also look at barriers communities and  individuals face when trying to access recycling and composting  services.   In addition to that, the bill will ask the EPA to study the end  market sale of recyclable and compostable materials. It also directs  the EPA to develop a way to measure how otherwise recyclable materials  are being lost from the circular market. The reports from both of these  studies will be immeasurably helpful to stakeholders, communities, and  local and State governments.   As part of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, Congress  provided unprecedented levels of funding for recycling infrastructure  and educational programs. The bill I am introducing today represents  our next step in building on these efforts--to turn the challenges of  recycling and composting into opportunities to reduce planet-warming  emissions and create good-paying jobs.   I look forward to working with my colleagues to enact this  legislation this Congress. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the  legislation be printed in the Record following my statement.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 3743         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

A bill to continue the temporary waiver of interest on State  unemployment loans during the pandemic to provide additional relief,  and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.    Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce, alongside  the Senator from Arkansas, Mr. Boozman, and the Senator from West  Virginia, Mrs. Capito, the Recycling and Composting Accountability Act.   This bill is the result of true collaboration and reflects a  substantial amount of bipartisan effort to address our Nation's  recycling and composting challenges. This bill aims to improve the  Environmental Protection Agency's ability to gather data on our  Nation's recycling systems and explore opportunities for implementing a  national composting strategy.   The availability of good data is one of the major challenges facing  the public and private sector as they work make investments to improve  our recycling systems. Upgrading recycling infrastructure, expanding  recycling services, and increasing recycling education will all benefit  from the availability of better data.   Specifically, this bill will create a comprehensive database of all  curbside recycling and composting programs nationwide. It will also  assess the materials those programs collect and their rates of  contamination. The bill will also look at barriers communities and  individuals face when trying to access recycling and composting  services.   In addition to that, the bill will ask the EPA to study the end  market sale of recyclable and compostable materials. It also directs  the EPA to develop a way to measure how otherwise recyclable materials  are being lost from the circular market. The reports from both of these  studies will be immeasurably helpful to stakeholders, communities, and  local and State governments.   As part of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, Congress  provided unprecedented levels of funding for recycling infrastructure  and educational programs. The bill I am introducing today represents  our next step in building on these efforts--to turn the challenges of  recycling and composting into opportunities to reduce planet-warming  emissions and create good-paying jobs.   I look forward to working with my colleagues to enact this  legislation this Congress. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the  legislation be printed in the Record following my statement.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 3743         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Recycling and Composting       Accountability Act''.       SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.         (a) In General.--In this Act:        (1) Administrator.--The term ``Administrator'' means the       Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.
