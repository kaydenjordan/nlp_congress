 Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize that yesterday marked the  70th anniversary of statehood for Israel. Israel is our close ally and  a beacon of democracy in a dangerous part of the world.   Throughout history, Israel has made numerous concessions in the  pursuit of peace while seeking only the right to exist. A strong Israel  is paramount to our Nation's interests in the region, and strategic  cooperation between the United States and Israel is vital to the well- being of both countries.   I was also proud to introduce H. Res. 835, which passed the House by  unanimous consent last week. The resolution calls all nations to enter  into robust diplomatic relations with Israel, highlights Israel's  recent advances in diplomacy, and affirms the importance of diplomatic  recognition of the nation globally.   A strong Israel benefits all nations, and I will continue to stand  with our friend and ally, Israel.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the topic of this Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, we are here tonight to talk about a topic that  is forefront on the minds of Americans of all ages. It is a topic at  dinner tables across the country, and is finally becoming a leading  national news story. We are here to talk about workforce development.   The American workforce has undergone a radical transformation in  recent years. Right now, there are 6.6 million unfilled jobs in this  country in a phenomenon known as the skills gap. Those jobs are  unfilled because too many Americans are unskilled, despite the fact  that we have record-high numbers of people attending postsecondary  education.   At the Education and the Workforce Committee, workforce development  is at the heart of what we do. All education is career education, and  that means all education is workforce development.   Education, as most of us know, and many of us have experienced, is  the sure path out of poverty for millions of Americans. For all of us,  it should give us the tools we need to cultivate the talents God has  given us. Whether through a baccalaureate degree, a professional  certificate, or any of the new and innovative stackable credentials,  Americans look to the educational system for options.   Mr. Speaker, I am joined here tonight by some of my colleagues from  the Education and the Workforce Committee.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Grothman).    Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Grothman for his comments. I agree  with Mr. Grothman that this is an issue every American needs to be made  more aware of. Many are.   Every week, every day, I meet with people from my district and  outside of my district who come in to see me who say that they have  jobs in their companies, in their manufacturing plants, and in their  restaurants that they cannot fill because they cannot find the people  with the skills to fill those jobs. Everyone in this country has a  stake in the future of our country, so we are hoping that everyone will  wake up to the skills gap and see what part he or she can play in it.   I know that members of the Education and the Workforce Committee have  become very well aware of this from their own districts and from their  own experiences, many of them as employers before they came to the  United States Congress. One of the people that I know that is very  attuned to the need in the workforce is our colleague, Mr. Ron Estes,  from the great State of Kansas.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. Estes).    Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Estes for being here tonight.   Mr. Speaker, I want to brag a little on Kansas, also. I had the  opportunity last year to visit in Congressman Estes' district and see  firsthand the cooperation going on there among the different levels of  education--the high schools, community colleges, State universities-- and working with business and industry, particularly the aerospace  industry.   Mr. Speaker, I ask Mr. Estes if he would like to add to his comments  about the great program going on there because I, frankly, have gone  all over the country and talked about that innovative program that is  going on there.   I yield to the gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, I think, again, the program that Mr. Estes has  there in Wichita is a good role model. It is an indication, again, that  we are sort of going back to the future.   In the past, most of our education institutions paid attention to  where the jobs were in this country and educated people to be prepared  for the jobs. There are people who sometimes can be critical of us on  the committee for saying that we spend too much time emphasizing people  getting a job and perhaps not enough emphasizing a liberal education.  Well, I am a huge fan of liberal education. My undergraduate degree is  in English, but thank goodness I learned to type in high school because  that typing skill is what helped me get through college as I worked my  way through.   All of us need skills. English majors of today need skills: computer  skills, graphic skills. We don't want to diminish the role of liberal  education. We want to just make sure that students have a clear  understanding of what their choices are going to be when they enter a  postsecondary institution and what they might expect when they exit  that institution.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Walberg),  another  [[Page H3966]]  member of our committee who is very well versed in the issues related  to workforce development and education, who has done yeoman's work on  many issues related to the workforce and education.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Walberg for speaking on  tonight's Special Order topic. I appreciate the comments that he has  made, and I appreciate the leadership that he has brought to the  Education and the Workforce Committee in so many ways.   The gentleman's comments about being with employers tonight mirror  the experiences that I have had where, again, every employer that comes  to see me says: You know, we love the tax cut bill. It is allowing us  to hire more people. The only problem is we can't find people with the  skills to take those jobs. So what are we going to do?   So this is an issue, again, that faces all of us. The Federal  Government cannot solve this issue alone. It is going to take the local  schools, K-12, as well as community colleges, as well as universities,  as well as business and industry to come together to figure out ways to  solve this problem.   Of course, what we are doing with the career and technical education  bill as well as with the PROSPER Act is to provide the framework for  those people to do what needs to be done out there. We are taking the  heavy hand of the Federal Government away and saying: We want you to  make many, many decisions at the local level, colleges and universities  to make decisions.   I think we are on the right track. With the leadership of Mr. Walberg  and other members of the committee, I think we are going to get there.    I yield to the gentleman from Michigan.    Mr. Speaker, I again thank Mr. Walberg for being here  tonight.   Mr. Speaker, I now yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.  Thompson), another stellar member of the Education and the Workforce  Committee, who in the past has led the way in the area of career and  technical education in particular, but is well versed in education in  all areas.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Thompson for his time tonight.  Again, I appreciate the work that he has done in this field session  after session, and I appreciate the way he approaches his work on the  Education and the Workforce Committee. We respect the gentleman  greatly, and he is well respected by all of his colleagues here.   Mr. Speaker, we are all pushing to get the bill passed out of the  Senate and are very, very hopeful. In addition, we keep our fingers  crossed.                                time  2045    We pray, we keep our fingers crossed, and we hope.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Allen),  another one of the great members of the Education and the Workforce  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Allen. He and the other members of  the committee who have been here tonight, as well as Members who serve  on the committee, bring real-life experiences and help us better  understand what it is that we need to be doing on the committee and in  the Congress.   Again, this skills gap is something that is of concern to all  Americans and should be of concern to all Americans. The Education and  the Workforce Committee is doing its best to present good legislation  to pass here so that the Federal Government can again give the  structure that is needed for business and industry to do what it needs  to do.   We are the greatest country in the world. We will continue to be the  greatest country in the world as long as we respond to the needs of our  culture and keep our country moving in the right direction.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues again and I yield back the balance  of my time.                            ____________________
