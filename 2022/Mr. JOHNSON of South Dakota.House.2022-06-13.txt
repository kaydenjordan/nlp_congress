 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, let's start with the basics. What is advanced air  mobility, AAM? This bill and the next one deal a fair amount with the  concept. It is just  [[Page H5454]]  making sure that we have got in place a system so the remotely piloted  or autonomous or vertical takeoff and landing aircraft are able to  integrate into our existing air infrastructure.   Mr. Speaker, it is incredibly important to do that in a way that is  effective and that is safe. As the chairman said, Mr. Speaker, that is  where H.R. 6270 comes in, the Advanced Aviation Infrastructure  Modernization Act. It does establish a pilot program which would  provide targeted grants related to the planning and construction of  this AAM.   We all know that the United States has a robust network of general  aviation airports and heliports. Their impact on most every community  in America is probably not fully grasped. They are a critically  important part of our Nation's infrastructure.   We want to make sure that those facilities have the necessary  infrastructure in place for innovative new entrants so we can make sure  our Nation's airports and airspace system are used by these innovative  new entrants in a way that is safe and safely integrated with the  existing traffic.   Of course, as is the case with most transportation planning, it is  State and local experts that are best suited to help plan for the  integration of AAM into our national system.   Mr. Speaker, that is the approach that this bill takes. It doesn't  give all the money to USDOT. It makes sure that these grants are  targeted at the State and local level so we can get the best bang for  our buck. Making certain that AAM works for all of our constituent  communities is the goal. It is the goal of this bill. I look forward to  seeing how different communities embrace advanced air mobility  operations.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Subcommittee Chairman Rick Larsen and Ranking  Member Garret Graves for their work and leadership on this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support of the legislation, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and  I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, H.R. 6270 takes an important step in giving  our State and local transportation planning experts the tools they need  to continue the introduction of advanced air mobility aircraft.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support of the legislation, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, to maintain safe airspace, we know we have to have  coordination. Think about all of the moving parts that are required to  keep people safe in that shared resource. That kind of coordination is  also important at the Federal level if we want to keep everybody safe,  and if we want to make sure AAM keeps moving in the right direction.   That is what S. 516 does, the Advanced Air Mobility Coordination and  Leadership Act. It makes sure that we are able to continue moving  forward and that AAM has the Federal support it needs from a variety of  agencies to be successful.   As the chairman mentioned, we had a similar bill, H.R. 1339, which  passed the House overwhelmingly, 383 yeas to 41 nays.                                time  1515    I think we all realize that that kind of strong bipartisan support is  not always as typical around here as we would like. Of course, this has  got a Senate number so, of course, we have strong bicameral support as  well. Indeed, the text that is before us today has been amended, and so  it reflects language that has been negotiated and agreed upon, Mr.  Speaker, by both Chambers.   This sort of bipartisan, bicameral agreement ensures that industry  and government can start to hash out these questions on the tough and  sometimes thorny issues that have to be addressed so that we make sure  that innovative new entrants are able to operate safely within our  transportation system.   We know that it is not always easy to deal with the Senate--our  colleagues on the other side of the Capitol--but my hope is that once  we pass this legislation, they will quickly take up the amended bill  and send it to the President's desk for speedy signing into law.   Mr. Speaker, I commend Congresswoman Sharice Davids, as well as  Aviation Subcommittee Ranking Member Garret Graves, whom I am normally  loath to say anything good about, but in this instance, I will. I thank  them both for their leadership on this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this legislation, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Obernolte).    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers,  and I yield myself the balance of my time to close.   Mr. Speaker, I think the gentleman from California just did a  wonderful job rattling off a number of key questions that policymakers  have to settle on before we can make sure that AAM is safely integrated  into our existing airports and airspace. This bill will do much to make  sure that we have the coordination that will be necessary to answer  those questions.   Mr. Speaker, I ask all of my colleagues to support this legislation,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers,  and I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, it is often said that sunshine is the best disinfectant.  It is said so often because it is true, and certainly, it is true in  public affairs.  [[Page H5458]]    This is a commonsense accountability measure introduced by my  Republican colleague from Puerto Rico (Miss Gonzalez-Colon), and I  applaud her for this.   It is going to increase transparency for post-disaster Federal  assistance. It makes sure for citizens who are curious--exactly as the  chairman said--who want this information about what the Federal  Government has done to help communities in need without their having to  go on some massive research project. This gives them an opportunity in  a clear and concise way to get a sense of what their Federal Government  has done to respond to these disasters. This increased transparency is  going to allow the American taxpayers to see where their hard-earned  dollars are going.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this legislation, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the  gentleman from New York (Mr. Katko).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume. I don't have any other speakers, so I would view this as  my closing.   When you see a small community get hit by disaster, it just breaks  your heart. I remember, as chief of staff to Governor Daugaard, being  on the ground in Wessington Springs just hours after a tornado ripped  up that town. I was struck by this young mayor, Melissa Mebius, a part- time mayor, as small-town mayors are. She was not an expert in disaster  recovery. She didn't know how to navigate the FEMA process.   I was reminded of her strength and her persistence just a couple of  weeks ago when I was in Castlewood and was able to meet with that  mayor, Brian Ries, and get his sense of how their town had been  devastated by a tornado.   Mr. Speaker, these are not big towns. To be specific, Castlewood is  627 people, and Wessington Springs has 956. These are good mayors.  These are good public works directors. These are good city councilors.  These are able leaders, but this is not an area of their expertise.   The gentleman from New York says it right when he says that this is  about fairness. H.R. 7211 makes sure that FEMA will have an advocate  who will help these small communities better collect and present the  information that is vital to a disaster declaration.   We all get it. If the information that is filed with FEMA is  deficient, if it does not prove a certain amount of damage, then you  are not going to get the declaration that is needed by these  communities so that they can move forward with the recovery that these  small and rural communities need every bit as the larger, more  sophisticated communities do.   Mr. Speaker, I commend the gentleman from New York for his leadership  on this issue, and I ask my colleagues to support this legislation.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, one of my favorite movies is the 1993 comedy starring  Bill Murray, ``Groundhog Day.'' In that movie, every day when Bill  Murray wakes up, he goes through the same set of activities and  processes. I can't help but feel a little bit like Bill Murray, given  that this is the fourth time this body is taking up the Ocean Shipping  Reform Act, but I think we are going to get it done this time.   We first passed it in December as a standalone bill with strong  bipartisan vote totals. Then, in January, it was attached to a larger  bill. A few weeks later, it was attached to yet another larger package  of legislation.   Now, we have before us the Senate bill, and I do think that we are  well positioned to get this across the finish line.   I thank the chairman for his kind words earlier. He mentioned the  word ``tireless.'' When it comes to talking about Mr. Garamendi, I  would also use  [[Page H5465]]  the word ``tenacious.'' He was a wonderful partner to try to actually  get something done.   There are so many Members of Congress that are more interested in  complaining about problems or about having the hot tweet of the day.  But in   John Garamendi, there is a Member who actually wants to get  things done. What a delightful characteristic to have in a Member of  Congress.   Our version of H.R. 4996, of course, I thought it was the perfect  piece of legislation. But the Senate is entitled to their own opinions,  so we will bring up their version.   I think it is worth us reminding ourselves, how did we get here? We  talk about a supply chain crunch. We talk about a supply chain crisis.  How did we get here, and will this bill actually help?   The influx of Federal dollars injected into the economy and the way  in which the pandemic shifted consumer spending has forced U.S. ports  to face unprecedented volumes of cargo, just stuff incoming, nonstop,  at a level at which this country has not seen.   This pressure on our ports has trickled down to other parts of the  supply chain that has led to delays in product arrivals. It has led to  product shortages, just as all the capacity in our system has been  overwhelmed.   Those soaring freight rates and capacity shortages have made it  difficult not only to receive imports but also to get our American  agriculture and manufactured goods exported for timely delivery abroad.  U.S. importers and exporters, U.S. consumers, have been hit on both  fronts.   Some might be wondering why a Congressman from South Dakota cares so  much about maritime law. The reality is that 60 percent of South  Dakota's soybeans are exported, as are a tremendous amount of dairy,  beef, and corn.   This is not just a coastal issue. This impacts lives from the farm  gate to Main Street. Whether people realize it or not, this supply  chain crunch is impacting them.   I got most involved in this issue when I heard from South Dakota  businesses like Strider Bikes, out of Rapid City, or Valley Queen  Cheese, out of Milbank, about how their ability to do business was  seriously impacted by the crunch at the ports.                                time  1545    Valley Queen Cheese had 2 million pounds of lactose. It already had a  buyer in Asia. They couldn't get it on a container. At a time when 60  percent of containers going back to Asia were going back empty, they  couldn't get space on a container headed back to their customers.  Strider couldn't get the parts they needed so that they would be able  to sell finished products to American consumers and consumers  elsewhere.   These are real impacts that take millions and billions of dollars out  of the American economy. The American Farm Bureau estimates that more  than $25 billion of ag sales have been forgone because of this problem  at the ports. One industry, the U.S. dairy industry, in just 6 months  last year, experienced a $1.6 billion hit.   So, Mr. Speaker, the Ocean Shipping Reform Act addresses these  problems in a few ways. It addresses the supply chain bottlenecks, it  promotes American competitiveness, and it holds foreign-flagged ocean  carriers accountable for any unfair practices that they engage in.   I just said that this bill is about U.S. competitiveness, and that is  exactly right. My sense is that if you are a foreign-flagged ocean  carrier, and you are using U.S. ports, you need to submit yourself to  some basic rules of the road.   This legislation provides the appropriate authority to the Federal  Maritime Commission so that they can better protect U.S. shippers who  import and export items. They should be able to do that free from  unreasonable anticompetitive actions.   So this bill does a lot, Mr. Speaker, but I want to hit just on three  that I think are most noteworthy. First off, under this legislation,  the FMC will be able to set minimum contract standards for ocean  shipping service contracts. That is critically important. Again, those  are the basic rules of the road we need to make sure are in place.   Secondly, it increases protections for U.S. shippers from retaliation  if the shippers file a complaint with the FMC. There has been a fair  amount of discussion in committee about how loath shippers are to file  complaints against carriers because of concerns about retaliation.   Third, this bill sets standards for detention and demurrage charges  levied by foreign ocean carriers. These are perfectly reasonable  requirements. This bill says that the charges must be accurate, and of  course, they should be, and the bill sets penalties for false or  inaccurate fees.   The House-passed bill placed even more weapons in the FMC's arsenal.  Again, the Senate version is not quite that robust, but Mr. Speaker, I  see no value in us having perfect be the enemy of the good. This does  move us in the right direction, so I would ask my colleagues to vote  for S. 3580, the Ocean Shipping Reform Act of 2022.   A ``yes'' vote is a vote to put U.S. shippers, farmers,  manufacturers, truckers, retailers, and consumers first. I support this  crucial legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   I would like to engage in a brief colloquy with my majority colleague  to ensure that we agree on section 7(b)(1) of S. 3580.   I would ask Chairman DeFazio: Section 7(b)(1) of the bill requires  the FMC to initiate a rulemaking ``further'' defining prohibited  practices by common carriers, marine terminal operators, and ocean  transportation intermediaries under section 41102(c) of title 46,  United States Code.   Section 7(b)(2) states that the contents of the additional rule  required under paragraph 1, ``shall only seek to further clarify  reasonable rules and practices related to the assessment of detention  and demurrage charges to address the issues identified in the final  rule published''--by the FMC--``on May 18, 2020, entitled,  `Interpretive Rule on Demurrage and Detention Under the Shipping  Act.'''   So, Mr. Chairman, my understanding is that any rule prepared under  paragraph 1 of section 7(b) is subject to the limitation set in  paragraph 2, and such rule shall only clarify the May 18, 2020 rule.   I also understand that any rule prepared under section 7 shall be in  addition to, not in place of, the May 2020 rule and that that May 18  rule shall remain in place during the preparation of the additional  rule after the promulgation of such an additional rule unless the FMC  chooses, unrelated to the requirements of section 7, to undertake any  amendment to the May 18, 2020 rule.   Finally, Mr. Speaker, it is my understanding that, though  characterized as an ``interpretive rule,'' this final rule was  promulgated through notice and comment and is changing ocean carrier  behavior with respect to these fees and has already led to enforcement  cases by the Commission to address unreasonable detention and demurrage  charges.   Does the Chair share my understandings with respect to section 7? Of  course, I yield time for the gentleman to respond.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman  from Oregon.    Mr. Speaker, reclaiming my time.   I appreciate the gentleman's comments, our agreement as well as your  engagement.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   It has been a bit of a journey. The gentleman from California was  right, it is almost a year to the day, but we are here, and we are  about ready to punch this into the end zone.   Mr. Speaker, S. 3580 provides the FMC the crucial tools they need to  help protect U.S. shippers. Both Mr. Garamendi and myself are former  regulators at the State level, and we had shared that it is unusual in  this kind of a highly complex and sophisticated commerce environment  that the FMC has lacked these basic authorities in the past.   This bill moves us in the right direction. It is going to help during  this current crisis. And even more importantly, Mr. Speaker, it will  make a future crisis less likely. People will understand that the cop  on the beat, the FMC, has the authority they need to shave the most  jagged edges off of unreasonable behavior from these foreign-flagged  ocean carriers.   Mr. Speaker, I sincerely thank my colleagues across the aisle for  working with so many of us on this side on this important legislation.  It is a strongly bipartisan and strongly bicameral success. I think  this time we are going to get it across the finish line, signed into  law by the President. I urge support.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
