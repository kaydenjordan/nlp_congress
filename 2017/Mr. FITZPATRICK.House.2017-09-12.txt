 Mr. Speaker, September is Hunger Action Month, a  month where people all over America stand together with the nationwide  network of food banks to fight hunger. Hunger can affect people from  all walks of life.   Too many Americans are one job loss or one medical crisis away from  food insecurity, and some people, like children and seniors, stand at a  greater risk of facing hunger. That is why I am proud of the Bucks  County Fresh Connect program, a free farmers market bringing fresh and  healthy food to our hungry neighbors. The Fresh Connect program  provides reliable and needed food to the 57,000 residents of Bucks  County facing hunger, about a third of whom are children.   This month I participated in the Fresh Connect program at Solly Farm  in Ivyland, where fresh produce was collected and delivered to the  Bucks County Community College in Bristol for distribution.   I want to thank Philabundance, the Bucks County Opportunity Council,  the Greater Philadelphia Coalition Against Hunger, St. Mary Medical  Center, United Way of Bucks County, Rolling Harvest Food Rescue, and  Solly Farm for all of their hard work in making this program possible.  Mr. Speaker, these organizations and all of their generous volunteers  are a tribute to our community and to our Nation.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the bill (H.R. 3284) to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to  establish a Joint Counterterrorism Awareness Workshop Series, and for  other purposes, as amended.

(b) Clerical Amendment.--The table of contents in section       1(b) of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 is amended by       inserting after the item relating to section 528 the       following new item:  ``Sec. 529. Joint Counterterrorism Awareness Workshop Series.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks and include any extraneous material on the bill under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, as we gather this week and mark the 16th anniversary of  the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, we remember the nearly  3,000 innocent people lost in that heinous act--including 18 from my  home of Bucks County, Pennsylvania.   Additionally, we honor the more than 400 first responders who  perished and the countless more whose long-term health was impacted  because of their courageous action. Each of us in this Chamber has  heard stories of those brave firefighters, police officers, and EMTs  who ran toward the danger and chaos on that Tuesday morning and made  the ultimate sacrifice in the service of their community and their  country. Today we remember them, and we recommit to recognize their  efforts and those efforts of all first responders around our Nation.   Mr. Speaker, since 9/11, we have seen the devastating impact of  coordinated terrorist attacks on civilian targets. In these cases,  first responders--including local police, fire, and emergency medical  personnel--are the main response force. It is critical that these men  and women have the training and tools to operate in these planned  attacks.   That is why I have introduced H.R. 3284, the Joint Counterterrorism  Awareness Workshop Series Act of 2017, to authorize a vital workshop  series allowing State and local jurisdictions to prepare for  coordinated terrorist attacks.   H.R. 3284, as amended, authorizes the Joint Counterterrorism  Awareness Workshop Series for 5 years and delineates the activities  that are required to be part of each workshop, including a review of  current plans, policies and procedures, and an examination of the roles  and responsibilities of each participating agency.   H.R. 3284 ensures that the whole community--from government  officials, law enforcement, fire, EMS, and public health officials to  the private sector--participates in the workshop.   Additionally, Mr. Speaker, this bill allows the FEMA Administrator to  select jurisdictions to participate in such workshops from  jurisdictions that currently receive, or previously received, Urban  Area Security Initiative funding and have requested to host a workshop.   Finally, H.R. 3284 requires the participants to develop a summary  report after each workshop that includes the key findings and  strategies to mitigate the identified gaps.   I introduced this bill with bipartisan support, and I am proud to  have the backing of two first responder organizations that I trust when  working on this type of legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter of support from the  International Association of Fire Chiefs and a letter of support from  the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association.                                           International Association                                                  of Fire Chiefs,                                         Fairfax, VA, July 21, 2017.      Hon. Brian K. Fitzpatrick,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative Fitzpatrick: On behalf of the nearly       12,000 fire and emergency service leaders of the       International Association of Fire Chiefs (IAFC), I express       our support for H.R. 3284, your legislation to authorize the       Joint Counterterrorism Awareness Workshop Series (JCTAWS).       These multidisciplinary exercises help local jurisdictions       prepare for the threat of complex, coordinated terrorist       attacks.        The terrorist threat continues to evolve. As terrorist       incidents in Mumbai in 2008, Paris in 2015, and Brussels in       2016 demonstrate, complex, coordinated terror attacks using       multiple teams and a variety of tactics are a growing threat       that local jurisdictions will have to address. Local       jurisdictions must be prepared to respond to multiple       incidents at the same time involving active shooter       incidents, explosives and the use of fire as a weapon.        The JCTAWS exercises provide an environment where local       fire service, law enforcement, emergency medical service,       private sector and other disciplines can plan for joint       response to these incidents. The JCTAWS allows federal, state       and local partners to collaboratively evaluate their options       and learn how to best protect their communities. The       exercises also bring together resources from the U.S.       Department of Homeland Security, the National       Counterterrorism Center, and the Federal Bureau of       Investigation to leverage the strengths of these major       agencies. After a jurisdiction hosts a JCTAWS exercise, key       findings are communicated to the participants as well as       mitigation strategies and resources to address gaps in       preparedness.        The IAFC endorses this legislation and thanks you for       authorizing funding for this critical exercise program. We       look forward  [[Page H7231]]       to working with you to pass this legislation this year.            Sincerely,                                       Fire Chief John D. Sinclair,      President and Chairman of the Board.                                   ____                                             Federal Law Enforcement                                            Officers Association,                                                     Washington, DC.   FLEOA Commends Fitzpatrick, Murray, Donovan for First Responders Bill         Washington, DC.--The Federal Law Enforcement Officers       Association (FLEOA) applauds Representatives Brian       Fitzpatrick (PA-08), Stephanie Murray (FL-07), Dan Donovan       (NY-11), and the members of the House Homeland Security       Committee for expanding the training and collaboration of       emergency first responders through introduction of H.R. 3284,       the Joint Counterterrorism Awareness Workshop Series (JCTAWS)       Act of 2017. FLEOA is the non-partisan, not-for-profit       professional organization representing more than 26,000       federal officers and agents from over 65 agencies.        FLEOA President Nathan Catura stated, ``The horrific damage       and loss of life caused by terrorists 16 years ago reminds us       of the devastation into which first responders insert       themselves on a regular basis. Whenever state, local,       federal, and tribal first responders react as one unified       team, the public benefits in countless ways.''        ``As a former federal agent, Congressman Fitzpatrick knows       the benefits H.R. 3284 will have by expanding the unified       training and communication of responders,'' Catura continued.       ``It is because of the previous JCTAWS training and the       additional training H.R. 3284 will generate that the public       safety community has made considerable progress since the 9/      11 attacks.''     Throughout our Nation's history, our first  responders have always stood for peace, security, and ordered liberty  that make our communities great and our country strong. For this we are  eternally grateful. As we remember those who gave their lives on  September 11, we, unfortunately, recall that the threats of coordinated  terrorist attacks are not going away. Today it remains critical that  our first responders have the resources and the tools needed to protect  our communities. The Joint Counterterrorism Awareness Workshop Series  is one of these vital tools.   Mr. Speaker, as a first responder myself, I am proud to work with the  House Committee on Homeland Security's Subcommittee on Emergency  Preparedness, Response, and Communications on moving this meaningful  legislation, and I urge all Members to join me in supporting our first  responders by voting ``yes.''   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I, once again, urge my colleagues to  support H.R. 3284, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Chairman, every year for 42 years, Congress has  funded the Legal Services Corporation so that low-income Americans  might realize our country's solemn pledge of justice for all. For  military families, homeowners and renters, families with children, the  disabled, the elderly, and nearly 112,000 veterans, investment in civil  legal aid is one of the most effective ways to help Americans navigate  the justice system.   The Legal Services Corporation allows millions of Americans to  safeguard their basic legal rights at a minimal cost to the Federal  Government. As the late Justice Antonin Scalia emphasized in 2014: `` .  . . this organization pursues the most fundamental of American ideals,  and it pursues equal justice in those areas of life most important to  the lives of our citizens.''   This organization provides direct grants to legal aid providers  across our Nation, including eight organizations in my home State of  Pennsylvania. I am proud to support the Legal Services Corporation,  which allows people access to justice even when they cannot afford  representation. We must continue this program.
