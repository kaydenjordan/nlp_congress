 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Burgess) for yielding this time to debate these important measures.   This is a historic moment here in the House. Today, we will be  sending the most significant financial regulatory relief legislation to  the President's desk in more than a decade. I am proud to have been  part of this effort, and I thank all of my colleagues who helped get us  to this moment.   Madam Speaker, for the past 3\1/2\ years I served in this House, I  have been telling the same story over and over again:   My home State of Georgia lost 70 banks during the financial crisis,  the most of any State in the Nation. Today, 52 of Georgia's counties do  not have a community bank headquartered there, and three of Georgia's  counties have no bank branch whatsoever. Why? Because of excessive  regulatory burden placed on small community banks and credit unions by  previous legislative action and through overreach by regulators.   Today, we are taking a major step toward reversing that trend by  taking bold action and by sending progrowth regulatory relief to small  community banks and credit unions to the President's desk. This bill  will help ensure that community banks and credit unions will no longer  be crushed under the weight of regulations that do not distinguish  between them and the largest financial institutions.   Much of this bill originally came from House bills--bipartisan, I may  add. This moment is an example of the legislative process working well  in a strong bipartisan fashion.   I urge all my colleagues to support this legislation.
