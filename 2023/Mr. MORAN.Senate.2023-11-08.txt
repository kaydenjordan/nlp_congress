 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, today, I join many who mourn the passing  and I honor the life of a Kansan I had the privilege of knowing and  working with: Nestor R. Weigand, Jr.   Mr. Weigand was a blessing to all who knew him, and he improved the  lives of many around him each and every day of his life.   He was raised in Wichita. Nestor's family later moved to Minnesota,  where he attended St. Thomas Academy school, and later graduated with a  degree in finance from the University of Notre Dame in 1960. Nestor  then went on to serve his country in the U.S. Army Reserve.   Following his time in the Reserve, Nestor devoted much of his adult  life to the real estate business. It was a tremendous passion of his.  It wasn't just a job; it was something he enjoyed and loved doing,  something he found satisfaction in, in putting a buyer and a seller  together, in making a project work.   He originally joined the family real estate business in Kansas in  1961. His hard work led him to become the president and CEO of J.P.  Weigand & Sons in 1983. Through this role, he succeeded in building one  of Kansas's most respected businesses.   Continuing his passion for real estate, Nestor was elected to be the  president of the Kansas Association of Realtors in 1978 and eventually  became the president of the National Association of Realtors 10 years  later. Nestor worked tirelessly in his role to improve the lives of  Kansans and Americans by fighting for fair housing laws throughout the  country.   Weigand real estate agent Alissa Unruh said:         One of the most impressive of his personal attributes was       that Nestor would call every employee and agent on their       birthday like clockwork. [He] never missed my birthday in 20       years.    Nestor cared about details, and he cared about people. In 1990, with  no prior political experience, Nestor made the decision to run for  Governor of the State of Kansas, and while he ended up, by a very small  margin, on the short end, his expertise and knowledge was something I  truly admired and have learned from during my time in public service.  His race for Governor earned him an appreciation by many Kansans who  might not otherwise have met him.   Before running for public office, one of the first people I sought  out was Nestor Weigand, for some advice. I enjoyed conversations with  Nestor over breakfast and lunch and greatly benefited from those  conversations and his wisdom.   Often in Washington, DC, here in the Nation's Capital, or in my  travels across the country and certainly across Kansas, when I would  tell somebody outside the State of Kansas that I am from Kansas, they  would say: Well, do you know Nestor Weigand?   He had many, many friends in many places. He was a giant in the real  estate industry and made a huge difference in people's lives.   Not only was he an expert in real estate, but he was also a leader of  the Wichita community and understood the people of the State of Kansas.  Nestor was a booster for Wichita, for Sedgwick County, and for our  State.   Nestor took his commitment to his community seriously. He sat on so  many boards, including being a board member and chairman of Wesley  Hospital for over 40 years.   Nestor's life truly reflected the love for business, for real estate,  his passion for public service, and his dedication to people. He knew  lots of people, but he knew them well, and they knew him and they  respected him.   You meet Nestor Weigand, and you decided this was the real deal, a  person who cared about you and who wanted to see good things happen in  your life.   His legacy will not be forgotten. He is already dearly missed. Robba  joins me in our prayers for his children, his grandchildren, and the  entire Weigand family.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
