 Mr. Speaker, we all know the tale of ``The Emperor's  New Clothes.'' Grifters convince an emperor that they are expert  tailors who weave a cloth so fine that only the virtuous can see it.  The emperor wraps himself in nothing and parades the streets as all the  townspeople compete to signal their own virtue by proclaiming how  beautiful the material is, even though their own common sense tells  them otherwise. This scheme is successful until a little boy who knows  better states the obvious.   For 2 years now, we were told by the experts that they could stop  COVID-19 if everyone did exactly as they commanded. I am science, as  one put it. They quashed debate within the medical community and  ridiculed, censored, and fired any dissenters.   Looking back, we can clearly see what a self-destructive folly they  produced. Study after study now confirms the obvious, that the mask  mandate, school closures, home detention orders, and business closures  had virtually no impact on the virus. But they did appalling damage to  the economy, seriously harmed children in ways we are still cataloging,  and cost untold lives due to suicides, drug and alcohol overdoses,  delayed health screenings and treatments, and poverty-related deaths.   This recent, tragic experience should warn us all to be much more  skeptical of surrendering common sense to so-called experts and of  suppressing free debate over what science actually is telling us, which  brings us to the Democrats' ongoing and escalating war on fossil fuels.   The road they have placed us on leads to a bleak future of  unaffordable energy, rolling blackouts, empty shelves, and increasingly  brutal rationing of every watt of electricity and drop of gasoline that  we once took for granted.   Gasoline prices are already the highest ever seen in this country as  we have discouraged production. Electricity prices are skyrocketing,  pushed by the crushing cost of renewables. Utilities across the county  are now warning of summer blackouts because renewable mandates have  destabilized the electricity grid.   Joe Biden and the Democrats promised to wage war on fossil fuels, and  they have succeeded. On his first day in office, he canceled the  Keystone pipeline, which today should have been completed and  delivering 830,000 barrels of crude oil every day into American  markets. He canceled oil and gas exploration on Federal lands. Just  last month, he withdrew 1 million acres of land from exploration and  production in oil-rich Alaska and the Gulf of Mexico.   And he blames Vladimir Putin? Under the progrowth policies of the  Trump administration, America didn't need Putin's oil. We were energy  independent for the first time in our lifetimes. We were producing more  oil than Russia and even Saudi Arabia. The day the Democrats took  office, gasoline was averaging $2.39 a gallon.   Today's sky-high fuel prices are aggravating supply chain breakdowns  and adding to consumer prices. Acreage once devoted to growing corn for  food is now used to produce ethanol, which requires trading an entire  acre of corn to produce just 550 gallons of ethanol.   The irony is, at a time when these Green New Deal policies can't  guarantee enough electricity to keep the lights on this summer at any  price, these Democrat elitists are telling families to buy electric  cars. Where do they think the electricity for their electric cars comes  from? Eighty percent comes from fossil fuels that they are ruthlessly  shutting down.   The excuse for all of this, of course, is to stop global warming, but  they cannot account for why it is that there have been periods  throughout paleo history when temperatures have been much higher and  also much lower than they are today. Nor do they account for the  infinitely more powerful natural forces that shape our constantly  changing climate.   The blind reliance on handpicked experts and the suppression of  dissent in our approach to COVID cost lives and destroyed the most  prosperous economic expansion in our lifetimes. But its excesses pale  in comparison to what the green left is now doing to our society. The  pain and damage we are feeling today is just the first bitter taste of  what is to come if they prevail.   Of one thing we can be certain: Whether or not we destroy our  Nation's prosperity by continuing the Democrats' war on fossil fuels,  the Earth will continue to warm and cool, as it has for billions of  years. The only question we can answer is whether ours will be a future  of abundance or scarcity, prosperity or poverty, comfort or misery.                            ____________________
