 Madam Speaker, I rise today to share in the relief  that families across New Mexico will be receiving starting next month.   Thanks to the American Rescue Plan, about 95 percent of New Mexico's  children will be eligible to get money through the child tax credit.  Working families with kids will get payments of up to $300 monthly per  child. That means more money for childcare and to put food on the table  and to support our hardworking families.   I personally know the struggles that many New Mexican families face,  and that is why here in Congress I am continuing to work to tackle  childhood hunger and create more opportunities to lift our families out  of poverty. We must make these tax credits permanent and put more money  into the pockets of hardworking parents so they can get back to work  and fuel our economy.                            ____________________
