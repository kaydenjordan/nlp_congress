 Madam Speaker, we have heard a great deal today-- actually, from both sides of the aisle pointing fingers across the way  at the opposing party--about the issue of children: taking care of  children that are brought here illegally, taking care of children that  supposedly come here on their own.   But since we know that nobody crosses from Mexico into the United  States illegally without having the permission of the drug cartel that  controls that section of the Mexico-U.S. border, it is not really  accurate to say a child comes unaccompanied, because a child can't  cross Mexico by himself. A child is brought by somebody.   Unfortunately, as we know, the figures from both government groups,  Doctors Without Borders, and others are pretty staggering when you  realize that such a large percentage--25 percent, 30 percent--of girls  who come to the United States through Mexico are raped.   I have seen too many rape trees that it breaks my heart. It is just,  as the poet said, incredible, the inhumanity to man. It is staggering.   And sometimes it is difficult to tell people no that want to come  here, but there is not a country in the world that lets more people  into that country than the United States does. There is nowhere.   Countries that are much bigger geographically, countries that have  many more people, countries that have more space per person, there is  no country that is as generous with the right being given to come in to  a country legally as the United States, and I love that about our  country.   But it is important to have rules about who gets to come in.  Obviously, some have projected that there may be 1 billion, 1.5 billion  people who would like to come to the United States. If the 300, 350  million or so people here were to have a billion people come in,  obviously, this country would cease to exist as it has or is or could  be. It would cease to exist. It would become a Third World country.  There would be so much massive unemployment overwhelming the social  services. Disease would become rampant.   As we see people coming here from other countries, there are diseases  that we had completely eliminated in the United States that are now  being reintroduced to the United States because we have not enforced  our borders and made sure that people coming in, as welcome as they are  to come in legally, that they are not coming in with a disease that  puts people in the United States in jeopardy. Once you do that, then  you don't continue to be that light on the hill that so many want to  come to. There is no place left.   Last year, there were some people here who said: Well, you know, if  we keep losing more and more of our freedom here in the United States,  maybe we just can all go to Australia.   I had a few guys that I met with from Australia. I thought they would  find that amusing. But they didn't smile; they didn't laugh. They said:  Do you not understand? If you lose your freedom here in America, China  will take  [[Page H3720]]  us over in a heartbeat. There will be no place you are going to be able  to go.   The United States of America is the place that gives everyone else in  the world hope for freedom.                                time  1315    I ran into the same thing in Nigeria, people imploring, in fact, some  West Africans who were Christians wanted to meet with me before I left.  The oldest gentleman said: You know, we wanted to make sure, before you  went back to Washington, you understood we were all so thrilled when  you elected your first Black President.   They said: But since President Obama has been the leader in the  United States, we have seen America get weaker and weaker. And you have  got to make sure people in Washington understand, when America gets  weaker, we suffer.   Ebenezer was his name. He said: You know, we know where we are going  when we die. We are Christians. We are believers. But our only chance  of having some degree of safety in this life is if America is strong.   Unfortunately, as I heard from people there, as I have read since,  the Obama administration was putting requirements: Look, we will give  you more help in neutralizing Boko Haram, but you are going to have to  legalize abortion, start paying for those, and you have got to legalize  same-sex marriage, and then we will give you some serious help with  Boko Haram.   In the meantime, the American administration had a hashtag,  #bringbackourgirls. It didn't really do much. Actually, it didn't do  anything, really. The hashtag went around and around, but thank God for  people who stepped up like our government did not and actually helped  girls, and some continue to be helped. I won't talk about where they  are, how well they are doing.   But it is just really tragic when the United States Government that  so many people around the world look to for hope, look to as an example  of what perhaps their country could be someday, start losing hope when  they see what happens here. It is tragic.   I know some say, and we have seen this over the years, whether it is  Dr. Spock's book on how to raise children, don't ever say no. Gee, you  might hurt their pride or enthusiasm. Don't ever punish, just  encourage.   But the fact is that the reason we have laws that don't allow  children to enter into binding contracts is because we understand that  children can be too easily persuaded. That is why criminals are able to  dangle candy or in some way entice children into situations wherein  their lives are destroyed.   There is a time to say no out of love and caring.   I don't know anybody on either side of the aisle here, either party,  who wants to see children harmed, but the fact is, as the border  patrolmen tell me constantly both when I am down there all night or  when I am up here and hear from them: When you guys make it sound like  anybody is welcome, especially if they have a child in their group,  well, we have more children now coming, often to their own detriment,  than we have ever had in our history.   So I understand the feeling, gee, let's don't say no to any child who  wants to come into America accompanied, unaccompanied. We extend our  arms.   But what happens? We know every time caravans, groups are coming in,  big, small, people die trying to get in. The drug cartels are so  corrupt, they will utilize children. They have no problem taking young  girls and using them in sex trafficking.   And by our leaving that open, I hear it all the time from people who  work the border: You guys lure them up here to their own harm. If you  would just secure the border, these folks will quit coming, and you  won't have thousands of girls being raped. You won't have people being  sold into sex slavery.   And I say ``sold,'' but it sounds more like, from the stories we get  down there that what happens, and it is not on the list of questions a  border patrolman asks as they are in-processing people, but sometimes  it is asked: How much did you have to pay? And sometimes they will add:  to the gang or the drug cartel to get you in here illegally?   The answer normally is 5, 6, 7, $8,000.   And again, the question is not on their list to ask, but sometimes  they ask: How did you get that money? You don't have that kind of  money. Where would you come up with that kind of money?   So often, the answer is: We got a thousand here. We had a thousand  sent, $1,500 sent from people in the United States, and they are going  to let us work the rest off when we get where we are going.   So, so many are not sold into slavery. They just agree, without  realizing, they are about to become an indentured servant to a drug  cartel, and they are going to be a servant either in sex trafficking or  drug trafficking.   So often I have stood there and watched people waiting to be  processed, and they will have an address in a city in the U.S. And I  have seen them, different times, exchange, and they would switch  cities, and then they would tell the border patrolman: Here is the city  where I have relatives, where I can go and be taken care of.   And it is where the drug cartels told them to go. So, technically,  they are not sold into slavery, but they have agreed to be indentured  servants to the drug cartels.   So it is amazing how many people seem shocked when they read story  after story about how the drug cartels in Mexico have big operations in  cities all over America. That is why the border patrolmen say: You know  what the drug cartels call us? They call us their logistics.   Like the commercial?   Well, yeah. Like the commercial.   They get them across the border, and then the U.S. Government ships  these people wherever the drug cartels want them to go.   Right now, they are so overwhelmed on our border, it is just tragic.   I know there are Christian groups that receive millions of dollars  for going down and helping get people in and taking care of them. And  it sure makes it appear like they are scared of losing the millions of  dollars they get for assisting illegal aliens, but we need to be  realistic.   When you are in a country that is self-governing, where you have an  obligation as part of the government, if you are a citizen serving on  juries, that makes you a judge of the facts of a case, or running for  office, or voting, you vote because you are supposed to be the one who  hires the servants who come to work in the county seat, the State  capitol, the Federal Capitol.   But the people are supposed to be the real rulers, and those of us  elected are supposed to be the servants. But there is an obligation  that goes with the freedoms, and that obligation means you have got to  enforce the law across the board.   Some people quote Scripture, saying, we have got to be good to the  foreigners--true; we have got to help the widows and orphans--true; we  ought to be encouraging and embracing of families--true.   But when you are acting as the government, you have a different role,  and that is a role to ensure that the law is enforced evenly and fairly  across the board without regard to someone's financial situation,  social status, or anything else.   That is why there are verses in the Bible that say something to pray  for is people who will not show favoritism to the rich and, also,  verses say, not show favoritism to the poor. You treat everyone fairly  across the board.   I sure got a lot of hateful things when I was a judge, and I revoked  the probation of a daughter of one of the wealthy oil families in my  hometown. They even had many of my supporters in the courtroom,  thinking that would intimidate me from doing what I would have done to  anyone else.   But as a judge, that is the job. You don't show favoritism to people  because of their wealth or because of their lack of it. You enforce the  laws fairly across the board.   Just as it would be crazy for a parent to welcome a child who can't  swim to come jump in the pool, you say: No. No. That is dangerous. No,  don't touch the hot stove. No, don't stick anything into the electric  socket.   There is a time to say no. But some think that being loving and  caring means never to say no. There is a time to say no.   If we enforce our borders and do so fairly and are fair about the  over a million visas that we give out in this country--again, the most  generous of any country in the world--just do so  [[Page H3721]]  fairly, then you don't have people forced into sex trafficking, forced  into drug trafficking.   You know, the best, most compassionate thing we could say or do to  help people in Mexico would be to totally secure the border so only  people come in who are legally coming in and to shut down the money  that the drug cartels are making off the drug trafficking and the sex  trafficking because, according to some estimates, before they started  getting so much money from human trafficking, they estimated $80  billion, one source, $80 billion or so from drug trafficking.   And what an incredible business model. They are making all this money  off drugs, but they don't have to hire employees, because the employees  come to them and pay them a fee to help them get to a place where they  can sell the drugs for them at no charge to the drug cartels.   And don't think the drug cartels don't know how to say no and take  lives. They know how to cut heads off and put them on pikes to  intimidate people, to keep them in line.   There is nothing more difficult in Mexico than being a law  enforcement officer who is dedicated to truly enforcing the law fairly,  including against people in the drug cartels. Their lives are at great  risk, as are their families'. But if we secure the border, build a wall  where we need it, secure the border, then the money dries up to pay for  corruption in Mexico.   Mexico, you think about Mexico. They ought to be a top ten economy.  They have incredible natural resources. They have got a better location  than North America. They are between North and South America. They are  between the two oceans. They ought to be the greatest trader: all the  natural resources, and, of course, they have got some of the hardest  working people in the world.   Why are they not a top ten economy? Because of corruption.   How is corruption funded? From money coming across our border  illegally for drugs that come in illegally or sex trafficking coming  in.   What an incredible gift to the people of Mexico, so many of whom  dream of a day when they could have an incredibly vibrant economy and  they didn't have to worry about corrupt police or corrupt government  officials.   That is why I know, when you hear some Mexican elected official say  they don't want the border secured, then you can pretty well take it to  the bank they are taking money to the bank from the drug cartels;  otherwise, they would want to see Mexico reach its potential that  cannot be reached as long as we are allowing tens of billions of  dollars to flow from the United States to the drug cartels for the  corruption of government and harm to people.                                time  1330    Now, there used to be an unwritten rule, as I understood it, that the  drug cartels would not kill anybody, rob, they would not let crime go  on around Mexico's resorts. But that has certainly gone to the wayside.   My wife and I went on our honeymoon in Mexico. We celebrated our 25th  anniversary in Mexico. But, as a government official, going to Mexico,  with people and cartels knowing who I am, it is a dangerous place to go  now, so we haven't been back in a long time. I look forward to the day  when we can, and that day will be when we secure our border and Mexico  achieves the status in the world's economies that it should because of  what is there and the people. That would be a gift we should give them.  But in the meantime, we make clear that we are securing our border, you  are not coming in unless you come in through a port of entry, a legal  port of entry, and you come in legally, you are not coming in.   Now we hear the stories, we read the stories and get the accounts,  children are now a commodity. The drug cartels know that if somebody  comes in with a child, with them or with their group, oh, gee, this is  a big family. We saw all of the wild screaming and gnashing of teeth  over children not being with parents. So they know they are not going  to be separated and they are going to be able to stay in the country.  So they are coming. They are coming in greater numbers than ever  before.   If you look back at some of the numbers from the nineties, it was 80  percent, as I recall. And somebody was just referring to the numbers  recently, about 80 percent were single adults from Mexico, men, who  were coming for jobs. And now, because of the dramatization over what  happens every day, in every county in the country, and that is an adult  who has committed a crime or is arrested for committing a crime, being  separated from a child. It happens every day.   I used to sign warrants to arrest people, and they certainly didn't  bring the children to the jail with them. They were separated from  their children. It is what happens when a government is trying to be  fair and not make the children suffer or be punished for the sins of  the parent. That is what a caring society would do. You don't punish  the children for the wrongs of the parent. But now, children are a  commodity. They are being rented, purchased, and used in order to  better ensure that people coming in illegally will be able to stay  here.   I did vote against my own party's motion to recommit. That is not the  way that kind of spending should be done. Two billion dollars will end  up luring people again to this country. If we advertise, and people  will know, the drug cartels will use it. Look, they just voted through  a provision that will provide $2 to $3 billion for medicine,  medication, for people who come into the country illegally. That is not  something we should be playing a game with. That is why I voted no.  This is too serious to be taken lightly.   We shouldn't be playing politics with things like that. Let's secure  the border and take care of folks who are here and ensure that people  who come into this country do so legally.   Actually, I asked a question to Secretary Nielsen when she was at  Homeland Security this year. I asked her: What if we were to have  immigration judges, not in an interior courtroom somewhere across  America, but had immigration judges there at the border, even if we had  to just set up big tents, have the immigration judges at the border?  She said that would solve the problem. You wouldn't have to give  somebody a notice to come back for a hearing 4 years from now to  determine whether they can stay in the country legally or not, and for  which most people never come back for their hearing.   I am hopeful that, at some point, President Trump will say: Do you  know what, let's don't set hearings years off. In fact, Secretary  Nielsen, as I recall, indicated, if somebody is kept there at a  facility near the border, they normally have a hearing 90 to 100 days,  120 days, from when they are picked up. But if they are released on  some kind of recognizance or bond, it is years, on average, before they  have their hearing. Well, let's solve that.   Let's just send our immigration judges to the border. If you come  across and claim asylum, let's have your hearing today, and we will  know by tonight whether you get to stay or whether we are taking you  back across.   But it doesn't do much good to ``deport'' someone who is here  illegally if you don't secure the border. That is why a guy who ended  up in my felony courtroom, who had nine DWIs and didn't speak English,  and he finally came to my felony court after--normally, a third DWI  gets charged as a felony, but somehow, he had gotten by. And on the  ninth DWI--he was driving while intoxicated--he ended up causing an  accident, nearly killed some folks, and did serious damage.   But I figured if he had nine DWIs, this guy is a threat to the safety  of everybody in this country. Everybody legally and illegally in this  country is at risk if this guy is here, out, and driving.   So I went ahead and sent him to prison. Nine DWIs is far too many,  especially when you start doing serious bodily injury to people. And I  was shocked that within 6 months he was back in my courtroom. He was  driving drunk and hurt somebody else.   Through the interpreter, I asked him: How is he back here in my  courtroom? I sent him to prison. And he said: Well, about 3 months  after--well, at that time, it was not even 3 months, it may have been a  month--he was picked up and deported. They carried him to the border.  And through the interpreter, he explained that they made him walk  across the border. And I said: So how are you back here? He said: I  waited until the deportation officers drove off. And then he came back  across the border as soon as they left, got back to  [[Page H3722]]  drinking and driving, and ended up back in my courtroom.   So, this time, I thought, well, if he is going to be here, obviously,  he is an alcoholic, so I sent him to a substance abuse felony  punishment facility because everybody there is either an alcoholic or a  drug addict. They go through a 12-step program. And I figured, well, if  he is going to be in the country, for heaven's sake, he at least needs  to be clean and sober. And I got word that at that facility he was  there about 90 days before he was deported. I would imagine he came  back in the country somewhere, but, obviously, not back to my county.    So why wouldn't we enforce our borders? A country that has no  borders, or that has borders that are not enforced, it is not a  country, it is not definable, it is just kind of an area where people  go.   If we are going to continue to be a shining light for so many  countries and so many people around the world, we need to follow the  law, not show favoritism, not to people because they are poor, not to  people because they are rich, but to be fair and enforce the laws  across the board.   That brings me to an important point that has been in the news a  great deal lately, and, actually, it has been going on for some time.  This country, regardless of how many people may want to rewrite  history, was largely inhabited and founded by people who were  Christians, different denominations, who were looking to have a place  where they were not persecuted for being a Christian. And I know, we  are told, as Christians, we are going to suffer for Christ's sake. And  I know Jesus said, remember, when they hate you, they hated me first.   But, for whatever reason, we have been allowed to have a country,  unlike most any place in history, where you are not persecuted for  being a Christian. Now, there are different denominations that would  have big controversies with other denominations. Some of that was  playing out in the first 5 weeks of the constitutional convention in  1787.   That is when Ben Franklin gave his famous speech. How do we know what  he said? Well, Madison was taking notes. But afterwards, Franklin was  asked for a copy of his speech. He sat down and wrote it out. Everybody  who was there who saw the speech said: Oh, yeah, this is word for word  everything he said.   And I know most children apparently in the country are taught that  Ben Franklin was a deist, you know, someone who believed that there was  some force, some being, something that created the universe. And if  that thing, being, force still exists anymore, it never interferes with  the laws of nature or the activity of human beings, it never gets  involved. And kids are being taught Ben Franklin was a deist.   But he stood up. He is 82 years old. He has gout, he has advanced  arthritis, he is overweight, he has trouble getting up and down the few  steps into Independence Hall, he has trouble getting up, he has a cane,  and often had to have help.   And he hadn't really spoken to that point at the convention. One of  the people at the convention wrote that President Washington--he wasn't  President of the country, he was President of the constitutional  convention--that President Washington looked relieved when Dr. Franklin  sought recognition because there was so much screaming going on.  Franklin didn't have an M.D. or a Ph.D., but he was certainly  recognized as being worthy of being a doctor.   But Franklin gets up--he probably had help--and we know what he said  because he wrote it down. And he starts about saying, you know, we have  been going on for nearly 5 weeks. We have got more noes than ayes on  virtually every vote. And then this is his verbatim, he says:         How has it happened, sir, that we have not thought of       humbly seeking illumination from the source of all life?    That is not verbatim, but close.   He said:         In the beginning of the contest with Great Britain, when we       were sensible of danger, we had daily prayer in this room.       Our prayers so were heard, and they were graciously answered.    Then he goes on to point out that everybody in there should remember  specific things that they prayed for as leaders in the Continental  Congress during the Revolution, and that they should remember how  specific things they prayed for were answered by God.   And then back to verbatim he says: ``I have lived, sir, a long  time.'' He is a year or so away from meeting his maker. And he said:  ``And the longer I live, the more convincing proofs I see of this  truth--that God governs in the affairs of men. And if a sparrow cannot  fall to the ground without his notice, is it probable that an empire  can rise without his aid?''                                time  1345    He is talking about the Bible: We have been assured, sir, in the  sacred writings that no empire is going to rise without his aid.   He says that we have a chance to create something special. These are  not his verbatim words. He said if we take advantage of that and we  come together, by the grace of God, we are going to have a special  country. He adds, without God's grace, we are going to succeed no  better than the builders of Babel.   He said that we will be confounded by our local partial interests,  and we, ourselves, shall become a byword down through the ages.   He goes on and ends up making a motion, just like during the  Revolution, just like with the Continental Congress, that the  Constitutional Convention should start with prayer every day.   See, it was really a secular Congress because they voted that down.  If you go look at what the discussion was, there were a bunch of  different denominations there. Usually, the Quakers were most  disagreeable about whom they would approve for saying a prayer for the  whole group.   As the debate pointed out, yes, during the Revolution, we had a  treasury. We had money so we could hire a Christian chaplain to say the  prayer every day for us.   There wasn't anybody here that could say a prayer that everybody else  in the Convention would feel got a fair shake for their denomination.  But we could hire, agree on, one chaplain, one minister who would say a  prayer for everybody.   Here we are at the Convention, and we are not getting paid. We don't  have a treasury, so we are going to have to put off hiring a chaplain  to do the prayer every day until we get this constitution done. That is  why it didn't get approved.   Then Randolph from Virginia gets up. He says he understands that we  don't have money to hire a chaplain to do the prayer every day, but  here we are at the end of June--this is 1787. He said it is the end of  June, and we are about to celebrate our Nation's birthday. We are not  accomplishing anything, so why don't we recess here now and reconvene  together in a church that we all agree on, a Christian church. We all  go there together, and on our Nation's birthday, we worship God  together. Then we come back and try to work this constitution thing  out.   That passed. The Delegates at the Constitutional Convention came  together and worshipped on our Nation's birthday at the Reformed  Calvinist Church in Philadelphia, Reverend William Rogers presiding. He  was the minister. I think you can even find online one of the prayers  that he prayed for the Convention.   As somebody wrote back then, when they came back together, there were  differences. There was a different spirit, and they were able to come  together. They were able to reach an agreement.   There was such strong division among the most populous States. They  said we are the most populous States, so we ought to have more  representation. Others said, no, we can't come together unless we all  have equal representation.   The Great Compromise came together, that we will have two separate  bodies within the Congress. We will have one where States have  representation based on the population, and it won't be like the House  of Lords where they really don't have any power. This will be a  separate body. They will have just as much power as the other house,  but every State gets two representatives, and then we will balance.   That was the Great Compromise. It enabled them to come together.  There  [[Page H3723]]  were great concerns about human rights and government intrusion into  people's private matters. They wanted to make sure that a king or  President couldn't just sign an order to go search somebody's home,  take over a home, or go gather up anything they wanted.   They agreed that if we come together on this Constitution, then we  also agree that it must have a Bill of Rights that comes with it.   The first of the Bill of Rights that was approved, the first 10  amendments, they didn't want to have a Church of England that was the  official government church. They didn't want a government church.   Of course, now we got one. It is called, informally, the church of  secularism the Supreme Court has forced us into. Regardless of what  anybody thinks, a government--and I used to say in college that you  can't legislate morality. Eventually, I have realized a government  legislates somebody's morality. It may be no morality, and we have kind  of come to that.   Moses' face is up there because at one time he was considered to be  the greatest lawgiver of all time. You have Hammurabi, the Justinian  Code, started by Justin. Napoleon, Jefferson--Jefferson didn't help  with the Constitution, but these are all the great lawgivers,  considered as such. We have two or three Popes up here. But Moses was  supposed to be the great one.   In recent years, children are being taught there is no real right or  wrong. It is whatever you feel in your heart is wrong, and it is all  relative. Right and wrong are relative. That is not what Moses said.   I was hearing Dennis Prager earlier today saying you cannot have a  free country based on secularist beliefs, based on atheism. You can't.   The only way you can have the level of freedom we have had is not  requiring everybody to be a Christian but to base the government upon  Judeo-Christian beliefs. That has been our history.   We welcome people. We don't mind anybody having any religion or no  religion. But the only way you can have that kind of freedom is to base  it on Christian beliefs.   I know from visiting with General Jay Garner, who President Bush  initially sent to Iraq to talk to people and get a feel from the Iraqis  what kind of government they should have, he talked to a direct  descendant of Mohammed.   There were a lot of people with him. After they left, General Garner  asked if everybody heard what they said.   They all agreed they heard. There was a reporter there. They asked if  he was going to write that in a story. He said, no, nobody will believe  it. They would think he was crazy.   But this very devout Muslim, descendant of Mohammed, said, in  essence--summary--we need a government that is based on a constitution  that Iraqis write, that the government be composed of Iraqis, and the  constitution needs to be based on the teachings of Jesus.   After he left, General Garner asked: Did you guys all hear that?   He said, yes, he said they need a constitution based on the teachings  of Jesus. A devout Muslim descendant of Mohammed agreed that if you  really want a free society, use the teachings of Jesus.   The Founders knew, just like the descendant of Mohammed, that is the  best way to have a free country. But now we are seeing more and more  the persecution of Christians.   Now the U.N. General Secretary, back when he was in charge of all the  refugee programs, was asked about why there is not as high a percentage  of Christians in the U.N. refugee program as there is a percentage of  Christians in the areas where refugees are coming from, like Syria.   He basically made the statement that Christians are so very important  to those geographic areas that we think it is important to leave them  where they are. They were being wiped out where they were.   The truth is, when Christians were coming to the U.N. refugee camps  to be reassigned or sent elsewhere after that, they were often victims  of violence.   I read many reports, talked to people over in some of the refugee  camps. The Christians didn't want to go there. They didn't like the way  they were picked on, so you didn't find that many Christians in those  camps.   Here is an article from May 3. This is from the BBC because this  stuff is not being reported properly in the mainstream media in  America.   The title is, ``Christians Are `Most Persecuted Group.' '' It says,  ``The persecution of Christians in parts of the world is at or near  `genocide' levels, according to a report ordered by the Foreign  Secretary Jeremy Hunt.'' That is the Foreign Secretary in England.   Christians were the most persecuted religious group, is what this  study found.   ``The interim report said the main impact of `genocidal acts against  Christians is exodus' and that Christianity faced being `wiped out'  from parts of the Middle East. It warned the religion''--talking about  Christianity--`` `is at risk of disappearing' in some parts of the  world, pointing to figures which claimed Christians in Palestine  represent less than 1.5 percent of the population, while in Iraq they  had fallen from 1.5 million before 2003 to less than 120,000.''   `` `Evidence shows not only the geographic spread of anti-Christian  persecution, but also its increasing severity.' ''   It says, `` `In some regions, the level and nature of persecution is  arguably coming close to meeting the international definition of  genocide, according to that adopted by the U.N.' . . . Its findings  come after more than 250 people were killed and more than 500 wounded  in attacks at hotels and churches in Sri Lanka on Easter Sunday.''   I mean, this is the kind of stuff going on.   The article goes on, again from the BBC, `` `What we have forgotten  in that atmosphere of political correctness is actually the Christians  that are being persecuted are some of the poorest people on the  planet.'   ``In response to the report, the president of the Board of Deputies  of British Jews, Marie van der Zyl, said Jews had often been the  targets of persecution and felt for Christians who were discriminated  against on the basis of their faith.   `` `Whether it is authoritarian regimes or bigotry masked in the  mistaken guise of religion, reports like the one launched today remind  us that there are many places in which Christians face appalling levels  of violence, abuse, and harassment.' ''   Pretty tragic. Then here in the United States, this story from CBN  News, May 7, this year, the Pacific Institute, ``The Pacific Justice  Institute, PJI, announced Tuesday that a Bible study for elderly  residents of the Veterans Home of California has been restored.''                                time  1400    ``The facility is owned and operated by the California Department of  Veterans Affairs.   ``The nonprofit PJI,'' Pacific Justice Institute, ``also says its  attorneys will continue to fight for full restoration of religious  freedom in the facility.   ``After some negotiation, CalVet''--that is California Department of  Veterans Affairs--``said it would allow Artis Breau and her Bible study  attendees to resume the Bible study, effective immediately, after it  had been shut down for weeks.   ``However, CalVet''--that is California Department of Veterans  Affairs--``continues to insist that it can investigate and substantiate  allegations against Breau and her fellow residents for expressing  religious views that it''--the California Department of Veterans  Affairs--``deems `offensive,' and even for discussing Heaven and  salvation.   `` `We are encouraged that CalVet realized it could no longer  prohibit and threaten the veterans' Bible study,' PJI President Brad  Dacus said in a press release. At the same time, the agency's position  that it can continue to punish religious''--and really, Christian  expression is specifically what CalVet is going after--``expression it  deems discourteous or offenses is unacceptable. We've won an important  first round in this battle for these heroes''--the veterans--``and we  are committed to seeing this through to complete victory.   ``PJI attorneys began representing Breau last fall when staff at the  veterans home complained that she had committed `emotional abuse' and  `elder abuse' by allegedly causing another  [[Page H3724]]  resident to lose sleep after a discussion about Heaven and hell. Last  week, CalVet admitted the allegation was unsubstantiated. . . . ''   ``This past March, a CalVet attorney threatened to have Breau removed  from the home if she did not immediately halt her longtime Bible study.   `` `What we've seen at the Veterans Home of California should concern  every freedom-loving American' . . . `Of all people, our veterans and  their widows from the Greatest Generation should enjoy the greatest  blessings of liberty--not the least. We're not about to let up until  these veterans have complete freedom.' ''   That is from the PJI attorneys. It is just outrageous how wrongheaded  people have gotten, and that is because they are imposing a court- ordered imposition of secularism.   We have come to a point in political correctness where the only group  that is politically correct to abuse, belittle, and discriminate  against is Christians. You don't have to like Christians, but for  heaven's sake, that is the kind of freedom in allowing Christians to  worship freely that made us the greatest country in history.   Now we have got the Equality Act. Supposedly, it is going to come up  next week.   The Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 was passed by a huge  majority of Democrats in 1993 because they were concerned, in 1993,  some of them, including our current chairman of the Judiciary  Committee, Jerry Nadler, about the persecution of Christians and Jews,  and they saw the need to have the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of  1993.   Back then, these same people believed that Moses knew what he was  talking about, and when Jesus quoted Moses verbatim about marriage,  that he knew what he was talking about.   In fact, we knew that that still was true in 2008, from David  Axelrod's book. They knew that Barack Obama could not win the  Presidency if he said of marriage with the same sex, that that was  fine. It was not sufficient to say--you could have same-sex  relationships. That was fine. But marriage is what the Bible said is  between a man and a woman.   Apparently, they had polled it every which way, and in 2008, if you  thought marriage was something besides what Moses believed and that  Jesus said as he quoted Moses verbatim, then you couldn't get elected  President.   Now, if you say: I still think what Moses and Jesus said is what  marriage ought to be. Same-sex relations are one thing, but marriage,  historically, except perhaps during the days of Moses--my understanding  is even in Sodom and Gomorrah, obviously, same-sex relationships were  fine, but even there, marriage was for procreation; therefore, it was a  man and a woman. Now if you say that, you are to be persecuted. You are  to be destroyed for believing Moses and Jesus knew what they were  talking about.   But some of those same people who rammed through the Religious  Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 have now added this provision that that  Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 shall not provide a claim or  a defense to a claim under this bill, and there is even a provision  here that you can have a claim filed against a bank, a lending  institution, if they don't lend money to someone who is gender  confused.   That is what gender dysphoria is. That is what the DSM-5 calls it,  gender dysphoria, like the opposite of euphoria. It is confusion about  one's gender, biological gender, which may disagree with what they feel  like that day.   We are seeing great gains made by women in women's sports. If this  becomes law, that will be destroyed. You will have men's sports, and  you will have coed sports.   As the lady who was the first to ever benefit by having a women's  scholarship from Villanova said--she is a Ph.D.--when she testified:  Look, you have got thousands of men who can beat the best time in the  world for the women's 400 meter in the 2016 Olympics. Women won't be  the ones getting the scholarships anymore if this Equality Act becomes  law.   Martina Navratilova, she makes no bones about being a lesbian, and  she has been basically destroyed in social media for saying that a  woman should not have to compete with a biological man. It is unfair.   We had a lady who tells us, she was a lesbian testifying: Look,  women's sports are going to be destroyed if you pass this bill. All the  great gains made for women being treated fairly and equally are going  to go by the wayside.   I know from my days as a judge, hearing the tragic stories of sexual  assault and aggravated sexual assault, that women suffer from a greater  percentage of post-traumatic stress disorder than soldiers do if they  have been sexually assaulted.   One of the things that can trigger the trauma again is being in a  confined space and a man comes in. But the response from the majority  is, well, they just basically need to get over it because we don't want  to hurt the man's feelings if he thinks he is a woman.   I hope this doesn't pass. I hope it doesn't become law. There are  some great things in here for equality, but that is not one of them.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.
