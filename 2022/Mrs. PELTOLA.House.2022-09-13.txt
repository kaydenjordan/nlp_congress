 Madam Speaker, I thank Leader Hoyer for the very kind  introduction and most especially for his words about my predecessor,  Congressman for all Alaska, Don Young.   I thank you, Speaker Pelosi, Minority Leader McCarthy, and so many of  my colleagues from both parties who have been very kind in welcoming me  to the House of Representatives.   I am also so grateful to have my husband, my seven children and their  loved ones, two grandchildren, and two sisters here with me this week.  I couldn't do this without their love and support and votes.   It is the honor of my life to represent Alaska, a place my elders and  ancestors have called home for thousands of years, where to this day  many people in my community carry forward our traditions of hunting and  fishing.   I am humbled and deeply honored to be the first Alaska Native to be  elected to this body, the first woman to hold Alaska's House seat. But  to be clear, I am here to represent all Alaskans. I will work every day  to make all Alaskans proud that they have entrusted me to carry their  voices here.   I am excited to work with all of you, to explain and take action to  address Alaskans' needs, just as you did with my predecessor, the  Congressman for all Alaska, Don Young.   Like all Alaskans, I mourned his passing. In Yupik, when we lose a  loved one, we say ``this is not the end.'' ``Tua-i-ngunrituq.''   Don was a true institution, an Alaska icon, someone who fought so  hard and so well for our State for 49 years. I know many of you loved  Don, and I am sorry for your loss, too. I am committed to securing his  legacy of bipartisanship and a deep respect for this institution. In my  few days in Washington, I have already begun forming friendships with  colleagues on both sides of the aisle.   Now, I might have a different approach than Don. You know how soft- spoken he was. But you will still be hearing all about Alaska, our  people, and our State's unique needs.   I promised Alaskans I would fight for our families, to lower the cost  of living that is pushing too many of us to the brink, to invest in  high-quality childcare and early education, and to grow Alaska's  economy with good jobs that pay a fair wage.   Resource development is important to Alaska's economy and our  national energy security, and I look forward to working to ensure our  State remains a global leader.   I also committed to fighting for our fish. For so many Alaska  communities, fish are life. Our fish harvest is the best in the world.  Half of the wild salmon sold in the world comes from our State,  supporting good jobs that sustain strong communities. Subsistence  fishing is not only an essential food source for so many Alaska  families and communities, it is a sacred part of our traditions.   Again, thank you for your warm welcome. We have a lot to get done,  and I am looking forward to getting to work.   ``Thank you very much.'' ``Quyana cakneq.''                            ____________________
