 Mr. Speaker, last week I hosted a dozen of  constituent events in my district. At every turn, families asked the  same question: When will Congress investigate the President's  involvement with Russia?   I have received many calls and e-mails about Russia for weeks. The  American people are deeply and rightly concerned with this  administration's involvement with the Putin regime. We know the  President's hand-picked national security adviser was forced to resign  over his communications with Russia. We know that if Moscow did indeed  influence our free elections, we have a duty to stand up against those  threats and not sweep them under the rug.   We do not support Putin's human rights record, his treatment of  journalists, or his invasions of Georgia and Ukraine, where my  grandmother was born.   So why is the people's House protecting Vladimir Putin? Why are we  not standing up to President Trump and investigating his dealings with  the Putin regime? What are we afraid of?   To my colleagues on the House Oversight and Government Reform  Committee, what are you afraid we will find out if we investigate?   Mr. Speaker, when are we going to get answers for the American  people?   Lastly, I welcome Chicago WVON's Matt McGill and Planned Parenthood's  Donna Miller to tonight's joint session.
