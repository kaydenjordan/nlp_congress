 Mr. Chairman, I thank the ranking member for yielding.   Mr. Chairman, I come from the Commonwealth of Virginia, a  Commonwealth which is rich in natural resources. We have an abundant  supply of energy sources, but this legislation would destroy the  untapped potential for research and investment in oil and gas resources  off our coast.   This bill would stifle innovation, prevent job creation, and severely  limit the ability of our Nation to realize its full potential of  achieving long-term energy independence.   Studies have shown that exploring offshore oil and natural gas  resources would bring thousands of jobs to Virginia and significantly  boost its economy.                                time  1300    Earlier this spring I traveled with Congressman Scalise and a  delegation of Members to his district in Louisiana, and helicoptered  off into the Gulf of Mexico where I was able to see firsthand the great  strides that have been made in energy exploration, technology, and  innovation, and the great benefits that have accrued to Louisiana:  Louisiana schools, Louisiana roads, and port projects as a result.   The amazing developments in ensuring that energy resources can be  explored and extracted safely and with minimal impact to our  environment, demonstrated to me that similar efforts can be achieved  back home in the waters off the coast of Virginia, and that our  environmentally sensitive areas would be protected for future  generations to enjoy, while we can lower energy costs for residents and  businesses across our great Commonwealth.   H.R. 1941 would block millions of dollars from going to Virginia and  other coastal States. If South Carolina doesn't want the money, fine,  but the Federal Government should not be in the business of halting  Virginia and, in turn, America's economic growth. Failing to give  States like mine the ability to explore the resources off our coast  would be a grave disservice to my constituents, our Commonwealth, and  our Nation.   I urge my colleagues to oppose this misguided legislation.
