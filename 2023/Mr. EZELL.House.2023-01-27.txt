 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor two  fallen heroes: Bay St. Louis Police officers, Sergeant Steve Robin and  Officer Branden Estorffe, who were shot and killed in the line of duty  this past December.   Sergeant Robin served 3 years with the Bay St. Louis Police  Department after prior service with the Hancock County Sheriff's  Office.   Officer Estorffe served 2 years with the Bay St. Louis Police  Department.   During their law enforcement careers, both men received numerous  accolades for their dedication to protecting their community. May we  remember their selfless commitment, their service, and ultimately their  sacrifice.   Their families are in the thoughts and prayers of myself, this body,  and everyone in Mississippi.                            ____________________
