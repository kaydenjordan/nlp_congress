 Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this  bill. As the House Liberty Caucus wrote, this bill violates the 10th  Amendment that conservatives have always supported.   More troubling is the way this bill is worded. It could lead to what  the Liberty Caucus describes as a ``massive expansion of Federal  authority'' because it could make almost every medical malpractice case  a Federal case. Every case should not be a Federal case.   The States have already put pretty severe limits on medical  malpractice cases. I have two other problems with this bill. I am in my  29th year in Congress. The doctors were asking for this $250,000 limit  then, too. $250,000 29 years ago is certainly not $250,000 today.   Finally, this bill, in the end, is saying there are really no limits  on suits against 99.8 percent of the people I represent, but we are  going to have special protection for this one very respected group of  people. Conservatives have traditionally had more faith in people than  in government.   I was a judge for 7.5 years before coming to Congress. Conservatives  used to believe strongly in the jury system, and still should believe  in that today.
