 Madam Speaker, you know Danny came to Congress a year  after I did. He must have been underage at the time, as you can see the  difference in our appearance, but he was working on what was then the  House Interior Committee, Natural Resources.   He is a veteran, as am I, of many years of working with George Miller  in the perpetual water wars in California. I am going to say Danny  didn't get that one fixed.   But then when we took back over after the election in 2006, and we  did some of the best things we have ever done for college affordability  and Pell grants in the Education and Labor Committee, Danny was right  there working on that.   We made loans forgivable through a public service. We limited the  length of time you would have to pay them if you were in a low-income  job. We greatly increased Pell grants, and we paid for all that by  stopping subsidized private bank loans with guarantees that they will  never lose any money.   Unfortunately, we have lost a little ground since then, but I think  this Congress might recapture those things and will look back to the  work he did then to make higher education more affordable.   Madam Speaker, we had a couple of Members say: Oh, he was so good to  me when I didn't know anything and I came in.   He was a mentor not only to staff, but to Members, and a good friend  to me over many years. I hope Danny enjoys his next iteration, whatever  it is.
