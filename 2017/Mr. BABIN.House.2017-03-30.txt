 Mr. Speaker, I wish to thank the gentleman from Iowa, my  good friend for yielding to me.   I rise to express my strong support for the announced policy by  Attorney General Jeff Sessions that will terminate U.S. Department of  Justice grants to sanctuary cities. These are the localities that have  chosen not to cooperate with the Federal Government when its seeks to  deport already-detained criminal aliens.   Under this Trump policy, your hard-earned tax dollars will no longer  go to cities and counties that thumb their nose at the Federal  immigration authorities and refuse to cooperate.   In President Trump's first 2 months in office, this administration  has acted to secure our borders, to encourage compliance with Federal  immigration law, and to deport criminal aliens. The previous  administration put out the welcome mat for criminal aliens. Thanks to  Trump, the welcome mat has now been removed.   A few short days ago, the national news broke on how two illegal  aliens from Central America raped a 14-year-old girl in the boys  bathroom of a public high school in Rockville, Maryland. These two  young men, Henry Sanchez-Milian, an 18-year-old from Guatemala, and  Jose Montano, a 17-year-old from El Salvador, came across our southern  border last year as unaccompanied minors. The Obama administration  initially targeted them for deportation proceedings, but they were  later released to join relatives in Maryland.   When asked about the situation, Rockville school officials said that  the legal status of these two individuals did not matter, as Rockville  has declared itself to be a sanctuary city. I beg to differ. It does  matter. If the Federal Government had done its duty and immediately  returned these illegal immigrants to their home country, this young  girl would not have been brutally raped.   For the sake of this young girl, we must secure our borders. This  vicious crime would never have taken place had the Obama administration  followed the law and secured our borders. The good news is that the new  administration is working hard to secure our borders, to deport  criminal aliens, and to protect the lives of American citizens.   Cracking down on sanctuary cities is an important first step. In the  first month of the Trump administration, ICE issued 3,083 detainers.  These are orders for local authorities to keep criminal aliens in  custody for 48 hours to enable U.S. Immigration and Customs  Enforcement, or ICE, agents to come and get these criminal aliens for  deportation. 206 of these detainees were just declined, meaning that  local authorities deliberately ignored ICE's detainer requests and  released these individuals back out onto American streets.  [[Page H2580]]    This is especially concerning because 44 percent of those individuals  had already been convicted of crimes in the United States. These  weren't just petty crimes, folks. These include: homicide, rape,  assault, domestic violence, indecent exposure with a minor, sex offense  against a minor, aggravated assault with a weapon, resisting an  officer, vehicle theft, kidnapping, driving under the influence, hit- and-run, and sexual assault.   Thank you, Mr. President, for holding accountable these sanctuary  cities that released these criminals back out onto our streets.   We are also working to force foreign countries to take back their  criminal alien citizens; 25-year-old Casey Chadwick was murdered by an  illegal alien from Haiti, Jean Jacques. Jacques had been released 6  months earlier and ordered deported after serving a 19-year sentence  for attempted murder.   Haiti had refused multiple times to take back Jacques, and under the  Obama administration policy, Jacques was simply released onto U.S.  streets to return to his life of crime, although Haiti had gladly taken  billions of U.S. aid. That is why I have introduced H.R. 82, the  Criminal Alien Deportation Enforcement Act. My bill withholds foreign  aid from countries that do not repatriate their criminal aliens.   This commonsense step ensures that countries that benefit from the  goodwill of the United States must hold up their end of the bargain and  take back their criminal aliens. And through his recent executive  order, President Trump declared that he would restrict the issuance of  visas to certain residents of noncooperative countries. Congress should  support the President by locking in this enforcement with legislation  so that a future President does not reverse this enforcement.                                time  1115    On behalf of the American people, I applaud President Trump and I  call on my colleagues to cosponsor my legislation to lock in these  protections for future generations of Americans and keep them safe.    That is H.R. 80.    H.R. 80.   The gentleman from Iowa, I am going to correct myself. That is H.R.  81, H.R. 81.    I have H.R. 82, which I just discussed, and that is the  repatriation of criminal aliens.    You are, Mr. King. You are a sponsor. And I thank you for  your cosponsorship and trying to keep our American citizens, our  constituents, safe.
