 Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of the en bloc  package, which includes my amendment to increase funding for the  Department of Veterans Affairs' electronic records system.   One of the most insistent casework requests I receive is from  veterans who are unable to receive care due to the Department's records  request backlog. I have raised with the Department individual cases,  and I have also been working with local veterans service organizations  to advocate on behalf of their members. Yet, it still takes anywhere  from 6 to 8 months to get anything back from the archives. That is not  acceptable.   Digitizing veterans' records will expedite their requests and improve  their experience.   I know first-hand what veterans experience while on Active Duty. It  is our responsibility to ensure that they have access to the high- quality care and services promised to them when they swore an oath to  protect and serve our country.   Mr. Chair, I urge support for my amendment.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Biden  administration's efforts to expand and strengthen the Abraham Accords.   When I met with Israeli political and military leaders last month,  they emphasized the importance of regional defense and deterrence  against Iran's malign activities.   That is why President Biden's reaffirmation of the United States'  commitment to Israel's security during his recent trip to the region is  so important. Our alliance with Israel is built on shared values and  shared interests, which includes strengthening regional security and  economic opportunity.   Saudi Arabia's decision to open its airspace to civilian flights to  and from Israel is a significant step toward regional integration and  diplomatic normalization. This important step, thanks to President  Biden's diplomatic efforts, lays the groundwork for additional  economic, political, and security ties between these two countries.   I commend President Biden for his success in building on the Abraham  Accords, and I look forward to working with the administration to  further deepen regional partnerships that benefit Israel's security.                            ____________________
