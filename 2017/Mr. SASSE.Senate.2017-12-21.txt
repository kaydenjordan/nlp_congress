 Mr. President, I thank my senior Senator for leading us in  this resolution.   Nebraska volleyball continues to dominate. If there is any debate  about the best volleyball State in the Union, there should be no more.  Nebraska has proved, yet again, we have the best team, the best  coaching staff, and indisputably the best fans in the country.   Two years ago, this team won the national championship at home in  Omaha, setting records with the crowds that attended the games there,  and last week in Kansas City, we set another alltime record with the  most watched championship volleyball game ever at 18,516 fans,  including my 6-year old who stayed awake at nearly 11 p.m. as we were  finishing, and he was deciding to watch it upside down, hanging over  the seats from the upper decks at the arena in Kansas City.   So I proudly join the senior Senator and Husker nation in  congratulating these young women, saying ``Go Big Red'' on behalf of  all 1.9 million Nebraskans.   Just two stats of note. First, in the earlier round at the final  four, Nebraska beat Penn State. Those are the two winningest teams in  the history of volleyball. Nebraska has the most wins at 1,308. Penn  State has the greatest winning percentage. We have now won five  championships in 22 years, as well as three runner-up, second-place  finishes in the last 30 years.   Coach Cook, as Senator Fischer mentioned, has won four championships  at Nebraska over the last 17 years. The alltime record for the history  of volleyball is five national championships, and we expect that Coach  Cook will set that new record.   So I join my senior Senator in urging the Senate to pass this  resolution for the University of Nebraska women's volleyball team.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.
