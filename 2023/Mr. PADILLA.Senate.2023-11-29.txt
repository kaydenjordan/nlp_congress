 Madam President, I rise today to congratulate  Bruce Saito, director of the California Conservation Corps--CCC--on a  decades-long career spent protecting California's environment, building  a climate workforce of the future, and introducing generations of  Californians to the conservation movement.   Today, the CCC is the oldest and largest conservation corps in the  country and stands as a hallmark of California's commitment to the  environment. But in 1977, just 1 year into its nascent mission, a young  Bruce Saito signed up to serve with the organization as a supervisor  and instructor, initiating what would become nearly a half-century of  service protecting the beautiful State he grew up in.   From the beginning, Bruce worked diligently, earning promotions to  become the director of the Los Angeles Urban Center and conservationist  supervisor at the CCC Camarillo Center. In 1986, he left the CCC to  help found the Los Angeles Conservation Corps, where he would serve for  three decades transforming the nonprofit into one of the largest in the  country. Thanks to Bruce, over 100,000 trees have been planted in and  around Los Angeles, and parks around the city have thrived.   In 2015, Bruce would return to his roots when Governor Jerry Brown  appointed him to serve as director of the CCC, where he served until  October 31, 2023. In his time working there, Bruce has helped countless  young Californians, giving young people valuable skills that in turn  launched many of their careers and ignited lifelong passions for  conservation.   California is a leader in the fight against the climate crisis--not  just in the United States, but around the world. But that ethos of  environmentalism, the culture of care for the community, wasn't always  inevitable. California remains the environmental envy of the Nation  because of people like Bruce, who not only had the passion to protect  our earth but the willingness to bring others along with him.   And it is because of people like Bruce that our children's generation  has a chance to know the same beauty of the land around us that we grew  up with.   All of California wishes Bruce well in his much-deserved retirement,  and we thank him for his decades of service.                            ____________________
