 Madam Speaker, it is nice to see our colleague back, ready  for the fight. It is nice to have him back.   Madam Speaker, I am pleased to speak in favor of the INVEST in  America Act today. This type of investment in our country's surface  transportation is long overdue.   The American Society of Civil Engineers has rated our infrastructure  a C-minus and said that we will need additional $2.6 trillion over the  next decade to make the needed upgrades and repairs.   In New Jersey, drivers lose an average of $713 per year from driving  on our roads, and 7.8 percent of our bridges are structurally  deficient.   The INVEST in America Act will deliver $343 billion for roads,  bridges, and safety; $109 billion for transit; and $95 billion for  freight and passenger rail.   Beyond improving our surface transportation networks, this bill will  make crucial investments to reduce carbon pollution and increase  climate resiliency.   I also want to thank Chairman DeFazio and Ranking Member Graves for  including funding for Member Designated Projects in the INVEST in  America Act, which will deliver necessary resources to communities in a  transparent and accountable fashion.   My district will receive critical funding for projects to connect  pedestrians with transit, improve roadway safety, construct a ferry  terminal, and improve drainage systems and traffic signals.   This bill is a win for New Jersey and a win for our country. We have  costly needs, and the INVEST in America Act meets them.                                time  1330
