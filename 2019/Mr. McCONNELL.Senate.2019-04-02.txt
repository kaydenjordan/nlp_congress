 Madam President, last night the Senate had an  opportunity to pass an important package of disaster relief funding for  communities all across our country. Unfortunately, it didn't happen.  Our Democratic colleagues voted down the efforts of Chairman Shelby and  Senator Perdue to put together a comprehensive package, and it remains  unfinished business.   As recently as 1 month ago, some congressional Democrats had  expressed a clear commitment to immediate, bipartisan action on  disaster relief, and the package considered yesterday represented a  long list of priorities from actually both sides of the aisle--the only  such list that had the President's explicit support.   It would have helped local schools, hospitals, and transportation  infrastructure get back up and running, farmers and ranchers recoup  losses, and our Nation's military restore readiness at bases and  installations in harm's way. It would have been an immediate and  significant step forward for the coastal communities of Florida and the  Carolinas that are still picking up the pieces after a devastating  hurricane season and for the western communities, as well, besieged by  wildfires, for the families in Puerto Rico who rely on nutrition  assistance that is dwindling, for those in the path of last month's  tornadoes in Alabama and Georgia, and for large swathes of the  heartland still grappling with floodwaters.   So I am disappointed that political games carried the day yesterday,  but I assure the American people that our work on this subject is far  from finished.                                 Nominations    Madam President, on another matter, 217 days--217 days--is how long  has elapsed between President Trump's sending the Senate his nomination  for a Federal Railroad Administrator and  [[Page S2164]]  this body's confirming him. For 217 days, a 45-year veteran of the  railroad with unquestioned expertise sat and sat on the Senate  calendar. He wasn't controversial. He had been voice-voted out of  committee. He was the kind of nominee on which even the prospect of  having to file cloture should have been laughable, but my Democratic  colleagues wouldn't let him get a vote.   Finally, after about 7 months and several high-profile railway  accidents, our colleagues across the aisle finally relented and let  this nominee go forward. After all those months of obstruction, not a  single one of them ended up recording a vote against him. No one voted  against him. So it was 217 days for an unquestionably qualified nominee  for a seriously important job whom literally no one really opposed.   Call it a case study in the Senate's dysfunction when it comes to  President Trump's nominees. If anything, the case study actually is not  extreme enough because at least this person was eventually confirmed  without a completely pointless cloture vote, followed by even more time  supposedly debating a nominee on whom Senators do not actually  disagree.   Perhaps more illustrative might be the cases of unobjectionable  district court nominees whose nominations were slow-walked through  months of idle time, only to receive unanimous support when it finally  came for confirmation votes.   Last January, four such nominations came before the Senate. Each was  noncontroversial. Each was well-qualified. Each, nevertheless, required  a cloture vote. Yet after weeks on the calendar, each passed without  drawing a single ``no'' vote. No one opposed them, and yet it took a  week.   These were four of the historic 128 cloture votes on nominations we  had to hold on nominations in this administration's first 2 years--128.  This is comprehensive, across-the-board heel-dragging like nobody in  this body has ever seen before. It is more than five times--five  times--as many cloture votes on nominations as in the comparative  periods--listen to this--for Presidents Carter, Reagan, Bush, Clinton,  Bush, and Obama combined--combined. In other words, it is systematic  obstruction, not targeted, thoughtful opposition to a few marquee  nominations or rare circumstances but a grinding, across-the-board  effort to delay and obstruct the people this President puts up, even if  they have unquestionable qualifications and even if the job is  relatively low-profile.   As I said last week, I am sure every Presidential election this side  of George Washington has left some Senators unhappy with the outcome,  but never before, to my knowledge, has the unhappy group so  comprehensively tried to stop a new President from assembling the very  basics of an administration--hundreds and hundreds of days in Senate  purgatory for uncontroversial nominees to mid-level posts and months of  delay for lower court nominees who go on to receive unanimous  confirmation votes.   This behavior is novel. It is a break from Senate tradition, and it  is something this body needs to address, not just for the sake of this  President but for future Presidents of any party, because at this rate,  the Senate is flirting with a dangerous new norm.   Today it may be Senate Democrats who are intent on endlessly  relitigating the 2016 election and holding up all of these qualified  people, but absent a change, these tactics seem guaranteed to become  standard practice for Senate minorities on both sides. I don't think  any of us want that future.   We need to stop things from deteriorating further. We need to fix  this. We need to let the President assemble his team and let the  American people have the government they actually voted for. We need to  turn back toward the Senate's institutional tradition in this vital  area for the sake of the Nation's future.   My Republican colleagues and I joined with Democrats back in 2013 and  supported the same sort of modest changes to our nominations process  through the same sort of standing order. Were we overjoyed that  President Obama had just won reelection? No, but we still thought he  deserved to stand up a government. So a big bipartisan majority--I  voted for it--including the leaders of both parties agreed to trim the  postcloture time on lower-level nominees. I was the minority leader. It  was a Democratic President. I voted for it.   Supreme Court nominees weren't touched, nor circuit courts, nor top  executive branch posts, but for district court judges and lower-level  executive jobs, even as Republicans were in the minority, many of us  agreed to test out an abbreviated process for President Obama's  nominees.   The process that we agreed to then is very similar to the resolution  the Senate will vote on later today. As I have discussed, Senators  Blunt and Lankford have proposed a similar set of changes to fix the  current mess that would also become permanent going forward. Their  resolution would make the Senate more functional and more consistent.  The rules that were good enough for President Obama's second term would  also apply under President Trump and every other President into the  future.   I would submit to my colleagues that a modest reform like this is  either a good idea or it isn't. The answer can't be flip-flop back and  forth depending upon which party occupies the White House.   So I will conclude this way. I believe that every one of my  colleagues knows that our present situation is unhealthy for this body  and for any administration. I believe every Member of this body knows  that the precedent that is being set is unsustainable.   So, look, I would urge all of our colleagues on both sides: Why don't  we do the right thing for the Senate? Let's show the country that  partisanship is not poison to absolutely everything. Let's demonstrate  that the U.S. Senate can still take a modest step to improve its own  workings on a strong bipartisan vote and do it through regular order.  We did it in 2013 when the roles were reversed. We should do it again  this week.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I enter a motion to reconsider the  vote.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session  to consider Executive Calendar No. 87.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.
