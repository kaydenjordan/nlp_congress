 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  Gun Violence Survivors Week.   The gun violence epidemic in our Nation is destroying lives. A recent  study found that 58 percent of adults in America reported that they or  someone they care about has experienced gun violence in their lifetime.  Think about that. More than half of the adults in America have been  touched by gun violence. It doesn't have to be this way.   In January of last year, our former colleague and gun violence  survivor, Gabby Giffords, joined me, the Speaker, and members of the  Gun Violence Prevention Task Force as we introduced H.R. 8, the  Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2019. It was 8 years to the day  that she was shot. Gabby had one message for us in Congress. She said:  ``We must never stop fighting.''   And the House did just that. We kept fighting, and we passed H.R. 8  almost 1 year ago, 344 days ago, to be exact.   Majority Leader McConnell has had 344 days to act--to fight gun  violence. What has he done? Nothing. Nothing. Not one vote, not one  hearing. Survivors have called on him to act. More than 90 percent of  Americans support the bill. Why won't he give the bill a vote?    Every time there is a mass shooting that makes headlines, the  Republican leadership sends thoughts and prayers.   Survivors don't want your thoughts and prayers; they want a vote.  They want to keep guns away from felons. They want to keep guns away  from domestic abusers.   I call on the Senate to act. Honor survivors. Do your job. Pass H.R.  8 for Gabby and for every survivor across our country.                            ____________________
