 Mr. Speaker, the administration has announced that  it will terminate temporary protected status, or TPS, for Nicaragua  while extending the immigration protection for Honduras for merely 6  months. In the coming weeks, an announcement on Haiti's TPS designation  is expected.   I am greatly worried about these decisions because over 100,000  Hondurans and Haitians legally residing in our communities could be  deported and forced to go back to the instability and chaos in their  home countries.   For years, the United States has been providing necessary funding for  Honduras, which is still struggling with crime and security challenges,  and for Haiti, which continues to be impacted by devastating natural  disasters. This is precisely why Congress enacted TPS: so that we can  provide a safe haven to those who are unable to securely return to  their home countries.   Mr. Speaker, the decision to send these individuals back would be a  setback to our bilateral relations with those nations while tearing  these families apart.   I strongly urge the administration to extend TPS for Hondurans and  Haitians residing in our beautiful country.                            ____________________
