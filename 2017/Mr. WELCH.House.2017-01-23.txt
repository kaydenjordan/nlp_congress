 I thank my colleagues for their support, the former  chairman of the committee and now chair of the Subcommittee on Energy.  He is a very important person over there, and there are no words I  could convey that would meet the reputation of Mr. Upton. I thank him  and Ms. DeGette very much.   They have said a lot of the specific content of this bill. This is a  situation where Congress passed a good law. There was a provision in it  that needed to be corrected, and, lo and behold, Congress is correcting  that provision. It is about these security devices that obviously can't  operate on no-power mode. They have got to be on. When the bad guys  come in, we have got to be watching. That is really what this is all  about.   It is a combination of the bipartisan commitment that we have had to  energy efficiency, especially last year. I do give Mr. Upton a lot of  credit for this. We have had a lot of debates in this Congress about  climate change, about the science, and aside from--we don't need to get  into that--to embrace as we have in a bipartisan way, there are  enormous benefits to efficiency every single place we can find it.   This efficiency bill originally was applying to all these devices to  put them in no-load mode. That was cutting down on use of electricity.  It was cutting down on carbon emissions. It was saving people money.  But the no-load obviously couldn't apply to security devices.   Last year, Mr. Pompeo, when he was a Congressman, supported this, and  now that he is going to be our leader in the CIA, he knows you have got  to keep that watching device on when the bad guys are lurking around.   We are back this year. One of our first bills to be passed and  hopefully signed by the President is the extension of the correction  that we made sometime ago. I am delighted to be here with my colleagues  in support of this legislation, getting this House of Representatives  off to a constructive start.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Young for being a great partner  in the presentation of this bill. Many of us worked together on rural  telecommunications issues, from getting broadband to all Vermonters and  folks in rural parts of your districts to improving our wireless  infrastructure to ensuring we have adequate choice and competition in  cable markets. That is because it is our desire, and mine especially,  to ensure that rural America has comparable telecom services to urban  and suburban America, just as the 1996 Telecommunications Act requires.  Making that happen requires constant effort and focus.   We often focus on rural broadband accessibility and affordability so  that the next generation of technological innovation does not skip  rural America and leave it behind. The promise of innovation, like the  Internet of things, should not be earmarked just for urban and suburban  America, which is why it is backwards and unfortunate that we are still  talking about finding ways to ensure that traditional landline  telephone calls can be completed without interruption on a consistent  basis, but that is exactly what this bill that I worked on with  Representative Young is getting at.   Our bill would require the FCC, the Federal Communications  Commission, to establish rules that require third-party providers--or  least cost routers, as they are called, which is the problem in the  call chain--to register their companies, for the first time, with the  FCC and, therefore, have to comply with FCC service quality  regulations, just like other companies.   This legislation would make it easier for the FCC to hold accountable  third-party providers. The FCC will finally know who they are and make  them comply with those quality standards.   This is really important in rural areas because we have got companies  that do business with urban America. In Vermont, Dakin Farm had rural  call completion problems during their busiest times in 2012. That was  the Thanksgiving to Christmas holiday period.   It really hurt their bottom line. It put them at a competitive  disadvantage. When people call in and the call is dropped, they think  it is bad service from Dakin Farm or the company that they are calling,  when it is not. Those folks have to then deal with the reputational  harm that is caused.   It is important in rural school districts like Camels Hump in Vermont  that rely on these calls when there is a snowstorm or ice storm--and  there is one coming tonight--to check whether, in fact, they have got  to get their kids to school or not. So it is a big deal when they need  it.   I appreciate, by the way, the work that Representative Young has done  on this. I look forward to this bill passing both Chambers and being  signed into law so we can, hopefully, make rural call completion issues  a thing of the past.                                time  1715
