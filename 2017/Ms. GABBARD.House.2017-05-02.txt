 Mr. Speaker, I recently wrapped up a townhall tour  across my district in Hawaii, visiting every single island. A common  theme that I heard from folks was one of concern and questions about  this Republican healthcare bill that we may be voting on later this  week.   They are worried about their aging parents not being able to pay for  their premiums and prescriptions and that newly added provisions that  threaten those with preexisting conditions with skyrocketing costs will  have such a devastating impact.   Every time we hear about the new versions and new changes to this  bill, it gets worse than the one before. Among a host of new problems,  the latest version strips away protections on healthcare benefits like  maternity care, substance abuse, mental health services, while also  expanding an already-crippling age tax against our seniors, against our  kupuna.   No matter how you package it, this bill is a handout to insurance and  pharmaceutical corporations while breaking the bank for those most in  need of care. I urge my colleagues to stand in strong opposition to  this bill and, instead, pass a healthcare bill that works for the  American people.                            ____________________
