 Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of my colleague  from Nebraska, and our hearts go out to those victims of the hurricane  now in the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico, following the terrible  devastation in Texas and Florida. These are American citizens who  deserve our assistance and urgent help.   I am glad to hear there is now more support mobilizing on the island.  I would like to associate myself with the comments of those who talk  about the need to move quickly to save lives.    Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Bob Mills as  the 67th recipient of the Dayton Region's 2017 Citizen Legion of Honor  Award from the President's Club. As founder of Synergy Building Systems  and Mills Development, Bob Mills' leadership and vision for quality  development in and around the I-75 and I-675 corridors has made a  tremendous impact on the economic vitality of the region.   More than a dozen corporate and not-for-profit boards have benefited  from Bob Mills' leadership over the years, including Greene Memorial  Hospital, the Air Force Museum, Wright State University Foundation, and  the Dayton Development Coalition. He has been recognized for his  generosity by the Dayton Regional STEM School, Beavercreek Chamber of  Commerce, the American Cancer Society, the Leukemia Lymphoma Society,  and as the recipient of the Mathile Community Award.   Maybe most impressive, Bob Mills and his family created the Gala of  Hope Foundation and have raised more than $6 million to fight cancer  and improve cancer care in the Dayton region by providing grants and  funding for patient care, families, caregivers, and research.   Additionally, he and his family have worked tirelessly to support  Dayton Children's new patient tower which supports local children's  needs for important healthcare services.   I would like to honor and congratulate Bob Mills for his many  contributions to his community and our State.                            ____________________
