 I ask unanimous consent that the following Senators be  permitted to speak prior to the scheduled votes: myself for up to 15  minutes, Senator Paul for up to 15 minutes, Senator Menendez for up to  7 minutes, and Senator Risch for up to 5.    Madam President, the Senate will soon vote on the  nomination of Maria Pagan to serve as Deputy U.S. Trade Representative  and our envoy to the World Trade Organization in Geneva.   This vote has been a long time coming; and in a moment, I am going to  talk about Ms. Pagan's extensive qualifications and her long  experience. But, first, Madam President and colleagues, there is a new  urgency today for the Senate to confirm Ms. Pagan with strong  bipartisan support.   The Russians' inhuman behavior means that they have forfeited the  right to enjoy the fruits of the post-World War II international order.   The World Trade Organization is one of the key venues where the  United States and our economic allies must hold Russia accountable for  its illegal and unjustifiable war in Ukraine. It means the United  States and our economic allies basically have to go to the World Trade  Organization and tell Russia: Go fly a kite.   Now, here in the Congress, as the chairman of the Senate Finance  Committee, I am working with the ranking member, Senator Mike Crapo;  House Ways and Means Chairman Richie Neal; and Ranking Member Kevin  Brady on legislation that would revoke Russia's permanent normal trade  status with the United States. This is part of suspending Russia's  benefits at the World Trade Organization and would mean Russia's  exports to the United States would immediately be hit with significant  tariffs.   Our country has led the effort to ratchet up sanctions against Russia  to levels nobody has seen.   Russia's economy is in free fall, and there is no question that  hitting Putin's tight circle of oligarchs who dominate Russia's largest  industries will pay off. Taking away Russia's trade benefits is an  essential next step that will help to freeze Russia out of key markets  around the world.   As our Envoy to the World Trade Organization, Ms. Pagan would be our  point person coordinating this effort. She will be the one coordinating  with like-minded countries and intervening in support of Ukraine. That  is why it is so important that she be confirmed today and why it is so  important that she have strong backing from both sides of the aisle.   Now, her nomination won bipartisan support in the Senate Finance  Committee. The Finance Committee approved her nomination by a vote of  27 to 1, so we are talking about near-unanimous support--certainly  something of a rare sight in the Congress these days. She got that  support because she is a highly experienced public servant who knows  how to get the best possible deal for our workers and our farmers and  our businesses.   Over three decades in government, she has served at both the  Department of Commerce and at the Office of the USTR. She is an expert  in a variety of fields. From trade in services to government  procurement, she has litigated several disputes before the World Trade  Organization. She now serves as deputy general counsel at the office of  the U.S. Trade Representative, the person called in when issues are  particularly challenging. She was recently at the center of the U.S.- Mexico-Canada negotiations, and she was key to helping Democrats  guarantee that the final deal would be enforceable. That was a must- have for all Americans; otherwise, the agreement wasn't going to pass.   Working through the WTO to isolate Russia is just going to be one  part of her job. There are critical negotiations at WTO that absolutely  have to move forward. These include COVID vaccines and the unfair  fisheries subsidies that do so much damage to our environment and our  fishing industry.   The WTO itself has big issues that have to be addressed. Its rules  are out of date, and its procedures move too slowly to keep up with a  modern economy.   The Chinese Government, for example, takes advantage of the World  Trade Organization's current shortcomings to game the trade system, and  they do it at the expense of American jobs, growth, and innovation. A  system that is intended to produce ironclad, predictable rules is now  opening up loopholes that trade rip-off artists are exploiting.   Ms. Pagan understands these challenges that I described. She is  equipped to confront these issues. She is a proven negotiator and a  strong advocate for American workers and farmers and businesses.   She has secured significant support from Democrats and Republicans on  the Senate Finance Committee.   There is urgent work that awaits her in Geneva. I urge my colleagues  to support this nomination. It is priority business for today, given  our trade challenges with Russia.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I will be very brief. There are two reasons  why Senators should vote against the Lee anti-vaccination amendment  that affects our dedicated healthcare workers and our superlative  military.   First, vaccines for healthcare workers protects the most vulnerable,  particularly seniors and those with chronic illness. Three in four  COVID deaths in America were seniors. Two hundred thousand were people  living in long-term care. Vulnerable people are safer when their homes,  hospitals, and doctors' offices are safe. Furthermore, flu shot  requirements for healthcare workers were already common. Health workers  know vaccinations are part of the job.    Turning to the Armed Forces, I am simply going to quote the letter  General Milley wrote with respect to the vaccination requirement. Here  is General Milley:         We need each and every Soldier, Sailor, Airmen, Marine and       Guardian healthy and capable of performing our duties. COVID-      19 is a threat to force protection and readiness.    General Milley went on to say:         With this in mind, the Secretary of Defense intends to       mandate vaccinations for all Servicemembers.    And then he makes it clear:         The Joint Force medical professionals recommended this as a       necessary step to sustain our readiness and protect our       force, our coworkers, our families, and our communities.    For these reasons, when we get a chance to vote on the Lee anti- vaccination amendment affecting healthcare workers in the military, I  urge my colleagues to oppose the Lee amendment.   I yield the floor.
