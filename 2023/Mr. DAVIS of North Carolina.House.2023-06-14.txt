 Mr. Speaker, today I rise with immense  joy to celebrate the 32nd season opener of the Jackie Robinson Baseball  League at Thomas Foreman Park in Greenville, North Carolina. This  occasion reminds us of sports' impact on our youth and communities  across America.   During the opening ceremony, we honored the memory of Jayceon Epps, a  remarkable young player whose jersey number 6 was retired. Although  tragedy took him from us far too soon, his spirit lives in the hearts  of our community.   Police Chief Ted Sauls was the guest speaker and threw out the first  pitch.   The Jackie Robinson Baseball League goes far beyond the game itself.  It instills values, fosters friendships, and provides mentorship  opportunities for our children.  [[Page H2929]]    Thanks to the commissioner, coaches, families, this community, and  above all, the talented players who make this possible.   Have a great season.                            ____________________
