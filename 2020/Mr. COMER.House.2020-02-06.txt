 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Trigg Countians Harold  Knight and David Hale for their coming induction into the Grand  National Turkey Callers Hall of Fame. Next week in Nashville, they will  be formally recognized for this high honor within the hunting and  turkey calling world.   Kentuckians are notably passionate about hunting and outdoors, but  maybe none as much as Harold and David. Their impact on this unique  industry cannot be understated.   Starting in the early 1970s, these two individuals started Knight &  Hale Game Calling and have been promoting their passion for the  outdoors ever since. What began as a small startup out of a basement  has become a successful and recognized enterprise within the hunting  industry.   After 40 years of work and raising significant attention to the field  of game calling, I am thrilled to see two of my constituents receive  this very high honor. This distinguished accomplishment is certainly  something to be proud of and is deserving of recognition by this entire  body.                    Honoring the Paducah Workforce Efforts     Mr. Speaker, near the end of last week, I had the  privilege of being back home in Kentucky and, as I try to do often,  visit with constituents and see some of the exciting programs underway  in the First Congressional District.   While stopping in the city of Paducah, I had the opportunity to see  some of the life-changing workforce development opportunities becoming  available to our citizens. In a time when we have more available jobs  than qualified workers to fill them, both the McCracken County Jail and  Paducah's school system are stepping up to fill the void.   At the local jail, I saw the great work they are doing to provide  low-level inmates with a pathway to becoming productive members of  society. The training programs they are providing for welding and HVAC  training will help fill critical workforce gaps and reduce  incarceration rates over the long term.   Once operational, the Paducah Innovation Hub will house technical  classes like carpentry, welding, and engineering. I was excited to see  the construction of this new innovative facility, which will be a model  for education moving forward.   The old model of 4-year degrees and piles of student loan debt are  not the answer for moving forward in education. Instead, we must  emphasize certificates and skills training. I thoroughly enjoyed  traveling my district and seeing firsthand the need for a more skills- based education system moving forward.   I am proud to represent McCracken County in this distinguished body,  and I look forward to seeing the great work being done by the McCracken  County Jail--and, in the future, the Paducah Innovation Hub--become a  model for both Kentucky and the entire Nation.                 Commending President Trump's Successful Week     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend President Trump for  the overwhelmingly successful week he has had in Washington.   In addition to delivering a strong and forward-looking vision to the  country on Tuesday night, the President has finally been acquitted of  the baseless smear charges leveled against him by Nancy Pelosi and Adam  Schiff.   The historically partisan impeachment put forward by House Democrats  was a stain on American history. But, thankfully, their desperate  attempt to silence the will of the American people is finally behind  us.   Starting with President Trump's unifying State of the Union Address,  the country is now ready to move forward. It is long past time for  Congress to join the President in advancing a positive agenda that will  improve the lives of every single American. That includes moving on  from classless actions like tearing up Presidential speeches on  national television.   Whether it be the current economic boom, fairer trade deals, or  steady leadership in keeping America safe, the President has a strong  record of accomplishment. But, as always, we have more challenges to  tackle.   I sincerely hope to see the Democrats move beyond the politics of  impeachment and resistance and get to work for the American people. It  is time for action on lowering healthcare costs, securing the southern  border, and continuing to advance our Nation's tremendous economic  momentum.   I hope to see my Democrat colleagues join me in supporting the  President's efforts to improve opportunities for working families and  keep Americans safe. The millions of Americans whom we represent expect  and deserve nothing less.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Madam Speaker, I have heard from business owners throughout my  district about the investments they are making in their businesses and  hardworking employees thanks to the strong economy ushered in by  President Trump. We have seen companies establish education programs,  provide bonuses to their employees, and reinvest in their communities  as a result of our booming economic climate. Unfortunately, the bill we  are considering today would quickly erode this progress.   As was made clear during the Committee on Education and Labor hearing  and subsequent markup, the PRO Act would not serve the interests of  individual workers. By overriding States' choices to enact right-to- work laws meant to curtail forced unionization, codifying harmful  rulemakings from the previous administration regarding the definition  and classification of employees, and increasing the prevalence of  worker intimidation and privacy infringement, the PRO Act is a maze of  misguided and costly antiworker policies.   To correct one of the countless issues with this legislation, I  submitted an amendment to strike the provisions that would legalize  secondary boycotts. Unions should not be empowered to target and  economically harm suppliers or business partners of a workplace they  are seeking to organize.   Unfortunately, this and many other commonsense amendments were  rejected by my colleagues on the other side of the aisle during markup  and again at the Rules Committee yesterday.   Notably, the PRO Act federalizes California's ABC test limiting  flexibility and opportunity for entrepreneurs in our modern economy and  codifies the previous administration's joint employer standard that  would disrupt and fatally damage the franchise model, harming thousands  of small business owners across the Nation.   I recognize a business's greatest asset is its workers. For this  reason, I am solidly proworker and probusiness and want to continue our  strong economic growth while also protecting the freedoms of  hardworking Americans.    Thankfully, this Democratic dream will meet a rude  awakening in the Senate, where it will not see the light of day, and  President Trump has signaled he would veto.
