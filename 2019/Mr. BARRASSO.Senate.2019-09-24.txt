 Madam President, I come to the floor today to discuss  the need to bolster our Nation's energy security following the recent  attacks on Saudi Arabian oil.   Having read the classified briefing in full, I am convinced that Iran  is absolutely behind the attacks. Now, Iran wants to drive up world oil  prices to hopefully, in their mind, increase the amount of revenue they  would get from selling their oil. Basically, they need the money, and  that is because the sanctions that the United States has imposed on  Iran have worked. They have been punishing. That is why President  Trump, I believe, made the right call in adding even tougher sanctions.  The sanctions have been biting, and Iran's currency has been  significantly devalued. Now is the time to step up our own American  energy production.    Since my Senate arrival in 2007, I have worked to advance pro-growth  energy policies throughout that entire time. My goal has always been to  promote American energy, to safeguard U.S. workers, and to protect this  great Nation.   Today, the United States is the world's top energy producer. We are a  global leader in oil, as well as in natural gas. In fact, the United  States is poised to become the world's top energy exporter, as well,  and my home State of Wyoming has been a key driver in all of this  success.   To reach this goal, we are going to need to leverage our energy  sources. This includes zero-emission nuclear power, as well as  renewable energy. We need it all. In the Senate, I believe both parties  want Americans to use more carbon-free energy. So both parties should  embrace sensible, scientific solutions. Yet Democrats, once again, are  pushing more of their radical proposals. That is what we have to deal  with.   Two weeks ago, House Democrats passed several anti-energy bills.  These measures would lock up key offshore and Alaskan oil reserves. The  majority of House Democrats have cosponsored these scary schemes that  would damage our economy.   If the House Democrats' anti-energy bills ever were to become law-- and I assure you that the Republican Senate and President Trump will  never allow that to happen--they would be a real gift to our foreign  enemies and to our adversaries, like Russia, because Russia routinely  uses natural gas as a geopolitical weapon.   Still, 2020 Presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren, a Member of our  Senate, recently unveiled a plan to ban hydraulic fracturing. This  revolutionary technique has led to a renaissance for American energy  production, and she wants to ban it.   Last year, Senator Warren's home State of Massachusetts imported  Russian natural gas. Where did they import it from? People all across  the country and the world saw the Russian natural gas tanker in Boston  Harbor. Let me repeat. Let me be very clear. Last year, Senator  Warren's home State of Massachusetts imported Russian natural gas  through the Boston Harbor. At the same time, the Senator has denounced  U.S. pipelines and other U.S. energy infrastructure projects--this, as  her own State pays one of highest utility rates anywhere in the  country.   Not only do the Democrats' politicized policies dramatically increase  Americans' energy costs, but they are also a threat to our national  security. No matter, Senator Warren also wants to ban nuclear power.  She doesn't like fracking. She doesn't like natural gas. She now wants  to ban nuclear power. Has she forgotten that nuclear energy is  America's chief carbon-free power source? Twenty percent of U.S.  electricity comes from nuclear power. These reckless Democrat proposals  would make the United States more dependent on unstable foreign energy  markets.   Working families here in the United States should never overpay on  their energy bills due to foolish policies--and that is what they are,  foolish policies that make us all vulnerable. The American public is  not going to stand for it.   According to a recent Washington Post-Kaiser Foundation poll, more  than 70 percent of Americans have said they don't want to pay even $10  more on their monthly electric bills to lower carbon emissions. We want  to lower carbon emissions. How much are families willing to pay?  Seventy percent say not $10 a month. How about $2 a month? A majority  said, no, that is too much to pay.   So we need to pursue a commonsense energy strategy--one that keeps  working families' costs down, one that keeps the economy strong, and  one that helps keep our Nation safe.   Republicans are committed to protecting and advancing America's  energy independence. President Trump understands how important this is.  In the wake of the attacks on Saudi Arabia, not only is the President  working to expand sanctions, but he is moving to approve major pipeline  projects as well.   One of the energy issues I am addressing now in the Senate is  reforming the permit process for American energy exploration. Earlier  this Congress, I introduced a piece of legislation called the ONSHORE  Act. It stands for Opportunities for the Nation and States to Harness  Onshore Resources for Energy. The ONSHORE Act will simplify the process  for Federal onshore oil and gas permits. Whether we are talking about  promoting energy exploration, utilities, carbon capturing, or nuclear  power, we must engineer our way to American energy solutions.   Republicans recognize our Nation's unique ability to fill in the gaps  from global supply disruptions. So our focus needs to be on promoting  American energy independence. It is time to reject the Democrats'  extreme schemes once and for all. What the Democrats are proposing is a  real threat to our U.S. energy security, and they are offering a gift  to American enemies.   We need to continue our America-first energy policy. That is what we  are going to continue to do to keep us strong, to keep us safe, and to  keep us prosperous as a nation.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, today I wish to celebrate the St.  Anthony Tri-Parish Catholic School Foundation's 2019 honoree, Dr. Gail  Zimmerman.   The foundation supports the wonderful work of the St. Anthony Tri- Parish Catholic School in Casper, WY. The school is dedicated to  achieving academic excellence in a faith-filled community and living a  life committed to Christian service. Since 1927, the school and staff  have provided a high standard of academic achievement while instilling  Christian values. The schools strong religious and educational  leadership to Casper students from preschool through eighth grade.   On October 10, 2019, the foundation will host their annual Joy  Breakfast. The foundation honors individuals who make outstanding  contributions to St. Anthony School and provide exceptional support to  the Casper community. Dr. Gail Zimmerman is the perfect choice for this  honor. Gail, with his late wife Anne, has a long history of personal  beneficence and public service. The community looks forward to this  breakfast and recognizing the annual honoree's invaluable contribution  and dedication to the St. Anthony's Tri-Parish Catholic School  Foundation.   Gail is an accomplished academic, a selfless servant, and an avid  sportsman. His father was a farmer and pastor, contributing greatly to  Gail's work ethic and Christian values. Gail attended high school in  Nebraska, then served in the U.S. Army. While serving, Gail met his  wife, Lois. The ceasefire in Korea occurred while he was in training,  enabling him to return to Nebraska for his undergraduate education.   Gail received his master's at the University of Montana while  teaching in Torrington, WY, and earned his Ph.D. in physiology and  microbiology at the University of Wyoming while teaching in Casper, WY.  He taught nurses and premedical students at Casper College for 23 years  before furthering his education and becoming a broker. Dr. Zimmerman  was elected to the Wyoming House of Representatives in 1985, then to  the Wyoming Senate in 1989. He served a total of 14 years in our State  legislature.   In 1975, Lois passed away. Together they had four children: Rhonda,  Mitchell, Michael, and Renee. Five years later, Gail married Anne  Templeton, a surgeon with whom I worked. They spent 24 happy years  until her passing in 2004.   Gail's community involvement, philanthropic engagements, and hobby  interests are extensive. He has been influential with the Casper  Petroleum Club, Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation, National Rifle  Association, Safari Club International, Polestar Outdoors, the Dallas  Safari Club Wyoming Chapter, and the Wyoming Water Quality and  Pollution Control Association. He also served as the Director of the  Werner Wildlife Museum and Wyoming State Wastewater Training Center,  Chairman and CEO of the Wyoming Employee Resource Capital & Service,  and Trustee of the John Templeton Foundation as well as the Zimmerman  Family Foundation. He somehow finds time to attend collector car shows  and Alaskan fishing trips. Gail is also a member of the Casper Rotary  Club.   Gail and his wife Anne generously contributed their time and  resources to Wyoming's schools and spiritual growth. They promoted  human rights and supported fellow Christians around the world. The  Zimmerman Science Awards and Zimmerman Family Foundation helped  countless Wyoming students and people in need to further their  education. They provided a much needed lift to those seeking to unlock  their true potential. Gail is a pillar of the Casper community. He  exemplifies Christian values and is a testament to the Code of the  West.   Madam President, it is with great honor that I recognize this  outstanding member of our Wyoming community. My wife, Bobbi, joins me  in extending our congratulations to Dr. Gail Zimmerman upon his  selection for this special award.                            ____________________
