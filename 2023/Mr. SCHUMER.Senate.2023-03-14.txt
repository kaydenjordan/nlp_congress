 Mr. President, now, earlier today, two Russian military  aircraft conducted an unsafe intercept with an unmanned U.S.  surveillance drone that was operating within international airspace  over the Black Sea. This intercept was so dangerous and so brazen that  the U.S. Air Force was forced to crash their drone into international  waters. It is another reckless act by President Putin and his military,  and I want to tell Mr. Putin: Stop this behavior before you are the  cause of an unintended escalation.   We have seen this behavior from the Russian military before, and it  will not deter the United States from conducting operations over the  Black Sea. These aggressive actions by Russian aircraft are risky and  could lead--I repeat--to unintended escalation.   The United States has routinely flown over the Black Sea since before  Putin's illegal and reckless invasion of Ukraine, and I am confident  our military will continue to do so.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to legislative session.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session to  consider Calendar No. 27.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to legislative session.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to Calendar No. 25, S.  316.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session.    I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory quorum calls  for the cloture motions filed today, March 14, be waived.    I have just filed a cloture motion that would finally  restore to Congress the power to declare war.   I yield the floor.
