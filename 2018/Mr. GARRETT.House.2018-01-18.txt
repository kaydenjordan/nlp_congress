 Mr. Speaker, it is humbling to have the opportunity to  stand in this Chamber to speak on so important a subject as China's  role in the world in 2018.   Having had the privilege also of leading American soldiers on foreign  soil, Mr. Speaker, I understand that the last resort in any  circumstance should be military action, and so I wish to make clear  that the strong words that will follow are not directed to be a threat  to the People's Republic of China but, instead, to be encouragement to  the people thereof.   We want peace and to work alongside all nations in a community of  nations, but it is our duty, as free people, to express the basic  rights inherent to our very existence in this world.   Mr. Speaker, I would say to the Chinese people today that we still  hold these truths to be self-evident, that all people are created equal  and endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, and that  among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness--this  message directed, again, to the people of China because the oppressive  Communist, dictatorial regime seems hell-bent upon denying these very  rights not to nations across the world aside from China, but to the  [[Page H545]]  very people whom they purport to serve; and in so doing, they not only  oppress those people, but also perpetrate schemes that lead to a lower  quality of life and enhanced threats to people across the globe.   Industrial espionage costs the very livelihoods and well-being of  workers in every continent of the world. Intellectual property theft  isn't about the hundreds of billions of dollars stolen from those who  had the wherewithal, energy, and vision to create, but about the child  who won't have an opportunity to attend college because the job that  his or her parent might have had has been quite literally stolen by  Chinese malfeasance.   Propping up a regime in North Korea that literally engages, in the  year 2018, in the enslavement of their own citizens and turning a blind  eye on those practices, which, Mr. Speaker, I suppose shouldn't be a  surprise when you look at the human rights record of the People's  Republic of China itself, I don't have time, nor do my colleagues,  though I commend Congressman Yoho for this hour, to recount the number  of victims of human rights violations, of prisoners of conscience, of  victims of state oppression, of those who had the temerity to stand up  and suggest that individuals have certain basic fundamental human  rights only to reap horrific consequences underneath a totalitarian  Communist regime in the People's Republic of China.   But in the limited time that I have, forced abortions of human life,  to the tune of tens and tens and tens of millions; Mr. Speaker, child  labor laws drafted by the People's Republic of China that look  wonderful on the global stage, but practices that one recent survey  indicated would have the entire population of the State of Ohio worth  of 10- to 14-year olds working what one recent news story characterized  as 16 hours a day, 28 days a month in 2018.   Their laws indicate that they have ended the practice of organ  harvesting, and yet mathematical data indicates that, in China, if you  are part of the ruling class, it is not hard to find that kidney, that  bone marrow, that heart.   This sort of oppression is foisted upon the people of China, while  all too often the United States and other nations of the world turn a  blind eye not in the interest of respecting cultural differences, but  in the interest of our pocketbooks.                                time  2045    We still hold these truths to be self-evident. And if I could do  nothing else while I am here, Mr. Speaker, but to speak and encourage  nations of the world, but, more importantly, the people oppressed by  regimes such as that of the Chinese dictatorial, Communist,  totalitarian state, and tell them that we understand, we have their  backs, they have our support, then I will have accomplished something.   I am of an age, Mr. Speaker, when one of the images permanently  seared in my memory is of a lone man standing in Tiananmen Square  facing down a main battle tank. And when I think of that image and then  I think of the United States, I think of Patrick Henry, who not only  said, ``Give me liberty or give me death,'' but also said, when someone  yelled from the back of the room, ``Treason,'' ``If this be treason,  make the most of it.''   I think of a 16-year-old girl in Farmville, Virginia, Barbara Johns,  whose family had to move because she had the temerity, after discussing  the Declaration of Independence with her uncle Vernon Johns, to  question why there was a school that only White kids could attend.   And I think of the charge in the Constitution of the United States  not to be a perfect Union, because we are not there yet, but to be a  more perfect Union.   So then I contemplate my responsibility not only as a Member of this  body, and it is obviously to serve the constituents of the Fifth  District of Virginia in the United States of America, but also to stand  up for human beings across the globe.   And China, we still hold these truths to be self-evident. We will not  turn a blind eye on policies that lead to forced abortions of living  humans, that lead to child labor policies of 16 hours of work a day, 28  days a month of a number of kids between the ages of 10 and 14 that  mirrors the population of the State of Ohio.   We will not turn a blind eye to policies and public statements saying  you have ended organ harvesting when all data indicates that you  haven't. And then we will not turn a blind eye to the oppression of any  minority, and particularly religious minorities, whether it is Falun  Gong or Christians or Muslims in the west of China.   So I know in this age of the internet, this age of the world wide web  and global communication, that the people of China, though their  government seeks to inhibit the flow of information, will hear this,  and the message is simple: You are my brothers and sisters. You are  human beings just like us. You have the same rights that we have. You  will not be given these rights by a government but by a creator or by  nature, depending on your belief structure. And if you have the courage  to stand up, understand this: We will support you.    Mr. Speaker, I would just, again, commend the Member  from Florida, Congressman Yoho, as it relates to this opportunity.   I think it is important to remember that, just like Americans,  whether it was the Revolutionary War or the civil rights movement, the  Chinese people have bled. They have sweated. They have paid the price  for the basic human rights that we all enjoy here.   And again, I would commend the American consumer to consider the  reality of child labor, of exploitative policies as relates to  industrial espionage, of exploitative policies that literally deprive  Americans of livelihoods perpetrated by the Chinese, and to shop with  that in mind until we see real reform from China.   I have been frustrated heretofore with the efforts sometimes of our  very own government as it relates to putting any force or its  proverbial money where its mouth was to this end, but I believe there  is power in the people of the United States.   And so I would encourage people, again, to shop with their  consciences until we see actual acts beyond words from a regime that  has a history of saying and doing all the right things in public but  allowing the perpetuation of horrific, horrific circumstances on their  very people at home, in private.
