 Mr. Speaker, on June 12, 1948, President Harry S.  Truman signed into law the Women's Armed Services Integration Act,  allowing women to serve as regular members of the military.   In the State of Texas, a bill was sent in to establish Women's  Veterans Day,  [[Page H4444]]  and that bill, in the Senate, was signed into law by the Governor of  the State of Texas.   I am honored to represent over 170,000 distinguished women veterans  in the State of Texas. Moreover, I am proud to work alongside the four  women veterans serving in the 116th Congress, and many more.   On this day, it is imperative that we highlight women's role in the  United States military. There should be no secret that women play an  integral part.   They volunteer for the same reasons as men, but 4.3 percent of women  in the military reported being sexually assaulted. Female veterans are  three to four times more likely than their civilian counterparts to  become homeless and 2.5 times more likely to commit suicide.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Dr. LaShondra Jones for bringing to our  attention honoring women veterans today, and they will be taking part  in many different activities. I am in awe of their invaluable service.   I want to salute them today on the floor of the United States House  of Representatives. This is a wonderful day that we are celebrating  Women's Veterans Day in Texas, but we should celebrate it and honor it  in the United States of America.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for her  leadership, and I thank her for the time.   This is an enormous and important step as it relates to healthcare in  America. So many of us have been fighting to ensure that the  preexisting conditions of Americans are protected. I am grateful that  work has been done to provide $190 billion that covers labor, health  and human services, and particularly $99 billion that deals with the  question of Alzheimer's disease, HIV/AIDS, and, certainly, work on  cancer research. I do want to take note of the fact that TRIO dollars  have been allowed, as well.   There is also an important point that is probably prospectively going  to be covered, but I do want to raise it now, and that is working with  countries that are our partners or that we would hope that they would  be partners in the war against terror.   As the co-chair of the Pakistan Caucus, I want to ensure--and I know  State, Foreign Ops, Defense is prospectively coming--that I believe  there has been much work accomplished by the new government and members  of the expanded Government of Pakistan to work against terror.   I know that they have lost treasure in the war against terror, and  that is the Pakistani military. So I would hope that we would find a  way to ensure that Pakistan receives its foreign aid, as I believe it  should, and that we provide measuring sticks or standards by which they  can meet steps of accomplishment, because it is important that we  create alliances that are strong in the region because of the  difficulty of the conditions in Afghanistan, the recent loss of life.   We know that Afghanistan is not at the level of security that we  would like, and I would hope that we would work with countries in the  region to ensure the peace and security of the region and the peace and  security in Afghanistan.     Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, just a few weeks ago, I had a roundtable  discussion with health professionals and those who are suffering from  diabetes. I heard the stories of how much insulin costs and how  difficult it was to be able to access healthcare, in many instances.  This discussion was held at the University of Houston medical school.   The Jackson Lee amendment makes a good bill even better by providing  $10 million more to help ensure that the national goals of finding and  bringing  [[Page H4544]]  more and better treatments for diabetes is aided by an expanded pool of  diverse and talented medical researchers and clinical trial  participants.   Many racial health disparities, including diabetes, stem from a lack  of access to quality healthcare and proper health awareness.  Unfortunately, this means that the incidence of kidney disease has not  always matched trial populations. African Americans represent 12  percent of the U.S. population but only 5 percent of clinical trial  participants.                                time  1730    Hispanics make up 16 percent, but only 1 percent of clinical trial  participants.   Sex distribution in cardiovascular device trials is 67 percent male.   Other significant barriers to diversified clinical trials, which are  key to sound medical research and the foundation for medical cures and  breakthroughs, as reported by investigators and coordinators, are  insurance status, patient inconvenience, cost, availability of  transportation, distance to the study site, and patient and family  concerns about risk.   My amendment, in particular, focuses on ensuring the outreach for  researchers and, as well, those who would be participants in clinical  trials. Physicians are the gateway to the patient as well, and the lack  of access to physicians also diminishes the rights or the ability for  people to be in trials.   My amendment is intended to aid in the necessary effort to diversify  the pool of doctors and medical researchers conducting clinical trials  and, thereby, helping to diversify the participants in the clinical  trials.   I would ask my colleagues to support this amendment.   Mr. Chairman, it is important to take note of this particular chart;  proportion of volunteers in clinical research by race and ethnicity.  And you will see, as it relates to minorities, at every step of the  way, dealing with total U.S. population, only 33 percent participate.  NIH-funded clinical research only 36 percent participate; and industry- funded clinical trials, a paltry 16.7 percent.   It indicates as well, and I include in the Record ``Clinical Trials  Shed Light on Minority Health.''                   [From FDA Consumer Health Information]               Clinical Trials Shed Light on Minority Health         The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is working to       increase the participation of people in racial, ethnic and       other minority groups in the clinical trials that test new       medical products.        The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is working to       increase the participation of people in racial, ethnic and       other minority groups in the clinical trials that test new       medical products.                            Why is this important?         Ensuring meaningful representation of minorities in       clinical trials for regulated medical products is fundamental       to FDA's regulatory mission and public health, says Jonca       Bull, M.D., director of the agency's Office of Minority       Health (OMH). Racial and ethnic minorities include African       American, American Indian, Alaska Native, Asian American,       Hispanic American, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander       communities.        OMH project manager Christine Merenda, M.P.H., R.N.       explains that clinical trials are the proving ground for new       drugs, vaccines and devices. They provide the data that will       determine whether FDA approves a manufacturer's application       for marketing approval.        ``Potential racial, ethnic and other differences in       response to drugs are important to FDA's efforts to help       ensure that the safety and effectiveness of drugs are studied       in all people who will use the products once they are       approved,'' she says.                       Considering Genetic Differences         Bull explains that there are biological differences in how       people process drugs. For example, variations in genetic       coding can make a cancer treatment more toxic in one ethnic       group than it would be in another. These variations can make       also make drugs like antidepressants and blood-pressure       medications less effective in one group than another.        Getting more data on these differences is essential for FDA       to truly know that a medical product will truly work and be       safe for all patients, Bull says.        Members of minority groups may be more vulnerable to       certain diseases. ``We know, for example, that African-      Americans and Hispanics have higher rates of diabetes, HIV/      AIDS, obesity and cardiovascular disease,'' says Bull. Native       Americans and Asians have been shown to have higher rates of       hepatitis, while Hispanics are disproportionately affected by       diabetes.        But historically, both women and minorities have been       under-represented in clinical trails. For example, according       to a 2011 report from the conference ``Dialogues on       Diversifying Clinical Trails,'' sponsored by FDA's Office of       Women's Health and the Society for Women's Health Research       and supported by OMH:         African Americans represent 12% of the U.S.       population but only 5% of clinical trial participants;         Hispanics make up 16% of the population but only       1% of clinical trial participants; and         ``Men make up more than two-thirds of the       participants in clinical tests of cardiovascular (heart and       blood vessel) devices?''        At the conference, more than 200 representatives from       government and industry came together with patient advocates       and the scientific community to discuss strategies for       increasing the participation of women and minorities in       clinical trials.        Why the Disparity?        Bull says there are different reasons why minorities have       been under-represented in clinical trials.        One reason may be a lack of trust because of past abuses,       Bull says. One notorious example was the Tuskegee Syphilis       Study, experiments conducted between 1932 and 1972 by the       U.S. Public Health Service. Health officials recruited poor       black share-croppers in Alabama to study the natural progress       of syphilis. However, while the study was in progress,       penicillin was discovered to treat syphilis. The study was       not stopped and the men were not treated with penicillin that       could have cured them.        According to a recent university study, however, this       attitude seems to be changing. The study was designed to       learn the health concerns and research perceptions among       under-represented groups. When asked about their over-all       interest in medical research, 91 percent of African-Americans       expressed interest in participating.        Nonetheless, recruiting people to participate in clinical       trials--no matter what race or ethnicity--is difficult in       general, Bull notes. FDA works to protect participants in       clinical trials and to ensure that people have reliable       information as they decide whether to join a clinical trial.        There are many benefits to minority participation for       researchers that extend, in larger sense, to society.       Minority participation helps researchers find better       treatments and better ways to fight such diseases as cancer,       diabetes, heart disease and HIV/ AIDS. In addition, it       uncovers differences by gender, race, and ethnicity that may       be important for safe and effective use of therapies.                           Safeguards and Resources         Safeguards for clinical trial participants include       oversight by institutional review boards (IRBs), composed of       at least five members, including scientists, doctors, and lay       people. IRBs ensure that appropriate steps are taken to       protect the rights and welfare of participants as subjects of       research.        Though it's too soon to tell, Bull says that the FDA Safety       and Innovation Act (FDASIA) signed into law by President       Obama in July 2012 could have a helpful effect in supporting       efforts to enhance minority participation in clinical trials.       FDASIA requires that FDA report to Congress by July 9, 2013       on the diversity of participants in clinical trials and the       extent to which safety and effectiveness data based on such       factors as sex, age, race and ethnicity are included in       applications submitted to FDA.        Based on these findings, FDA and others involved in       clinical research will be able to identify needs and       opportunties to increase minority representation, says Bull.        In the meantime, Bull encourages consumers to take a more       proactive approach. If you're undergoing treatment and your       condition is not improving, she says, you may want to talk to       your health care professional about the availability of       clinical trials that address our condition.        FDA also has information at fda.gov (http://www.fda.gov)       with information about participating in clinical trials       (http://www.fda.gov/ForConsumers/ByAudience/ ForPatientAdvocates/ParticipatinginClinicalTrials/ default.htm) and links to an array of resources. And       clinicaltrails.gov (http://www.clinicaltrials.gov) is another       resource from the National Insitiutes of Health.     Mr. Chairman, the Food and Drug Administration is  working to increase the participation of people in racial, ethnic, and  other minority groups in the clinical trials that test new medical  products.   So I would indicate that this particular amendment is to give greater  focus to ensure that we have access to these individuals. Again,  diabetes in minority communities is surging. The difficulty of getting  access to insulin is also a conspicuous medical concern. But certain  medical illnesses have been known to have a higher prevalence in  certain demographic groups, including Type 2 diabetes, lupus, sickle  cell anemia, and triple-negative breast cancer.   This particular amendment is, of course, helping to end, or to work  on improving the access at this time.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Connecticut  (Ms. DeLauro).  [[Page H4545]]         Mr. Chairman, I urge support of this amendment.   Mr. Chair, I wish to thank Chairman McGovern and Ranking Member Cole  of the Rules Committee for making this Jackson Lee Amendment in order.   I thank Chairwoman DeLauro and Ranking Member Cole for their hard  work in bringing Division A, the Labor-HHS portion of this omnibus  appropriations legislative package, to the floor.   I thank them all for this opportunity to explain the Jackson Lee  Amendment, which makes a good bill even better by providing $10 million  more to help ensure that the national goals of finding and bringing  more and better treatments for diabetes is aided by an expanding pool  of diverse and talented medical researchers and clinical trial  participants.   Many racial health disparities, including diabetes, stem from lack of  access to quality healthcare and proper health awareness.   Unfortunately, this means that incidence of kidney disease does not  always match trial populations.   For example, consider that:   1. African-Americans represent 12 percent of the U.S. population but  only 5 percent of clinical trial participants.   2. Hispanics make up 16 percent of the population but only 1 percent  of clinical trial participants.   3. Sex distribution in cardiovascular device trials is 67 percent  male.   Other significant barriers to diversified clinical trials, which are  the key to sound medical research and the foundation for medical cures  and breakthroughs, as reported by investigators and coordinators are  insurance status, patient inconvenience costs, availability of  transportation, distance to the study site, and patient and family  concerns about risk.   But the most significant barriers limiting clinical participation are  race, age, and sex of participants:   1. Women and minority patients are more difficult to recruit.   2. Women and minority physicians have less experience and are  relatively costlier to engage.   3. Minority patients with limited English proficiency can require  costly translation services.   The first step in engaging women and minorities in clinical trials is  finding them.   Research has shown that minority patients seek physicians of their  own race, so bringing these doctors into trials is critical.   Physicians are the gateway to the patient.   There are disturbing statistics on the number of African Americans,  Hispanics and Native Americans pursuing academic qualification and  participating in scientific research.   Many barriers exist that account for the low rate of participation  among diverse communities, including patient fear of experimentation  and lack of understanding or education with regard to the importance of  clinical trials in creating new treatments and cures.   The Jackson Lee Amendment is intended to aid in the necessary effort  to diversify the pool of doctors and medical researchers conducting  clinical trials, and thereby helping to diversify the participants in  the clinical trials.   In short, the Jackson Lee Amendment seeks to open the ``physician  gateway'' to the patient.   The Journal on STEM Education reported in 2011 that only 8.34 percent  of the STEM doctorates awarded in 2006 were given to underrepresented  minorities (URMs), despite making up approximately 28 percent of the  U.S. population.   Additionally, GAO found that while the percentage of underrepresented  minorities nationwide increased from 13 percent to 19 percent from 1994  to 2003, the total number of STEM doctorates awarded to the same group  dropped during this period from 8,335 to 7,310.   In response, the National Institute of General Medical Sciences  (NIGMS) created the Minority Opportunities in Research (MORE) Division  and similar academic intervention programs.   The MORE programs are comprised of four primary components: research  experience, mentoring and advisement, supplemental instruction and  workshops, and financial support.   This includes the Minority Biomedical Research Support-Research  Initiative for Scientific Enhancement (MBRS-RISE) program, the Minority  Access to Research Careers (MARC), Post-baccalaureate Research  Education Program (PREP), and the Bridges to the Baccalaureate and  Bridges to the Ph.D. programs.   The amount of funds dedicated to these programs reflects the  commitment by the science and research community to the goals of the  MORE Division in addressing this problem.   Certain medical illnesses have been known to have higher prevalence  in certain demographic groups, including type II diabetes, lupus,  sickle cell anemia, and Triple Negative Breast Cancer for which African  Americans are more than twice as likely to be diagnosed on average.   Race and ethnicity have also been shown to affect the effectiveness  of and response to certain drugs, such as antihypertensive therapies in  the treatment of hypertension in African Americans and anti-depressants  in Hispanics.   Increased diversity in research trials could help researchers find  better, more precise ways to fight diseases that disproportionately  impact certain populations and may be important for the safe and  effective use of new therapies.   But before we can engage more women and minorities to participate in  clinical trials, we must be able to find them.   And the key to finding minority patients is find more physicians from  their racial and ethnic groups because research has shown that  physicians are the gateway to the patient.   The Jackson Lee Amendment opens that gateway.   I urge support for the Jackson Lee Amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, let me take this opportunity to thank  Congresswoman DeLauro and her leadership as the chairwoman of this  subcommittee, and her ranking member, Mr. Cole. I had the privilege of  appearing before them in making my request, and so I want to thank them  for many of the requests. I don't want to be too celebratory and say  all of my requests, but I am very pleased that the investment in  healthcare, education, many of the issues that I was concerned about,  are well-invested, and it will be the kind of announcements that I will  be able to make in my district for the great needs that are needed.   My amendment is to emphasize the importance of a program that, when I  went to graduations, I saw students wearing banners, if you will, that  said the word ``TRIO;'' that they were graduating with the help of  TRIO. They were going on to college with the help of TRIO. And I was  very excited about  [[Page H4546]]  the opportunity of seeing, in living proof, the proud symbols of those  who had had a greater opportunity.   My amendment makes, again, a good bill even better by providing $10  million more to help ensure that TRIO students at the greatest risk of  not completing their degree program get additional assistance to finish  their education. I was excited when these students walked across the  stage going on to college with TRIO support.   TRIO is a set of seven federally-funded education opportunity  outreach programs that help low-income, first-generation students, and  students with disabilities, to pursue higher education.   There are many opportunities for individuals to go into the trades  and other disciplines, but many want to go to college.   The Upward Bound Program, the first Federal TRIO Program, was created  in 1964. Later, Talent Search was created. The TRIO name itself was  born four years later, when the Higher Education Act of 1965 was  amended to include Special Services for Disadvantaged Students.   So today, there are nine TRIO programs that I am excited about; and  my emphasis is to ensure that these programs are well-funded.   Even in my own community, I can tell you that TRIO is well-needed and  well-utilized.   Mr. Chairman, I ask my colleagues to support the Jackson Lee  amendment.   Mr. Chairman, could you tell me how much time is remaining?    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro).    Mr. Chairman, I am excited that, in 1986, we added  the Ronald E. McNair Postbaccalaureate Achievement Program--we all  remember him as a great astronaut who died in a horrific astronaut  calamity--to foster doctoral degree attainment by students from  underrepresented segments of society.   But, Mr. Chair, a young man went to the Upward Bound program at the  historically Black Texas Southern University. He graduated from  Sterling High School, but he grew up in extreme poverty, stricken with  food insecurities and difficult living conditions.   Poverty is not only a state of being, but a state of mind.   However, with the help of TRIO, he went on to acquire life skills,  strategies, and the support he needed to follow the dream of attending  the University of Texas at San Antonio, majoring in Construction  Science Management.   Not only did he graduate from UTSA, but he graduated with honors, and  he plans to attend graduate school in the fall. He is one of many  students that are impacted; and the more we focus on the at-risk  students, the more America continues to ascend to her greatest level.   We helped Terrance, who is a 40-year-old student that began working  on his GED at Houston Community College in 2005. He ultimately achieved  it 5 years later.   My amendment, again, is to emphasize the doors of opportunity, from  Ronald E. McNair, Student Support Services, Talent Search, the Training  Program for Federal TRIO Programs, Upward Bound, Upward Bound Math and  Science, and Veterans Upward Bound. It is encompassing of many aspects  of young people and those returning to school.   I ask my colleagues to support the Jackson Lee amendment, which  focuses on those at risk, and turns that at risk into success.   Mr. Chair, I wish to thank Chairman McGovern and Ranking Member Cole  of the Rules Committee for making this Jackson Lee Amendment in order.   I thank Chairwoman DeLauro and Ranking Member Cole for their hard  work in bringing Division A, the Labor-HHS portion of this omnibus  appropriations legislative package, to the floor.   I thank them all for this opportunity to explain the Jackson Lee  Amendment, which makes a good bill even better by providing $10 million  more to help ensure that TRIO students at the greatest risk of not  completing their degree program get additional assistance to finish  their education.   TRIO is a set of seven federally-funded educational opportunity  outreach programs that help low-income, first-generation students and  students with disabilities to pursue higher education.   The Upward Bound Program, the first Federal TRIO Program, was created  under the authority of the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964, as  amended.   A year later, Talent Search was created as part of the Higher  Education Act of 1965 to assist students applying for newly authorized  federal financial aid for postsecondary education.   The TRIO name itself was born four years later when the Higher  Education Act of 1965 was amended in 1968 to include the Special  Services for Disadvantaged Students program--what is now called Student  Support Services (SSS).   Since 1968, TRIO programs have been expanded to provide a wider range  of services.   Today, nine TRIO programs are included under the TRIO umbrella, seven  of which provide direct services to students.   The 1972 amendments to the Higher Education Act created Educational  Opportunity Centers (EOCs) to help adults select a postsecondary  education program and obtain financial aid.   Veterans Upward Bound (VUB) was also initiated in the 1972 as part of  the Upward Bound program to serve returning Vietnam veterans.   Amendments in 1986 added the Ronald E. McNair Postbaccalaureate  Achievement Program (McNair) to foster doctoral degree attainment by  students from underrepresented segments of society.   In 1990 the Upward Bound Math and Science (UBMS) program was  initiated as part of the Upward Bound program to address the need for  specific instruction in the fields of mathematics and science.   TRIO also includes a training program for project directors and other  staff of TRIO projects (Training Program for Federal TRIO Programs,  which was authorized in 1976).   The TRIO programs are administered by the Student Service area of the  Department's Office of Postsecondary Education.   TRIO includes: Educational Opportunity Centers; Ronald E. McNair  Postbaccalaureate Achievement; Student Support Services; Talent Search;  Training Program for Federal TRIO Programs Staff; Upward Bound; Upward  Bound Math-Science; and Veterans Upward Bound.   Currently serving nearly 790,000 students across America, TRIO  provides academic tutoring, personal counseling, mentoring, financial  guidance, and other supports necessary for educational access and  retention.   TRIO programs serve students from middle school and high school  (Talent Search, Upward Bound, Upward Bound Math-Science) to college and  postgraduate study (Student Support Services, Ronald E. McNair  Postbaccalaureate Achievement).   TRIO also provides services to adult learners (Educational  Opportunity Centers, Veterans Upward Bound).   Jackson Lee Amendment No. 15, adds $10 million in funding to assist  students at the greatest risk of not completing their degree program.   TRIO students can include teens to older adults trying make a career  move or complete a life goal of a GED or college degree.   I ask my colleagues to support this Jackson Lee Amendment.                                    LiTroy    TRIO/Upward Bound program at Texas Southern University   Story: Litroy Lambert graduated from Sterling High School in Houston  Texas in 2014.   He grew up in extreme poverty stricken with food insecurities and  difficult living conditions.   Poverty is not only a state of being it can too often become a state  of mind where dreams fester and die.  [[Page H4547]]    However, with the help of the TRIO/Upward Bound program at Texas  Southern University LiTroy was able to acquire the life skills,  strategies and the support he needed to follow his dreams of attending  the University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA) majoring in Construction  Science Management.   Not only did LiTroy attend UTSA, but he also graduated with honors  and plans to attend graduate school in the fall.   LiTroy is one of many students whose lives have been dramatically  changed by the efforts of TRIO/Upward Bound programming and staff.   Stories from Houston Community College's (HCC) TRIO Educational  Opportunity Center:                               Terrance, age 40    Terrance is a 40-year-old student that began working on his GED at  Houston Community College in 2005.   Upon meeting Terrance in his GED class, he explained that he had been  working on his GED off and on and was unsuccessful at completing his  GED because of the cost of the exam and his inability to pass certain  portions of the exam.   He is a father and has also worked odd jobs while attempting to  complete his GED.   TRIO offered Terrance an alternative to the GED exam, the HiSet,  which is an approved high school equivalency certification recognized  by the Texas Education Agency.   In addition to offering him an alternative exam, HCC provided him  with vouchers to cover the cost of the exam and within his first  attempt of taking the HiSet exam, he successfully earned his high  school equivalent certificate.   We assisted Terrance with applying for college and financial aid and  he is currently enrolled at and set to begin college classes this fall  to earn a Communications degree.   Stories from Houston Community College's TRIO Educational Opportunity  Center.                                 Eric, age 44    Eric is a 44-year-old student that began working on his GED in 1995,  stopped attending and then returned to complete his GED in 2017 when he  was unable to receive a promotion on his job because he did not have a  high school diploma.   After several attempts at the GED, Eric was unable to pass portions  of the GED exam because of his work schedule that prevented him from  attending class regularly.   Eric struggled with portions of the exam and TRIO offered him  tutorial services and the alternative HiSet exam.   Eric successfully passed the HiSet exam and earned his High School  Equivalent certificate.   TRIO also assisted Eric with applying for financial aid and college  admissions.   Eric will begin working on his pre-nursing courses in the fall so  that he can eventually apply to nursing school and receive a promotion  at his job.                              Christina, age 65    Christina is a 65-year-old disabled student that contacted TRIO  because she had problems finding a program that would lead to a job.   She wants to get off disability and work in an office job so that she  can take care of herself without the limited income that disability  provides.   TRIO was able to advocate for Christina to get financial aid  reinstated because she was on probation when she attended previously,  due to the demands on her time because of having to care of her sick  husband, who died when she was in school.   The TRIO Educational Opportunity Center was also able to connect her  with free tuition that is offered by Houston Community College so that  she can maximize her financial aid.   We assisted Christina with finding a program that will give her the  technology/computer skills she needs that will lead to a job.   Christina is currently enrolled in summer classes and pursuing a  degree in Business Technology.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
