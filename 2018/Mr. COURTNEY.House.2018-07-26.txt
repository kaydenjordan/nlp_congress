 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the 2019 John  McCain Defense Authorization bill.   First, I would like to extend my congratulations to Chairman  Thornberry and Ranking Member Smith for their steady, bipartisan  leadership as this bill was crafted--the 58th consecutive year in a row  that Congress has produced an NDAA, a testament to their superb  legislating and the constructive dialogue that results from following  regular order.   I also want to salute the hard work of my colleague Rob Wittman, at  the helm of the Seapower and Projection Forces Subcommittee, and our  professional staff--Phil MacNaughton, Dave Sienicki, and Bruce  Johnson--for their talent, expertise, and follow-through for all our  members.   Our subcommittee mark accelerates the timeline toward achieving a  Navy fleet of 355 ships, the size needed to meet global requirements  according to the Navy's 2016 force structure assessment.   Our work authorizes funding for 13 battle force ships, three more  than President Trump's request. In particular, at a time when rising  adversaries are recapitalizing or expanding their undersea fleets, this  year's NDAA provides $7.6 billion for the Virginia-class program and  nearly $4 billion for the Columbia-class development and advance  procurement.   The bill authorizes two Virginia-class attack submarines in 2019 and  requires the next Block V Virginia contract currently under negotiation  to include priced options for additional third submarines in years 2022  and `23. This provision will maintain the option for the next Congress  to take advantage of industrial-base capacity that the Navy last  February told us is available to increase submarine construction in the  future.   Tragically, 2017 was a very difficult year for the U.S. Navy. Our  country lost 17 sailors in the fatal collisions involving the USS  Fitzgerald and the USS John McCain.   This bill directs the Navy to assess the checks and balances in its  chain of command so operational demands are appropriately balanced with  ship training, certification, and maintenance. It limits to 10 years  the period in which ships may be forward deployed and requires that  ship readiness inspections be conducted on a no-notice basis, with  results made available for the public to see.   These changes are critical. We owe it to our sailors, and we can't  afford to have our naval assets out of commission with so much at stake  as competitors seek to counter time-honored norms, such as the right to  transit international waters freely.   Mr. Speaker, the important provisions of this bill showcase what we  in Congress can accomplish when we collectively choose to work with our  colleagues across the aisle and trust the committee process to produce  a fair and balanced result.   Even more impressive is the fact that passage of this NDAA is the  earliest it has come in 20 years. This defies the constant narrative of  a dysfunctional Congress. Again, I commend the skillful leadership of  Mr. Thornberry and Mr. Smith, as well as Senators McCain and Reed  across the Capitol, in helping shepherd this legislation to the point  where it is today.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge all Members to vote for passage of this  measure.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to mourn the passing of one  of our Nation's brave servicemembers, Air Force Staff Sergeant James  Grotjan, who lost his life in an accident while in the line of duty in  the United Arab Emirates earlier this month. His untimely passing while  supporting our Nation's mission to defeat ISIS in Iraq and Syria is a  reminder of the risks our brave servicemen and -women place themselves  in each and every day to protect our country.   Staff Sergeant Grotjan, who went by Tyler, followed his father's  footsteps into military service. After graduating from Bacon Academy in  Colchester, Connecticut, Tyler joined the Air Force and eventually  joined the 4th Civil Engineer Squadron at Johnson Air Force Base in  North Carolina.   His father recently said that Tyler's military service made him ``the  proudest father on the planet.'' It takes a special kind of person to  join the military. These are the kind people who write a blank check  for their life to protect the country, and he was that guy. He  absolutely loved the military.   This Saturday his family and friends in southeastern Connecticut will  pause for a few hours to lay Staff Sergeant Grotjan to rest and reflect  on his life of giving. In front of his mother's house in Waterford  there is a sign that reads: ``Fly free with the angels.''   Mr. Speaker, I know that I join with all of Connecticut and the whole  House in offering our thoughts and prayers to Staff Sergeant Grotjan's  wife, Taylor; his mother, Laura; his father, Randy; his seven brothers  and sisters; family; and friends, and pray that he will ``fly free with  the angels.''                            ____________________
