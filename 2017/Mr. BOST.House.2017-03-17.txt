 Mr. Speaker, you can learn a lot when you listen. During  times like these, when political infighting makes it difficult to hear  everyone's voice, we need to try even harder.   Today I would like to encourage all of my constituents in the  Illinois 12th District to visit bost.house.gov/yourstory to share your  personal perspective on the Affordable Care Act. Again, that is  bost.house.gov/yourstory.   If the law has helped you and your family receive care you needed, I  want to hear about it. If the law has put you in a situation where you  don't have insurance or have higher premiums, I want to hear about  that, too.   It is important that we deal with this healthcare issue and reform it  so that it works for all people. And for the people of southern  Illinois, I want to hear your story.                            ____________________     Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of my amendment to H.R.  1367.   My simple and straightforward amendment would require the Department  of Veterans Affairs to develop and implement a plan to hire permanent  directors for each medical center of the VA. It also specifies that the  Secretary should prioritize the hiring of directors for locations that  have spent the longest amount of time without one.   Mr. Chairman, last Congress it was brought to my attention that the  VA medical center that many of my constituents utilize had not had a  permanent director in almost 3 years. This is simply unacceptable when  we have veterans needing quality care and are demanding reform to the  current healthcare system.   After reaching out to the Department, I came to realize that this is  a common problem around the country, which led to my introduction of  the amendment.   Under the current VA system, the Secretary is allowed to appoint an  interim director at facilities, but those individuals can only serve a  maximum of 240 days. This is simply far too short  [[Page H2166]]  a period of time to properly get to know the staff at the centers and  the needs of the location, let alone implement new reforms.   This commonsense bipartisan amendment is identical to a bill I  introduced earlier in this Congress with Members of both parties  supporting the legislation. It is also identical to legislation that  this body passed last Congress with strong bipartisan support.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense  amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr.  Wenstrup).    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
