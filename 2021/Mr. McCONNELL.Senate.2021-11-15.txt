 Madam President, earlier today, our distinguished  President pro tempore, the senior Senator from Vermont, announced he  will conclude his incredible run of Senate service. Senator Leahy plans  to retire at the end of next year, at the conclusion of his eighth  term.   Senator Leahy has served Vermonters in the Senate for longer than  anyone in the State's history. Of course, he has also become an all- star Senate institution in his own right. I think particularly of the  opportunities I had to work with Senator Leahy when we were sharing  leadership of the Appropriations Subcommittee for State and Foreign  Operations.   It is hard to imagine the Senate without Pat and his lovely wife  Marcelle. For now, I just want to salute our colleague on the occasion  of his announcement and add my congratulations on his remarkable career  thus far.    Mr. President, few sheriffs have accomplished as much,  served as long, or helped as many as Sheriff Keith Cain of Daviess  County, KY. After 48 years with the Daviess County Sheriff's  Department, and 22 years as sheriff, Keith is retiring this year,  leaving behind a breathtaking legacy of public service. Today, I  recognize Sheriff Cain as a Kentucky hero whose record of service  stands as an example for us all.   Sheriff Cain loves Daviess County and has spent his entire life  working to protect and defend his fellow Kentuckians. He started his  career in the Marines during the Vietnam war, showcasing the  selflessness and sense of duty that would define the rest of his life.  Upon returning to Kentucky, he joined the Daviess County Sheriff's  Department, finding a home among his community's top law enforcement  officers.   Fast forward nearly half a century, and it is clear that Sheriff  Cain's dedication to his neighbors has not waned a bit since he first  started his career. By pioneering new tactics and techniques, he has  revolutionized law enforcement practices in Daviess County. As a  graduate of both the National Sheriff's Institute and the FBI National  Academy, Keith brought the technical know-how needed to beat any  challenge that threatened his home community.   When the addiction crisis started in earnest in Western Kentucky,  Sheriff Cain spearheaded Daviess County's rollout of Operation United  Front, a program that helped combat the spread of illicit substances.  He currently serves as the chair of the Drug Enforcement Committee of  the National Sheriff's Association, using his expertise to help  communities across the Nation. Keith is also a leader in law  enforcement training and instruction. He served as the chair of the  Kentucky Law Enforcement Council--the body responsible for all police  training in the Commonwealth----and currently works at a local  community college as a certified law enforcement instructor.   With nearly five decades of phenomenal public service under his belt,  it is no surprise that Sheriff Cain has received numerous awards from  law enforcement organizations all across the country. There are too  many to list, but highlights include the Governor's Award for  Outstanding Contribution to Kentucky Law Enforcement, the Kentucky  Sheriff Association's Sheriff of the Year Award, and the National  Sheriff's Association Sheriff of the Year Award. Keith has been  recognized by organizations like the NAACP, the U.S. Marine Corps Law  Enforcement Foundation, and the VFW. Needless to say, Daviess County  will miss him dearly when he is gone.   While Sheriff Cain is retiring, I am confident we are not marking the  end of his lifelong commitment to service. As the past half century has  shown, Keith dedicated his entire life and career to care for his  neighbors and community. While he will now have more time to spend with  his wife Charlotte, son Jason, and granddaughters, Alexis and Alyssa, I  am sure he will also remain an ever-present helping hand for Daviess  County residents. On behalf of the Senate, I thank Sheriff Cain for his  service and congratulate him on his well-earned retirement.

It had fallen behind its peer institutions in infrastructure and  student programming. Its endowment soon came under threat from partisan  efforts that could have forced Berea to renege on its promise of  providing a high-quality, tuition-free education to more than 1,600  students. But because of the work of President Roelofs, the school is  now thriving like never before. Today, in light of President Roelofs's  announcement that he will retire in 2023, I would like to pay tribute  to one of the most generous and hard-working champions of higher  education in Kentucky.   It is easy for outsiders to overlook Berea College. But nestled  between the foothills of the Cumberland Mountains and the Bluegrass  plains is one of the most significant institutions of higher learning  in the entire United States. Founded by abolitionists before the Civil  War, Berea College was the first racially integrated and coeducational  college in the entire American South. Berea fostered inclusion and  diversity at a time when it was difficult--even dangerous--to do so.   That grand history made the threats to Berea's tuition-free model  even more worrisome. In many ways, the school embodies the unique  values that make America special; it is an institution where anyone, of  any background, has a chance to compete, learn new skills, and succeed.  To some observers, though, Berea's work college system seemed outdated  in an era when schools offer increasingly flashy amenities for ever- increasing tuition rates.   Roelofs, however, was firmly committed to Berea's foundational  principles. He quickly got to work to defend the school's legacy and  protect its students. Nearly a decade later, the fruits of his hard  work are apparent. Berea has updated its residence halls, developed new  educational programs, restored its surrounding forest ecosystem, and  steadily climbed college ranking lists. Most importantly, Berea College  is better equipped than ever to remain true to its tuition-free  commitment.   I had the opportunity to get to know Lyle when we worked together to  protect his school from an unintended tax penalty that arose when  partisan lawmakers targeted the ability of schools like Berea to use  the returns on their endowments to provide tuition-free education to  low-income students. If these legislators had been successful, they  would have forced Berea College to abandon its tuition-free promise and  turn its back on its students, whose families make, on average, less  than $30,000 per year. But because of the work of Berea College  President Lyle Roelofs and his tireless advocacy efforts in Congress,  we were able to work together to ward off these tax hikes and protect  Berea College for years to come.   President Roelofs's leadership and care are astounding, and his  commitment to Berea College is heroic. I know that each student who  attends Berea is profoundly grateful for his work. On behalf of the  Senate, I would like to congratulate President Roelofs on his well- earned retirement and thank him for his service to the Commonwealth of  Kentucky.                            ____________________
