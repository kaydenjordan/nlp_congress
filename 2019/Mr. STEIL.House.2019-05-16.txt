 Madam Speaker, I appreciate Mr. Rutherford putting  together tonight's Special Order.   Madam Speaker, I rise to recognize Racine County Sheriff Deputy Eric  Schneider for his heroic actions on March 18.   While on duty, Deputy Schneider rushed to the scene of a house fire.  He knocked on all of the doors and windows, yelling to see if anyone  was inside.   A man came out of the house, but without regard for his own safety,  Deputy Schneider entered the burning house to check if there were more  people inside. Risking his life, he found a man who was unconscious.  Deputy Schneider dragged him out of the house and saved his life.   Deputy Schneider is a hero. We are fortunate to have brave men and  women like Deputy Schneider protecting us.   Madam Speaker, I thank Deputy Schneider. I commend him for his  actions.   Madam Speaker, when law enforcement officers put on their uniforms  and badges, they do not know if they will return home after their  shift. Their job is dangerous. Too often, they sacrifice their lives to  strangers.   Over the past year, Wisconsin has lost three police officers in the  line of duty. Those heroes died while protecting us from harm.   We will never forget them. We will not forget their service. We will  not forget their bravery.   We remember:   Officer Charles Irvine, end of watch, June 7, 2018;   Officer Michael Michalski, end of watch, July 25, 2018; and   Officer Matthew Rittner, end of watch, February 6, 2019.
