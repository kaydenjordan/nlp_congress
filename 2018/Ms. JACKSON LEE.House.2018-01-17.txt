 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to save lives.   Mr. Speaker, I oppose the CR for its repetitiveness and its inability  to save lives, frankly, the lives of DREAMers or the lives of those who  depend upon the Children's Health Insurance Program.   In the vulgar statement that was made by the White House, how  shocking this week of Dr. King's birthday of the deafening silence of  my Republican friends and the faith community, the broad-based faith  community.   Let me read from the network:         The slave codes created servitude for natural life for       African laborers. 250-plus years slave labor of millions of       African and Black people was the foundation of the American       economy and global force that it eventually became. On the       eve of the Civil War, Black slaves were valued at an       estimated $3.5 billion--and that is scaled for modern       inflation--and none of the Black slaves were able to cash in       on that value.    That is the vulgar statement about Africa from which many of us have  come. And so I would argue that it is time, now, for this House to  stand up for people such as those who are starving in Somalia, those  who are starving in Sudan and Nigeria, those who have been called a  vulgar word.   Where is the morality of this Congress, the morality of this  administration, the morality of this Nation?   Enough is enough.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New Jersey  for his leadership, and I thank Mr. Royce, Mr. Engel, Mr. Smith, and  Ms. Bass for establishing a real, viable African policy, a policy that  I have had the privilege of being part of for all of the years that I  have served in the United States Congress.   I remember making the first inaugural trip to do the research and to  meet with heads of state in Africa on the question of the African  Growth and Opportunity Act.   Over the years, we worked with the Bush administration on the  Millennium Challenge Corporation. So I am delighted that we have a bill  that improves the benefits.   It is even more important, in this time, to make sure that the  policies of the United States toward Africa and the African countries  are clear and precise. They are strong allies and a very viable trade  partner.   This, of course, Mr. Speaker, is crucial in the backdrop of very  vulgar statements that, unfortunately, have come from the Commander in  Chief. Therefore, this is the policy that is real, an ongoing  partnership, the fact that Africa represents a growing population of 1  billion people. When we last traveled with a President of the United  States--which then was President  [[Page H435]]  Barack Obama--and visited a number of African countries, in particular  Kenya, we were there to look at the rising population of small- and  medium-sized entrepreneurs, young millennials, and others who were  eager to engage in business.   The African Growth and Opportunity Act will be a pathway for sub- Saharan African countries in that area that will create the pathway for  trade for the goods of those produced on the continent.   Peace and the economy go together. If we have an economic engine  partnership with the United States, looking at good quality investment,  and if we have the work of the Millennium Challenge to challenge  countries to become more democratic, to open the doors of opportunity,  to have a better fiscal system, and to be a real partner in these  improvements, that is a real African policy.   So I rise to support the underlying bill, H.R. 3445. I rise to  support it because it is an advancement to the work that has been done  over the years by the United States Congress and the many partners that  we have had.   I am a student of Africa, having gone to school in Accra and Kumasi  in Ghana and, of course, in Lagos and Ibadan in Nigeria. I have  traveled often, and I understand the ingenuity, the eagerness, and the  commitment to democratic principles and, of course, the opportunities  for their young generation.   So I rise today to support the bill. I thank the sponsors for this  very excellent legislation. It is good work.   Mr. Speaker, I don't know if it is appropriate, but I ask unanimous  consent to cosponsor the legislation at this time.
