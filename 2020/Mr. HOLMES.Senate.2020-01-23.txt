 Correct.         My understanding is that the prosecutor general       at the time, Shokin, was not at that time pursuing       investigations of Burisma or the Bidens.         That's correct. And not just us but all of our       allies and other institutions who were involved in Ukraine at       the time.    Ms. Manager GARCIA of Texas. Ambassador Yovanovitch confirmed these  points. Let's watch her testify.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)          Ambassador Sondland placed a call on his mobile       phone, and I heard him announce himself several times along       the lines of ``Gordon Sondland, holding for the President.''       It appeared that he was being transferred through several       layers of switchboards and assistants, and I then noticed       Ambassador Sondland's demeanor changed and understood he had       been connected to President Trump. While Ambassador       Sondland's phone was not on speakerphone, I could hear the       President's voice through the ear piece of the phone.        The President's voice was loud and recognizable, and       Ambassador Sondland held the phone away from his ear for a       period of time, presumably because of the loud volume. I       heard Ambassador Sondland greet the President and explained       he was calling from Kyiv. I heard President Trump then       clarify that Ambassador Sondland was in Ukraine. Ambassador       Sondland replied, yes, he was in Ukraine, and went on to       state that President Zelensky ``loves your ass.'' I then       heard President Trump ask, ``So he's going to do the       investigation?''        Ambassador Sondland replied that ``he's going to do it,''       adding that President Zelensky will do ``anything you ask him       to do.''    Mr. Manager SCHIFF. After the call, Ambassador Sondland confirmed to  Holmes that the investigations were the President's sole interest with  Ukraine because--and this is very important--they benefit the  President.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)          After the call ended, Ambassador Sondland       remarked that the President was in a bad mood, as Ambassador       Sondland stated was often the case early in the morning. I       then took the opportunity to ask Ambassador Sondland for his       candid impression of the President's views on Ukraine. In       particular, I asked Ambassador Sondland if it was true that       the President did not give a [expletive] about Ukraine.       Ambassador Sondland agreed that the President did not give a       [expletive] about Ukraine.        I asked, ``Why Not?'' Ambassador Sondland stated the       President only cares about ``big stuff.'' I noted there was       big stuff going on in Ukraine, like a war with Russia.       Ambassador Sondland replied that he meant big stuff that       benefits the President, like the Biden investigation that Mr.       Giuliani was pushing. The conversation then moved on to other       topics.    Mr. Manager SCHIFF. This understanding by Ambassador Sondland is  independently confirmed by President Trump's own interactions with  Ukraine.   During his two telephone calls with President Zelensky--first on  April 21 and then on July 25--President Trump did not refer to any  anti-corruption efforts or the war against Russia. He never even  uttered the word ``corruption.'' Instead, he only spoke about  investigating his political opponents.   He later confirmed this narrow and singular focus to the press. On  October 3, when asked about the Ukraine scheme, he said: ``Well, I  would think if they were honest about it, they would start a major  investigation into the Bidens. It's a very simple answer.''   Here is that conference:   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         REPORTER. What exactly did you hope Zelensky would do about       the Bidens after your phone call?        The PRESIDENT. Well, I would think that, if they were       honest about it, they'd start a major investigation into the       Bidens. It's a very simple answer.    Mr. Manager SCHIFF. So we know from witnesses, the President's  personal agents, and, most importantly, the President himself that the  only thing President Trump cared about with Ukraine was his  investigations in order to benefit himself.   To see this even more starkly, it is helpful to remember what  Presidential head-of-state calls are normally used for.   Talk to any former occupant of the Oval Office, and he will tell you  that the disparity in power between the President of the United States  and other heads of state is vast. Since World War II--and consistent  with the requirement to ``faithfully execute'' their oaths of office-- U.S. Presidents from both political parties have made good use of this  disparity in power in their telephone calls with foreign leaders. They  have used those calls to secure commitments that have bolstered  American security and prosperity.   Acting as our chief diplomat, President Reagan used his calls to our  European allies, like Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, to rally the  world against the Soviet threat--the shining city on the hill standing  up to the evil empire. His calls laid the foundation for landmark  nonproliferation agreements that averted nuclear Armageddon.   It was during a phone call on Christmas Day in 1991 that President  George H. W. Bush learned that Mikhail Gorbachev intended to resign as  Soviet Premier, marking the end of the Soviet Union. Historians credit  his deft diplomacy, including numerous one-on-one phone calls, for  bringing about a peaceful end to the Cold War.   Following September 11, President George W. Bush used his calls with  heads of state to rally global support for the U.S. campaign to defeat  al-Qaida and to work with our allies to protect and defend U.S.  national security and combat terrorism.   President Obama used his calls with foreign leaders to contain the  fallout from the global economic crisis, assemble an international  coalition to fight the Islamic State, and, of course, to rally support  for Ukraine following Russia's invasion of Crimea.   No matter what you think of the policy views or priorities of these  prior Presidents, there is no question that they are examples of the  normal diplomacy that happens during Presidential telephone calls, and  there is no doubt, when you are the President of the United States and  you call a foreign leader, that you are on the clock for the American  people. Consistent with the faithful execution of his or her oath of  office, a President's first and only objective is to get foreign  leaders to do what is in the best interest of the United States.   That is not what happened on July 25. On that date, President Trump  used a head-of-state call with the leader of Ukraine to help himself-- to press a foreign leader to investigate the President's political  opponent in order to help his reelection campaign. President Trump  abused his authority as Commander in Chief and Chief Diplomat to  benefit himself, and he betrayed the interests of the American people  when he did so.   Let's go to the third reason that we know the President put his  interests first.   The third reason you know that the investigations were politically  motivated is the central role played by President Trump's personal  attorney, Mr. Giuliani, who has never had an official role in this  government but, instead, was at all times representing the President in  his personal capacity. There is no dispute about this.   For example, Mr. Giuliani made this point clearly in his May 10  letter to the President of Ukraine himself, where he wrote:         Dear President-Elect Zelensky, I am private counsel to       President Donald J. Trump. Just to be precise, I represent       him as a private citizen, not as President of the United       States. This is quite common under American law because the       duties and privileges of a President and a private citizen       are not the same. Separate representation is the usual       process.    Mr. Giuliani also repeated this publicly. For example, he confirmed  this point on May 9, in the New York Times, when he said--well, many  things--``We're not meddling in an election, we're meddling in an  investigation, which we have a right to do.''   ``There is nothing illegal about it,'' he said. ``Somebody could say  it's improper. And this isn't foreign policy.''   He went on to say, referring to the President: ``He basically knows  what I'm doing, sure, as his lawyer.''   ``My only client is the president of the United States,'' he said.  ``He's the one I have an obligation to report to, tell him what  happened.''   Think about that. The President is using his personal lawyer to ask  [[Page S501]]  Ukraine for investigations that aren't ``foreign policy'' but that will  be very, very helpful to the President personally. It is not often you  get it so graphically as we do here.   Let's go to the fourth reason that these investigations were never  part of U.S. policy.   It was not just that President Trump used his personal lawyer; it was  also that what he was asking for was never a part of U.S. policy.  Witnesses told us that President Trump's investigations were not in his  official, prepared talking points or briefing materials. To the  contrary, they went against official policy and diverged from our  national security interests.   All three witnesses--Tim Morrison at the National Security Council,  LTC Alex Vindman at the National Security Council, and Jennifer  Williams, who listened to the July 25 call--testified that when  President Trump demanded that President Zelensky investigate the  Bidens, he had completely departed from the talking points they had  prepared for him.   Now, before I get to the video clip, I just want to underscore this:  He is not obligated to use his talking points, and he is not obligated  to follow the recommendations of his staff no matter how sound they may  be. What this makes clear is that it was not U.S. policy that he was  conducting; it was his private, personal interests that he was  conducting. If it were U.S. policy, it probably would have been in the  talking points and briefing materials, but, of course, it was not.   Let's look at Mr. Morrison's testimony on this point.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         GOLDMAN. Now, Mr. Morrison, were--these references to       CrowdStrike, the server and 2016 election, and to Vice       President Biden and son, were they included in the       President's talking points?         I then heard President Trump ask, ``So he's       going to do the investigation?'' Ambassador Sondland replied       that he is going to do it, adding that President Zelensky       will do ``anything you ask him to do.''    Mr. Manager SCHIFF. So here we are; this is July 26. President  Zelensky doesn't want to be used as a pawn and doesn't want to be drawn  into U.S. politics, but at this point he feels he has no choice.  Sondland tells David Holmes he is going to do it. Of course, that is  the only thing the President asked about in that call. Sondland says he  is going to do it, adding that Zelensky will do ``anything you ask''  him to do, including, apparently, be his pawn.   Although Sondland didn't remember the details of his conversation, he  did not dispute Holmes' recollection of it. In fact, Ambassador  Sondland had an interesting take on it, which you should hear.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         Ambassador SONDLAND. Actually, actually, I would have been       more surprised if President Trump had not mentioned       investigations, particularly given what we are hearing from       Mr. Giuliani about the President's concerns.    Mr. Manager SCHIFF. That is pretty telling that in this call, the day  after he has had this head-of-state call--they finally got the call  arranged between these two Presidents--and Ambassador Sondland, with  major support of the President, says: I would have been more surprised  if he didn't bring it up.   The President doesn't bring up the war with Russia. He doesn't bring  up anything else. He just brings this up, and Sondland confirms: Yeah,  frankly, I would have been surprised if it was something different  because we are all in the loop here.   Everybody understood what this President wanted, and apparently  everybody also understood just how wrong it was and how damaging it  was.   In September 2019, even after President Trump learned that his scheme  was in danger of becoming publicly exposed, he would not give up. He  still expected Ukraine to announce investigations into Joe Biden and  his alleged Ukrainian interference in 2016. According to three  witnesses, President Trump emphasized to Ambassador Sondland during a  call on September 7 that President Zelensky ``should want to do it.''   Then you have the President's remarks on October 3:   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         REPORTER. What exactly did you hope Zelensky would do about       the Bidens after your phone?        President TRUMP. Well, I would think that, if they were       honest about it, they'd start a major investigation into the       Bidens. It's a very simple answer.    Mr. Manager SCHIFF. So here we hear again from the President's own  words what his primary object is, and his primary object is helping his  reelection campaign--help to cheat in his reelection campaign. After  all that we have been through and after all that we went through with  the Russian interference in our election and all that cost, he was at  it again, unrepentant and undeterred. If anything, he was emboldened by  escaping accountability from his invitation and willful use of Russian- hacked materials in the last election, and unconstrained. This is a  President who truly feels that under article II he can do whatever he  wants, and that includes coercing an ally to help him cheat in an  election.   If he is successful, the election is not a remedy for that. A remedy  in which the President can cheat is no remedy at all, which is why we  are here. This was not about corruption, which brings me to No. 10, the  10 reasons you know President Trump put himself first.   Ironically, the President has argued that his corrupt conduct in  soliciting sham investigations from Ukraine was driven by his concerns  about corruption in Ukraine. This attempt to legitimize his efforts is  simply not credible and not the least bit believable given the mountain  of evidence in the record of President Trump's corrupt intent. There is  no evidence that President Trump cared one whit about anti-corruption  efforts at all. That is the 10th reason you know this was all  political.   First, the evidence and President Trump's own public statements make  clear that when the President talks about corruption in Ukraine, he is  only talking about that sliver--that little sliver--of alleged  corruption that just somehow happened to be affected by his own  political interests, specifically two investigations that would benefit  his reelection.   For example, on September 25, in a joint press availability with  President Zelensky--the man who doesn't want to be a pawn--at the  United Nations General Assembly, President Trump emphasized his  understanding of corruption to relate to the Biden investigation.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         TRUMP. Now, when Biden's son walks away with millions of       dollars from Ukraine, and he knows nothing, and they're       paying him millions of dollars, that's corruption.    Mr. Manager SCHIFF. I mean, you can imagine how President Zelensky  feels sitting there and hearing this--the man who does not want to be a  pawn and the man who doesn't want to be pulled into American politics.  And  [[Page S505]]  there is the President, at it again, trying to draw his nation in, even  while they have a war to fight.   Another example was on September 30, when President Trump stated:   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         Now, the new President of Ukraine ran on the basis of no       corruption. That's how he got elected. And I believe that he       really means it. But there was a lot of corruption having to       do with the 2016 election against us. And we want to get to       the bottom of it, and it's very important that we do.    Mr. Manager SCHIFF. This is, of course, again, bringing up the  CrowdStrike conspiracy theory. What does the President say?  ``Corruption . . . against us.'' He is not concerned about actual  corruption cases, only about matters that affect him personally.   Two days later, President Trump again tried to link corruption with  the Biden investigation.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         The only thing that matters is the transcript of the actual       conversation that I had with the President of Ukraine. It was       perfect. We're looking at congratulations. We're looking at       doing things together. And what are we looking at? We're       looking at corruption. And, in, I believe, 1999, there was a       corruption act or a corruption bill passed between both--and       signed--between both countries, where I have a duty to report       corruption. And let me tell you something: Biden's son is       corrupt, and Biden is corrupt.    Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Just 2 days after that, the President again  equated corruption with actions by others to hurt him politically.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         The PRESIDENT: Here's what's okay: If we feel there's       corruption, like I feel there was in the 2016 campaign--there       was tremendous corruption against me--if we feel there's       corruption, we have a right to go to a foreign country.    Mr. Manager SCHIFF. So here, again, the President is pushing out the  Kremlin talking points of Ukrainian interference in 2016 and the  CrowdStrike conspiracy theory. Again, when President Trump is talking  about corruption, he is talking about perceived efforts by political  opponents to hurt him. It is personal, and it is political, but it is  not anti-corruption policy.   Ambassador Volker confirmed this fact. Fighting corruption in  Ukraine, when used by President Trump and Giuliani, in fact, refers to  the investigation of the Bidens in 2016. Volker said:   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         VOLKER. In hindsight, I now understand that others saw the       idea of investigating possible corruption involving the       Ukrainian company Burisma as equivalent to investigating       former Vice President Biden.    Mr. Manager SCHIFF. So, again, although President Trump and Mr.  Giuliani had used the general term ``corruption'' to describe what they  want Ukraine to investigate, it wasn't about anything actually related  to corruption. The evidence, including the President's own statements,  makes clear that this is simply code for the specific investigations  that President Trump wanted Ukraine to pursue.   Second, as we have discussed, the President's timing of his purported  concerns about corruption in Ukraine make it all the more suspect.  Before news of Vice President Biden's candidacy broke, President Trump  showed no interest in Ukraine. He gave Ukraine hundreds of millions of  dollars under a regime that lost power because of mounting concerns  about corruption.   So here we are, the President, in these prior years, giving money to  a government, to Mr. Poroshenko, that is viewed as corrupt, and  Zelensky comes and runs against him in an underdog campaign--underdog  campaign of Zelensky against Poroshenko. And what is the heart of  Zelensky's campaign? That Poroshenko's government is corrupt, and he is  running to clean it up. He is the reformer. He succeeds because the  Ukrainians really want to clean up their government. We see this  reformer win and carry the hopes of the Ukrainian people.   President Trump had no problem giving money appropriated by Congress  to Ukraine under the corrupt regime of Poroshenko where corruption had  existed during Poroshenko. But a reformer gets elected, devoted to  fighting corruption, and suddenly there is a problem. There was a  reason to give more support to Ukraine. We had a President for whom  this was the central pillar of his campaign. He came from outside of  the government. People placed their hopes in him. You can see President  Zelensky trying to flatter the President in that July 25 call by  saying: I am up for draining the swamp too. He ran on a campaign of  reform.   So there was no problem giving money to the prior regime where there  were abundant concerns about corruption, but you get a reformer in  office, and now there is a problem? Of course, we know what changed:  the emergence of Joe Biden as a candidate.   In the prior regime, corruption was no problem. A reformer comes into  office; suddenly, there is a problem. If you need any more graphic  example, again, you look at that call.   No one disputes that Marie Yovanovitch was and is a devoted fighter  against corruption. That is her reputation. That was part of the reason  they had to get rid of her. If you look at that July 25 call, the  President is badmouthing this person fighting corruption. He is  praising the former Ukrainian prosecutor, who is corrupt. Are we really  to believe that this is about fighting corruption? There was no problem  supporting the former regime with corruption problems but problems  supporting a reformer trying to clean it up; no problems with a corrupt  former Ukrainian prosecutor whom he praises in that call--he is a good  man--but problems with a U.S. Ambassador who has devoted her life to  this country.   It wasn't until 2019, after Biden emerged as a considerable opponent  and after Special Counsel Mueller confirmed that President Trump's  campaign had welcomed Russian assistance in 2016 that President Trump,  we are to believe, suddenly developed an interest in anti-corruption  reforms in Ukraine. Never mind that his own Defense Department said  they were meeting all the benchmarks. This new administration, the  reformer, was doing exactly what we wanted him to do. Never mind that.  Now that Biden is in the picture, he has a problem.   Third, when given the opportunity to raise the issue of corruption  with the Ukrainians, the President never did. Despite at the request of  his staff, the word ``corruption'' never crosses his lips, just the  Bidens and CrowdStrike.   When the President first spoke to President Zelensky on April 21, he  was supposed to--he was asked to by his staff--bring up corruption. Go  back and check, but I think the readout of that congratulatory call  actually said that he brought up corruption. Am I right? My staff says  I am right.   So, on April 21, he is asked to bring up corruption. In the  congratulatory call to President Zelensky--great reformer--he doesn't  bring it up, but you know the readout says that he did. It was just  like the readout of the July 25 call, misleading.   Of course, the readout for the second call was far more misleading  because there was far more to mislead about. But in those two  conversations, there is nary a mention of the word ``corruption.'' We  are to believe that, apart from the Bidens, this is what our President  was concerned about in Ukraine.   Here is Lieutenant Colonel Vindman.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)          On June 27th, Ambassador Sondland told       Ambassador Taylor in a phone conversation, the gist of which       Ambassador Taylor shared with me at the time, that President       Zelensky needed to make clear to President Trump that       President Zelensky was not standing in the way of, quote,       ``investigations.'' I understood that this meant the Biden/      Burisma investigations that Mr. Giuliani and his associates       had been speaking about in the media since March.    Mrs. Manager DEMINGS. Even with the addition of President Trump's  political appointees to aid Mr. Giuliani's efforts, President Zelensky  did not announce the investigations. As Mr. Giuliani's June 21 tweet  shows, the Ukrainian President was resisting President Trump's  pressure.   So what happened? Well, that brings us to the President's next  official act: turning up the pressure by conditioning an official White  House meeting on Ukraine announcing his political investigations.   Senators, I know we have covered a lot of ground, but as we have  shown, there is overwhelming and uncontradicted evidence of the  President's scheme to solicit foreign interference in this year's  Presidential election.   Let me say this also. Each time that we remind this body of the  President's scheme to cheat, to win, some of his defenders say that we  are only concerned about winning the next election--the Democrats are  only doing this to win the next election.   But you know better because this trial is much bigger than any one  election, and it is much bigger than any one President. This moment is  about the American people. Whether a maid or a janitor, whether a  nurse, a teacher, or a truck driver, whether a doctor or a mechanic,  this moment is about ensuring that their votes matter and that American  elections are decided by the American people.   President Trump acted corruptly. He abused the power of his office by  ordering U.S. diplomats to work with his political agent to solicit two  politically motivated investigations by Ukraine. The investigations  were designed solely to help his personal interests, not our national  interests. Neither investigation solicited by President Trump had  anything to do with promoting U.S. foreign policy or U.S. national  security. Indeed, as we will discuss later, both investigations and the  President's broader scheme to secure Ukraine's interference was a  threat. It was a threat. It was a threat to our national security. The  only person who stood to benefit from the abuse of office and  solicitation of these investigations was Donald Trump--the 45th  President of the United States.   This was a violation of public trust and a failure to take care that  the laws be faithfully executed, but when it came down to choosing  between the national interests of the country and his own personal  interests--his reelection--President Trump chose himself.   Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. Mr. Chief Justice, the distinguished Members of  the Senate, the counsel to the President, and all of those who are  assembled here today, earlier this morning, I  [[Page S511]]  was on my way to the office, and I ran into a fellow New Yorker who  just happens to work here in Washington, DC.   He said to me: Congressman, have you heard the latest outrage?   I wasn't really sure what he was talking about. So, to be honest, I  thought to myself, Well, the President is now back in town. What has  Donald Trump done now? So I said to him: What outrage are you talking  about?   He paused for a moment, and then he said to me: Someone voted against  Derek Jeter on his Hall of Fame ballot.   (Laughter.)   Life is all about perspective.   I understand that, as House managers, we certainly hope we can  subpoena John Bolton and subpoena Mick Mulvaney, but perhaps we can all  agree to subpoena the Baseball Hall of Fame to try to figure out who,  out of 397 individuals, was the one person who voted against Derek  Jeter.   I was thinking about that as I prepared to rise today, because what  is more American than baseball and apple pie? Perhaps the one thing  that falls into that category is the sanctity and continuity of the  U.S. Constitution.   As House managers, we are here in this august body because we believe  it is necessary to defend our democracy. Some of you may agree with us  at the end of the day, and others most likely will not, but we do want  to thank you for your courtesy and for your patience in extending to us  the opportunity to present our case with dignity to you and to the  American people during this solemn constitutional moment.   I want to speak for just some time on the second official act that  President Trump used to corruptly abuse his power, which was the  withholding of an official Oval Office meeting with the President of  Ukraine.   As discussed yesterday, ``quid pro quo'' is a Latin term. It means  ``this for that.''   President Trump refused to schedule that Oval Office meeting until  the Ukrainian leader announced the phony political investigations that  he demanded on July 25. He knew President Zelensky needed the meeting  to bolster his standing. He knew that Ukraine was a fragile democracy.  He knew that President Zelensky needed the meeting to show Vladimir  Putin that he had the support of Donald Trump, but President Trump  exploited that desperation for his own political benefit--this for  that. Did a quid pro quo exist? The answer is yes.   Let's listen to Ambassador Sondland on this point.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         Amb. SONDLAND. I know that members of this committee       frequently frame these complicated issues in the form of a       simple question. Was there a quid pro quo? As I testified       previously with regard to the requested White House call and       the White House meeting, the answer is yes.    Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. Did President Trump abuse his power and commit  an impeachable offense? The answer is yes.   The phony political investigations that President Trump demanded from  Ukraine were part of a scheme to sabotage a political rival--Joe  Biden--and cheat in the 2020 election. No national interest was served.  The President used his awesome power to help himself and not the  American people. He must be held accountable.   The President's defenders may argue, as Mick Mulvaney tried to, that  quid pro quo arrangements are a common aspect of U.S. foreign policy.  Nonsense. There are situations where official United States acts, like  head-of-state meetings or the provision of foreign assistance, are used  to advance the national interests of the United States. That is not  what happened here. Here, President Trump sought to advance his own  personal political interests, facilitated by Rudolph Giuliani, the  human hand grenade.    Let's walk through the overwhelming evidence of how President Trump  withheld an official White House meeting, which was vitally important  to Ukraine, as part of a corrupt scheme to convince President Zelensky  to announce two phony political investigations.   First, the Oval Office meeting President Trump corruptly withheld  constitutes an official act. President Trump chose to withhold this  meeting for a reason. It was not some run-of-the-mill meeting. It was  one of the most powerful tools he could wield in his role as the leader  of the free world. It would have demonstrated U.S. support for  Ukraine's newly elected leader at a critical time. Ukraine is under  relentless attack by Russian-backed separatists in Crimea and in the  East. Ukraine desperately needed an Oval Office meeting, and President  Trump knew it.   Second, President Trump withheld that Oval Office meeting to increase  pressure on Ukraine to assist his reelection campaign by announcing two  phony investigations. As my colleagues have detailed extensively  throughout the day, this is a classic quid pro quo.   Third, multiple administration officials, including the President's  own handpicked supporters and appointees, confirmed that a corrupt  exchange was being sought.   Finally, contemporaneous documentation makes clear that the President  corruptly abused his power to advance the scheme to try and cheat in  the 2020 election--this for that.   Let's explore whether the granting or the denial of an Oval Office  meeting constitutes an official act.   As we discussed earlier today, an abuse of power occurs when the  President exercises his official power to obtain a corrupt personal  benefit while ignoring or injuring the national interests.   Pursuant to the Constitution and more than 200 years of tradition, as  President, Donald Trump is America's head of state and chief diplomat.  Article II grants the President wide latitude to conduct diplomacy and  to, specifically, receive Ambassadors and other public Ministers. The  President decides which head-of-state meetings best advance the  national interests and which foreign leaders are deserving of an  official reception in the Oval Office--perhaps one of the most  prestigious nonreligious venues in the world.   In diplomacy, perception matters. Meetings between heads of state are  make-or-break moments that can determine the trajectory of global  events, and a meeting with the President of the United States in the  Oval Office is unquestionably monumental, particularly for a fragile  democracy like Ukraine.   The Oval Office is where foreign leaders facing challenges at home  go--like a war with Russia--in pursuit of a strong and public  demonstration of American support. That is especially true in this  particular case. The decision to grant or withhold an Oval Office  meeting to President Zelensky has profound consequences for the  national security interests of both Ukraine and the United States.   To understand the full context of President Trump's corrupt demands  to the Ukrainian leader, it is important to consider the geopolitical  context--that all of you are very familiar with--confronting the  Ukrainian people.   Ukraine is at war with Russia. In 2014, Russia annexed Crimea by  force. The United States and other European countries rallied to  Ukraine's defense, providing economic assistance, diplomatic support,  and later, with strong advocacy from this body, lethal aid. This  support meant Russia faced consequences for its aggression.   Here is Ambassador Yovanovitch's testimony explaining just how  important the United States is to Ukraine.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         Amb. YOVANOVITCH. The U.S. relationship for Ukraine is the       single most important relationship, and so I think that       President Zelensky, any president, would do what they could       to lean in on a favor request. I'm not saying that that's a       yes, I'm saying they would try to lean in and see what they       could do.         It is important to understand that a White       House visit was critical to President Zelensky. President       Zelensky needed to show U.S. support at the highest levels in       order to demonstrate to Russian President Putin that he had       U.S. backing, as well as to advance his ambitious       anticorruption agenda at home.    Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. In other words, Ukraine knew that Russia was  watching carefully.   That was particularly true in the spring of 2019, when Donald Trump  launched the scheme at the center of the abuse of power charge.   During this time period, Vladimir Putin was preparing for peace  negotiations with the new Ukrainian leader. Putin could choose to  escalate or he could choose to deescalate Russian aggression. And  influencing his decision was an assessment of whether President Trump  had Ukraine's back.   (Text of Videotape presentation.)         Amb. TAYLOR. The Russians, as I said in my deposition,       ``would love to see the humiliation of President Zelensky at       the hands of the Americans.''    Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. An Oval Office meeting would have sent a strong  signal of support that President Trump had Ukraine's back. The absence  of such a meeting could be devastating. Indeed, Ukraine made very clear  to the United States just how important a White House meeting between  the two heads of State was for its fragile democracy.   At the deposition, as the one on the screen reveals, LTC Alexander  Vindman, the director for Ukraine on the National Security Council,  recalled that following President Zelensky's inauguration, at every  single meeting with Ukrainian officials, they asked their American  counterparts about the status of an Oval Office meeting between the two  Presidents.   Initially, the Ukrainians had reason to be optimistic that a White  House meeting would be promptly scheduled. On April 21, during  President Zelensky's first call with President Trump, the new Ukrainian  leader asked about a White House visit three times. As part of that  brief congratulatory call, President Trump himself did extend an  invitation. Ukraine's dependence on the United States and its desperate  need for a White House meeting created an unequal power dynamic between  the two Presidents.   As Lieutenant Colonel Vindman testified, it is that unequal power  dynamic that turned any subsequent request for a favor from the  President into a demand.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)          Also, on June 28th, while President Trump was       still not moving forward on a meeting with President       Zelensky, we met with . . . He met with Russian President       Putin at the G20 Summit in Osaka, Japan, sending a further       signal of lack of support to Ukraine.    Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. Now, let's discuss how exactly President Trump  used the withholding of the White House meeting to pressure Ukraine for  his phony investigations--his quid pro quo scheme.   It is important to understand that the pressure exerted on Ukraine by  delaying the White House meeting didn't just occur right before the  July 25 call. That pressure existed during the entire scheme, and it  continues to this day.   We know this from the efforts of administration officials to secure  the meeting and from the Ukrainians continuously trying to lock down a  date.  [[Page S513]]  For example, even after President Trump expressed reluctance about  Ukraine on May 23, his administration officials continued working to  secure a White House meeting.   On July 10, for instance, they raised it again when Mr. Yermak and  Ukraine's national security advisor met with John Bolton at the White  House.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         Dr. HILL. And then we knew that the Ukrainians would have       on their agenda, inevitably, the question about a meeting. As       we get through the main discussion, we are going into that       wrap-up phase. The Ukrainians, Mr. Danylyuk, starts to ask       about a White House meeting and Ambassador Bolton was trying       to parry this back.    Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. As you have seen, President Zelensky didn't  just raise the Oval Office meeting on his April 21 call, he raised the  meeting on the July 25 call with President Trump again.   President Zelensky said on the July 25 call: ``I also wanted to thank  you for your invitation to visit the United States, specifically  Washington, DC.''   After the July 25 call, the Ukrainians continued to press for the  meeting, but that meeting never happened.   Only on September 25, after the House announced its investigation  into the President's misconduct as it relates to Ukraine and the  existence of a whistleblower complaint became public, did President  Trump and President Zelensky meet face-to-face for the first time. That  meeting was on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly in New York.  It was dominated by public release of the July 25 call record that  occurred the day before. It was a far cry from the demonstration of  strong support that would have been achieved by an Oval Office meeting.    Even President Zelensky recognized that a face-to-face talk on the  sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly was not the same as an  official Oval Office meeting. Sitting next to President Trump in New  York, he again raised a White House meeting. Here is what President  Zelensky said:   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         President ZELENSKY. And I want to thank you for the       invitation to Washington. You invited me, but I think--I'm       sorry, but I think you forgot to tell me the date. But I       think in the near future.    Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. President Trump was not just withholding a  small thing; the Oval Office meeting was a big deal. Ukraine remains at  war with Russia. It desperately needs our support. As a result, the  pressure on Ukraine not to upset President Trump--who still refuses to  meet with President Zelensky in the Oval Office--continues to this day.   David Holmes testified that the Ukrainian Government wants an Oval  Office meeting even after the release of the security assistance and  that our own U.S. national security objectives would also benefit from  such a meeting.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)          And although the hold on the security       assistance may have been lifted, there were still things they       wanted that they weren't getting, including a meeting with       the President in the Oval Office. Whether the hold, the       security assistance hold continued or not, the Ukrainians       understood that that's something the President wanted and       they still wanted important things from the President. That       continues to this day. We have to be very careful. They still       need us now going forward.        In fact, right now President Zelensky is trying to arrange       a summit meeting with President Putin in the coming weeks,       his first face-to-face meeting with him to try to advance the       peace process. He needs our support. He needs President Putin       to understand that America supports Zelensky at the highest       levels. So this doesn't end with the lifting of the security       assistance hold. Ukraine still needs us, and as I said, still       fighting this war this very day.    Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. Let's evaluate exactly how President Trump made  clear to Ukraine that a White House meeting was conditioned on Ukraine  announcing two phony political investigations that would help with  President Trump's reelection in 2020--help him cheat and corrupt our  democracy.   By the end of May, it was clear that President Trump's pressure  campaign to solicit foreign election interference wasn't working.  President Zelensky had been elected and was rebuffing Mr. Giuliani's  overtures. Even when President Trump directed his official staff to  work with Mr. Giuliani in an effort to get President Zelensky to  announce the two phony political investigations, that didn't work. So  President Trump apparently realized that he had to increase the  pressure. That is when he explicitly made clear to Ukraine that it  would not get the desperately sought after Oval Office meeting unless  President Zelensky publicly announced the phony investigations that  President Trump sought.   On July 2, 2019, Ambassador Volker personally communicated the need  for investigations directly to President Zelensky during a meeting in  Toronto.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         Ambassador VOLKER. After weeks of reassuring the Ukrainians       that it was just a scheduling issue, I decided to tell       President Zelensky that we had a problem with the information       reaching President Trump from Mayor Giuliani. I did so in a       bilateral meeting at a conference on Ukrainian economic       reform in Toronto on July 2, 2019, where I led the U.S.       delegation.        I suggested that he call President Trump directly in order       to renew their personal relationship and to assure President       Trump that he was committed to investigating and fighting       corruption, things on which President Zelensky had based his       Presidential campaign. I was convinced that getting the two       Presidents to talk with each other would overcome the       negative perception of Ukraine that President Trump still       harbored.    Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. After Ambassador Volker instructed President  Zelensky in Toronto on what to do, he updated Ambassador Taylor on his  actions. He told Ambassador Taylor that he had counseled the Ukrainian  President on how to ``prepare for the phone call with President  Trump.'' He also told Ambassador Taylor that he advised Zelensky that  President Trump ``would like to hear about the investigations.''   In addition to Ambassador Volker's direct outreach to President  Zelensky, Ambassador Sondland continued to apply pressure as well  during two White House meetings that took place on July 10 with  Ukrainian officials. The first meeting included National Security  Advisor John Bolton, Dr. Fiona Hill, LTC Alexander Vindman, Secretary  Rick Perry, Ambassador Volker, as well as Bolton's Ukrainian  counterpart and Ukrainian Presidential aide Andriy Yermak.   After discussion on Ukraine's national security reform plans,  Ambassador Sondland broached the subject of the phony political  investigations.   Fiona Hill, who also attended the meeting, recalled that Ambassador  Sondland blurted out the following in that meeting with the Ukrainians:  ``Well, we have an agreement with the Chief of Staff for a meeting if  these investigations in the energy sector start.'' That is code for  Burisma, which is code for the Bidens.   Ambassador Volker also recalled that Ambassador Sondland raised the  issue of the 2016 election and Burisma investigations. Ambassador  Volker found Ambassador Sondland's comments in that meeting to be  inappropriate.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         Ambassador VOLKER. I participated in the July 10 meeting       between National Security Advisor Bolton and then-Chairman of       the National Security Defense Council, Alex Danyliuk. As I       remember, the meeting was essentially over when Ambassador       Sondland made a general comment about investigations. I think       all of us thought it was inappropriate.    Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. The exchange underscores that by early July,  President Trump's demand for investigations had come to totally  dominate almost every aspect of U.S. foreign policy toward Ukraine.  Securing a Ukrainian commitment to do investigations was a major  priority of senior U.S. diplomats, as directed by President Donald John  Trump.   The July 10 meetings also confirmed that the scheme to pressure  Ukraine into opening investigations was not a rogue operation but one  blessed by senior administration officials at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.  As Ambassador Sondland testified, ``Everyone was in the loop.''   Mr. Majority Leader, based on the statement that we should break at  around 6:30 p.m., I ask your indulgence. This may be a natural breaking  point in connection with my presentation.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The majority leader.                            ____________________
