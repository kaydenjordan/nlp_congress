 Mr. President, I am here today because, unfortunately,  our elections still remain vulnerable to foreign election interference.   Earlier this month, the Senate Intelligence Committee, which I am  proud to serve on, released its report on Russia's use of social media  to undermine our democracy.   The committee's bipartisan conclusion was clear. Russia attacked our  democracy in 2016; their efforts on social media are ongoing; and they  will be back in 2020. Frankly, they never left.   This echos all of the evidence we have seen from the intelligence  community and from companies like Facebook, whose CEO, Mr. Zuckerberg,  is testifying on the other side of the Capitol today on some of the  ongoing efforts. We have seen this evidence, as well, from Special  Counsel Mueller and many, many others.   The alarm bells are going off, and what are we doing? We are running  out of time to do something about it.  [[Page S6061]]    Twice in recent weeks I have come to the floor to make a unanimous  consent request on bipartisan legislation, which I have introduced,  called the FIRE Act, and twice this bipartisan legislation has been  blocked by my Republican colleagues. Actually, their actions earned  applause from the President on Twitter.   Again, let me once again go forward with what this bill does. It is  pretty simple and very straightforward. It would say to all  Presidential campaigns going forward: If a foreign power reaches out to  your campaign, offering assistance or offering dirt on a political  opponent, the appropriate response is not to say thank you; the  appropriate response is to call the FBI.   When I first introduced this legislation, we were concerned about the  Mueller report's finding that the Trump campaign welcomed the  assistance of the Russian Government during the 2016 election.   At the time, I was also deeply alarmed by the President's comments in  the Oval Office during the summer that he would entertain offers of  foreign assistance in future elections.   A lot has happened since then, which makes this legislation more  necessary than ever. In the time since I last spoke on the FIRE Act,  the President has used his office to seek dirt on a political opponent,  Mr. Biden. It appears he pressured the Ukrainians. In the middle of  ongoing trade negotiations, he went on national television to call on  China to investigate Mr. Biden.   He also, during this period of time, has used the bully pulpit to  intimidate and threaten an intelligence community whistleblower. I am  glad to see that many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle  have stood up for the integrity of the whistleblower program and the  notions that whistleblowers are a critical part of keeping our system  on the up and up and that whistleblowers should not be threatened.   We have also heard in these past few weeks--I am not going to get  into all of the details--a lot of contradictory and, frankly, almost  Orwellian claims about whether the President's asking a favor of the  Ukrainian President is evidence of a quid pro quo. Then, just in recent  days, we have seen a series of career diplomats coming forward,  basically trying to validate the whistleblower's complaints.   I know the House is working on some of this, and our Senate  Intelligence Committee is also looking at some of the  counterintelligence concerns about the President's deals--about the  President's deals particularly with Mr. Giuliani and his associates.   I have particular interest, as well, in terms of what the Attorney  General is doing when he is going out, asking our closest allies--our  FVEY partners, in the case of Australia and the United Kingdom--to use  their intelligence services to bring us dirt on the President's  political opponents. That puts in jeopardy the trust basis the Five  Eyes plan operates under.   We need, more than ever, this basic FIRE Act bill to make it  absolutely clear that if we see foreign governments interfering, the  obligation ought to be on any Presidential campaign to tell the FBI.   I see my colleague on the other side of the aisle, and I know she  will probably object again. I just hope my colleagues will think about  and look back on how history is going to judge this body. Did we do  what was necessary to protect the integrity of our democratic process?  And how in the heck did we allow the protection of our democratic  process to become a partisan issue? We would never make protection of  the power grid a partisan issue. Yet, unfortunately, I think we are  going to see folks on the other side of the aisle object to this  commonsense basic reform.   If there are ways to improve on this legislation, I am wide open. I  know my colleague raised concerns about the breadth. Let me be clear.  Some of the claims that were made last time are not true, do not affect  diplomatic efforts, do not affect folks who are visiting here in this  country. We have been very, very clear. This is about a foreign  government's offer or their spy service's offer of assistance during a  Presidential campaign directly to that campaign.   But if there are ways to improve on the legislation, let's have it at  it. Let's offer an amendment. Let's at least vote. The truth is, we  know what we need to do to protect our elections.   Before I make my unanimous consent request, I want to recognize my  friends and colleagues, Senator Klobuchar and Senator Wyden, who, after  I make my request, will be speaking on a broader election security bill  of which I am proud to be an original cosponsor as well. Let me simply  say that I support their efforts to make sure we have paper ballot  backups, to make sure we have postelection audits, to make sure if the  Kremlin is paying for advertising on Facebook, they have the same kind  of disclosure requirements as if they advertise on FOX--commonsense  bipartisan proposals that, if they actually got to the floor of the  Senate, I bet we would get 80 votes. My hope is that we will have that  opportunity.   The truth is, the only person winning from our failure to act--and,  unfortunately, this person seems to be winning, as well, in Syria and  seems to be winning, as well, in terms of the split between America and  Ukraine--is Vladimir Putin.   Again, I appeal to my colleagues: Let's move forward on the first  step, protecting the integrity of our elections. Let's bring forward  the FIRE Act. Let's make absolutely clear that if a foreign government  tries to intervene in a Presidential election, the obligation is to  report to the FBI and not say thank you.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Rules Committee be  discharged from further consideration of S. 2242, the FIRE Act; that  the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration; that the bill be  read a third time and passed; and that the motion to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table, with no intervening action or  debate.    Mr. President, I would allow my colleague to speak on  this item. I say to my colleague from Tennessee, and others, that if  there are ways to improve this legislation, let's have at it. But the  notion that we are going into a Presidential election in which our  intelligence community has said that Russia and others will be back,  and we have taken no action to prevent that when there are commonsense  items from social media constraints to making clear the foreign  government shouldn't intervene, to having paper ballot backups, to  making sure we have appropriate campaign disclosure, we are shirking  our responsibility, and I hope in the future my colleagues will  reconsider.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I am here today because protections for  Americans with preexisting medical conditions are under attack from  this administration. For the last 3 years, this President has used  every tool at his disposal to try to undermine the ACA. He tried to  repeal it twice through Congress. When that failed, the administration  joined a lawsuit that would strike down the ACA with no plan to replace  it.   The truth is, this administration is, unfortunately, actively working  to destabilize the insurance market. One way the administration is  attempting to undermine the ACA is with the so-called ``short-term  plans,'' which I would refer to--and, frankly, I think most Americans  if they saw the criteria in these plans would not call them short-term  plans--and I would call them junk plans. Thanks to this administration,  these junk plans allow insurance companies to once again discriminate  against Americans with preexisting conditions.   Make no mistake, these plans are a threat to the stability of the  insurance market and to every American with a preexisting condition.  That is why I have introduced a resolution that will force an up-or- down vote on the administration's rule that pushes more of these junk  plans on unsuspecting consumers and, consequently, significantly  increases costs for other Americans.   I fear some Members of this body have forgotten what it was like  before the Affordable Care Act, when an unexpected surgery or a  diagnosis of a chronic illness could mean a one-way ticket out of the  middle class.   Unfortunately, this is not a hypothetical. Recently, one of my  constituents, a man named Jesse, received a $230,000 medical bill for  his back surgery. Unbeknownst to him, he had purchased a plan that he  thought would cover this, but this plan, unfortunately, was a junk plan  that considered his back injury as preexisting.   Jesse is one of the more than 3 million Virginians with a preexisting  medical condition.   I have three daughters. Two of my three daughters have preexisting  medical conditions that would not be covered under these junk plans.   Today I want to share some of those stories to remind my colleagues  of what real people will face if we allow the administration to  continue dismantling these protections that folks count on.   Recently I got an email from Linda in Warren County, VA. She is a  cancer survivor with multiple preexisting conditions. She wrote:         Due to the housing fallout in 2008, we lost our healthcare       coverage and I could no longer get health coverage because of       my cancer diagnosis.    Mindy from Henrico, around Richmond, is also a cancer survivor. She  writes:         Even though my cancer is in partial remission, I remain on       treatment for fear of the cancer returning again. As I       prepare for retirement, it scares me to think that this       cancer would be considered a pre-existing condition and I       could be denied healthcare or would be required to pay       through the nose for insurance.    Sharon in Norfolk told me about her struggle with behavioral health  issues. She wrote:         I am a functioning member of society, however that will not       last long if I lose this access to medical help. I went off       my medications in 2000 as I couldn't afford a doctor and       medication . . . and it was a very thin line between me and       homelessness.    Justine from Loudon County is worried that she could lose coverage  for her diabetes care. Here is her message for the Members of this  body:         What if you or a loved one was diagnosed with a ``pre-      existing condition?'' How would you feel about being denied       health coverage?    It is a good question that Justine asks, and that we should all ask  ourselves. As a father, as I mentioned, I have dealt with the scary  reality of having a child with juvenile diabetes and a child with  asthma, but I am also an extraordinarily lucky individual, and I knew  that because of the insurance and because I had the resources, they  would be taken care of. That is not the case for many of the 3 million  Virginians who have preexisting conditions or the countless tens of  millions of Americans.   Katherine in Blacksburg, VA, told me about her daughter who was  diagnosed at age 3 with juvenile diabetes. She wrote:         Until there is a cure for diabetes, I cannot imagine how       costly it would be for her to stay alive and manage her       health if there are limitations on coverage for people with       pre-existing conditions.    Katherine's daughter deserves access to healthcare just as much as my  daughter does.   I got a letter from a pharmacist in Abingdon, in far southwest  Virginia, named Michael. He treats diabetics every day, and he also  knows what it is like because he has lived with the disease for 38  years.   He writes:         Without insulin we will die. . . . If coverage for pre-      existing conditions goes away, you will see a large decline       in the health of type 1 diabetics, and more dependence upon       Medicaid.    This is not only somebody who has dealt with diabetes for 38 years,  but he is also a knowledgeable consumer. He is a pharmacist.   I have too many of these stories to share them all today, and I see  my friend, the Senator from Washington State. She and other of my  colleagues will be coming to the floor today and over the next few days  until we have a  [[Page S6083]]  chance to vote on this CRA, to share stories as well of what we will do  to Virginians, Washingtonians, Tennesseans, and Americans all across  this Nation if we go back to a time when we did not protect people with  preexisting conditions.   One or two more quick stories. James from Danville, VA, told me about  his 10 separate preexisting conditions. Lynn from Lynchburg is on three  separate medications due to a brain tumor. She could die if her  insurance coverage didn't cover those medications, and the list goes  on.   In closing, when we talk about preexisting conditions, we are talking  about people's lives. That is why we must pass the resolution I have  introduced to reverse the administration's harmful rule changes and  defend protections for folks with preexisting conditions.   I think virtually every one of my colleagues on both sides of the  aisle have said they absolutely want to protect folks with preexisting  conditions. Even for folks who otherwise completely don't agree with  the ACA, that is the one part of the ACA that folks have agreed upon.   Well, next week we are going to have a chance to move past talk, to  move past statements, to actually go on the record with an up-or-down  vote, to go on the record to say that we are going to protect  provisions of the ACA that made sure that folks with preexisting  conditions weren't discriminated against, or we will go on the record  saying: No, what the administration is doing is all right.   These short-term or junk plans sound good until you realize you are  not getting the kind of coverage that you thought you were buying. We  will have that decision point come next week.   I ask my colleagues across the aisle who believe and say they support  protections for folks with preexisting conditions, well, they will have  a chance to go on the record next week. I hope they will. I hope we  will pass overwhelmingly this CRA and make sure that protections for  folks with preexisting conditions are maintained.   I can't think of an issue that is more important to so many families  all across Virginia, and, for that matter, all across the country.   I yield the floor.
