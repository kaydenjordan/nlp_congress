 Mr. President, many of us are increasingly concerned that,  since President Trump's reckless decision to abandon the multilateral  nuclear agreement with Iran, which by all accounts Iran had been  complying with, the administration has been on a collision course that  could draw us into a war with Iran. Although the President insists that  is not what he wants, he is known to change his mind on a whim, and the  statements and actions of others in his administration, including some  who were vocal proponents of the unnecessary and costly war in Iraq,  leave little doubt that they favor a policy of regime change.   We all deplore Iran's support for terrorism, its ballistic missile  program, its horrific violations of human rights, and its constant  outpouring of hateful  [[Page S3042]]  anti-American, anti-Israel rhetoric, but a war with Iran would be far  worse, and no one can be certain how it would end. As tensions  increase, a misunderstanding or provocative act by either Iran or the  United States could quickly trigger retaliatory strikes that spiral out  of control, drawing us, our allies, and our adversaries into protracted  hostilities. Rather than risk that potentially disastrous result, the  administration should be partnering with our European and Middle  Eastern allies on a strategy of negotiations to reduce regional  tensions. In that regard, I ask unanimous consent that a recent op-ed  in ``The Guardian'' by Peter Westmacott, former British Ambassador to  the United States, be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                     [From the Guardian, May 21, 2019]          To Defuse This Crisis the US Must Start Talking to Iran                           (By Peter Westmacott)         As Washington raises the stakes, the risk of a       misunderstanding is high--and it could lead to a new conflict       in the Middle East.        Washington's foreign policy hawks--and by extension for the       rest of us. Donald Trump says he doesn't want a war with       Iran, but his national security adviser, JJohn Bolton, has       despatched warships and bombers to the region while the US       secretary of state Mike Pompeo has been sharing worrying       intelligence about Iranian intentions with close allies and       congressional leaders.        What's going on? It's now a year since Trump tore up the       nuclear deal with Iran negotiated in 2015 by the Obama       administration along with Britain, France, Germany, Russia,       China and the EU. Since then, egged on by Israel and the Gulf       states, he has announced new sanctions, despite Iran's full       compliance with the terms of the deal, and tried bullying the       Europeans and others into applying US sanctions in order to       deny Iranians the economic benefits they were promised.        After a year of waiting to see if the other signatories       would make the deal work without US cooperation, the Iranians       announced earlier this month that they would no longer fully       comply with the uranium and heavy water restrictions of the       agreement--and that, unless the Europeans could help with oil       and banking within 60 days, more drastic measures would       follow. Western governments sometimes forget that the Iranian       government is not a monolithic entity, and that the officials       they are used to dealing with, such as president Hassan       Rouhani and foreign minister Javad Zarif, are under constant       pressure from hardliners who point to the lack of any return       on the investment Iran made four years ago.        Since Trump pulled the plug, the Europeans have been       working on a scheme to allow some forms of trade with Iran to       continue independently of the US. Its effects have been       limited, leading the supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, to       convince himself--wrongly--that the Europeans were only ever       playing good cop to Washington's bad cop. As US sanctions       continue to damage the Iranian economy, Trump says he is       still interested in some kind of grand bargain. Tehran should       call me, the president says, perhaps not realising that there       would be huge political consequences for anyone who did.        But outside the US, the impression has grown that the hawks       in the Trump administration are more interested in regime       change than in policy change--and by military action if       necessary. There are shades here of Iraq 2003, when the       George W Bush administration was desperate to prove that       Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. It is       nonsense to claim, as Pompeo did last month, that ``there is       a connection between the Islamic Republic of Iran and al-      Qaida. Period. Full stop''. Al-Qaida's roots are in Sunni,       Wahhabist Saudi Arabia, and it hates Shia Iran almost as much       as it hates the US and its allies.        The Europeans have never disagreed about the nature or       extent of Iran's destabilising activity in the region. But       they don't buy the regime change argument, knowing from       experience that outside pressure is more likely to strengthen       rather than weaken the hardliners. They also still believe       that the best way to prevent Iran acquiring nuclear weapons       is to stick with the deal.        There is now a real risk of the world finding itself with       another Middle Eastern conflict on its hands, by accident or       miscalculation. What can be done? As many of us have been       saying to Iranian officials for some time, they should help       others to stand up for the nuclear deal by moderating Iran's       behaviour in the region: stop supplying sophisticated       weaponry to Hezbollah in Lebanon; and stop supplying missiles       to the Houthi militia in Yemen that perpetuate the horrific       civil war. Iran could use its influence over President Bashar       al-Assad to press him to avoid further bloodshed in Syria.       And it could end the imprisonment and abuse of dual nationals       and other Iranian citizens on specious grounds.        Some suggest that current tensions may be partly the result       of misunderstandings between Tehran and Washington. That       wouldn't be surprising, given the long history of distrust       and the absence of diplomatic relations between the two       countries for 4o years. But it serves as a reminder that some       form of direct communication is essential: both sides should       move quickly to activate private channels.        Back in 1987--when the UN security council was trying to       stop the Iran-Iraq war Saddam had started (with western       encouragement) seven years earlier--the council passed a       resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire and a       withdrawal to international borders. It didn't manage to stop       Saddam launching another, ultimately unsuccessful offensive.       But tucked away in paragraph eight was a request to the       secretary general ``to examine, in consultation with Iran and       Iraq and with other states in the region, measures to enhance       the security of the region''.        That resolution is still valid. Why not look again at the       idea of all the regional powers, under UN auspices, coming       together with a view to lowering tensions? A recent OpEd in       the New York Times by Abdulaziz Sager, a Saudi Arabian       academic, and Hussein Moussavian, a former Iranian nuclear       negotiator, argues that the time for the region's two big       rivals to sit down and try to bury the hatchet might just       might have come. So much is at stake that it's surely worth a       try.                            ____________________     Mr. President, it has been nearly a decade since Justice  John Paul Stevens retired from the Supreme Court. His absence on the  bench is perhaps felt more now than ever. Justice Stevens' nomination  was the first of 18 Supreme Court nominees I have considered in my  years in the Senate. As a young Senator, it was a privilege to support  his confirmation in 1975. It was a vote I have long been proud of.  Justice Stevens had a storied tenure on the Supreme Court and  ultimately became the third longest serving Justice in our Nation's  history.   Justice Stevens' commitment to the law and conduct on the bench was  beyond reproach. His legacy is one of integrity, dedication to public  service, and a recognition that the Constitution protects all Americans  equally. He was part of majorities that protected LGBT rights,  disability rights, and limited the death penalty.   The Supreme Court has never been perfect. Justice Stevens would be  the first to acknowledge as much, but I cannot help but compare his  many years on the Court with today. Today, the Supreme Court almost  reflexively sides with corporate interests over individuals' interests,  even when precedent or so-called textualism and originalism stand in  the way. We have also seen an unprecedented blockade of a Supreme Court  nominee, and we have a President intent on nominating the most  ideological nominees to the bench I have ever seen, nominees who have  been preapproved by opaque far-right special interest groups. Many of  these nominees have long records of outright hostility toward  reproductive rights, environmental protections, and voting and civil  rights. They even refuse to accept that Brown v. Board of Education, a  foundational civil rights decision settled 65 years ago, is indeed  settled law. It is equally predictable and deeply unfortunate that  Americans increasingly view the courts as a purely political  institution.   Our Constitution and laws are intended to serve the people,  protecting the freedom of individuals from the tyranny of government  and helping to organize our society for the good of all. It is up to  the judiciary to ensure our laws have meaning. This is a duty Justice  Stevens' recognized and relished.   How I miss his jurisprudence, his steady voice, and his leadership.   I ask unanimous consent that a May 11, 2019, feature by Robert Barnes  from The Washington Post entitled, ``John Paul Stevens looks back on  nearly a century of life and law, but worries about the future,'' be  included in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                  [From the Washington Post, May 11, 2019]   John Paul Stevens Looks Back on Nearly a Century of Life and Law, But                          Worries About the Future                             (By Robert Barnes)         Fort Lauderdale, FL.--John Paul Stevens spent more than a       third of his near-century on Earth at the Supreme Court,       where he often was on a different page from a majority of his       fellow justices.        ``It happens so often that you have to get used to       losing,'' Stevens, 99, said during an interview this last       week at his condominium here, just steps from the Atlantic       Ocean. ``My batting average was probably pretty low.''  [[Page S3043]]         But one particular loss lingers and, Stevens says, brings       grim reminders almost weekly: the court's 2008 decision in       District of Columbia v. Heller, which found the Second       Amendment protects a right to individual gun ownership       unrelated to possible military service.        ``Unquestionably the most clearly incorrect decision that       the Court announced during my tenure on the bench,'' Stevens       writes in his new memoir, ``The Making of a Justice.''        Heller and the Second Amendment, Stevens said in the       interview, produce ``such disastrous practical effects. I       think there's no need for all the guns we have in the country       and if I could get rid of one thing it would be to get rid of       that whole gun climate.''        He continued: ``Just the other day there was another school       shooting in Colorado, and every time it happens, it seems to       me we don't have to have this kind of thing in this country,       and we should do everything we can to try to change it.''        Stevens writes of his efforts to try to make the 5-to-4       decision come out the other way. His 531-page book, to be       published Tuesday, details the life and career of a World War       II Navy code-breaker from a solidly Republican family,       nominated to the federal bench by one GOP president (Richard       M. Nixon) and elevated to the Supreme Court by another       (Gerald R. Ford) who retired in 2010 as the court's most       outspoken liberal. Although, Stevens believes the court       changed more than he did.        In the interview, he expressed generalized distress at the       state of the world and the nation's politics. ``You wake up       in the morning and you wonder what's happened,'' he said.       Still, he retains a judge's reticence even years after       leaving the bench: ``But I shouldn't say more.''        He does wonder why it is so challenging for his former       colleagues to recognize that partisan gerrymandering is a       constitutional violation, as they do with racial       gerrymandering. ``It's the same issue,'' he said. ``Public       officials, including state legislators, have a duty to act       impartially. The whole point [of partisan gerrymandering] is       to create an unfair result.''        And he expressed surprise about Chief Justice John G.       Roberts Jr., whom he respects and admires. ``I must confess       he's more conservative than I realized,'' Stevens said. ``But       that doesn't go to his quality as a chief justice.''        During the interview, Stevens was preparing for a reunion       of his clerks--more than 90 of 125 were expected to attend.       He must steady himself with a walker, but he remains active.       Tennis has been replaced by ping-pong, he said, but he still       plays nine holes of golf each week.        ``I don't go in the ocean as much as I used to, and that's       really my favorite activity down here,'' he said. ``A strong       guy'' to help him in and out of the surf is now ``an absolute       necessity,'' he said.        It is hard to imagine that at his 1975 confirmation       hearing, soon after he became one of the first to receive a       heart bypass operation, the main obstacle was ``did I have a       sufficient life expectancy to justify the important       appointment,'' he writes. He was approved unanimously. The       memoir is a tale of a privileged childhood in Chicago, the       ravages of the Great Depression and a family scandal, service       as a wartime cryptologist and a charmed legal career as a       Supreme Court clerk, appeals court judge and the third-      longest-serving justice in the court's history.        Stevens was in the stands at Wrigley Field in Chicago when       Babe Ruth called his shot in the 1932 World Series--``my most       important claim to fame,'' he writes--and in the audience at       the Democratic National Convention that summer when Franklin       D. Roosevelt explained the New Deal on his way to becoming       president. His father, Ernest, who took Stevens to the       speech, was a Warren Harding Republican, however.        Amelia Earhart told him he was out too late for a school       night when she attended the grand opening of the Stevens       Hotel in Chicago, at the time the largest in the world.       Charles Lindbergh passed along a caged dove someone had given       him. On a trip to the South, Stevens and his family attended       ``Gone With The Wind'' the week it in opened in Atlanta.        The invitations that come to a Supreme Court justice       provide other celebrity tidbits. He was as smitten as others       when he met Princess Diana, and an encounter with the       composer and conductor Leonard Bernstein provides a       surprisingly bawdy anecdote from the mannerly Stevens, who       often prefaced his questions on the bench with a courtly,       ``May I just ask . . . ?''        It was during a dinner at the French Embassy in Washington       when Stevens and his wife, Maryan, were seated with       Bernstein, who had just conducted the Orchestre National de       France at the Kennedy Center. Maryan wondered about the       emotions that accompany performing a masterpiece.        ``It's like [making love] in a cathedral,'' Bernstein       replied, according to Stevens in the memoir. The justice       dutifully used the f-word to authenticate his reporting.        ``The Making of a Justice'' is Stevens's third book since       leaving the court; the others chronicle the chief justices       with whom he served and how he would remake the Constitution.       He said he is unsure if there is a lesson in it for readers.       ``I didn't have a specific mission in mind, I just started to       write,'' he said.        One lesson from childhood that informed his career, though,       involved his father. The Depression hit after the Stevens       Hotel opened, and the place faltered. The hotel borrowed       money from an insurance company controlled by Stevens's       grandfather, an act that a Cook County prosecutor viewed as       embezzlement. Ernest Stevens was found guilty, only to have       his conviction overturned by the Illinois Supreme Court,       which found not a ``scintilla'' of evidence of criminal       intent.        ``Firsthand knowledge of the criminal justice's       fallibility'' made Stevens skeptical for the rest of his       career, he said. ``The system is not perfect--it's pretty       good, but it's not perfect''        Stevens was part of majorities that handed important       victories to gays, limited the death penalty and mostly held       the line on abortion rights.        On the latter, he said he is puzzled by ``more and more       state legislatures'' passing restrictive laws in hopes of       getting the Supreme Court to revisit the court's rulings.        ``I thought that was an issue that had been resolved,'' he       said. ``I have no idea what the present court will do.''        In the book, he detailed his efforts to derail the Heller       majority. He adopted Justice Antonin Scalia's originalist       approach to show, in his opinion, that historical texts       supported the view that the Second Amendment was aimed at       preventing federal disarmament of state militias, rather than       forbidding efforts at gun control.        He wrote that he circulated his dissent five weeks before       Scalia's majority opinion, in hopes of persuading Justice       Anthony M. Kennedy and--somewhat surprisingly--Justice       Clarence Thomas.        ``I think he's an intellectually honest person, and I just       thought there was a chance he might be persuaded'' on the       historical arguments, Stevens said of Thomas. ``I guess I was       kind of dreaming a little bit.''        But Stevens said the effort did succeed in getting Kennedy       to insist Scalia include limiting language that states and       cities have used to defend their gun-control measures.        In the book, Stevens refers to U.S. v. Nixon, in which the       court said the president must turn over White House tapes to       congressional investigators, as ``the high point for judicial       independence.''        He wrote the court's unanimous decision in Clinton v.       Jones, saying that a sitting president does not have immunity       from all civil lawsuits for actions when he was not in       office.        Both were unanimous and ``easy decisions,'' Stevens said,       but he declined to be drawn into the current battle between       congressional investigators and President Trump.        He is asked: Nothing to say about the president? ``Nothing       that you don't know already,'' he said.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I pay tribute to a wonderful friend,  Bishop Thomas C. Ely, who is retiring from his leadership position of  the Episcopal Diocese of Vermont.   Bishop Ely has been an outstanding servant of the Vermont diocese  since his consecration as bishop in 2001. During his tenure in the  Green Mountain State, he has served as the leader of the 45 Episcopal  congregations in Vermont and one more across Lake Champlain in Essex,  NY. He has visited all parishes once a year and counseled many clergy  members. Bishop Ely's devotion to human dignity and dignity education  influenced every church in the diocese. He demonstrated this as  chairman of the board and as an educator of Rock Point School in  Burlington, where his wife Ann worked all through his tenure as bishop.  Bishop Ely, as a promoter of social justice and equality, also showed  leadership in many other ways. He has been active in immigrants'  rights, marriage equality, improving the lives of those living in  poverty and in Bishops Against Gun Violence. His work on human rights  is illustrated in his long commitment to the human rights organization  Cristosal, which works in Central America.   Recently, Bishop Ely completed the successful Partnership Campaign  for Rock Point, raising over $2 million to assure the future of the 130  acres owned by the Church on Lake Champlain in Burlington. The funds  will improve the trails and facilities in partnership with the city of  Burlington and the Lake Champlain Land Trust, preserving 93 acres for  public access.   I am proud to say that Bishop Ely lives his faith, through worship,  leadership, and through action to improve and enrich the lives of all  Vermonters. His journey of faith and action would not have been  possible without the love and support of Ann Ely who, in addition to  her work at Rock Point School, has also been deeply involved in St.  Paul's Cathedral in Burlington.  [[Page S3044]]    The outpouring of gratitude and love for Tom and Ann has been  enormous, in particular at the May 18, 2019, convention, where Vermont  Episcopalians elected their next bishop. The applause would not cease  until Bishop Ely motioned for quiet, so that proceedings could  continue. Bishop Ely is loved by his people and greatly appreciated by  many Vermonters for his principled leadership. He made a difference,  helping us to live up to our ideals, and will be fondly remembered, as  he and Ann enter a new phase of their lives. Marcelle and I are  delighted that Tom and Ann will continue to be citizens of Vermont,  living in the beautiful town of Newfane. We both value their  friendship.   In honor of Bishop Ely's retirement, I ask that the December 5, 2017,  Episcopal New Service article ``Vermont Episcopal Bishop Thomas Ely  announces plans to retire,'' be entered into the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:              [From the Episcopal News Service, Dec. 5, 2017]        Vermont Episcopal Bishop Thomas Ely Announces Plan to Retire         The Right Reverend Thomas C. Ely, tenth bishop of the       Episcopal Diocese of Vermont, recently announced his       intention to retire and resign his ministry, no later than       September 30, 2019. He has agreed to remain in his position       until a successor is chosen and is in place.        Ely, 65, was consecrated as bishop of the Vermont diocese       in 2001, having previously served as a priest in the Diocese       of Connecticut for 20 years. In a message to the people of       the Diocese of Vermont, Ely said that by the time of his       retirement he will have served in the priesthood for nearly       39 years.        ``There are other interests and ministries to which I am       feeling called to devote my time and energy while my health       and stamina are still good,'' Ely said, ``including family,       community theatre, various justice ministries and a bit more       golf.''        During his episcopate, Ely has been a leader both within       the diocese and throughout the wider Episcopal Church on such       controversial issues as marriage equality, the ordination of       LGBT clergy, increased gun safety and racial justice. He is       also a leading voice on matters of environmental and economic       justice.        As part of his global outreach, Ely serves on the board of       Cristosal, a nongovernmental agency based in El Salvador that       works to advance human rights in Central America.       Additionally, he is a co-founder of the Vermont chapter of       Kids4Peace, a grassroots interfaith youth movement dedicated       to ending conflict and inspiring hope in Jerusalem and       divided societies around the world. More locally, Ely is a       leading advocate for the Vermont Ecumenical Council and       Vermont Interfaith Action.        Ely has been instrumental in the stewardship and       revitalization of Rock Point, a 130-acre property in       Burlington, owned by the Vermont diocese, known for its       natural beauty and peaceful atmosphere. Each year, nearly       10,000 people visit Rock Point, and Ely is overseeing a $1.7       million partnership campaign aimed at improving facilities,       strengthening leadership and expanding public access.        Ely said that he and his wife, Ann, will take up residence       in their house in Newfane, Vermont, upon his retirement. In       the meantime, he says, ``I plan to use these months ahead to       continue encouraging full and passionate engagement in our       local mission approaches, and I plan to continue my efforts       related to a sustainable Rock Point and all that means to our       life as the Episcopal Church in Vermont.''                            ____________________     Mr. President, Darn Tough Vermont says that their factory  in Northfield, Vermont, is the ``Sock Capital of the World.'' I'm loath  to object to that claim. Over the past 15 years, Darn Tough has  steadily grown from a small sock producer for other companies into a  world-renowned brand of their own. They've created good paying jobs to  Vermont and have a deep commitment to American manufacturing. Darn  Tough is a great example of the many hearty small businesses that drive  Vermont's economy. It is with pride that I recognize their  achievements.   Marc Cabot opened Darn Tough's factory, Cabot Hosiery Mills, in 1978.  He started by producing private label socks--other companies sell these  under their brand name--for large companies like Brooks Brothers and  Old Navy. This was a steady business. But things became difficult in  the 1990s when many of those customers began to move their production  overseas. By the early 2000s, Cabot Hosiery Mills was struggling.   Marc's son, Ric, who had been involved in the family business from a  young age, came up with an idea to save the company. He decided to  transition Cabot Hosiery Mills from a private label producer to its own  brand: Darn Tough Vermont. Ric envisioned a superior, outdoor-oriented  sock that was knit right in Vermont. Its quality would speak for  itself.   At first, Ric had to give Darn Tough socks away to get noticed. He  gave out 3,500 pairs of Darn Tough socks at the Vermont City Marathon  in 2004, and soon after word, began to spread about a mysteriously  durable sock with a lifetime warranty produced right in Vermont. Darn  Tough's brand and sales have been growing steadily ever since.   Over the past 15 years, the Cabots have rebounded from the brink of  bankruptcy to a company nearing $50 million in sales annually. Ric, who  is now the CEO and president, is leading Darn Tough in its latest  expansion. They've added over 50 new knitting stations and are in the  process of expanding their workforce of over 250 Vermonters. Darn Tough  doubled down on American manufacturing when their partners wouldn't-- now they're seeing their reward.   I am proud to recognize the contributions and achievements that Darn  Tough and the Cabot family has made over their over 40 years in  Vermont. I ask consent to enter into the Record a VTDigger article  titled ``Making it in Vermont: Darn Tough doubles down on Northfield  facilities.'' It describes the hard work that goes into making each  Darn Tough sock and highlights Darn Tough's commitment to Vermont and  Vermont values.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                      [From VTDigger, March 31, 2019]   Making It in Vermont: Darn Tough Doubles Down on Northfield Facilities         Ask Kirk Smith how many colors of yarn are used at Cabot       Hosiery Mills, and he'll tell you: ``Too many.''        The family-owned factory that produces Darn Tough socks       will include up to 16 different threads in a single design.       The operation spins out 22,000 pairs of socks every single       day.        From the outside, the Northfield production facility isn't       much to look at--it's big, beige and unmarked. But inside,       thousands of spools of multicolored yarn hang from the       ceiling, while computerized machines knit the threads into       socks.        ``If you had seen me when they took me on my tour when I       was being interviewed here, I was like a kid in a candy       shop,'' said Smith, the plant's manager of manufacturing       operations. ``I didn't want to leave the line. I just wanted       to keep seeing what was going on.''        Lined up in rows with their electronic displays blinking,       the mill's 184 knitting stations resemble slot machines at a       casino. But they have a more predictable output: roughly       every five minutes, each one dispenses a fresh new sock.        Darn Tough is in the midst of an ambitious five-year       expansion plan. In order to increase production, they're       adding more machines, bringing their total to 236--for now.       Ric Cabot, the company's president and CEO, said those       machines will increase the mill's production by 1.5 million       pairs of socks per year.        ``Accommodating the new equipment required moving their       packaging and distribution areas to another building about a       mile down the road. That means the company's annual ``sock       sale''--two weekends in November when locals walk the       warehouse looking for deals on factory seconds--will take       place at the company's satellite location this year.        There are two sock seasons each year, and the factory works       about six months ahead of schedule. Right now, they're mainly       producing fall socks.        Each piece is knit, washed, dried, boarded, folded,       inspected and packaged in Northfield, before being shipped       off to the company's distribution center in Cleveland, Ohio.        ``The Cabots have always been very dedicated to their       Northfield roots,'' Smith said. ``Could there be better       places in the state? Maybe, but this is where they started.       This is where they have a connection and this is where we'll       be.''                            ____________________
