 Madam Speaker, public transportation that everyone can  access is a critical, long-term investment in our communities.   The bipartisan infrastructure law is the largest Federal investment  ever in safe, healthy, and sustainable transit options for millions of  Americans, options like Pace bus that keep seniors and our neighbors in  my community in northern Illinois connected.   Not only will the bipartisan infrastructure law continue record job  growth by adding millions more good-paying union jobs; it invests $4.5  billion in Illinois for critical upgrades and repairs to aging transit  infrastructure.   Last week, I visited the Crystal Lake Metra station to highlight the  difference this money will make for us at home. Now, Metra can invest  in upgrading ADA accessibility and replacing decades-old railcars with  cleaner alternatives.   I am proud to work with the Biden-Harris administration to improve,  modernize, and expand our public transportation infrastructure.                            ____________________
