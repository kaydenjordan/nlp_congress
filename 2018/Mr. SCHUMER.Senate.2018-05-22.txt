 Mr. President, first let me thank my friend from Georgia  for being able to go first and also thank my friend from Illinois, who  has been passionate, strong, and effective when it comes to these for- profit colleges. He laid out a strong case.   Let me just make one more point which sometimes my colleagues on the  other side of the aisle and the Trump administration and Ms. DeVos seem  to forget. Who loses money when these for-profits take advantage of the  kids? The Federal taxpayers do because the vast majority, the  overwhelming percentage of funds that go to these for-profit colleges  are from Federal student loans. So this is a waste of taxpayer money.  Somehow our Republican colleagues--not all but some--and the Trump  administration are willing to have the Treasury basically, in certain  ways, be looted. They shrug their shoulders and let the for-profits  keep doing it. It is an amazing contradiction. So I thank my colleague  Senator Durbin.
