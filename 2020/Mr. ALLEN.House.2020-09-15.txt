 Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Foxx for yielding. I  appreciate the opportunity to address this issue today.   I rise in opposition to H.R. 2639, and I oppose it because I believe  every child should have access to a good education. I have long  advocated for the need to expand choice to each student so that they  have the opportunity to live out the American Dream regardless of their  ZIP Code or family resources. In fact, we talked about this very thing  on the steps of the Capitol this morning.   H.R. 2639 is a partisan proposal that would impose a top-down, Big  Government solution--that is the problem--allowing the Federal  Government to decide how best to address the issues of racial and  socioeconomic isolation in America's schools.   Unfortunately, this debate is not about equality for all children. If  it were, we would have ensured no State had the ability to trap  students in low-performing schools.   Rather than bring a bill to the House floor that would expand the  availability of charter schools or offer families educational freedom,  Democrats have decided the teachers unions are more important to them  than real families who are desperate for access to a better education  for their children.   Additionally, this partisan proposal would create another Federal  program while ignoring existing priorities.   During committee markup, I offered a substitute amendment to the bill  that would have expanded the Student Support and Academic Enrichment  Grants, or SSAEG, in the Every Student Succeeds Act to allow school  districts to use funds to reduce or eliminate racial or socioeconomic  isolation in schools.   The SSAEG were authorized on a bipartisan basis to give school  districts flexible funding to address local needs and receive $1.21  billion in fiscal year 2020 appropriated funds.    Mr. Speaker, unfortunately, committee Democrats rejected  my amendment and chose to push forward a partisan bill that would only  result in another broken promise from the Federal Government.   Instead of working in a bipartisan, bicameral fashion to implement a  commonsense solution, Democrats are once again choosing partisan  political messaging over sound policy.   It has been a tough year, especially on families who have had to  adapt to learning in the age of coronavirus. So, let's have a real  conversation on how we can best serve our students and families by  working to expand choice.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this partisan bill before  it is too late.    Mr. Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Speaker, I have got to be frank for a minute. I find  it a shame that this amendment is even necessary.   When we replaced the No Child Left Behind Act with the Every Student  Succeeds Act, we created the Student Support and Academic Enrichment  Grants program on a bipartisan, bicameral basis. We did this to provide  school districts the flexibility they need to use Federal funds as they  see fit to meet local needs.   It is disappointing that my Democratic colleagues didn't invite  Republicans to the table to negotiate in good faith to build on that  consensus. Instead, Democrats once again ignored commonsense approaches  and impose a top-down, Big Government solution that will have the  Federal Government decide how best to address the issues of racial and  socioeconomic isolation in American schools.                                time  1415    You know, we have heard story after story of the history of our  schools and how we got to this point. The question is, will we continue  with this top-down government approach or allow the  [[Page H4409]]  schools the flexibility to fix this problem.   My amendment, on the other hand, offers a commonsense solution that  could easily garner an overwhelming majority of votes in this body if  every Member chose to focus on the importance of actually addressing  racial and socioeconomic isolation in schools and not on scoring  political points.   This amendment would explicitly allow school districts to use funds  they receive from the Student Support and Academic Enrichment Grants  program under the Every Student Succeeds Act to develop or implement  comprehensive strategies to improve diversity and reduce or eliminate  racial or socioeconomic isolation in public early childhood programs  and public schools.   This is a real solution. The SSAEG block grant is currently receiving  just over $1 billion. The proposal before us today would have to fight  for funding with the multitude of other Federal programs that currently  exist.   This amendment also ensures that school districts are engaging with  their communities to design programs that comply with Federal law and  have the support of parents and other constituents. It also alters  requirements to distribute funds across multiple spending categories so  that districts will have sufficient funding to design effective  integration programs.   The amendment uses the same language as the Magnet Schools Assistance  Program under the Every School Succeeds Act to ensure that school  districts choosing to use funds for improving diversity can fund  transportation activities, if they see fit.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support this amendment, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  North Carolina (Ms. Foxx).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, it is a shame that we even have to offer this amendment.  We have got a problem, but I can tell you, my community solved this  problem, which is the reason I ran for Congress.   The faith-based community created a school for kids who are branded  as losers in the public education system, and these moms don't have but  one choice, and that is to send these children to this school. And it  is amazing how kids who are branded as losers have become the most  outstanding students in Richmond County.   We keep talking about fixing these things and, like I said earlier,  we continue to offer solutions, but we continue with the same problem.  There is a way to fix this. This is a start. Rather than create a new  program we know will be underfunded that will benefit, at best, a small  handful of school districts, my amendment would ensure that nearly  every school district in this country would have Federal funds  available to improve diversity and reduce or eliminate racial or  socioeconomic isolation in schools.   I urge the majority to put the students and families and educators my  amendment would benefit before their political interest and take  ``yes'' for an answer.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
