 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the life and  legacy of Dr. Nicholas Balabkins of Bethlehem, Pennsylvania.   Dr. Balabkins was born in 1926 in Latvia and immigrated to the United  States after World War II where he received his master's and doctorate  degrees in economics.   For decades, Dr. Balabkins was a staple of the Lehigh University  community, known for his ready smile and colorful bow ties and  recognized by awards for his teaching excellence.   He wrote a dozen books and published over 40 professional economics  articles, earning worldwide recognition for his work.   Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, Dr. Balabkins received  the highest civilian honor from his home country of Latvia: Order of  the Three Stars.   Dr. Balabkins will be remembered as an extraordinary professor,  neighbor, colleague, and friend. We honor his lifelong dedication to  shaping the lives of the students who were lucky enough to pass through  his classroom.                            ____________________
