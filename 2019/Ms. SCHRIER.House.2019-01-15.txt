 Madam Speaker, I want to applaud my colleagues,  especially Mr. Engel and Mr. McCaul, for sending a strong message with  a vote on H.R. 221, the Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Anti- Semitism Act.   Jewish people enjoy freedom, acceptance, and assimilation in this  country like we never have before. Sadly, in recent years, there has  been a disturbing uptick in anti-Semitic rhetoric and acts both in the  U.S. and Europe.   In the context of rising intolerance, hatred, and xenophobia in our  country, we are witnessing emboldened normalization of anti-Semitic  language and behavior. This includes anti-Semitic propaganda targeting  many of us new Members of Congress. The tragic shooting at Tree of Life  Synagogue in Pittsburgh was the deadliest attack on Jews in our  Nation's history.   Bigotry is not unique to the Jewish community. What is, however, is  that we don't have anyone monitoring and responding to the uptick in  anti-Semitic acts and rhetoric.   This bill elevates the State Department's top position to that of  Ambassador, reporting directly to the Secretary of State. The stature  of this position sends the strong message that we are committed to  combating anti-Semitism here and abroad.   As a Jewish woman, anti-Semitism is personal for me, but we need to  understand this in the context of the larger issues of intolerance and  White nationalism that are gaining traction in our country right now.   No minority is safe when any minority is targeted. We should all be  on high alert when Muslims, Blacks, Latinos, and immigrants are cast as  ``the other,'' scapegoated, and dehumanized. We cannot sit idly by  while people are targeted for how they dress, how they look, or how  they choose to worship.   I ask my counterparts in the Senate to pass this bipartisan bill.  Let's show the world that America takes this issue seriously and that  hate has no place here.                            ____________________
