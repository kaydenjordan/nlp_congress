 Mr. Chair, I am proud to come to the floor today to  discuss an amendment to H.R. 840, the Veterans' Access to Child Care  Act, that I have cosponsored with my colleague, Representative Susie  Lee from Nevada.   The Veterans' Access to Child Care Act will provide veterans who need  to attend regular or intensive mental healthcare appointments with no- cost childcare during their appointments. Our amendment will make sure  these childcare services are covered at our local VA clinics, such as  the one in my district in Peoria, Arizona, along with the main VA  facilities.   No veteran seeking these types of mental health services should be  left behind. It is our responsibility to ensure that, under this  legislation, all our eligible veterans who need mental health services  are able to go to a facility operated by the VA Department, even if it  is located separately from the VA's general healthcare facility.   My home State of Arizona is blessed to be home to so many of our  Nation's veterans. In fact, I have 70,000 veterans in my district  alone. However, it deeply troubles me that veteran suicide rates are 9  percentage points higher in Arizona than the national average.   Expensive childcare should not hinder Arizona's returning veterans  the ability to access needed mental healthcare or other prolonged  service-connected disability care needs.   We need to do everything we can do to help our Nation's greatest  heroes. They risked it all for us. It is inexcusable for us, after our  veterans have given so much to defend our freedoms, to permit policies  that don't give them the best resources to recover and heal. We relied  on them to protect us; now we must step up and help them.   I thank Representatives Brownley and Roe for their work on this  legislation, and Representative Lee for her effort on this much-needed  amendment.   I urge all of my colleagues to support this amendment to give  eligible veterans choice and access.
