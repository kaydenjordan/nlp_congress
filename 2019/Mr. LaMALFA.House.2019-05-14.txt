 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize National Police  Week.   Thousands of police officers from around the country are in  Washington, D.C., this week, and I want to welcome them with the  recognition and appreciation they deserve and that they don't always  receive these days.   I thank the Capitol Police officers, Officers David Bailey and  Crystal Griner, who saved many of my colleagues' lives less than 2  years ago when they took down an armed gunman at that baseball practice  that we so famously heard about.   I am very thankful for our officers that we have in northern  California, many who have had to work around the clock with some of the  disasters we have had in recent years with the dam and the fires, who  really helped make an orderly situation out of a lot of chaos.   Nationally, I hate to have to relate these statistics, but 163 police  officers died in the line of duty last year, 52 from gunfire. Any  number greater than zero is unacceptable.   In California, we lost 11 officers in 2018. This year, we tragically  lost 22-year-old Davis Police Officer Natalie Corona, one of the most  heartbreaking ones you might ever see. She was following in her  father's footsteps, who was an officer for a long time in Colusa  County.   Indeed, these men and women know it is a higher calling, a higher,  24-hour duty that they answer to for all of our safety. We appreciate  them. We love them, and let's always be sure we remember to show them  that.                            ____________________
