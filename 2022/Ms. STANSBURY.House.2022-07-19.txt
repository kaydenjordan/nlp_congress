 Mr. Speaker, it is hard to believe that in the year  2022, I rise to defend the right to access contraception. That is  right, contraception.   Why? Because we have a renegade Supreme Court that has overturned a  half century of settled law, stripping away our fundamental  reproductive rights, and made it clear that they plan to not stop  there.   In fact, Justice Thomas' concurring opinion in Dobbs makes it clear  that the Supreme Court has its sights on overturning longstanding  precedents that guarantee the right to access contraception and protect  the right to same-sex marriage, which we just voted on.   These are basic human rights: the right to marry, the right to love  who you love, the right to control your own body, the right to control  your own health, the right to control your own family decisions, and  your right to protect your own privacy.   Let me say it loud, and let me say it clear: We will not go back.   My great-grandmother was born in this country before she had the  right to vote. My mother was a machine operator and entrepreneur. I  stand here today as your Congresswoman and your committed Congresswoman  to say we will not go back. These are our bodies, our rights, and we  will continue to fight to protect them.                            ____________________
