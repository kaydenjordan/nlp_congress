 Mr. President, I have known and admired Thad Cochran for  40 years--since he first came to the Senate. At the time, I was a young  staffer for Senator Bill Cohen, who also was elected to the Senate that  same year.   I saw from the start that this gentleman from Mississippi was so  bright, insightful, and creative yet also humble, kind, and devoted to  helping others. He treated everyone with such dignity. He was nice to  everyone, from the elevator operators to the highest officials around  the world. He truly is one who leads by example.   Those qualities are his legacy, and I have seen them time and again  as a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee when Thad was an  important member and, of course, when he became the chairman.  [[Page S1896]]    Last year was the 150th anniversary of the creation of the  Appropriations Committee, and Thad marked that occasion by reminding  all of us of our great responsibility to make thoughtful and informed  decisions in the allocation of public funds. In managing appropriations  bills, he was always so inclusive, willing to incorporate ideas and  priorities from everyone who could make a persuasive case. The fact is,  Thad has always placed careful consideration and compromise above  partisan politics. That really reflects how Thad has led his life.   He has excelled at everything he has ever undertaken. When he joined  the Boy Scouts, he became an Eagle Scout. In his high school, he was  valedictorian. In college, he had the highest scholastic achievements.  He excelled in serving in the Navy, and, of course, we know how much he  has accomplished as our esteemed and dear colleague here in the Senate.   When Thad served as chairman of the Appropriations Agriculture  Subcommittee, he traveled to the State of Maine with me, and we met  with Maine's potato farmers and blueberry growers--not exactly staple  crops of Mississippi. Thad listened intently to these farmers and  growers. It was clear that he cared about them and that he valued our  family farms and our rural communities.   That night, we had a lovely Maine lobster dinner at an inn on the  coast. During that dinner, Thad shared with me his passion for good  literature, his love of music, and his passion for education that had  been instilled in him by his parents.   Of course, another issue that brought Thad and me together was making  sure that our naval fleet was strong. As a U.S. Navy veteran who served  for a time in Boston, MA, Thad has always been a dedicated advocate for  his shipyard in Mississippi, as I am for Bath Iron Works in the State  of Maine. Thad has twice visited BIW with me to see the great work done  there.   In 2013, Thad received the Navy's Distinguished Public Service Award  in recognition of his longstanding commitment to American sea power.   Through four decades in the Senate, plus three terms in the House of  Representatives, Thad has compiled an admirable legislative record on  issues ranging from education to libraries, the arts, our national  defense, scientific and biomedical research, conservation initiatives,  and civil rights. But perhaps his greatest legacy is that he taught us  how a Senator should act, and that legacy will live on forever.   Thad, our Nation is so grateful for your service, and I, personally,  am so appreciative of your friendship. I offer my best wishes to you  and to Kay. You will be greatly missed.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be  permitted to speak for up to 30 minutes.    Mr. President, we have the opportunity today to take  immediate action to lower the cost of health insurance by as much as 40  percent and to increase the affordability of insurance for millions of  Americans who purchase plans in the individual market.   I commend Senator Alexander, the chairman of the Senate Health,  Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, for his extraordinary  leadership and hard work in this area.   I am also very pleased with the work that has been done by  Representative  Greg Walden, the chairman of the House Energy and  Commerce Committee, and Representative Costello.   We have come together, along with a substantial number of our  colleagues, including Senators Graham, Rounds, Isakson, and Murkowski,  among many others, on this very important insurance stabilization and  rate reduction package.   Let me begin by outlining the major provisions of what it is that we  are proposing, because there has been, unfortunately, a lot of  misunderstanding and, dare I say, misinformation.   First, our legislation, based on the Alexander-Murray bill, would  fund the cost-sharing reduction subsidies for 3 years. These are vital  for Americans who have incomes that are below 250 percent of the  poverty level. CSRs provide government assistance to help them pay for  their deductibles and their copays.   Second, our proposal also improves the ability of the States to take  further steps to lower insurance premiums for their citizens. We  provide meaningful flexibility for States by revising section 1332 of  the Affordable Care Act, which authorizes State innovation waivers.   Third, based on a bill that I authored with Senator Bill Nelson, our  proposal provides a total of $30 billion over 3 years for States to  have reinsurance, or invisible high-risk pools, by applying for a  waiver under the section 1332 program I just mentioned.   As I know the Presiding Officer well knows, reinsurance is a proven  method for dealing with high-risk, expensive claims. It reduces  uncertainty and has benefits not only for those who have preexisting  conditions and need expensive healthcare but for the entire individual  market, and it has been proven to work in States like Maine and Alaska.   We have also included $500 million to assist States with the planning  of the designs of their own reinsurance, or invisible high-risk pools.  In the House, the Costello bill also had a Federal fallback in  recognizing that we were late in the year and that we wanted to provide  help immediately, which we have included for 2019, to give States  [[Page S1909]]  time to apply for waivers under section 1332.   What does our bill not do?   Our proposal does not change the Affordable Care Act's essential  benefit requirements. It does not change the guarantee that an  individual will be able to buy insurance. It does not change the  protections for people with preexisting conditions. Yet it ensures that  the Federal funding directly benefits consumers and not insurance  companies.   In considering this plan, Congress faces a fundamental question: Do  we want to take action to significantly reduce the cost of health  insurance for millions of Americans or are we just going to sit back,  say no, and let this opportunity pass us by?   Time is short. If Congress fails to act, insurance rates in the  individual market will skyrocket this fall. This will directly harm the  9 million Americans who pay for their own insurance without government  or employer assistance. That is, for example, the fisherman in my State  who is self-employed, the electrician, the plumber, the carpenter-- there are so many--the hair stylist. They are already paying far too  much for their healthcare costs. Well, all of them will be facing  another double-digit premium increase if they are to be insured, and  rates can only be expected to continue to climb.   Healthcare premiums are already too expensive under the Affordable  Care Act. That is one of the problems with the Affordable Care Act that  I have been committed to fixing. Last year, the average price of the  Affordable Care Act silver plans, which are the most popular plans,  increased on average by 34 percent. A growing number of counties in our  country are at risk of having no insurers or only one insurer, leaving  hard-working individuals with few or no choices for health insurance  coverage. Inaction will only exacerbate the premium spikes and the  market instability we have already experienced.   When our country is confronted with such a serious problem--I mean,  what is more important to people than healthcare?--Americans expect us  to come together. They expect us to work constructively. They expect us  to provide real relief from the rising cost of health insurance, which  makes health insurance unaffordable for far too many Americans, and  that is precisely what our plan would do.   Let me be crystal clear. Our proposal is the last opportunity--the  last opportunity--to prevent these rate increases that will go into  effect, which will be announced on October 1. Our package will help to  stabilize the insurance markets and make them more competitive.   Every study has shown that our bill would make health insurance more  affordable. According to the leading healthcare experts at Oliver  Wyman, our bill would lower individual health insurance premiums in the  individual market by as much as 40 percent compared to what people will  otherwise pay if Congress fails to act. According to Oliver Wyman, it  would also expand coverage to an additional 3.2 million Americans.   I want to touch on a complicated but important issue that some of my  colleagues on the other side of the aisle have raised as a reason not  to pass this bill. There have been two reasons. One is the application  of the Hyde amendment, which has been law for decades, which I will  talk about subsequently, but the first has to do with what is referred  to as silver-loading and zero-premium bronze plans.   First a little background. The Affordable Care Act was designed to  provide two key subsidies for enrollees who purchased coverage on the  exchange and qualified from an income standpoint. The first are premium  tax credits to help cover the cost of premiums for individuals earning  between 100 and 400 percent of the Federal poverty level. The second  are cost-sharing subsidies, or CSRs, to help cover the cost of  deductibles and copays and other out-of-pocket expenses for individuals  who are very low-income--earning between 100 and 250 percent of the  Federal poverty level.   Despite the fact that Congress never appropriated the funds to pay  for the cost-sharing reductions, the Obama administration paid them  anyway. The House sued to block this strategy and won in Federal  district court.   Lacking an appropriation from Congress, President Trump stopped  making these payments last year. That concerned many of us, but let me  make clear--he was following the court's decision. In response,  insurance companies came up with the silver-loading strategy, under  which they increased the price of their silver plans to compensate for  the cost-sharing reduction payments they were no longer receiving. In  essence, insurers have created silver plans that mimic CSRs for low- income enrollees. Because the ACA's tax credits are tied to the silver  plan premium, the tax credits ballooned in size, producing credits so  large that they are often sufficient to fully cover the premiums on the  bronze plans for lower income enrollees and, by the way, greatly  increased the cost to Federal taxpayers, which is why the bill we put  together, by right-sizing the market and avoiding the games that were  played, actually pays for itself.   We all remember the old saying that ``if something sounds too good to  be true, it probably is.'' Well, free bronze plans for low-income  individuals sounded too good to be true, and they are. I hope my  colleagues on the other side of the aisle are listening to this  explanation. The fact is that free bronze plans are only a good deal  for low-income Americans who never get sick, who never get hurt, who  never need to use their insurance. If they do, they will pay hundreds  or even thousands of dollars more out of pocket.   While these plans might have lower monthly payments or even be free,  they have much higher deductibles and copays. Based on publicly  available data pulled from the exchanges, I am going to describe an  example illustrating that individuals with free bronze plans will face  much steeper costs when they try to access care than if they paid the  small premium for the silver plan.   Let's take the example of Chris and Caroline, ages 34 and 32, who  live in Portland, ME. They bought coverage on the exchange for  themselves and their two young children for 2018. They make about  $34,500 a year, which is about 140 percent of the Federal poverty  level. They saw that they could get a ``free'' bronze plan, or they  could choose to buy the cheapest silver plan for $54.83 a month. They  chose the free bronze plan, not realizing that the silver plan would  have given them access to subsidies, which provide lower deductibles  and copays to low-income people. If Caroline gets pregnant this year  and they are under the free bronze plan, they are going to have to pay  out of pocket $7,350--and they make $34,500 a year. Had they picked the  least expensive silver plan, they would have had to pay $500.   Consider a hypothetical couple in their early thirties, Jacob and  Emma, with two young children, living in Seattle, WA. They are making  just under $35,000 a year. When they went shopping for coverage on the  exchange, they, too, saw that they could get a free bronze plan, or  they could buy the least expensive silver plan for about $84 a month.  Jacob and Emma chose the free bronze plan, which doesn't come with the  subsidies included in the silver plan to help low-income families with  deductibles and copays. If someone in this young family faces a serious  illness this year, the silver plan in Washington State would have  capped Emma and Jacob's additional expenses at $660. Unfortunately,  they have the so-called free bronze plan that some of my colleagues  have been touting. They would face up to $7,210 in out-of-pocket  expenses--hardly an affordable option for this low-income family.   It used to be well understood by the affordability advocates in and  out of the Senate that low-income Americans struggled to meet  deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses. Just 1 year ago today, the  Kaiser Family Foundation issued a report arguing against the House  reform bill because it did not contain CSRs, noting that ``cost-sharing  reductions are a key part of the financial support currently provided  to [low-income] enrollees'' and that without such support, deductibles  ``are often out of reach for people with lower and modest income.''   A prior Kaiser Family Foundation report from 2015 showed that only 1  in 10 individuals earning between 100 and 250 percent of the Federal  poverty level--those are the individuals who would be eligible for CSRs  under our bill--has savings or other assets large enough to cover a  $6,000 deductible. In other  [[Page S1910]]  words, without CSRs, 90 percent of these individuals will have to wipe  out their savings to cover their medical expenses before they even meet  their deductible. Those who can't meet their deductible won't get  reimbursed. For these Americans, a zero-premium plan will really mean a  zero-benefit plan.   I cannot believe that silver-loading and free bronze plans is a  credible long-term strategy. First, I would note, in addition to the  examples I have given, that CBO assessments from last year were that  the silver-loading strategy would cost the Federal taxpayers $194  billion over the budget window. Second, because low-income individuals  will struggle to meet their deductibles, they will be unable to secure  reimbursement of expenses. Sooner or later, taxpayers are going to be  asking why they are paying nearly $200 billion more to subsidize  policies that deliver such poor benefits.   To be clear, the amendment we are offering prevents this strategy,  protecting lower and modest-income enrollees, low-income families and  individuals and the taxpayers.   Now, let me discuss the Hyde amendment. I am disappointed, to say the  least, that Democrats, who ought to have embraced this proposal, have  instead rejected it because its funding is subject to the Hyde  amendment. As a pro-choice Republican, I must say this puzzles me. The  Hyde amendment has prohibited the use of taxpayer dollars to pay for  elective abortions for more than 40 years. It is not new policy. The  entire Labor-HHS title of the omnibus before us today is subject to the  Hyde amendment.   There are variations of the Hyde amendment in other titles of the  omnibus spending bill. It applies to a long list of Federal programs,  including Medicare, Medicaid, CHIP, TRICARE, Veterans Affairs, Indian  Health Service, the Peace Corps, the Bureau of Prisons, Immigration and  Customs Enforcement. I have heard it said that it doesn't apply to  commercial insurance that is offered by the Federal Government--that is  just not true. It applies to the Federal Employees Health Benefits  Program, through which 8.3 million employees, retirees, and their  families get their health insurance coverage. I have not seen my  Democratic friends make any effort to change the applicability of Hyde  to that insurance program.   Together, these programs account for more than $1 trillion in  government spending each year--all of which is covered by the Hyde  amendment. That is 100 times the amount of reinsurance we are proposing  in our amendment. A trillion dollars of Federal healthcare funding is  already covered by the Hyde amendment, which has been policy for 40  years. So how is this, in any way, a radical departure from current  policy?   I find it frustrating that some on the other side of the aisle are  choosing to block this important package that will provide relief to  those who need it most because of the application of the Hyde  amendment. Let me say, they cite the Stupak amendment, which is section  1303 of the Affordable Care Act. We leave that in place, we don't touch  it, and we do not change the Hyde amendment's exemptions found in  section 507, which allow private entities, State governments, or  individuals to use their own funds to provide coverage for abortion. In  other words, this is nothing radical or new, and it is baffling and  gravely disappointing that this should be used to block this package.   Dozens of healthcare consumer and business groups, as well as the  National Association of Insurance Commissioners--those State  commissioners whose job it is to look out for consumers--have called  upon Congress to take action to lower premiums for millions of  Americans and their families. These groups include the American  Hospital Association, Blue Cross Blue Shield, the U.S. Chamber of  Commerce, the American Medical Association, the American Cancer  Society, the American Academy of Family Physicians, the Federation of  American Hospitals, and there are a wide range of groups representing  people with diseases, such as arthritis, cancer, epilepsy. The United  Way has called for action, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, the American  Lung Association. Just yesterday, the National Association of Insurance  Commissioners put out a new letter in support of market stabilization.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that these three letters be  printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.   Mr. President, how incredibly disappointing it would be if some  Members derailed this serious effort to reduce the cost of health  insurance for millions of Americans. While Members may disagree with  certain provisions, the time has come for each and every Senator to  decide: Are you for lower rates and more affordable coverage for the 18  million Americans who get their insurance from the individual market or  are you content to just sit back and let their insurance rates soar  once again this fall, making health insurance even less affordable than  it already is?   In my view, the answer is clear and obvious. We must not lose sight  of our goal, and that is making health insurance more affordable for  millions of Americans. Including our insurance package in the omnibus  funding bill is the right thing to do, and it is urgent that we do it  now.   Thank you.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:           National Association of Insurance Commissioners & The             Center for Insurance Policy and Research,                                                    March 21, 2018.      Hon. Lamar Alexander,      Chair, Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, U.S.           Senate, Washington, DC.      Hon. Patty Murray,      Ranking Member, Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions           Committee, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.      Hon. Susan Collins,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Alexander, Ranking Member Murray, and Senator       Collins: Members of the National Association of Insurance       Commissioners (NAIC) continue to urge congressional support       for health insurance market stabilization reforms and applaud       the Senate leaders who have worked across the political aisle       to advance them. If Congress does not act to stabilize health       insurance markets, continued uncertainty regarding federal       funding, the health of the risk pool, and regulatory       requirements will result in even higher premiums and,       possibly, fewer carriers participating on the exchange--      perhaps even bare counties.        This is why commissioners from across the political       spectrum have contacted their congressional delegations,       testified before House and Senate committees, and urged       federal policymakers to take immediate action to stabilize       the health insurance markets.        Specifically, state regulators support market stabilization       reforms that would:        Provide federal funding for reinsurance programs to address       the deteriorating risk pools;        Fully fund cost-sharing reduction (CSR) payments that are       owed to insurance carriers that provide low-cost sharing       plans to lower-income enrollees; and,        Make the Section 1332 waiver process more streamlined and       predictable for states.        These concepts have received bipartisan support and,       contrary to some rhetoric, are in no way a ``bailout'' of the       insurance industry. They directly benefit consumers and help       stabilize the risk pool. CSR payments reimburse carriers for       providing a lower cost version of their Silver plans to       eligible consumers, and establishing reinsurance funding       acknowledges that the risk pools in many states are much       sicker than anticipated and help is needed to backstop       markets that might otherwise cease to exist in some counties.       Section 1332 waiver flexibility will provide states clearer       guidance and quicker action to address their market       realities, while preserving guardrails to protect consumers.       And finally, the Senate rightly acknowledges that ``sales       across state lines'' are best left to the states in the form       of interstate compacts.        As insurance commissioners, we attempt to assess these       reforms with an apolitical perspective, but we recognize that       the political process in Washington does not always allow for       a perfect result. What is clear, however, is that without       these reforms markets across the country will continue to       deteriorate, and consumers will pay the price for this       inaction. We applaud Senators who have worked to advance       these reforms and we urge all Members of Congress to support       them and stabilize health insurance markets for our nation's       consumers.            Sincerely,      Julie Mix McPeak,        NAIC President, Commissioner, Tennessee Department of       Commerce & Insurance.      Raymond G. Farmer,        NAIC Vice President, Director, South  [[Page S1911]]       Carolina Department of Insurance.      Eric A. Cioppa,        NAIC President-Elect, Superintendent, Maine Bureau of       Insurance.      Gordon I. Ito,        NAIC Secretary-Treasurer, Commissioner, Insurance Division,       Hawaii Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs.                                   ____   Congress Must Act Now to Prevent Premium Spikes and Coverage Losses for         Millions of Americans, say 20 Patient and Consumer Groups         Washington, D.C., Mar. 13, 2018.--20 patient and consumer       groups issued the following statement urging Congress to       include legislation in the forthcoming omnibus spending bill       to steady the health insurance market:        ``Congressional leaders must include provisions to       stabilize the health insurance market in the March 23rd       omnibus government funding bill to prevent millions of       Americans from losing health insurance coverage. In the       coming months, insurers will set plan rates for 2019 and a       shaky marketplace will likely result in premium spikes--      putting health insurance out of reach for many patients and       families.        Several bipartisan proposals under consideration could       preserve and even expand access to affordable health       insurance for middle class families. They include cost-      sharing reduction policies that could improve affordability       for low-income Americans and the creation of a reinsurance       program to help keep premiums stable for those with pre-      existing conditions. We urge Congress to move swiftly, so       that plans on state exchanges can stabilize, and perhaps       lower, premiums for the millions of Americans who will turn       to the marketplace for coverage next year.        Both parties in Congress have pledged to protect people       with pre-existing conditions, but recent regulatory actions       taken by the Trump administration to expand association and       short-term health plans could undermine existing protections.        Recent data indicates that the number of Americans who are       uninsured is on the rise again for the first time since 2008.       At the end of 2017, 12.2 percent of U.S. adults lacked health       insurance--up from 10.9 percent at the end of 2016, an       increase of 3.2 million people.        Quality insurance coverage improves patient outcomes and       allows Americans to stay healthy and remain financially       secure. The vulnerable communities we represent simply cannot       afford to lose access to health insurance that protects their       livelihood and wellbeing.''

We came together earlier this month to stress the       importance of congressional action to lower healthcare       premiums. Time is running out.        In the next few weeks, health insurance providers will       begin to file premium rates for 2019 in the individual       market. In October, individuals and families who buy their       own coverage will review their options, see their premiums,       and make their choices. Without Congressional action now, the       plans offered to Americans will be nearly 30 percent more       expensive than they would be otherwise.        Congress is working on an omnibus appropriations bill that       it must act on by March 23. As providers of health care and       coverage to hundreds of millions of Americans, we urge you to       ensure that bill includes elements that will reduce premiums,       improve affordability, and improve the individual market for       2019 and beyond:        Establish a premium reduction/reinsurance program to help       cover the costs of people with significant health care needs.        Provide multi-year funding for cost-sharing reduction (CSR)       benefits.        According to independent analyses by Avalere Health and       Oliver Wyman, enacting both legislative provisions could       lower premiums by up to 21% in 2019 and increase enrollment       and expand coverage to over 1.5 million Americans. By 2020,       premiums could be 40% lower with an additional 2.1 million       Americans enrolled and covered. Moreover, this legislation       will help physicians and hospitals better serve the health       care needs of patients in their community and lower costs for       businesses that provide coverage to their employees.        Time is running short. We urge you to deliver on the       promise to reduce premiums for millions of Americans and       their families.            Sincerely,      America's Health Insurance Plans;      American Academy of Family Physicians;      American Benefits Council;      American Hospital Association;      American Medical Association;      Blue Cross Blue Shield Association;      Federation of American Hospitals;      U.S. Chamber of Commerce.     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate proceeds to the consideration of the House message to accompany  H.R. 1625, the omnibus appropriations bill, the Collins-Alexander  amendment at the desk be considered and agreed to.    Mr. President, I want to make three points in response  to the objection that was raised by my friend and colleague from  Washington State.   The first is timing.   According to the Senator from Washington, we have all the time in the  world. Regrettably, that is not true.   Starting next month, insurers are beginning their calculations on  what rates they are going to charge for insurance policies on the  individual market next year. They are also making the decision as to  whether they are even going to sell in particular counties across this  country. There is already not much competition, so the time is urgent  for us to act. Those rates get approved by the State insurance  commissioners, and they are published on October 1. So the idea that we  have tons of time to take care of this problem is just not accurate.   Indeed, as Senator Alexander just said, the chairman of the HELP  Committee, the HELP Committee has spent months on these concepts, has  worked really hard on these issues, and has had extensive hearings and  roundtables and discussions. The one thing we do not have is time, and  that is why the National Association of Insurance Commissioners has  urged us to act on this bill.   The second is the concept that somehow this bill has brandnew  concepts in it. The only thing that is new is the amendment that was  just filed by the Senator from Washington State. I have no idea what is  in that. It was not shared with me. To my knowledge, it was not shared  with the Senator from Tennessee. I have no idea whether it covers cost  savings reductions that help our lowest income people pay their copays  and deductibles. I have no idea what it does to silver-loading, whereby  insurers jack up the prices of silver plans in order to draw down more  Federal dollars. I have no idea what it does on a whole variety of  issues because I have never seen it.   By contrast, the language of the Collins-Alexander proposal was  shared with the minority. Indeed, I have had several discussions with  the Senator from Washington State about the language, and all of the  concepts in our bill have been debated. Hearings have been held on  them. They have been talked about extensively. They are not new. There  was a change in the reinsurance provisions, which I authored with my  friend and colleague, the former State insurance commissioner from  Florida, Senator Nelson, and that was to add a third year to the  reinsurance.   I would have thought my Democratic friends would have been thrilled  with that--a third year. That was at the suggestion, I would say, of  Congressman Costello and Congressman Walden in the House.   We also put in a Federal backstop so every State could be assured of  the benefits of reinsurance in the next year, even if they had not had  time to file the application for a waiver under section 1332. Again,  that is a concept my Democratic friends were pushing for us to include.  It was one that I, frankly, had reservations about, but that is in  there. So those are two changes in the reinsurance that our Democratic  colleagues, I would think, would be applauding because it helps to  drive down rates.    Third, I hear from my Democratic colleagues that this is an enormous  change in the application of the Hyde amendment because it applies to  commercial insurers. That is just not true. The Hyde amendment already  applies to the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. That is the  insurance program for 8.3 million Americans who are Federal employees,  spouses, or family members of Federal employees, or retired Federal  employees--8.3 million. How does the Presiding Officer think that  program is administered? The answer is, it is administered through  commercial insurers like Blue Cross Blue Shield, United Health  Insurance, and many others. This is not the first time, and the  language actually for the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program is  more strict than what is in the bill we have proposed. So the idea that  this is some new approach is just not accurate.   The Federal Government spends about $1 trillion on healthcare through  various programs--its share of Medicaid, Medicare, VA programs, the  Children's Health Insurance Program, the TRICARE Program, the Federal  Employees Health Benefits Program. It is about $1 trillion. Guess what.  That is 100 times more than the amount that is covered in this bill-- 100 times more. So this is not a new concept in any way.   The reinsurance provisions and the cost-saving reductions have been  discussed for months in the HELP Committee, both formally in hearings  where, by the way, there was widespread support for them and in  informal roundtables and in Senator-to-Senator discussions.   Make no mistake about the stakes here, if we do not act--and it  appears, due to the objection on the Democratic side, that we are not  going to act--insurance rates will go up on October 1. That is going to  hurt everybody who has to buy insurance who wants to be insured and has  to buy through the individual market because they don't get insurance  through the workplace. That is going to hurt very low-income people.  That is also going to hurt those who receive no government help at all  and do not have employer-provided insurance because they are self- employed.   Why don't we want to take advantage of this opportunity to decrease  insurance rates by as much as 40 percent over the next 2 years?   Do you know how welcome that would be by the people in my State of  Maine? Maine is a low-income State. We don't have Microsoft  headquarters in the State of Maine. We are a low-income State. We need  insurance rates to fall. This bill would do it. Oliver Wyman, the well- respected healthcare consulting firm, has verified that rates would  fall. The CBO says premiums would be less, and Oliver Wyman says 3.2  million more people would be insured. Surely--surely--this should be a  goal we can all embrace.   I yield the floor.
