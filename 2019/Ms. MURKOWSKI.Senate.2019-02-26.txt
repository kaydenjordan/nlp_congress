 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, before I wrap for the end of the day  at the request of the leader, I want to share my thanks, my  appreciation--truly, my appreciation--for an action that the House just  took up.   It was just about an hour or so ago that the House took up the bill  that we had passed out of the Senate here, our lands and water  conservation bill, which was a very significant measure of about 120  different conservation, lands, waters, and sportsmen's bills--all  rolled into one package--that passed out of here by 92 to 8. It just  passed out of the House by a significant, significant margin.   It is, I think, a real testament not only to the work that has been  done within this body on a very strong bipartisan basis but, really, to  the work that we have done with the House, in our working with the  other body in a bipartisan, bicameral way. I think it goes a long way  to showing that we really can come together as a Congress on issues  that are important to each of us individually.   I give my thanks and my appreciation to Chairman Grijalva, to Mr.  Bishop, who was the former chairman of that committee and who worked on  this with us last year, and to all of their teams, as well as to the  House leadership, which has helped to advance this to this moment in  time.   We look forward to the President's signing that very, very shortly,  and I know that it will come as a real positive moment for so many. I  thank all who helped us with this.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that with  respect to the Miller nomination, the motion to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table and that the President be  immediately notified of the Senate's action.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  postcloture time on the Desmond nomination expire at 12:15 p.m.  tomorrow; further, that if confirmed, the motion to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table and the President be  immediately notified of the Senate's action; finally, that there be 2  minutes of debate equally divided prior to the cloture vote on the  Wheeler nomination.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Senate proceed to legislative session for a period of morning business,  with Senators permitted to speak for up to 10 minutes each.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 79, submitted  earlier today.    I further ask unanimous consent that the resolution be  agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or  debate.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m.,  Wednesday, February 27; further, that following the prayer and pledge,  the morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be  approved to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their  use later in the day, morning business be closed, and the Senate  proceed to executive session and resume consideration of the Desmond  nomination under the previous order.    Madam President, if there is no further business to  come before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 7:07 p.m., adjourned until  Wednesday, February 27, 2019, at 10 a.m.                            ____________________
