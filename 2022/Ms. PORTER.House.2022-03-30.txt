 Madam Speaker, inflation is a challenge for families. I  feel it myself as a single mom raising three kids. Historically, the  standard approaches to reduce inflation are to raise interest rates and  to lower wages. Some people are calling for these same misguided  approaches today. This is wrongheaded. Families need lower costs, not  less money in their pockets.   We can bring prices down by increasing supply, for example, by  expanding energy capacity with more green energy. The America COMPETES  Act, which I supported, will strengthen our supply chains and increase  our domestic manufacturing of technology.   We can also bring prices down by cracking down on corporate abuse. We  can reduce healthcare costs by allowing Medicare to negotiate drug  prices, lower grocery costs by increasing competition in the  meatpacking industry, and stop Big Oil from price gouging.   These policies will lower costs without lowering wages. We can  strengthen our capitalist economy and rein in inflation. Families need  us to address inflation. They need lower costs, not lower wages.                            Budget Cuts Limit IRS     Madam Speaker, the IRS backlog is over 7 million tax  returns. That is unacceptable. On the Oversight and Reform Committee, I  am holding the IRS accountable to eliminate this backlog quickly.   Families need their tax refunds to pay rent and buy food. Small  business owners need their refunds to keep their doors open. It is  their money, and the government should promptly return it.   My office has helped Orange County residents cut through red tape and  get answers from the IRS. We have helped nearly 500 taxpayers  collectively recover over half a million dollars. I am proud of these  wins, but the solution here cannot be individual intervention. Years of  budget cuts have limited the IRS' ability to operate effectively and  efficiently.   IRS employees are working hard. I thank them. But the IRS needs  resources, and the taxpayers need assistance. Every Congress Member  should vote to fully fund the IRS. As a taxpayer advocate, I will keep  pushing to save taxpayers time and money.                            Clean Energy Solutions     Madam Speaker, Orange County is leading the way on clean  energy solutions. Businesses in our community are spearheading  innovative technologies to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. These  businesses represent the best of our capitalist economy. They create  jobs and lead in innovation. I am proud to represent a district that  ranks among the top five in the most clean energy jobs in the country.   However, as Earth Day approaches, we must also recognize that these  cutting-edge businesses face an uneven playing field. Big Oil and gas  companies have unfair tax breaks and other advantages that inhibit  competition that we need for healthy capitalism. Long term, this will  make it harder for our economy to stand up against our global  competitors.   The hard work of Orange County businesses that they are putting in to  develop new and efficient methods of producing clean energy represents  the best of our capitalist economy. To remain competitive, we have to  lift up new and innovative technologies.                 Congratulating Neal Kelley on His Retirement     Madam Speaker, free and fair elections are the bedrock of  our democracy. Regardless of their ideology, their identity, or where  they live, all eligible voters should be able to cast their ballots  freely and safely.   In Orange County, the registrar of voters facilitates elections for  more than 1.8 million registered voters. As chief election official in  Orange County, Neal Kelley safeguarded equal access to the ballot box  and protected the integrity of our elections. He innovated to improve  efficiency and reliability of voting, adopting technology that  increased transparency and voter turnout.   He retired on March 10 after 17 years of remarkable service. Neal  Kelley is a model public servant we can all learn from. On behalf of  Orange County voters, I congratulate Mr. Kelley on his retirement and  thank him for his service to our democracy.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, corruption abroad makes our country less  safe.   President Biden has said that the fight against corruption is a core  national security interest for the United States. In the last month, we  have sanctioned hundreds of Russian oligarchs and political figures  over the war in Ukraine. These sanctions show the importance of  alliances, the strength of diplomatic values, and the power of the  economic tools at our disposal.   But it should not take a war to crack down on people who become  wealthy through bribery and theft. We should not need to go person-by- person, business-by-business, country-by-country to strike down  corruption.   We need legislation that will identify kelptocrats and proactively  limit their ability to wield influence and exploit power to enrich  themselves, at the expense of the people and land they govern.                            ____________________
