 Madam President, I think it is time the Senate subject  itself to a bit of a reality check. Today is December 11. Here are just  some of the things the Senate needs to accomplish before this Congress  adjourns:   We need to confirm more of the President's nominees for the judiciary  and for the executive branch, such as the well-qualified nominee to be  Deputy Secretary at the Department of Treasury, whom we are currently  considering.   We need to reach an agreement to fund the remaining one-fourth of the  Federal Government that was not covered by regular appropriations.   We need to make a substantial new investment in the integrity of our  borders and the security of American families.   We need to take up and pass the conference report for the farm bill  to honor our commitments to our Nation's growers and producers.   This week alone, we need to dispense with the debate pertaining to  the situation in Yemen and an attempt by some of our Democratic  colleagues to undo reforms that protect Americans' private, personal  information as they exercise their First Amendment rights.   In addition, at the request of the President and following  improvements to the legislation that have been secured by several  Members, the Senate will take up the recently revised criminal justice  bill this month. I intend to turn to the new text as early as the end  of this week.   As a result of this additional legislative business, Members should  now be prepared to work between Christmas and New Year's if necessary  in order to complete our work. Let me say that again. Unless we  approach all this work in a highly collaborative, productive way and  take real advantage of unanimous consent to expedite proceedings, it is  virtually certain that the Senate will need to be in session between  Christmas and New Year's in order to complete this work.   The Senate is a consent-based institution. Expediting this work would  require an extraordinary degree of collaboration from everyone. So  Members should either prepare to cooperate and work together or prepare  for a very, very long month.   In just a few hours from now, we will receive an indication of  whether that cooperation will begin to take shape. My friend the  Democratic leader and his counterpart in the House are scheduled to  meet with President Trump at the White House later today.   For the Nation's sake, I hope my Democratic friends are prepared to  have a serious discussion and reach an accommodation with the President  on funding for border security. Otherwise, circumstances are beginning  to resemble a movie we have seen before. It was only this past January  when Democrats chose to manufacture a government funding lapse over the  issue of illegal immigration. It didn't work out very well.   The reality is that the President's request is entirely reasonable.  And before today's partisan considerations set in, I bet it might have  looked reasonable to many of the majority of the Senate Democrats who  joined in support of physical border security legislation back in  2006--some 12 years ago.  [[Page S7390]]    Senate Republicans are working with the President and his homeland  security team on $5.02 billion of targeted funding to bolster security  measures in specific places where the Department of Homeland Security  determines it is most needed. And make no mistake--the need is great.  In fiscal year 2018, Customs and Border Patrol reported a 30-percent  increase in apprehensions at the U.S.-Mexico border. Looking further  back, the monthly apprehension total this past October reached its  highest level in 4 years--4 years. CBP has observed over the past year  a 50-percent increase in apprehensions of known gang members and a 115- percent increase in seizures of fentanyl narcotics.   Clearly, delivering border security funding must be a priority. That  is because the men and women of the Border Patrol deserve to be a  priority. American communities deserve to be a priority as they face  down the threat of gang violence. American families deserve to be a  priority as the flow of lethal drugs fuels an epidemic of addiction.   This is the right investment in the right place at the right time.  There is no reason why the Democratic leader and the House Democratic  leader should put the demands of far-left special interests ahead of  the safety of American families. There is no reason for my Democratic  friends to end this year the way they began it--with a government  shutdown. It would be truly bizarre for them to decide they would  prefer a partial government shutdown to reasonable funding for national  security. It would signal that their party is more committed to  political spite for the President than to the public interest.   I will be watching eagerly this morning to see if the Democratic  leaders approach these negotiations with the productive and good-faith  spirit they deserve.                            ____________________     Madam President, on another matter, as I mentioned a  moment ago, one key piece of our unfinished business is the farm bill.  Last night, I used my very own hemp pen to sign the conference report,  clearing the way for the House and Senate to pass legislation and send  it to the President's desk. I am proud that the bill includes my  provision to legalize the production of industrial hemp. It is a  victory for farmers and consumers throughout our country.   Fighting for Kentucky hemp has been a long struggle. My State was  once the national leader in the growing and production of industrial  hemp, but then, for decades, a Federal ban halted that progress and  shut American farmers out of the hemp field. Don't get me wrong--Hemp  could still be found all over our country in all kinds of products. The  problem is that it is all being grown somewhere else and imported into  America. It is time to let American growers get back in business with  this versatile crop once again.   The farmers, processors, and manufacturers in my State and across the  country are ready for the hemp comeback. It began in 2014 when I  secured the establishment of a hemp pilot program with the help of  then-agricultural commissioner Jamie Comer. States like Kentucky got  the chance to explore the plant's potential and show us just what hemp  could do, and the results have been nothing short of extraordinary.  Now, American-grown hemp can be found in your food, your clothes, and  even in your car dashboard. The results mean jobs, economic growth, and  new opportunity. Last year alone, hemp products contributed more than  $16 million to Kentucky's economy, and that was just from the pilot  program--just from the pilot program.   At a time when farm income is down and our growers are struggling,  industrial hemp is a bright spot of agriculture's future.   My provision in the farm bill will not only legalize domestic hemp,  but it will also allow State departments of agriculture to be  responsible for its oversight. In Kentucky, that means that  Commissioner Ryan Quarles--another champion of hemp--will be able to  help farmers thrive. And I know the occupant of the Chair is familiar  with Commissioner Quarles.   When the Senate votes on this legislation in the coming days, we will  also be voting to give farmers throughout the country the chance to tap  into hemp's potential and take part in its future. I have been proud to  work with my colleagues in Congress, such as Senator Ron Wyden, and  with hemp advocates in Kentucky to get to this point. Obviously, I will  be proudly voting for this bill.                            ____________________     Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote  [[Page S7391]]  scheduled for 11:30 a.m. this morning occur at 11 a.m. this morning.    Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 3:45  p.m. today, the Senate vote on adoption of the conference report to  accompany H.R. 2.
