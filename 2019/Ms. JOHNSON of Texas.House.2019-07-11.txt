 Mr. Chair, l rise today to voice my support for  my three amendments to H.R. 2500, the National Defense Authorization  Act for Fiscal Year 2020.   My first amendment requires an annual update of the climate  vulnerability and risk assessment tool by the Secretary of Defense.  This tool will play a critical role in measuring the impact of climate  change on our defense infrastructure, therefore we must ensure that it  is routinely updated to reflect a rapidly changing climate.   My second amendment ensures that cultural competence and diversity  are integrated in the recruitment and retention efforts of mental  health providers for our active duty service members. It is essential  that these providers reflect the diversity of our troops and are  culturally competent in their treatment services.   My third amendment mandates the installation and maintenance of  carbon monoxide detectors in all military family housing units. This  will ensure that our armed services families are protected against the  risk of carbon monoxide poisoning in their own homes.   I urge my colleagues to support these amendments.
