 Mr. President, I was necessarily absent for the votes on  S. Con. Res. 36, 5-year balanced budget. Had I been present, I would  have voted nay on S. Con. Res. 36, 5-year balanced budget.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today, during National Police Week, I wish  to recognize and honor the men and women who serve as New Jersey's  police officers and law enforcement officials. We owe a great debt of  gratitude to the professionals working in law enforcement who risk  their lives each and every day for the safety of all New Jerseyans.  These American heroes answer the call when we need them the most, and  we stand together as a grateful nation in saying thank you.   Established by a joint resolution of Congress, National Police Week  devotes special appreciation to those members of law enforcement who  have lost their lives in the line of duty for the safety and protection  of the people they serve. In a proclamation issued 56 years ago,  President John F. Kennedy recognized the national importance of  honoring our law enforcement professionals by designating the 15th of  May as Peace Officers Memorial Day and the week in which that date  falls as National Police Week.   Today I want to pay special homage to New Jersey's fallen police  officers. These heroes made the ultimate sacrifice in service to our  State. Though they are no longer with us, we stand proud and united  knowing that they continue to be commemorated by their fellow New  Jerseyans and by their fellow brothers and sisters in blue. Their  courage, spirit of service, and commitment has allowed the people of  New Jersey to be safe and secure. For their service and their  sacrifice, we are eternally grateful.
