 Mr. President, the Federal Communications Commission  Schools and Libraries program, commonly known as E-Rate, has helped  connect our schools and libraries to highspeed broadband. Recent  changes allowed for schools to pay for Wi-Fi on campuses, recognizing  that students are using laptops and other devices for learning. This  bill, cosponsored by my friend Senator Gardner, would allow schools to  receive reimbursement for Wi-Fi on school buses--an idea inspired by a  New Mexico high school student. A few years ago, a football player from  Hatch Valley High School in Hatch, New Mexico told me how, after being  on a bus for hours after a game, he would sit in the dark parking lot  of his school doing his homework--because he didn't have high-speed  broadband at home. Making Wi-Fi available on school buses is one piece  to solving the homework gap--especially in rural areas. Adequate  internet is an absolute necessity in this day and age. And I will  continue to work with my colleagues to make sure every home in the  Nation has adequate internet access.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be  printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 2958         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. E-RATE SUPPORT FOR SCHOOL BUS WI-FI.         (a) Definition.--In this section, the term ``school bus''       means a passenger motor vehicle that is--        (1) designed to carry a driver and not less than 5       passengers; and        (2) used significantly to transport early child education,       elementary school, or secondary school students to or from       school or an event related to school.        (b) Rulemaking.--Not later than 180 days after the date of       enactment of this Act, the Federal Communications Commission       shall conduct a rulemaking to make the provision of Wi-Fi       access on school buses eligible for support under the E-rate       program of the Commission set forth under subpart F of part       54 of title 47, Code of Federal Regulations.                                  ______                                         By Mr. DURBIN (for himself and Mr. Markey):   S. 2965. A bill to amend the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act  of 1998 to give Americans the option to delete personal information  collected by internet operators as a result of the person's internet  activity prior to age 13; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and  Transportation.
