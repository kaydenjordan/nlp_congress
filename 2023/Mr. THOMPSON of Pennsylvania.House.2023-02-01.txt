 Mr. Speaker, I rise today, on the first  day of February, to recognize Career and Technical Education Month.   During this month, we highlight the impact of CTE programs, programs  that can be referred to as learn-to-earn. These programs are for  learners at all levels. We recognize the role of CTE in supporting  industry seeking to fill positions in high-demand, high-skill, and  high-wage jobs and career fields.   My appreciation for CTE came at a very early age. My father, coming  out of the Navy, went through a CTE program, which led him to a job as  a tool and die maker. Eventually, he decided to start his own business,  which became quite successful.   As co-chair of the bipartisan House Career and Technical Education  Caucus and a senior member of the Committee on Education and the  Workforce, I have always supported and will continue to support CTE  programs that provide learners of all ages with career-ready skills.   From agriculture to the arts, from marketing to manufacturing, CTE  programs work to develop America's most valuable resource: its people.   A one-size-fits-all approach to education is not an effective way to  prepare students for the workforce. We are doing students a great  disservice when we only promote what is considered a traditional  college experience.   CTE has established itself as a path that many high-achieving  students choose in pursuit of industry certification and hands-on  skills that they can use right out of high school, in skill-based  education programs, or in college.   Mr. Speaker, CTE Month recognizes the benefits of a skills-based  education and the valuable contributions CTE students make to the  American workforce.   Congress recognized the importance of CTE when we passed the  Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act,  which helps to close the skills gap by modernizing the Federal  investment in CTE programs and connecting educators with industry  stakeholders. This bill was later signed into law by President Trump in  2018.   While this is a major milestone, there is still much more work to be  done. That is why I will continue to put forward commonsense pieces of  legislation that update and promote workforce development throughout  our Nation.   These include: The Counseling for Career Choice Act, which ensures  that high school students are made fully aware of their career and  educational options prior to graduation, including non-degree  certificate programs, internships, apprenticeships, and 2-year and 4- year degree programs.   There is also the Skills Investment Act, which enhances tax  advantaged savings accounts for educational expenses so American  workers can use the accounts to pay for skills-based learning, career  training, and workforce development.   Lastly, the Cybersecurity Skills Integration Act, creates a $10  million pilot program within the Department of Education to award  competitive grants to education-employer partnerships for the  development, implementation,  and/or expansion of postsecondary CTE programs that integrate  cybersecurity education into curricula preparing students for careers  in critical infrastructure sectors.   In closing, Mr. Speaker, I encourage my fellow colleagues to join my  co-chair, Ms. Bonamici of Oregon, and me on the bipartisan House Career  and Technical Education Caucus as we work to restore the rungs on the  ladder of opportunity for all.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  congratulate Penn State University's World Campus on 25 years of online  learning.   In 1998, Penn State World Campus launched its first online courses.  Since then, those initial courses have expanded to more than 175  degrees and certificate programs, and almost 34,000 students have  graduated with a Penn State degree they earned online.   Through the past 25 years, the leadership of World Campus has  remained dedicated to helping students to reach their goals. The  creation of World Campus allows students to find success in a flexible  way. Students who wanted a Penn State degree but could not go to a  campus have access to an extensive selection of associate, bachelor's,  and master's degree programs.   In fact, Penn State World Campus is ranked number five on Military  Times ``Best for Vets'' list and named ``Guard-Friendly'' by the  Pennsylvania National Guard Associations.   Mr. Speaker, as a proud Penn State alumnus, the World Campus gives  students of all backgrounds and ages the ability to be able to find  success and join the extensive Penn State community.   Congratulations, Penn State World Campus, we can't wait to see what  the next 25 years have in store.   We are.                            ____________________
