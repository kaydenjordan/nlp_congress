Nomination of Jeff Sessions     Mr. President, the Senate is holding hearings on each  of President-Elect Trump's nominees to his Cabinet. Traditionally,  Presidents are accorded a very high level of deference on assembling  their own team, in part because these nominees are directly accountable  to the President. But they are accountable to the American people too.   No Cabinet member is more powerful or has more impact on the day-to- day lives of Americans than the Attorney General of the United States.   The Attorney General is, indeed, a general, in command of an army of  thousands of lawyers whose words carry enormous weight and power. It is  the weight and power of the people of the United States. He speaks for  us. He charges defendants in our name. He has sweeping authority to  bring criminal charges in all Federal offenses, enormous unreviewable  discretion in cases ranging from minor misdemeanors to the most serious  felonies. In every sense, as capital penalties can be sought for some  of these crimes, he wields the power of life and death.   The Attorney General's authority is not only sweeping, it is uniquely  independent of the President's Cabinet. His decisions must supersede  partisan politics. In most cases, there is no recourse to overrule his  decisions unless there is political interference. He is not just  another government lawyer or even just another member of the  President's Cabinet. He is the Nation's lawyer, and he must be the  Nation's legal counsel and conscience.   The job of U.S. Attorney General at stake here is one that I know  pretty well. Like some of my colleagues in this body, I served as U.S.  attorney, the chief Federal prosecutor in Connecticut.   I reported to the U.S. Attorney General. For years afterward as a  private litigator and then as attorney general of the State of  Connecticut for 20 years, I fought alongside and sometimes against the  U.S. Attorney General and the legal forces at his disposal. I have seen  his power, or hers, firsthand. The power of this Attorney General is  awesome, as is that of any Attorney General.   In the best of cases, they are inspiring too. Even as he protects the  public from vicious and violent criminal offenders, his role is also to  protect the innocent from unfounded charges that could shatter their  lives even if they are acquitted. As Justice Robert Jackson, a former  Attorney General himself, once said: His job is not to convict, but to  assure justice is done.   So this job requires a singular level of intellect and integrity and  nonpartisan but passionate devotion to the rule of law and an  extraordinary sense of conscience. That is because he is responsible  for so much more than prosecuting and preventing crime and ensuring  public safety. He is responsible for aggressively upholding our  Nation's sacred constitutional commitment to protecting individual  rights and liberties and preventing infringement on them, even by the  government itself, maybe especially by the government.  [[Page S300]]    This responsibility for safeguarding equal justice under the law is  particularly important today, at a time when those civil rights and  freedoms are so much in peril. This historic moment demands a person  whose life work, professional career, and record shows that he will  make the guarantee under our Constitution of equal justice under law a  core mandate of his tenure.    Having reviewed the full record and recent testimony, regrettably and  respectfully, I cannot support the President-elect's nominee, our  colleague and friend Jeff Sessions, for this job.   At his confirmation hearing, Senator Sessions simply said he would  follow the law and he would obey it, but the Attorney General of the  United States must be more than a follower. He must be a leader in  protecting the essential constitutional rights and liberties. He must  be a champion, a zealous advocate. He must actively pursue justice, not  just passively follow or obey the law.   Senator Sessions' record reflects a hostility and antipathy--in fact,  downright opposition--to civil rights and voting rights, women's health  care and privacy rights, antidiscrimination measures, and religious  freedom safeguards. He has prided himself on his vociferous opposition  to immigration reform legislation, a measure that passed this body with  68 bipartisan votes, and a criminal justice reform bill that has  attracted a group of 25 cosponsors, Democrats and Republicans. He even  split with the majority of his own party to vote against reauthorizing  the Violence Against Women Act. He opposed hate crime prohibitions.  Senator Sessions' views and positions on these issues and others, which  are critical to protecting and championing rights and liberties under  our Constitution, are simply out of the mainstream. There is nothing in  Senator Sessions' record, including his testimony before the Judiciary  Committee this week, that indicates he will be the constitutional  champion the Nation needs at this point in its history.   Equally important, the Attorney General must speak truth to power. He  must be ready, willing, and able to say no to the President of the  United States and ensure that the President is never above the law.  Senator Sessions' record and testimony give me no confidence that he  will fulfill this core task.   When I asked him about enforcement of cases against illegal conflicts  of interest involving the President and his family, such as violations  of the emoluments clause or the STOCK Act, he equivocated. When I asked  him about appointing a special counsel to investigate criminal  wrongdoing at Deutsche Bank, owed more than $300 million by Donald  Trump, he equivocated. When I asked him about abstaining from voting on  other Presidential nominees while he is in the Senate, he equivocated.  Those answers give me no confidence that he will be the independent,  nonpolitical law enforcer against conflicts of interest and official  self-enrichment that the Nation needs now more than ever--at a moment  when the incoming administration faces ethical and legal controversies  that are unprecedented in scope and scale.   Senator Sessions' record over many years and his recent testimony  fail to demonstrate the core commitments and convictions necessary in  our next Attorney General.   Back in 1986, the Senate Judiciary Committee rejected Senator  Sessions' nomination to a Federal judgeship due to remarks he made and  actions he took in a position of public trust as U.S. attorney in  Alabama. However, my position on his nomination is primarily based on  his record since those hearings and less on what was considered at that  time.   On voting rights, Senator Sessions has often condoned barriers to  Americans exercising their franchise. He has been a leading opponent of  provisions in the Voting Rights Act designed to ensure that African  Americans can vote in places, such as his home State of Alabama, which  have a unique history of racial segregation. He has advocated for  needlessly restrictive and draconian voter ID laws, citing utterly  debunked threats of rampant voter fraud as an excuse for curtailing the  real and legitimate rights of entire groups of voters.   On privacy--very important--Senator Sessions has passionately opposed  this longstanding American right, which is enshrined in five decades of  Supreme Court precedent. It protects women's health care and personal  decisions involving reproductive rights. At a time when these rights  are facing an unprecedented assault, he has continued to condemn Roe v.  Wade and the many court decisions upholding that case.   He is also supported by extremist groups like Operation Rescue that  defend the murder of doctors and the vilification and criminalization  of women. With him as Attorney General, American women would  understandably feel less secure about those rights.   On religious freedom, Senator Sessions has advocated for using a  religious test to determine which immigrants can enter this country.  When this issue arose in committee, Senator Sessions was the only  Senator--the only Senator--to argue forcefully for religious tests and  against principles of religious liberty that have animated our Republic  since its founding. With Senator Sessions as Attorney General, a Trump  administration would enjoy a permanent green light for any racially or  religiously discriminatory immigration policy that might appeal to him.   On citizenship, Senator Sessions has called for abolishing a time- honored tradition that dates back to reconstruction. Birthright  citizenship is the distinctly American concept that anyone born on our  soil is a citizen of our country. We do not exclude people from  citizenship based on the nationality of their parents or grandparents.  Senator Sessions disagrees, a position that most other Republicans  think is extreme.   With Senator Sessions as Attorney General, the Trump administration  would be encouraged in attempting to deport American citizens--who have  raised families and spent their entire lives here--from the only  country they have ever known.   Senator Sessions declined my invitation at his nomination hearing to  exercise moral and legal leadership and demonstrate his resolve to  serve as the Nation's legal conscience. He refused to reject the  possibility of using information voluntarily provided by DACA  applicants to deport them and their families. As a matter of  fundamental fairness and due process, when a DREAMer has provided  information to our government after being invited to come out of the  shadows, this information should never be used to deport that person.  With Senator Sessions as Attorney General, that sense of legal  conscience would be lacking.   On issues of discrimination and equal protection, Senator Sessions  has publicly opposed marriage equality, claiming it ``weakens  marriage'' and even tried to eliminate protections for LGBT Americans  contained in the Runaway and Homeless Youth and Trafficking Prevention  Act. He has repeatedly voted against steps to enhance enforcement  against hate crimes--violent assaults involving bigotry or bias based  on race, religion, and sexual orientation. He even defended President- Elect Trump's shocking admission on video of his pattern of engaging in  sexual assault.   Senator Sessions himself has said that public officials can be fairly  judged by assessing who their supporters are. Senator Sessions is  backed by groups with ties to White supremacists.   He has even accepted an award and repeated campaign donations from  groups whose founder openly promotes the goal of maintaining a  ``European American majority'' in our society. Neither award, nor many  other important parts of Senator Sessions' record, was reported on the  questionnaire he prepared for the Judiciary Committee.   I gave Senator Sessions an opportunity at the hearing earlier this  week to repudiate these hate groups and racist individuals who have  endorsed his nomination and supported him in the past. In fact, instead  he doubled down, saying that a man who has accused African Americans of  excessive criminality and American Muslims of extensive ties to  terrorism was ``a most brilliant individual.''   So I reach my decision to oppose this nomination with regret because  Jeff Sessions is a colleague and a friend to all of us. Indeed, he and  I have a rapport. I have come to like and respect  [[Page S301]]  him through a number of shared experiences in this building, traveling  abroad, and outside.   We have common causes. He and I both support law enforcement  professionals who serve our communities and the Nation with dedication  and courage. They are never given sufficient thanks and appreciation.   He and I both believe that individual corporate criminal culpability  should be pursued more vigorously. Individual corporate executives  should be held accountable for the wrongdoing of corporations when they  are criminally involved.   This job, this decision, this responsibility is different. Here, my  disagreements stem from bedrock constitutional principles. While I  could envision deferring to Presidential authority and supporting him  for other positions, my objections to his nomination here relate  specifically to this particular, essential, all-powerful job.   At this historic moment, there must be no doubt about the ironclad  commitment of the Attorney General of the United States to the bedrock  principle of equal justice under law, his resolve to be an independent  voice, assuring that the President is never above the law, his  determination to be a champion for all people of America and our  constitutional principles that protect all people, and to be a legal  conscience for the Nation.   Reviewing his record, I cannot assure the people of Connecticut or  the country that Jeff Sessions would be a vigorous champion of these  rights and liberties. Therefore, I stand in opposition to his  nomination.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
