 Mr. President, I rise to introduce the bipartisan  Recreation and Public Purposes Tribal Parity Act to correct a long- standing and unjust oversight that prevents Tribal governments from  having the same opportunities as State and local governments do to buy  and lease public lands for recreational purposes.   Current law allows the Bureau of Land Management to lease or sell  certain public lands to State and local governments or qualifying  nonprofits if those lands will be used for explicit public and  recreational purposes. These lands are used for a variety of public and  recreational purposes, like historic monument sites, schools,  firehouses, law enforcement facilities, courthouses, health facilities,  hospitals, and parks. However, the law does not allow the BLM to sell  or lease these lands to Tribal governments.   Our bill would allow Tribal governments to participate in the program  in the same way that State and local governments do. Doing so would  help ensure Tribal nations enjoy the same opportunities for land  acquisition as State and local governments and nonprofit organizations  do.   Tribal governments were not considered when the Recreation and Public  Purposes Act became law in 1926. The omission leaves Tribes without the  same opportunities as other governments to use public lands for these  beneficial purposes. This disadvantage is clear, as the sale and lease  of public lands is often at a discount compared to fair market value.  This issue is part of the greater need to correct longstanding barriers  that undermine the sovereignty of Tribal governments and our efforts to  right historic wrongs.   The Federal Government owns about 640 million acres of land, about  28% of the total land in the United States. Public lands potentially  available for disposal by the Bureau of Land Management alone are  located across at least 18 States. The exclusion of Indian Tribes from  qualifying for acquisition of these lands is not based on any clear  policy rationale.   As our Nation works to strengthen Tribal sovereignty and self- determination, it is important that we ensure our laws treat Tribal  governments in equal regard as State and local governments and ensure  they have the opportunity for positive and productive land use  activity.   I thank Senator Feinstein for introducing this legislation with me in  the Senate, and Congressman LaMalfa for championing this effort in the  House of Representatives. I look forward to working with my colleagues  to enact this commonsense bill as quickly as possible.                                  ______                                         By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Tillis, and Mr. Grassley):   S. 4430. A bill to amend title 35, United States Code, to establish  an interagency task force between the United States Patent and  Trademark Office and the Food and Drug Administration for purposes of  sharing information and providing technical assistance with respect to  patents, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.
