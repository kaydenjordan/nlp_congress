 Madam Speaker, despite the enactment of marriage equality  in 2015, same-gender couples continue to experience persistent and  pervasive discrimination when it comes to home ownership.   A recent study by Iowa State University found systemic discrimination  against LGBTQ borrowers. The study found that, despite having a lower  credit risk overall, same-sex borrowers are 73 percent more likely to  be denied a mortgage loan. And when they are approved, they face  mortgage interest rates that are 0.02 to 0.2 percent higher, on  average, translating to tens of thousands of dollars in extra  repayment.   Twenty-six States across the United States do not have statewide  housing protections for the LGBTQ community, and the Fair Housing Act  does not protect lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender individuals.  The Equality Act would change this.   This bill would not only improve the lives of members of the LGBTQ  community, it would make neighborhoods across the country more diverse.  And making our neighborhoods more diverse means more Americans get to  know and understand their neighbors who are gay, trans, or queer; and  with that understanding and the friendships and the neighbor  relationships, we hope to get tolerance. This is how we magnify the  wave of LGBTQ acceptance this country has experienced in the last  decade.   Imagine growing up in a community where you never have any LGBTQ role  models; where students in your school were harassed for even being  perceived as gay.   Imagine growing up in a neighborhood where you never met someone who  expressed themselves like you; where you were taught that your sexual  orientation or gender identity was wrong or immoral.   Imagine what it would be like to have waited years for your country  to recognize your loving relationship as legal and equal under the law.  Now, you are finally able to get married, and if you choose to, start a  family.   You have saved enough money for the downpayment on your first home.  You find that dream house in an area with good schools, plenty of parks  for your dogs, and friendly neighbors.   You and your spouse go together to fill out a loan application at the  local bank and wait eagerly for it to be granted. However, despite  doing everything right, you are outright denied for that loan without  reason.   You go to another bank, assuming that this is a mistake, because both  you and your spouse have great credit. You apply for a mortgage loan  again.   Maybe this time you are approved, but the interest rate would amount  to tens of thousands more dollars than you had anticipated; tens of  thousands more dollars than your credit risk should have you pay.   You found your dream home, but now you can't buy it because of an  artificially, discriminatorily-inflated interest rate.                                time  2100    The Equality Act is vital. By amending existing civil rights laws to  explicitly include sexual orientation and gender identity as protected  characteristics, no person may be lawfully discriminated against for  their sexual orientation and gender identity in housing, education,  employment, public accommodations, and so much more.   Not only would it protect LGBTQ families who want to buy a home or  take out a loan, but it would allow individuals who identify as gay or  trans or queer to see people who look and love like them in their  communities, and it would allow their neighbors to see that LGBTQ  families are like them: They care about their neighborhoods; they care  about their communities; they love and want the best for their children  like anyone else; and they take the same pride in home ownership.   Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere, and  discrimination against the LGBTQ community is a deep injustice.  Allowing that discrimination to continue in our country flies in the  face of the principles of equality and opportunity that form the basis  of our democracy.   Madam Speaker, I am proud to support the Equality Act, and I urge my  [[Page H3920]]  colleagues on both sides of the aisle to do the same.
