 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Major  General Timothy P. Williams.   For the last 9 years, Major General Williams has served as the 28th  adjutant general of Virginia, displaying an unparalleled dedication to  the men and women of the Virginia National Guard, the Virginia Air  National Guard, and the Virginia Defense Force.   He has built a reputation of steady leadership in a time so often  marked by turbulence.   His soldiers and airmen were on the front lines of the COVID-19  crisis, completing more than 1,100 missions in response to the  pandemic.   During his tenure, the Virginia National Guard deployed to the U.S.  Capitol following the January 6 insurrection. Later that year, his  servicemembers helped to evacuate thousands of our Afghan allies to  safety.   Under the leadership of Major General Williams, Virginia soldiers  have also deployed to Kuwait, the Horn of Africa, Iraq, Syria, Kosovo,  and many more places.   While Major General Williams will officially retire on July 1, I am  confident that his service is not done, and I am confident that his  resiliency, his devotion to duty, and his fervent patriotism will  continue to inspire generations of brave Virginians who wish to lead  from the front as he continues his service to our Commonwealth and the  country.   Madam Speaker, please join me in extending our country's gratitude to  Major General Timothy P. Williams for his service.                            ____________________
