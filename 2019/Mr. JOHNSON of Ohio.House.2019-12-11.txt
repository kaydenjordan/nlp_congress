 Madam Chair, Americans see a Congress paralyzed  by impeachment and other distractions.   We should change course, do our job, and put our constituents before  partisan politics. Reducing prescription drug prices is a way to do  that.   My friends across the aisle brag about ``affordable'' healthcare in  other countries, but they don't mention the hidden costs.   Look at a young boy from Canada, Ashton Leeds, who, in 2018, was  stricken with an aggressive form of thyroid cancer. Treatments approved  by the Canadian health system failed, and his life was saved when his  family brought him to America for a cutting-edge treatment unavailable  in Canada.   This isn't an isolated instance. As my Republican colleagues have  described today, the data shows that H.R. 3 takes us in the wrong  direction--stifling innovation and reducing future cures.   Madam Chair, Americans are desperately looking for relief at the  pharmacy counter, and we can give it to them with H.R. 19, a bipartisan  proposal with a real chance of becoming law, and I urge my colleagues  to support it.
