 Mr. Chair, our Nation's foster care system is  overburdened and limited in its ability to adequately address the  adversities, challenges, and traumas that children and families often  confront in some of the most vulnerable times of their lives. This is  the unfortunate reality--a status quo where good enough is not good  enough. It is a status quo where children are forgotten and neglected,  a status quo that leaves children to gather in the  [[Page H5743]]  trauma that introduced them to the foster care system.   The Administration for Children and Families has emboldened the  status quo for far too long. Studies show that children placed in  foster care are significantly more likely to face lifelong struggles  that include homelessness, sex trafficking, incarceration, and post- traumatic stress disorder.   To move past these challenges, we must introduce innovative solutions  that address the complex needs of children and families involved in the  foster care system.   Our foster care system lacks innovation, but that is something that  we can change. We must educate, support, and empower children in the  foster care system to reach their full potential.   To accomplish these goals, our foster care system needs  interventional, trauma-informed programming molded to the unique  circumstances of each child in the foster care system.   I encourage my colleagues to recognize these unique challenges and  help set foster care youth on a path to success.
