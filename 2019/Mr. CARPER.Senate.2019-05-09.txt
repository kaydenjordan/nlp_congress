 Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to an American  hero and patriot who was taken from us far too soon. Earlier this  month, I was standing in the flight line at the Dover Air Force Base  alongside Congresswoman Lisa Blunt Rochester and Senator Chris Coons.  We were there to receive the remains of three marines killed in action  on April 8, 2019, when a roadside bomb went off in Afghanistan. Two of  the servicemembers killed were Active Duty: Cpl Robert A. Hendriks, of  Long Island, NY, and SSgt Benjamin S. Hines of York County, PA.   There was a third: SSgt Christopher Slutman, a Reservist, a 15-year  member of the New York City Fire Department, and a Delawarean. The 43- year-old U.S. Marine was also a loving husband to his wife Shannon and  father to three daughters: McKenna, Kenley, and Weslynn. In life and in  death, Staff Sergeant Slutman epitomized the best of America. He  selflessly put his life on the line to protect and serve his country  and his community.   It was Winston Churchill who once said, ``The reservist is twice the  citizen.'' By that measure, Christopher Slutman was three times the  citizen. He wore two uniforms in service to our Nation. He was staff  sergeant in the U.S. Marines, serving in the 25th Marine Regiment,  Fourth Marine Division in the Marine Forces Reserve, based in  Harrisburg, PA. He was also a decorated 15-year veteran of the New York  City Fire Department.   Friends say that Christopher always dreamed of being a firefighter.  He grew up in Maryland and graduated from Frederick Douglass High  Schoo1, where he played football, baseball, and wrestled and achieved  Eagle Scout status. Eventually, he volunteered with fire departments in  Maryland and Washington, DC. Most recently, he split his time between  the Bronx and Wilmington, DE. Most days, I ride down to Washington, DC,  from my home in Wilmington to do my job. Staff Sergeant Slutman took  the train the opposite direction to do his job. He so wanted to serve  that he would travel from his home in Delaware to Ladder Company 27 in  New York City. In fact, he was on military leave from Ladder Company 27  and nearing the end of his most recent deployment with the Marine  Reserves in Afghanistan when he and two comrades lost their lives.   It was Slutman's work in the Bronx where, in 2014, he won the Fire  Chiefs Association Memorial Medal for rescuing an unconscious woman  from the seventh floor of a high-rise apartment building.   Scripture tells us in John 15:13, ``Greater love has no one than  this: to lay down one's life for one's friends.'' Staff Sergeant  Slutman lived that kind of profound love: dedicating his life to  serving others, even at his own peril, and it seems that this kind of  selflessness and devotion to service was a hallmark of the Slutman  household. Staff Sergeant Slutman is survived by three brothers. One of  his brothers is in the Marines, another in the Army. The third is a  firefighter in Washington, DC. Their father is an Army veteran and was  a volunteer firefighter, as was Slutman's mother. Here is a family who  has, and continues to, truly give of themselves in service of others.   Last Friday, I was honored to have been able to join Staff Sergeant  Slutman's family, friends, and fellow servicemembers in New York City  to pay our respects to a man who gave his life for this country. The  first speaker at his funeral was Marine SgtMaj Christopher Armstrong,  who served alongside his friend Chris for 8 years. Armstrong remembered  his friend with these words. He said, ``Upon joining the unit, I began  observing the Marines; who they watched, how they looked at their  leaders, and what they said. There were a small number of men that when  they spoke, silence fell; when they issued an order, the response was  immediate; and when they were looked upon, it was with reverence.  Christopher Slutman immediately stood out as a leader who was respected  and admired. He didn't pound his chest, he didn't try to impress or go  on about what he was going to do. He just did it.''   Armstrong continued. ``He placed his Marines' welfare before his own,  always. Chris never sought credit, but he always gave it.''   FDNY Commissioner Dan Nigro also spoke. He described Slutman as ``the  type of American we can all be proud of.'' And he added, ``Chris was a  protector of those in danger, a defender to those who needed him, a  rescuer to those who needed saving, and a leader who demonstrated his  valor on every tour of duty both here and abroad.''   It was a poet named Edgar Guest, who spent his life in Detroit, MI,  and was often referred to as the People's Poet, who once said, ``I'd  rather see a sermon than hear one any day.'' Christopher Slutman's life  was a better lesson than any sermon. He demonstrated the absolute best  of this country every day with his heroism and service to others. The  way he lived his life and gave his life is a language that is clear to  one and all.   It is with a heavy heart that I, along with the entire First State  and the country, offer our sincerest condolences to his wife Shannon  and his three girls. Their dad is an American hero. I, along with our  Governor, John Carney, and Delaware's congressional delegation, promise  you that he won't soon be forgotten, and I know that his legacy lives  on in you.                            ____________________
