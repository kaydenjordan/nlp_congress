 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life  of Evan Hansen, a senior at Wabash College who ended his life on  September 10.   Evan epitomized compassion, charity, and loving his neighbor. He was  the kind of young man who made customers feel special when he greeted  them personally while working at Joe's Butcher store in Carmel.   His parents, Chuck and Mary, have been overwhelmed by the outpouring  of love they have received from friends at home and from overseas. He  had studied abroad, making lasting friendships from people all around  the world.   Evan was admired by his teammates as the captain of the Wabash  football team. While he was tough as nails on  [[Page H9101]]  the football field, he was truly as caring as Mother Teresa off the  field. He organized the summer lunch program for children in need at  his church, Our Lady of Mount Carmel. He was always ready to lend a  hand to someone in need or offer his smile to friends and strangers. He  planned on attending Marian University's nursing program next year.   September is National Suicide Prevention Month. It is my hope we can  remove the stigma of mental health issues so that all of us can help  people like Evan who believe their only way to finding peace is by  making a decision that can never be undone.                            ____________________
