 Mr. Speaker, House Republicans  continue to profess that ``family values'' form the bedrock of their  decision making. Yet, time and time again there is action being taken  to the contrary. We have seen that the same ``family values'' that  Republicans claim to have are not evident in the debates here on the  floor, the legislation brought forth, and ultimately what is voted on  in Congress.   Whether the topic is food nutrition for our children, Supplemental  Security Income benefits for older Americans, or immigration policies,  the average American family does not stand to benefit from many of the  proposals considered by my Republican colleagues. Even when it comes  down to the physical well-being of our citizens, Republicans have shown  through their actions that they value profits more than lowering the  cost of health care for millions of Americans. In fact, the recent  corporate tax bill passed by the Republican party is have directly  associated with a 15% spike in premiums at the expense of middle- and  working-class Americans. The nonpartisan CBO also reported that another  3 million will be pushed off their coverage altogether.   I have even greater concerns as to how House Republicans are  strengthening families while the GOP Farm Bill that passed last week  will kick at least 2 million people off food stamps, and cut total food  stamp benefits by more than $23 billion. Meanwhile, Republicans refused  to include limits on subsidies provided for crop insurance--one of the  few federal programs without eligibility caps or payment limits.  Moreover, Supplemental Security Income is truly a provider of last  resort and is vital for those who depend on it, yet my colleagues  continue to impose devastating cuts to a program that benefits our most  vulnerable. On the immigration front, Republicans are unwilling to  allow migrant families to remain together and are instead separating  them at our southern border.   Mr. Speaker, these are just a few examples of how what we do here  impacts millions of families all across the country. I believe many of  my colleagues will agree with me that strong families form the  foundation of a strong nation. Any decision on policy, whether economic  or social, should be made to the overall benefit of the everyday  American family. However, we must be extremely careful not to do so at  the expense of millions of middle and lower class Americans who are  already struggling to get by.                            ____________________
