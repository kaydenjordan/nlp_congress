 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  Norwegian Constitution Day. On May 17, 1814, Norway's Constitution was  officially signed, declaring Norway as an independent country.   Mr. Speaker, 207 years later, we remember this important history and  join Norwegians around the globe in celebrating its independence.   I would like to extend our appreciation to the Norwegian-American  community for all the tremendous contributions they make to make  America great.   I would also like to recognize my amazing scheduler, Kristine  Nichols. She is a proud Norwegian-American who recently obtained her  U.S. citizenship. I want Kristine to know that I appreciate all that  she does to keep my office running smoothly and, most importantly, to  keep me sane every day.                            ____________________
