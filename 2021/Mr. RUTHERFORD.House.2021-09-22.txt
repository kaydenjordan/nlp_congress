 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Brain  Aneurysm Awareness Month, the time when we spread awareness of the  signs and symptoms and seek increased research into treatment and  prevention.   Northeast Florida is home to the headquarters of the Trinity Love  Hoblit Foundation, which works to support and fund neurological  research, training, and treatment for brain aneurysms, strokes, and  other cerebrovascular conditions.   Its namesake is Trinity Love Hoblit, who was born with a rare form of  primordial dwarfism and grew to only be 29 inches tall.   Throughout her life she battled brain aneurysms and underwent  numerous surgeries to alleviate the symptoms.   Sadly, Trinity passed away in 2015 and was only 14 years old.   So in honor of Trinity and Brain Aneurysm Awareness Month, please  listen carefully to the risk factors and signs and symptoms of brain  aneurysm.   The risk factors include smoking, high blood pressure, older age,  alcohol, or drug abuse, and family history. The symptoms include  headache, pain above or behind one eye, blurred or double vision,  difficulty speaking or swallowing, numbness or weakness on one side of  the body, and seizures.   Folks, please do not ignore these symptoms and promptly seek medical  care if you experience any of them, especially if you are having the  worst headache of your life.   When it comes to brain aneurysms, awareness is the beginning of  prevention and cure.   On behalf of the Fourth Congressional District of Florida, I am proud  to recognize Brain Aneurysm Awareness Month, and I thank the Trinity  Love Hoblit Foundation for the lives they are helping to save every  day.                   Improving Benefits for First Responders     Madam Speaker, it has been 20 years since terrorists  attacked the United States on September 11.   We have now had a generation to appreciate the courage and sacrifices  so many of our first responders make to keep us safe.   In my 40 years of law enforcement, including 12 as sheriff of Duval  County, I know good officers who have made the ultimate sacrifice in  service to their community.   Twenty years after 9/11, many of our first responders who are  critically injured in the line of duty still have a hard time getting  the benefits that they have earned and sacrificed.   That is why I am proud to cosponsor H.R. 2936, the Protecting  America's First Responder Act.   This bill would improve death and disability benefits for police,  firefighters, and other public safety officers.   This is a commonsense solution to a major problem, and I urge the  Judiciary Committee to immediately consider this bill.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend from Alabama for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this amendment, which would  unnecessarily restrict the Department of Defense from transferring  surplus equipment to local, State, and Federal law enforcement  agencies.   We all remember the tragic Pulse nightclub shooting in my home State  of Florida.   During their response, law enforcement officers set off a controlled  explosion to distract the shooter and used an armored vehicle to breach  the walls of the nightclub to gain entry.   One of the entry officers was literally shot in the head, but his  life was saved by his antiballistic helmet. Now, I believe had the  gentleman across the aisle been an entry officer that night, he might  have a different opinion on the equipment that is necessary at those  scenes.   Under this amendment, those officers would not have had the  explosives, the armored vehicle, or the antiballistic helmet to save  their lives and many more lives that night.    This program works to get our law enforcement officers what they need  to protect themselves and to protect our communities. I always promised  my community that our law enforcement officers would be men and women  of character, well equipped, properly deployed, and skillfully managed.  The 1033 program helps achieve that goal with significant reductions of  cost to hardworking taxpayers. We must not take that away. I urge a  ``no'' vote.
