 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I come to the floor of the Senate  today to remind people what the far-left Democrats want to do with our  healthcare.   I am a doctor. I think it is a right people have to know what the  Democrats are proposing. They are peddling what to me is an extreme  one-size-fits-all healthcare plan. It is a scheme, as I look at it,  because, essentially, Democrats want Washington to take over your  healthcare and my healthcare and the healthcare of all Americans and  actually control all healthcare in this Country. They want to take  private health insurance away from 180 million people who get their  insurance through work.   Under this system, the health plans that many people like will be  gone--not just for today, not just for tomorrow, forever gone. There  will be no more individual plans, just Washington's one-size-fits-all  plan.   Democrats have been lining up to support this socialist scheme all  across the country. Many leading Democrats running for President have  done so. They back it, and 112 Democrats who are Members of the House  of Representatives are behind it as well.   Radical Democrats, led by Senator Bernie Sanders, have decided that  Washington bureaucrats--not you, not me, not your doctor--should call  the shots. What care do you need? Washington, DC, bureaucrats will  decide. How soon will you get the care? Washington, DC bureaucrats will  decide. Where can you get the care? Washington, DC, bureaucrats will  decide.   The problem with this scheme is it will have a dramatic impact in  this country on patient care. As a doctor with decades of experience, I  know Washington shouldn't control your medical decisions. That should  be up to you and members of your family. You should make your own  decisions after you consult with your doctor, not with a faceless  bureaucrat.   For decades, I have given medical health advice on the radio and on  television. Each time, in giving one of these reports, I close with the  line: ``Here in Wyoming, I am Dr. John Barrasso, helping you care for  yourself.''   Helping you care for yourself--you see, you and your doctor are  partners working together, and a good doctor will focus on what is best  for you. Doctors in local communities know who their patients are, and  they know what their patients need.   What doctors don't need is a Washington bureaucrat telling them how  to do their jobs. The point is to protect patient care and to protect  patient choice. For example, Medicare is a medical lifeline for our  seniors. Still, with 60 million people relying on Medicare, the program  is being stretched to the breaking point.   Waste, fraud, and abuse have made the problem worse. In 2018, the  Government Accountability Office found $48 billion in improper Medicare  payments. The government's watchdog wants reforms, and we need reforms  to protect our seniors, so we must strengthen this vital program for  our seniors.   Just think if we pack every American into one government system,  which is what the Democrats are proposing. They call it Medicare for  All, which would quickly become Medicare for None. One-size-fits-all  care will kill the doctor-patient relationship.   This massive plan is expected to cost a dramatic amount of money.  Those who looked into this have estimated the cost to be $32 trillion.  It is a hard number to comprehend. And that is just for the first 10  years.   Washington is going to have to find ways--and they will be looking  for ways--to save money, and we have heard what ways they will be. The  Wall Street Journal notes that any savings would have to come from  cutting payments to doctors, cutting payments to providers, cutting  payments to hospitals, and restricting care. They are talking about  rationing care--limiting the care that you need, that you want, that  the government now will say you cannot have.   The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office looked at this. They  agree. They say ``the public plan might not be as quick to meet  patients' needs.'' It may not be as quick to meet patients' needs? So  you are diagnosed with cancer, and they are not going to be quick  enough to face your needs? Care will be rationed both in treatment and  in technology.   Democrats, of course, don't want you to know about healthcare  rationing. You need to know. You have a right to know. You deserve to  know what they are proposing. The care you get will be entirely the  government's call because the Democrats' plan bans all private  insurance in the country. If you have it through work, you will lose  it.   What about paying your doctor directly for services? Well, Washington  Democrats have a plan for that. They want to put an end to that as  well. Doctors would have to leave the government-run system. They  couldn't take care of any other patients who are on that system if they  entered into a private contract with individual patients.   Even the Washington Post newspaper admits the plan has problems. The  Post recently ran this headline: ``No matter what Sanders says, there's  no Medicare-for-all without tradeoffs.''   I agree. And the tradeoffs could turn out to be fatal. Democrats'  one-size-fits-all healthcare means you will pay more to wait longer for  worse care.   As a Senator and a doctor, my focus continues to be on improving  patient  [[Page S3347]]  care. Real healthcare reform is needed in this country. Reforms are  needed to lower the costs without lowering the standards. Regrettably,  what the Democrats are proposing lowers the standards and raises the  costs--the exact opposite of what is so vitally important for all of  us.   These are the issues that Republicans are working on right now:  empowering you to buy coverage that works for you, lowering the cost of  your prescription drugs, protecting you when you have a preexisting  condition, and eliminating surprise medical bills. But with the  Democrats' one-size-fits-all care, you would lose the insurance you get  through work, and you would lose Medicare Advantage if you are a senior  who is one of the 20 million people who gets their insurance through  that program.   They call it Medicare Advantage because there are advantages for  seniors who are on it. It coordinates care. There is preventive care.  Those are the advantages.   You will likely lose the doctor-patient relationship that you have  depended on for years and lose the freedom to make your own medical  decisions.   I say it is time to reject this one-size-fits-all scheme that would  make all of us pay more and wait longer for worse care. Instead, let's  work together to give patients the care they need from a doctor they  choose, and do it at lower costs.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I have 2 requests for committees to meet  during today's session of the Senate. They have the approval of the  Majority and Minority leaders.
