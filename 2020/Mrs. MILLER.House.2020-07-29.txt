 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize my friend and  former colleague Mr. Shirley Love, who passed away on July 17, 2020.   Born in May 1933 to Earl and Winona Love, Shirley was named after the  popular West Virginia newspaper columnist, Shirley Donnelly.  Unbeknownst at the time, he was also destined for media greatness.   For 45 years, Shirley worked at WOAY-TV station entertaining and  informing many. He is known for becoming one of southern West  Virginia's first nightly TV news anchors, and with his terrific voice,  Shirley was a welcomed radio presence in households throughout the  region, ultimately landing him in the West Virginia Broadcasting Hall  of Fame.   After retiring from WOAY, he selflessly represented Fayette County in  the State legislature for 16 years. Appointed by Governor Caperton to  the senate, Shirley eventually moved to the house of delegates, where I  had the honor to work alongside him.   Shirley constantly lived up to his reputation of integrity and  honesty. He will always be remembered by his family, friends, and  countless people he impacted throughout his life.   I send my sincerest condolences to his wife, Audrey, his children,  and his grandchildren.   May God bless Shirley Love.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman DeFazio and Ranking Member  Graves.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this year's bipartisan Water  Resources Development Act.   Our country was built on an elaborate system of inland waterways,  ports, and harbors to facilitate trade and transportation. And nearly  every community in our country relies on open waterways to move their  products.   My district is no exception. We are home to the Port of Huntington  Tri-State on the Ohio River. This interconnected water system creates  jobs and ensures that Appalachia remains a competitive region of  economic growth.  [[Page H3958]]    As we rethink and reform America's supply chains post-COVID, we must  continue to open, update, and modernize key water infrastructure to  maintain safety and efficiency. WRDA investments secure this mission.   WRDA also delivers protection from hurricanes and flooding. In my  district in southern West Virginia, we saw disaster strike in 2016 when  our dams overflowed, and our rivers tore through many vibrant  communities. As we recover and rebuild, we must also prepare for the  future.   If we pass this bill, we can double the funding for flood protection  in central West Virginia and triple the funding in southern West  Virginia. The vast majority of American communities lie along key U.S.  waterways. And while I work for my district, countless others will also  see increased protections.   Mr. Speaker, for the good of our country, I implore my colleagues to  vote ``yes.''
