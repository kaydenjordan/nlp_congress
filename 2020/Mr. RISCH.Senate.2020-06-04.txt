 Mr. President, I would like 3 minutes to close the debate  on Michael Pack.    Mr. President and fellow Senators, we are about to do the  final vote on Michael Pack. This man is uniquely qualified to hold this  position. He has done an outstanding job. Everyone should look at the  most recent documentary he did on the Supreme Court. It was just  outstanding.   There has been a political fight over him for 2 years and 1 day.  Today is the moment of truth. It is time to vote on Mr. Pack. Debate is  closed.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.
