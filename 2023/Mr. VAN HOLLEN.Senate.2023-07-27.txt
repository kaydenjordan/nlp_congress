 Mr. President, I concur with many of my colleagues  that spending on defense is important to meet our national security  needs and support our allies like Ukraine. My State of Maryland plays  an important role in bolstering national defense, advancing critical  research, and supporting our military, and I strongly support the work  of our bases.   However, it is clear to me that we as a country are not spending our  money wisely. The defense budget has grown considerably and, despite  its size, has not passed an independent audit. Admiral Mike Mullin, the  former Chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said in reference to  defense spending that ``with the increasing defense budget, which is  almost double, it hasn't forced us to make the hard trades. It hasn't  forced us to prioritize.''   While I do not believe that across-the-board cuts are ever the best  way to reduce spending, I voted in favor of the Sanders amendment to  send a message that we need to put our defense dollars to much better  use and make the hard choices necessary to right-size our defense  spending.
