 Mr. President, I wish to recognize a friend and  colleague, Mary Skeens, who has been a tireless advocate for affordable  housing for West Virginians. Mary is retiring as the executive director  of Community Works where she has spent the last 12 of her 40-year  housing career.   A native of Kentucky, Mary realized at an early age that not every  family in a warm, secure home. Her pressing concern for the living  conditions of her classmates and peers led her into a career in  housing. In 1990, her husband, Jim, had a desire to return to his  family farm in Roane County, WV. This allowed Jim to return to his  Mountaineer roots, and Mary embraced her new adopted home State and  entered the housing profession.   Mary started her housing career as manager at a senior living high- rise apartment complex in Dunbar. She was later offered a position at  the West Virginia Housing Development Fund as the head of the community  development office overseeing the newly-created HOME Program during  President Clinton's Administration. Mary worked with nonprofit housing  agencies all over West Virginia in an effort to qualify as them as  community Housing Development Organizations, also known as a CHDOs.  Over the next 10 years, Mary worked with numerous housing providers to  develop many worthwhile projects that serve West Virginians to this  day, creating domestic violence shelters, affordable multifamily rental  complexes, and affordable housing subdivisions in underserved areas of  our State. Mary is well known throughout West Virginia for her housing  finance skills and her ability to provide much-needed technical  assistance.   In 2007, Mary became executive director of Community Works in West  Virginia. This agency was newly created and in its early years of  operation. Community Works is a licensed mortgage lender providing home  ownership loans, owner occupied rehabilitation loans, and a commercial  loan program to its nonprofit housing member organizations. Mary  stepped in and grew the agency by expanding its reach. This agency's  work can be seen in most every housing development in the State through  its loan programs and outreach. In addition to providing affordable  financing opportunities, Mary has overseen many initiatives to improve  housing policy and awareness that will affect this industry for years  to come. She has also dedicated much time serving on many housing  related boards of directors, and, as a result of her work, was inducted  into the West Virginia Affordable Housing Hall of Fame in 2012.   Mary has accomplished so much in her years of service to West  Virginia's housing community. I would like to thank Mary for aiding our  State and its residents by providing safe, decent, and affordable  housing to so many citizens who could not have afforded it otherwise.   Thank you for working with me and my staff over the years to serve as  a resource on housing policy. I wish you well in your retirement. It is  truly an honor to call you a friend and fellow West Virginian.                            ____________________
