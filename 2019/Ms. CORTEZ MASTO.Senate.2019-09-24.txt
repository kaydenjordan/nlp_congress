 Madam President, I come forward today to  recognize the 100th anniversary of the Reno + Sparks Chamber of  Commerce. In 1890, the Reno Commercial Club and Reno Business League  were born out of a need to enhance the city of Reno as a commercial  center. In 1919, the two merged to form the Reno Chamber of Commerce,  and in 1970, the chamber expanded to include the city of Sparks. In  2018, the Latino Chamber of Commerce merged with the Reno + Sparks  Chamber of Commerce to provide wider representation for the community's  diversity of businesses and people.   Today, the Reno + Sparks Chamber of Commerce is the largest business  organization in northern Nevada with over 1,800 registered businesses  that employ over 85,000 individuals in Washoe County. The Chamber has  42 ambassadors, as well as volunteers from a wide variety of industries  who meet monthly to celebrate success stories and aid in event  planning. The chamber also delivers more than 4 million annual leads  and referrals through its online directory and offers free educational  programs, training events, and countless opportunities for member  connectivity. Through the Reno + Sparks Leadership Program, now in its  34th year with 1,100 alumni, the chamber cultivates leaders by  providing opportunities to volunteer and support the community while  immersing participants in the issues and challenges of the region. It  also hosts elected officials and issues its public policy platform each  State legislative session to advocate on behalf of free enterprise and  a robust economy.   Since 1919, the Reno + Sparks Chamber of Commerce has advocated on  behalf of all businesses, provided resources and support to its  members, and connected its members with new customers and partners. The  northern Nevada economic landscape is stronger and more diverse because  of the Reno + Sparks Chamber of Commerce's many efforts to support  local leaders and small businesses throughout the region.   Through booms and busts, the Reno + Sparks Chamber of Commerce has  been a steadfast force in our community. From ribbon-cutting ceremonies  to its long-running leadership program, the Reno + Sparks Chamber of  Commerce has been a reliable and valuable resource for northern  Nevadans. Its dedication to economic prosperity and communal  inclusivity for northern Nevada has stood for a century, and I am  excited to see what they have in store for the next 100 years.                            ____________________
