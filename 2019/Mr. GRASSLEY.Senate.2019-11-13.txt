 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 1  minute as in morning business.    Mr. President, November is National Adoption Month.  This year, we have very good news.   In 2018, over 63,000 young people were adopted from foster care. That  is an increase of 4,000 from the previous year. However, the number of  children waiting for adoption also increased. That number rose to  125,000. Unfortunately, teenagers, sibling groups, and those with  medical challenges often wait much longer to be adopted. Every child  deserves a safe, permanent, loving home, so I want to commend all those  who have chosen to adopt children in foster care.   If you wonder where I get the opinion that it is unfortunate that  people want a permanent, safe, and loving home, all you have to do is  listen to the kids in the foster care system, and you always get this  response: What I would like to have is a mom and dad, and I would like  to have a home. In other words, they get tired of being shuffled around  from one foster home to another foster home, to another foster home.  That is where I come from in recognizing November as National Adoption  Month.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I have the  right to yield to Senator Collins at the end of my remarks.    Mr. President, polls show a surprising interest of  Americans in the high cost of prescription drugs. It seems to be an  issue that unites Americans. I often point out that Washington is an  island surrounded by reality. Here inside the Beltway, people are  obsessed with partisan impeachment proceedings. It seems like morning,  noon, and night, the relentless effort to unseat the President of the  United States is a toxic strain of Potomac fever infecting Capitol  Hill.   Now, if only Congress would channel every waking minute to fix  problems in the real world, wouldn't that be wonderful? So let me  provide a reality check. For people living in the real world,  impeachment inquiry is not what keeps Americans up at night. It is not  what wakes up moms and dads worried sick about paying for their child's  insulin. It is not what drains the pocketbooks of seniors and takes a  big bite out of people's paychecks. The issue that unites Americans  from Maine, to Iowa, to Oregon is the sky-high prices that Americans  and the taxpaying public are paying for prescription medicine.   As chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, I am working in a  bipartisan way to fix what is broken in our drug supply chain. In  February, we called the heads of Big Pharma to testify before the  Finance Committee. Next, we heard from the largest pharmacy benefit  managers to examine rebates and unravel the pricing supply chain. There  was an awful lot of finger-pointing between the various interests about  the soaring drug prices that Americans pay for pharmaceuticals. That  finger-pointing, we heard in our committee. Finger-pointing doesn't  decrease drug prices because the real problem is there is too much  secrecy and not enough accountability in the industry of pricing drugs.   When drug prices grow by leaps and bounds, year after year, it is  time to look under the hood. It is time to kick the tires along the  drug supply chain and check the gauge on the competition. Why in the  world is insulin, just as an example--a drug that has been on the  market for nearly 100 years--doubling or tripling in price for patients  in the United States? It is surely not that way in Europe.   We have gotten lots of feedback from patient advocates, healthcare  providers, and free market proponents. The pushback from Big Pharma  reveals that we are really on to something. Congress needs to take its  foot off the brake. It is time to deliver real savings, and our bill  will deliver real savings to consumers and to the taxpayers. It is time  to pass reforms that will cut prescription drug costs for the American  people.   Now, some of my colleagues may require a more blunt call to action so  I want to use the two-by-four illustration. Join us and score a win for  the American people. Otherwise, do nothing and risk being on the losing  side of the ballot box next November.   At my annual 99 county meetings where I always hold a Q&A with  whatever groups of constituents gather, I hear the same message from  people all across the State of Iowa. They have family members and they  have neighbors who struggle to pay for prescription management, to  manage chronic health conditions, and to treat diseases. Thanks to  breakthrough treatments and cures, Americans are living longer and  healthier lives.   Many are beating the odds of a diagnosis that would have been a death  sentence a generation ago. However, if a loved one is diagnosed with MS  or diabetes or cystic fibrosis, no miracle cure will help if Americans  can't afford to pay for their medicine. It will not help seniors if  sky-high prices drain taxpayer-financed health programs like Medicare  and Medicaid. Soaring drug prices are forcing too many Americans to  skimp on other necessities or even ration their doses of prescriptions  that they take.   Now, I just mentioned, as an example, cystic fibrosis. Last month,  the FDA approved a promising new treatment for this progressive genetic  disorder. Cystic fibrosis impacts about 30,000 Americans. There is  nothing parents will not do to advocate for their child living with  this condition. That is how I met one family from Iowa a few  [[Page S6526]]  years ago. That is when I launched the bipartisan Senate caucus on  cystic fibrosis, to add our voices for awareness and advocacy. Now, I  am told the price tag for the new drug is more than $300,000 per  patient, per year.   Without a doubt, this drug raises the roof of hope for tens of  thousands of families, but it also raises a red flag about drug prices.  If prices keep going through the roof year after year, how will  Americans who depend on prescription medicines afford them? America's  drug pricing regime is broken. It requires reform to sustain fiscal  sustainability and also to steer incubation and innovation forward. It  needs more transparency. It needs better incentives. It needs real  competition to drive down prices. So all 100 of us have our work cut  out for us.    Big Pharma doesn't want the pipeline to the Federal Treasury  tightened at all, and they will spend big money to scare people away  from reasonable solutions that will deliver real savings and get the  best deal for the taxpayers. I referred to our working in a bipartisan  way. So, in July, Ranking Member Wyden and I secured broad, bipartisan  support in our Finance Committee--19 denying vote.   Our bill would save taxpayers more than $100 billion. That is not  this Senate saying that. That is the Congressional Budget Office. The  bill caps out-of-pocket costs for seniors. The bill saves their  households more than $30 billion. We fine-tuned and improved our bill  to gain more momentum and more support. Part of that support and one of  the outstanding advocates for what we are trying to do doesn't happen  to be a member of the Finance Committee, but it is my good friend from  Maine, Senator Collins, right here on the floor. I will yield to her in  short time.   She is helping lead the fight to reduce drug prices. We have been  working together on many issues. I am a former chairman of the Special  Committee on Aging, and she is the current chair of the Special  Committee on Aging. We are committed to help older Americans lead  productive lives. We also share a top priority not to miss a vote.  While I might have a stronger voting streak, Susan hasn't missed a  single vote. I hope Maine appreciates a person who has been in the  Senate since 1997 and hasn't missed a single vote.   Senator Collins is one of those rare lawmakers who doesn't care who  gets the credit, as long as we are doing the right thing. The name of  this bill that I am talking about--and I imagine she will refer to--is  the Prescription Drug Pricing Reduction Act. That will be the right  thing to do, and it will do the right thing. So it is time for Congress  to do the right thing.   Just in case I said anything different about Senator Collins that is  not accurate, she can feel free to correct me, but I now yield to  Senator Collins, a strong voice for this piece of legislation.    Mr. President, first of all, it is a pleasure to work  with Senator Shaheen on this bill. I am very happy to work together. We  have the same goals in mind. For the cynical people outside of  Washington, DC, that say there is never any Republican or Democratic  cooperation, there is kind of a rule around here that Senator Shaheen  and I are examples of, but it applies to all 100 Senators.   If you really want to get something done, you have to seek  bipartisanship in this body. I can quantify that in this way. There are  53 Republicans. There are 47 Democrats. But if there were 53 Democrats  and 47 Republicans, the same rule would apply.   About 99 percent of the legislation that gets done around here has to  have 60 votes to stop debate before you can even vote on the bill. So  obviously, even if all 53 Republicans were voting together--and that  doesn't happen very often--you still wouldn't get the 60 votes to pass  a piece of legislation. So that is why almost every major piece of  legislation that gets through here--and this example of Shaheen- Grassley is just another example--it is because you seek  bipartisanship, and it is just nice that it has to be that way.   So addressing this issue, I can say I associate myself with the  remarks of Senator Shaheen and sit down, but there is kind of a rule  around the Senate. Everything that has been said on this bill has been  said, but I haven't said it yet, and I am going to say it.   I recently introduced S. 2770, known as the Survivors' Bill of Rights  in the States Act of 2019, with Senator Shaheen and Senator Tillis.  This measure is a companion to what Congresswoman Speier developed and  introduced in the other Chamber. It builds on legislation entitled the  Survivors' Bill of Rights Act that we adopted in 2016.   As chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee in the last Congress, I  worked closely with a young woman, Amanda Nguyen, on the development of  that 2016 measure prior to its introduction. Amanda, a survivor of  sexual assault, found and leads the nonprofit organization known as  Rise, R-I-S-E.   She also worked with Senator Shaheen on the same legislation,  introducing the final version in this Chamber. We incorporated that  2016 package of rights into an amendment that I offered to another  measure before the Senate Judiciary Committee. In May 2016, that  legislation passed this Chamber 89 to 0. In October 2016, the House  version, which was introduced later, was signed by the President.   The bills that we introduced this month on the 2016 Survivors' Bill  of Rights, it makes each State eligible to receive a Federal grant to  implement a similar package of rights for victims of sex crimes at the  State level. Such rights include, for example, the right to know the  results of your forensic exam, the right to have evidence preserved for  a certain period, and the right to notice before your forensic kit is  destroyed.   A State also may use its Justice Department grants to preserve sexual  assault evidence kits, reduce the number of kits awaiting testing, and  extend additional assistance to crime victims under our legislation.  Finally, the measure we introduced authorizes 20 million annually for  each of the fiscal years 2021 through 2024 to support the  implementation of the new grant program established by this bill. I  urge my colleagues to join us in cosponsoring the Survivors' Bill of  Rights in the States Act of 2019.   I thank Senator Shaheen for joining in this effort and leading this  bill and, most importantly, to compliment her over a long period of  time in the Senate--and probably even before she came to the Senate-- her commitment to working with me and with people generally on the  issue of increased protection for victims of sexual assault.   Again, I thank Congresswoman Speier and her staff for initiating this  measure in the House and for working so hard to develop a bicameral,  bipartisan measure, and I thank Senator Shaheen once again.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, this week I introduced S. 2838 with  Senators Ernst, Blackburn, Sullivan, Murkowski, and Perdue. This  legislation, which we have titled the SAFESPORT Act of 2019, includes  funding accountability, antiretaliation protection, child abuse  reporting, and other reform measures.   I want to take this opportunity to thank the Commerce Committee  members who lead the Senate subcommittee with jurisdiction over the Ted  Stevens Act, along with Commerce Committee Chairman Wicker, for  including so much of my SAFESPORT Act as an amendment to a larger  package that they developed. That measure is S. 2330, the Empowering  Olympic and Amateur Athletes Act of 2019, sponsored by Senators Moran  and Blumenthal.   Senators Moran and Blumenthal worked closely with me to secure the  inclusion of multiple provisions of my SAFESPORT Act in their bill,  which cleared the Commerce Committee this morning with unanimous  bipartisan support. Every one of these provisions is designed to ensure  that the U.S. Center for SafeSport, which is tasked by Congress with  investigating abuse of athletes in amateur sports, continues on its  current track of excellence. I extend my sincere appreciation to both  subcommittee leaders for their hard work on S. 2330 and for  collaborating with me to improve their bipartisan bill.   First, the SAFESPORT Act would enhance child abuse reporting, by  ensuring that the Center for SafeSport is subject to the same mandatory  reporting requirements as other professionals who work with children,  under the Federal Victims of Child Abuse Act. By law, this center is  tasked with receiving and investigating complaints of sexual abuse in  amateur sports, which is why its personnel should have to report  suspected crimes against children to the authorities.   Second, this bill ensures that the Center for SafeSport, a private  organization that already receives millions annually in revenue from  the Olympic community--and which would receive $20 million annually, at  the direction of Congress, if the Moran-Bhimenthal bill is enacted--is  subject to an annual audit by an independent auditor. Such an audit is  highly recommended by charity watchdog groups for the highest  functioning nonprofit organizations. It is also a standard requirement  for almost any nonprofit charitable organization receiving Federal  grant awards of more than $750,000 annually. My legislation also calls  for the Center for SafeSport to implement any corrective actions  recommended by the auditor each year or explain why it disagrees with  the recommendations.   Third, this legislation subjects the Center for SafeSport to certain  transparency requirements, ensuring, for example, that this  organization reports to Congress annually with a detailed account of  its activities, any changes in its financial standing, and a corrective  action plan to implement auditor recommendations, if any. We are  entitled to know how many complaints the organization investigates and  resolves using the millions of dollars it receives from the U.S.  Olympic community each year. Such information would be made available  to the public, under the SAFESPORT Act.   The Commerce Committee included all of these accountability,  transparency, and child abuse reporting provisions, as well as the  antiretaliation language of my SAFESPORT Act in the package it approved  today. That antiretaliation language, on which I collaborated with  Senator Peters, protects whistleblowers who come forward and report  abuses in amateur sports. I thank Senator Peters for his collaboration  on that language. I am delighted  [[Page S6545]]  we made this progress and look forward to working with the committee to  ensure it is enacted.   The only language that the committee did not accept, due to  jurisdictional concerns raised by Senators Blumenthal and Moran, was  the grant accountability language in the SAFESPORT Act. One section of  my bill, which bars nonprofits receiving Justice Department grants from  stashing funds in offshore accounts for tax avoidance purposes, among  other requirements, has cleared the Judiciary Committee with bipartisan  support on multiple occasions. Chairman Graham approved its inclusion  in the Commerce package, and Ranking Member Feinstein has cosponsored  similar language on multiple occasions. So I am disappointed that these  reforms were omitted from S. 2330 today. Senators Blackburn and  Sullivan, who joined with me in seeking the inclusion of that grant  accountability language in that Commerce Committee package today, have  called for adding it to S. 2330 before its floor consideration.   I look forward to working with the leaders of the Commerce Committee  to achieve that goal. The only other key provision of my SAFESPORT Act  that was not included in S. 2330 would enable the Attorney General to  seek the removal of officers and directors of the Center for SafeSport,  in the event these individuals engage in serious misconduct or material  violations of the Ted Stevens Act.   I urge my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring S. 2838, the  SAFESPORT Act, which is so important to ensure that the organization  tasked by Congress with protecting amateur athletes retains its  current, high standard of excellence. I, again, thank Senator Peters as  well as my cosponsors, particularly Senators Blackburn and Sullivan,  for helping me negotiate for the inclusion of so many provisions of the  SAFESPORT Act in the bipartisan measure that cleared the Commerce  Committee. I also want to thank my committee staff, including Kolan  Davis, Evelyn Fortier, Rachael Soloway, and Dario Camacho for their  hard work on this measure. Finally, I thank the organizations, such as  Fairness, Dignity & Respect for Crime Victims & Survivors Project,  which endorsed this legislation, as well as the Athletes Advisory  Council, which worked with us on the antiretaliation provisions.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a fallen  soldier from Iowa, Private Channing Robert Whitaker. After 76 years,  this marine is finally coming home. Inspired by the patriotism and  service of his four older siblings who also served during World War II,  Whitaker enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps in 1942 at the age of 17.  After completing training, his unit deployed on November 20, 1943  during the  [[Page S6563]]  D-Day operations at Tarawa Atoll in the Pacific. On November 22, 1943,  Whitaker was killed in action during the effort to secure Betio Island  in the Tarawa Atoll. He was 18 years old. During this battle, over  3,000 U.S. marines and sailors were killed or wounded. After the war  was over, there were efforts to repatriate all of the fallen; however,  almost half of the known casualties were not recovered.   In March of this year, thanks to the efforts of History Flight, Inc.,  the Republic of Kiribati, and the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency,  Whitaker's remains were identified. On November 22, 2019, 76 years  after he gave the last full measure of devotion in service to his  country, Channing Whitaker will be buried with full military honors in  Des Moines, IA.   Our country owes a debt of gratitude to all who have served in  defense of our country and especially to those who killed in action. I  am grateful that this Iowan is finally coming home and that his service  and sacrifice will always be remembered.                            ____________________
