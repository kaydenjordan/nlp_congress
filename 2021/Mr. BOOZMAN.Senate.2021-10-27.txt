 Mr. President, beginning in his first days in office,  President Biden paused all oil and gas leasing on Federal lands and  then killed the thousands of jobs supported by the Keystone XL  Pipeline. Fast forward to today, prices at the pump are more than 40  percent increased from a year ago. Home heating costs have increased by  more than 20 percent going into the winter.   Under President Biden's new policies, instead of reducing this burden  on hard-working Arkansans, President Biden has made it clear that his  agenda trumps the needs of American families and is doubling down with  his new reckless, energy-destroying spending bill that will only  increase these costs.   This far-left Democrat wish list makes the undeliverable promises,  proposes to dramatically drive up costs for every American, would  eliminate thousands of jobs in the energy sector, and would accelerate  our already rapid inflation.   This is not a realistic approach to address our country's  environmental energy needs. Heavyhanded rules that reduced energy  supplies are likewise counterproductive.   We should not turn our back on the existing energy sources that we  have in North America that lower gas prices and reduce our dependence  on oil from unstable regions. American manufacturers need long-term  access to affordable energy so our country can compete globally against  nations with much lower environmental standards. Also, in the event of  a national security or energy crisis, for example, access to our  resources will be essential.   Bureaucratic overreach and unwarranted spending will not only drive  up energy costs on consumers but will also do the most harm to low- and  middle-income families. Think of the impact this would have on single  moms and seniors on fixed incomes. These families are most affected by  burdensome regulations and can least afford a costly, unworkable energy  policy.  [[Page S7403]]    We must continue to use an all-of-the-above approach to diversify our  Nation's energy portfolio. Working to increase exploration and  production of natural gas and oil, continuing the development and use  of coal, along with support for renewable and nuclear energy, should  all play a role in our national energy strategy. America's energy  supply should be diverse, stable, and affordable.   President Biden is pushing hard to get Congress to agree to his plans  in time for this week's climate summit. It is fitting that the summit  is in Scotland, as European nations have shown us the dangers in  addressing climate change the wrong way.   Poorly conceived mandates to eliminate fossil fuels have resulted in  a cavalcade of problems for agriculture across the continent.   Surging natural gas prices have resulted in fertilizer plants  closing, created a food-grade CO2 shortage crisis that is  hurting pork and poultry processing. Beverage producers are also facing  the same challenge getting CO2, leading to the likely  scenario of widespread disruption across the food and beverage sector.   Our friends in the UK went heavy on wind power only to have the wind  stop blowing, forcing energy companies to scramble for gas reserves,  and consumers to face much higher bills.   As ranking member on the Agriculture Committee, I take these warnings  very, very seriously. The President's plan would be an absolute gut  punch to our Nation's family farmers and rural America as a whole,  especially as inflation continues to skyrocket under this  administration's watch.   The cost of farming is on the rise. Land, fuel, seed, fertilizer, and  livestock feed prices are all increasing. Soaring costs of inputs come  at a time when the farm economy had only recently begun to turn a  corner. Now with further increases, farmers, once again, face the  possibility of a downturn in the farm economy as profits dwindle.   Propane--heavily relied upon in rural America for agricultural  production and home heating--has seen prices almost double this year.  In fact, market experts are predicting an ``Armageddon'' as we head  toward the winter. Now President Biden and his allies in Congress would  enact policies that double down on economic hardship by eliminating  affordable sources of energy, particularly those relied upon in rural  America.   Much of the President's agenda comes directly from the Green New  Deal, a far-left agenda that most Americans have roundly rejected.  Working with President Trump, we successfully fought off the Green New  Deal. Now President Biden wants to resurrect it and rebrand it as  ``Build Back Better.''   Given the troubles Democrats have had writing their bill, it seems  that America doesn't want it either.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to  outstanding educator Jessica Saum, who was named 2022 Arkansas Teacher  of the Year.   As a special education teacher at Stagecoach Elementary in Cabot, AR,  Jessica has demonstrated her excellence in the classroom time and time  again by helping each student reach their full potential.   She has provided unique opportunities for her students and engaged  with the community to bring learning to life in her classroom. The  creativity she brings to each lesson allows her students to learn and  grow in exciting and distinct ways.   Just as impressive is the commitment that Jessica exudes beyond the  [[Page S7415]]  classroom. She was recognized as the 2020 314th Airlift Wing Key Spouse  of the Year at the Little Rock Air Force Base for her volunteer work.  Mrs. Saum is a remarkable military spouse, teacher, and advocate for  children with special needs.   Her passion for and commitment to education can be seen by Jessica's  own pursuit of learning. She obtained a bachelor of science in early  childhood and special education, a master of science in special  education educational specialist (4-12), and a graduate certificate as  a special education director from Arkansas State University.   We are fortunate to have Jessica representing the many great teachers  in Arkansas, as well as serving as a role model to future generations  of Natural State educators.   I congratulate Jessica for this achievement and all of her  contributions to her community and our State. Her determination,  devotion, and commitment to her students and the field of education, in  addition to her support for our military members and their families, is  exemplary. I am encouraged by her efforts to inspire our future  generations and her passion to help them to succeed.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the 75th  anniversary of KHOZ.   When KHOZ was established in 1946, its founders were dedicated to the  task of bringing the people of Boone County a quality radio program for  the whole family. That became a reality on September 28, 1946, when the  station aired its first broadcast.   These hard-working Arkansans connected Boone County, as the county's  first radio station began sharing news, sports programming, and music  with citizens in the region.   Today, the staff at KHOZ continues this task, having successfully  earned the admiration and trust of the Harrison community. This radio  station has been a staple in the area, from providing jobs to keeping  its listeners informed and bringing good times and good music over the  airwaves. KHOZ has remained a source of comfort and joy for so many  Harrison residents, and I am confident it will continue to do so for  many years.   To recognize this milestone, the KHOZ team has thoughtfully put  together a video documentary commemorating its staff's many years of  dedication to bettering the station and the community. The documentary  showcases the familiar hosts and the stories they have shared with  family, friends and coworkers. It also highlights the rich history of  the station and follows its growth over the years. I am honored to have  been able to contribute to this celebration.   KHOZ's commitment to the community and its listeners is a testament  to this station's values and dedication to the vision of its founders.  By instilling a sense of familiarity over the years, listeners have  connected with the station and developed special relationships with  their favorite hosts. This public service has become a cherished piece  of the region's history and daily life.   Congratulations to KHOZ on its 75th anniversary and for the countless  memories it has created for its listeners. I look forward to its  continued success for years to come.                            ____________________
