 Madam President, yesterday the Senate took another  step toward delivering an important package of legislation. We passed  my amendment to Strengthening America's Security in the Middle East Act  and voted to advance the bill, both by very wide bipartisan margins. S.  1 represents the broad consensus of this body about our Nation's  responsibilities as an ally and a partner. It reaffirms our promise to  uphold Israel's security, to help Jordan face complex security  challenges, and to hold Bashar al-Assad's murderous henchmen  accountable.   I look forward to the Senate voting on final passage soon and sending  this bipartisan legislation over to the House.   After we complete that work, the Senate will return to the Natural  Resources Management Act, a high-priority bill containing more than 100  proposals concerning economic development, public lands, water  resources, and conservation.                            ____________________     Madam President, on another matter, tonight Congress  will host President Trump for his second State of the Union Address. I  am looking forward to attending and hearing the President reflect on  the great strides our Nation has made over the past 2 years and his  vision for the challenges that are still before us.   From historic tax reform and regulatory reform, to huge progress in  the fight against ISIS, to landmark progress in the nationwide fight  against opioid addiction, the story over the last 2 years has been one  of immense policy progress for our country.   The American people are less interested in beltway melodrama and more  interested in the classic question: Am I better off than I was 2 years  ago? On this front, thanks to a few key Republican victories and a  number of major bipartisan accomplishments, the state of the Union is  strong and growing stronger.   It has now been more than 2 years since the American people hired  President Trump and a Republican Congress to get Washington's foot off  the brake of our economy. Since then, we got to work rebuilding the  middle-class prosperity that had hollowed out communities across  America under the Obama economy.   After 8 years of watching leftwing policies disproportionately  benefit coastal cities and our Nation's largest metro areas while  mostly leaving small cities, small towns, suburbs, and rural America  behind, the American people wanted a change.   That is exactly what the last 2 years' policies have delivered.  Historic tax reform delivered higher take-home pay and helped breathe  life into the engine of American job creation and innovation. Landmark  regulatory reform cut burdensome compliance costs for small businesses,  reigned in Federal overreach on education policy, and defended  Americans' rights of conscience.   So what are these policies doing for the American people? I think the  answer is pretty clear. All those Americans who had been struggling to  find work? Well, today a higher percentage of Americans are working  than were ever working at any point under President Obama. For the  first time in modern recorded history, we have reached and stayed at a  level where there are more job openings nationwide than Americans  looking for jobs.   Listen to these headlines: ``Employers' Hiring Push Brings Workers  Off the Bench.'' ``Disability Applications Plunge as the Economy  Strengthens.''   Listen to this, from one news article:         The tighter labor market is delivering opportunities to a       broad swath of workers who were disproportionately affected       by the last recession. Unemployment has fallen sharply for       blacks, Latinos, younger workers and those without a college       education . . . [and] the deeper jobs pool has been       particularly crucial for improving the economic outlook for       disabled Americans.    These and many more Americans have been able to find work, but what  about Americans who already had jobs but felt like their families were  treading water and needed to get ahead?   Last year, the amount of money employers spent compensating American  workers--those already working--grew  [[Page S842]]  at its fastest pace in more than 10 years. Thanks to tax reform, when  many working families and small businesses file under the new Tax Code,  they will see less of their money has been sent off to the IRS.   So there are more jobs to choose from, more wage growth, and higher  take-home pay following tax cuts, but it is also worth looking at where  this new prosperity is going.   The last administration's leftwing policies disproportionately  benefited the Nation's largest metropolitan areas. It turns out,  policies dreamt up in places like New York and San Francisco worked  pretty well in places like New York and San Francisco, but the rest of  the country decided we could do better.   Today businesses on Main Street and family farms are dusting off  their ``Help Wanted'' signs. Smaller cities and States like Indiana,  Nebraska, and Ohio have so many job openings that some of these  communities are offering sizeable cash bonuses to move there. Smaller  communities and rural America recently outpaced the rest of the country  in relative job creation. So it is an all-American comeback, and the  kinds of places liberal policies left behind are now at the front of  the pack.   I have focused this morning on our robust economy. It is helping  American families lift themselves higher, but it is just one part of  the success story the President will be able to tell tonight.   The last 2 years have seen the White House and the Congress work  together to identify pressing national challenges and to develop big  bipartisan compromise solutions to attack them head-on. Working  together, both parties collaborated on more than a dozen targeted  measures to improve access to quality care for our Nation's veterans  and passed landmark legislation to help local communities heal the  wounds created by opioid addiction.   I am delighted to have one of these local champions as my guest  tonight. Lisa Minton is leading on the frontlines of Kentucky's battle  against opioid abuse. She runs the Chrysalis House, a treatment  facility for pregnant and new mothers fighting addiction in Lexington.   In 2017, I worked with Lisa to secure a $2.6 million grant to expand  their services for low-income women and their children. I am glad she  will be in the House Chamber this evening, and I am proud to highlight  her amazing work this morning.   Working together, a bipartisan majority ended the harmful spending  caps that hampered military readiness and made major progress restoring  regular order appropriations on behalf of the American taxpayer. A  bipartisan majority delivered commonsense relief for local lenders on  Main Street from the burden of regulations designed for Wall Street.   These are just a few examples, and it is a good thing we know we can  tap into that bipartisan spirit because the American people did not  hire us to spend the next 2 years in total gridlock. That is not what  they did. When the American people elect divided government, they are  saying: We know you disagree on a lot of things, but look to the things  you agree on and do those.   If the past few weeks have shown anything, it is that we need to work  together across the aisle in order to do our work, and make no mistake,  there are significant challenges ahead, such as addressing the ongoing  security and humanitarian crisis at our southern border, lowering the  cost of healthcare and prescription drugs, and taking further steps to  rebuild America's infrastructure.   Tonight I expect the President will offer a serious vision to deal  with challenges like these. I look forward to hearing from him and  then, throughout the coming year, I look forward to the Senate working  closely with him and working closely with each other across the aisle  to do just that.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to executive session for the consideration of Calendar Nos. 1  through 4 and all nominations on the Secretary's desk; that the  nominations be confirmed; that the motions to reconsider be considered  made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate; that  no further motions be in order; that any statements related to the  nominations be printed in the Record; that the President be immediately  notified of the Senate's action; and that the Senate then resume  legislative session.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  be in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak  therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Presiding Officer of the Senate be authorized to appoint a committee on  the part of the Senate to join with a like committee on the part of the  House of Representatives to escort the President of the United States  into the House Chamber for the joint session to be held at 9 p.m. on  Tuesday, February 5, 2019.    Mr. President, I understand that there is a bill at  the desk, and I ask for its first reading.    Mr. President, I now ask for a second reading, and in  order to place the bill on the calendar under the provisions of rule  XIV, I object to my own request.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Committee on the Judiciary be discharged from further consideration of  H.R. 439 and the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration.    I ask unanimous consent that the bill be considered  read a third time.    I know of no further debate on the bill.    I ask unanimous consent that the motion to reconsider  be considered made and laid upon the table.    I know of no further debate on the measure.    I ask unanimous consent that the preamble be agreed to  and that the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the  table with no intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  recess until 8:25 p.m. tonight and upon reconvening, proceed as a body  to the Hall of the House of Representatives for the joint session of  Congress provided under the provisions of H. Con. Res. 9; that upon  dissolution of the joint session, the Senate adjourn until 10 a.m.,  Wednesday, February 6; further, that following the prayer and pledge,  the morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be  approved to date, and the time for the two leaders be reserved for  their use later in the day; finally, that following leader remarks, the  Senate resume consideration of the motion to proceed to S. 47, with all  time during the recess, adjournment, morning business, and leader  remarks counting postcloture on the motion to proceed to S. 47.
