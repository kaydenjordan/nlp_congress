 Madam Chair, I rise to reflect on the  importance of the disaster supplemental bill we are considering today.   In Nebraska, we continue our work to recover from the storm which hit  our State at the end of February. The storm brought with it blizzard  conditions and large amounts of rain, followed rapidly by destructive  flooding.   The impact of this storm continues to be felt across our State,  particularly by our ag producers. In the west, the extreme blizzard  conditions compounded an already hard winter, leading to severe cattle  losses. In the east, stored grain was actually washed away or damaged  by the floods, and extensive silting of fields has impeded planting as  the season is now underway.   I particularly appreciate both this bill and the most recent Senate  package including language to ensure our disaster programs can address  losses of stored grain. While crop insurance covers producers from  planting, including coverage for prevented planting, up through  harvest, it does not provide coverage for harvest grain which is stored  and has not yet been sold. Our producers need this relief.   I realize this bill is not perfect, and there are a number of issues  I hope we can address moving forward. I would prefer to be considering  legislation which addresses the concerns of some Senators and the  President and would be signed into law. This bill does not, and I hope  negotiations will get us there soon.   I have long advocated for disaster packages to be paid for; this  package is not, and my amendment to cover the cost was, unfortunately,  not made in order.   We have traditionally extended a number of tax relief provisions to  families and businesses in disaster areas. I have introduced  legislation to do this, and I hope we can act on this relief soon as  well.   Madam Chair, Nebraskans need relief. Considering this bill moves us  closer to providing them relief and, for that reason, I do support it.
