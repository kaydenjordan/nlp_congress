 Mr. Speaker, on February 12, an  historic change of command ceremony was held for the South Carolina  National Guard 51st Military Police Battalion. Lexington High School  math teacher Major Erika Perry became the first female commander of  this battalion.   Major Perry comes from a military family, with both her father and  grandfather serving in the United States military. She was commissioned  as a military police officer in 2001 and became a platoon leader in the  133rd Military Police Company in 2003, being deployed to Iraq.   A recent article in Cola Daily, edited by Terry Ward, detailed:  ``During her years in the National Guard, Perry served in Iraq and  Afghanistan and on the home front during times of crisis, like  Hurricane Matthew. She appreciates the LHS administration's support of  her military career throughout her 19 years at the school.''   Congratulations to the University of South Carolina men's and women's  basketball teams on their victories last night, securing their place in  the NCAA's Sweet 16 as one of the few universities to have teams in  both tournaments simultaneously. Go, Gamecocks.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.                            ____________________
