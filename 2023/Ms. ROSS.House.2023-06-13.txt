 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight the importance of  the Supreme Court's decision in Allen v. Milligan.   In ruling that the Alabama legislature used redistricting to dilute  the voices of Black voters, the Supreme Court has preserved section 2  of the Voting Rights Act and helped protect the fundamental promise of  our democracy, that every vote matters.   This is a major victory for voting rights, not just in Alabama, but  in States across the south. My home State of North Carolina is no  stranger to racial and partisan gerrymandering.   As Republican legislatures employ gerrymandering as a tool to serve  their partisan interests, this ruling sends a powerful warning to all  politicians to seek to roll back minority voting rights.                            ____________________
