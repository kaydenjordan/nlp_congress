 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule I, I demand a  vote on agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the Journal.    Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a  quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not  present.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and service  of Devonnia Kate Tscheulin of Scottsburg, Indiana.   Devonnia passed away on August 15 due to complications while giving  birth to her third child.   Anyone who knew Devonnia knew she had a heart for service.   After graduating from Salem High School, she became a paramedic and  went on to serve as deputy director for the Washington County EMS and  the deputy chief director of the Scott County EMS in Scottsburg.   It is impossible for me, in the time I have here today, to capture  just what made Devonnia so special, so admired.  [[Page H5410]]  She was known for being a comforting presence for many families in  their darkest moments. She was a steady hand in times of crisis, saving  many lives during her career.   Devonnia's life was meaningful, yet tragically too short. It is  difficult to imagine women can die during childbirth in the United  States today, but they do.   It is in her memory that I commit to pursuing legislation to ensure  we are doing everything we can to protect the lives of mothers and  their babies. That is why I am proud to cosponsor H.R. 3838, the  Preventing Maternal Deaths Reauthorization Act of 2023. I won't stop  fighting for solutions to prevent maternal deaths.   Devonnia left behind incredible loved ones like her husband, Michael,  also a public servant with the fire department, and three beautiful  children, Chase, Katie, and Maverick.   We will never forget Devonnia and the example that she was and still  is to us all.                            ____________________
