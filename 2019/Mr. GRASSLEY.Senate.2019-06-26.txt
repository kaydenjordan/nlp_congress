 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in  morning business for 90 seconds.    Mr. President, ever since I was elected to the U.S.  Senate, I have welcomed young Iowans to intern in my office.  Internships provide students with the opportunity to gain valuable work  experience, to apply the things they learn inside the classroom to the  real world, and to develop skills they will carry with them into the  future.   That is why my office offers year-round internships in both  Washington, DC, and in Iowa. I offer students the opportunity to work  alongside my staff to learn more about our Federal Government, and it  happens that about two-thirds of my staff were former interns. This is  a wonderful educational opportunity, and I encourage all college-age  students to apply.                             National Dairy Month    Mr. President, on another subject, Wells Enterprises, the maker of  Blue Bunny ice cream, produces more ice cream in one location than any  other place in the United States. That is why Le Mars, IA, is called  the Ice Cream Capital of the World.   It produces over 200 million gallons a year, which I appreciate,  because I like to eat ice cream. The Wells Ice Cream Parlor is one of  the busiest tourist attractions in our entire State, and I have been  there multiple times.   With this being National Dairy Month, I am proud to recognize Wells  and all of the hard-working farmers and dairy workers who produce the  great dairy products that are enjoyed across the country.   I yield the floor.                      Recognition of the Majority Leader     I ask for the yeas and nays.
