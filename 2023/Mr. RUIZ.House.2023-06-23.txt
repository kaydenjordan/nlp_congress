 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight my bill, the  Children's Act for Responsible Employment and Farm Safety, or the CARE  Act. This bill will protect children in the agricultural industry by  creating the same child labor protections that children have in all  other industries.   Farm labor is the most dangerous occupation in our Nation, and there  are no child labor protections. As a result, three kids get injured a  day, and every 3 days, a child dies from injuries sustained in the  fields.   Between 2001 and 2015, nearly half of all fatal injuries to young  workers occurred in agriculture.   As an emergency physician, the son of farmworkers, and someone who  grew up in an impoverished farmworker community with friends who left  school to help financially support their families, I want to protect  farmworker children across the country.   My bill aims to stop the alarming rate of farm labor injuries and  deaths by raising the age of employment and limiting the number of  working hours during the schoolday for children--the same as all other  industries.   We must protect children. As a father, doctor, and son of  farmworkers, I implore my colleagues to join this effort and cosponsor  the CARE Act.                            ____________________
