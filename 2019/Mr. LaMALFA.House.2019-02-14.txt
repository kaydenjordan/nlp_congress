 Madam Speaker, I rise tonight in memory of our friend,  Walter Jones, congressman from North Carolina.   Walter was a kind, gentle, sweet soul of a man, who I admired even in  the brief time we had to serve here together.   I found him to be a man of integrity who always put what he thought  was right for the people of his district and this country first.   Sometimes he had a vote he might regret, but he did everything he  could to make that right.   He went so far as to make the families of a fallen soldier feel that  much more comfortable with a letter--to every one that he could  possibly do--showing compassion and showing that at least one  congressman knows what their pain is.   So, to his family; his wife, Joe Anne; and his daughter Ashley; all  his constituents and friends and neighbors in North Carolina, our  hearts are with you at the loss of a man whose main goal was to please  God and walk with Jesus Christ. We admire him, and we will miss him.                            ____________________
