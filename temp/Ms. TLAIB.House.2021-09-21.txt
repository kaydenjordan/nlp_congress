 Madam Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Speaker, I rise in support of amendment No. 11 which  would provide critical needed consumer protection to our servicemembers  who hold medical debt.   No one chooses to get sick, yet medical debt is the leading cause of  personal bankruptcy in our country, and the pandemic has only made paid  our medical debt crisis worse, especially for our veterans.   According to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, servicemembers  and veterans are nearly twice as likely to submit debt collection  complaints as the general public. And medical debt concerns comprise  nearly 13 percent of servicemember debt collection complaints.   So this amendment is important because medical bills and  reimbursements are often vague and confusing. Servicemembers often  assert that the calculation of the underlying debt is inaccurate and  unfair. Other times, bills go missing during deployment or are  delivered to the wrong recipient.   So this amendment would strengthen servicemembers' consumer  protections regarding medical debt by preventing the collection of  medical debt for 2 years from the date of medical billing, and  prohibiting credit agencies from reporting all medical debt collections  for a year.                                time  2300    My amendment also requires medical debt collectors to provide  servicemembers with their consumer rights upon contact.   Together, these protections would provide servicemembers much-needed  clarity to figure out what they actually owe and what the impact will  have on their credit.   So, Madam Speaker, debt collection particularly affects our young  servicemembers and veterans who have little credit history upon  enlisting.   Among servicemembers with 3 or fewer years of service, the CFPB has  found 5 percent had medical debts in collection just prior to  separation from service, and that number doubles to more than 10  percent within a year of their separation from service. As a result,  those same individuals with 3 years or less of service, on average,  exit the armed services with subprime credit scores.   So with that I really finally ask my colleagues to please help us ban  medical debt also for medically necessary procedures from ever even  appearing on servicemembers' credit reports.   This amendment would not prevent States from implementing stronger  protections for our servicemembers. It would not preempt existing  consumer protections for our servicemembers already on the books.   Again, I remind my colleagues that, again, this is really critical  for our servicemembers.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    How much time is remaining, Madam Speaker?    Madam Speaker, I remind my colleagues that all of these  protections have already passed the House this Congress but have yet to  receive action in the Senate.   I want to remind my colleagues also the way the amendment is drafted  right now currently, a medically necessary procedure is defined as,  one, healthcare services or supplies needed to diagnose or treat an  illness, injury, condition, disease, or symptom that meet accepted  standards of medicine; two, healthcare to prevent illness and detect  illnesses at an early stage when treatment is likely to work best,  again, for services like Pap tests, flu shots, and screening mammograms   I want to remind my colleagues, this is a huge barrier. The credit  reports are huge barriers for housing and employment for our veterans.  We continue to support increased housing for our veterans, increased  mental health services for our veterans and all these other issues but,  much of that is due to the fact that we have credit reports with  medically necessary debt, medical procedures on there, and really no  pathway to protect our consumers, our veterans, in this case.   I really remind my colleagues again: we cannot continue to support  housing and employment services for our veterans, and the credit  report, the credit score, all of that, is holding them hostage unable  to continue to create a good life in our country especially after  sacrificing so much for our Nation.   So I really ask my colleagues this is the right thing to do. Again,  this is basically folks who are getting sick that need healthcare, and  we are not saying that they won't be able to collect, the healthcare  agencies, they are able to collect. This is just to prevent it from  becoming a barrier for many of our veterans who seek employment which  does look at--many employers still now currently look at credit  reports, and they also look at credit reports for housing. Again, we  can't continue to try to fund these kinds of supports when this is a  huge barrier for our veterans.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
