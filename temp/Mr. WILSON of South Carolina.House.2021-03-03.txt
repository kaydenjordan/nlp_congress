 Mr. Speaker, in an era of fake news, it  is refreshing to find editorialist Jerry Bellune, editor of the  Lexington County Chronicle, expose the tragic fraud being perpetrated  on taxpayers:         The Washington Swamp set up criminals to steal billions of       dollars through fraud.        In attempts to shovel money to the rest of us, Congress has       created an opportunity for criminal fraud.        Their real victims are us, the American taxpayers, and our       great-grandchildren who will be paying for this folly for       generations to come.        The reality is that those who created the CARES Act set us       up for up to $100 billion in fraud. The Labor Department       inspector general estimates $63 billion in tax dollars were       stolen.  [[Page H1021]]         As the Chronicle Tech Talk columnist Katie Ritchie has       warned, scammers wooed victims to convince them to give       personal information.    In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.   Our sympathy to the family of Chamber of Commerce President Bill  Mooneyhan.                            ____________________
