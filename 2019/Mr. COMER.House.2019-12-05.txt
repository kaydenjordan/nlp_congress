 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in special recognition of my  lifelong friends, Drs. Lynn and Sam Cofield of Trigg County, Kentucky,  for their remarkable careers and outstanding contributions to their  local community and beyond. This year marks their retirement, and I  want to congratulate Lynn and Sam for many decades of success.   Lynn and Sam met while attending veterinary school at Auburn  University. They married in 1984 and bought the Trigg County Veterinary  Clinic located in Cadiz, Kentucky. While practicing veterinary  medicine, they also managed a 160-acre farm they called Riverview West.  They raised a herd of purebred Charolais cattle and quickly rose to  prominence among the cattle industry. Producing and exhibiting  Charolais cattle became passions for Lynn and Sam, who continued to  expand their influence in the agriculture community.   From 1986 to 1991 Lynn served as Kentucky Junior Charolais  Association adviser where I was one of her many students who traveled  the livestock show circuit with the Cofield family. Lynn was also  active in many organizations over the years ranging from 4-H and FFA to  the Kentucky Veterinary Medical Association.   Sam served on the Farm Bureau Board of Directors and the Trigg County  Health Department Board. Both Lynn and Sam supplied the Trigg County  community with high-quality, honest veterinary medicine until 2019.  Their clinic sold in February, and in October they began a hard-earned  and much-deserved retirement. In the words of those who know them best,  the Cofields are staples in Trigg County and the surrounding  communities.   Countless families can tell stories of how the Cofields cared for  their pets and livestock from beginning to end. The Cofields let no  obstacle prevent them from providing top-notch medical care. Whether in  the wee hours of the morning or in the pouring rain, the Cofields were  there ready to lend a hand.   Once again, I want to congratulate Drs. Lynn and Sam Cofield on their  notable careers and recent retirement. I thank them both for being  exceptional leaders in the First Congressional District of Kentucky.       Honoring the Work of the Kentucky Magistrates and Commissioners                                Association     Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize the work of the  Kentucky Magistrates and Commissioners Association headquartered in  Frankfort, Kentucky.   On October 30, 2019, the Association provided over 500 new pairs of  shoes to Monroe County schools. The shoes were delivered to my hometown  and my former school Tompkinsville Elementary. I am deeply grateful to  the elected magistrates and commissioners who made this donation on  behalf of the KMCA. Their actions represent the best of the  Commonwealth and make me proud to represent one of its six  congressional districts.   I want to particularly thank several members of the KMCA from the  Monroe County Fiscal Court: Magistrates Jamie Veach, Roger Deckard,  Ricky Bartley, Ricky Graves, and Mark Williams, in addition to county  judge, Mitchell Page. I also want to thank my good friend, J.C. Young,  executive director of the Kentucky Magistrates and Commissioners  Association for spearheading the effort.                                time  1030    No child should worry that they might leave the house without  adequate footwear, and because of the actions of the Kentucky  Magistrates and Commissioners Association, Monroe County's most  vulnerable are better off today than they were only a few short weeks  ago.   Mr. Speaker, once again, I thank the KMCA for choosing Monroe County  and for the time and energy they sacrificed to improve the everyday  lives of dozens of schoolchildren. Their efforts are applauded in  Kentucky's First Congressional District.                            ____________________
