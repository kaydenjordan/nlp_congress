 Madam Speaker, I recently had the pleasure of touring the  Susquehanna County Career & Technical Center.   Located in the heart of Pennsylvania's natural gas boom, Susquehanna  County's CTC is helping to provide low-cost education opportunities for  in-demand jobs.   During our tour, we heard stories of students graduating in a matter  of weeks or months to enter the workforce with little to no student  debt making significant six-figure annual salaries.   Careers in trucking, the natural gas industry, and other blue-collar  positions are highly in demand in Pennsylvania's Twelfth Congressional  District.   It was also great to see Cabot Oil & Gas, one of the largest natural  gas producers in the country, investing in the school's commercial  driver's license program to create a pathway from learning directly  into a career.   This is another tremendous example of the natural gas industry being  terrific community partners while paving the way for America's energy  independence.   With February being Career and Technical Education Month, it is  important to remember that we should not be forcing our students into a  one-size-fits-all system, especially when programs like those at  Susquehanna County Career & Technical Center are providing a low-cost  option for in-demand opportunities.                            ____________________
