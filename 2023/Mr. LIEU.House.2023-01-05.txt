 Madam Clerk, I rise today to nominate Hakeem Jeffries for  Speaker of the House.   Vote after vote, Democrats stand united and ready to work on behalf  of the American people under the leadership of Hakeem Jeffries.   Vote after vote, nomination after nomination, Democrats are united,  just like we were united when we passed the American Rescue Plan to get  our economy back on track; united when we passed the infrastructure law  to rebuild America; united when we capped insulin at $35, passed  historic gun safety legislation, and passed the PACT Act to help our  Nation's veterans; united when Democrats passed the CHIPS and Science  Act to bring manufacturing back to America; united when Democrats  passed the Inflation Reduction Act to reduce our deficit and protect  our environment. Democrats are unified to tackle the climate crisis  while Republicans are mired in their own leadership crisis.   Madam Clerk, House Democrats are ready, willing, and able to get to  work for the American people. We will do so under the leadership of  Hakeem Jeffries, who has a plan for the American people. Therefore, as  vice chair of the Democratic Caucus, I am directed by the vote of our  Caucus to present  [[Page H25]]  for election to the office of Speaker of the House of Representatives  for the 118th Congress, Representative-elect from the State of New  York, Hakeem Jeffries.   The CLERK. The Clerk recognizes the gentleman from Montana (Mr.  Rosendale).
