After 3 years of Active-Duty service with the Army Office  of the Chief, Legislative Liaison, MAJ Patrick ``Ryan'' Alban is  deservedly moving on and transitioning to the Army Reserve. On this  occasion, I believe it is fitting to recognize Major Alban's  distinguished service and dedication to fostering the relationship  between the U.S. Army and this Chamber.   Ryan started his service on the Hill as a legislative liaison in the  National Guard Bureau, where he was responsible for the Army National  Guard's military construction portfolio until May 2019. He then served  as my defense fellow for 12 months where he was instrumental in the  drafting of legislation and providing policy advice. Following his time  in my office, Major Alban served for over 2 years in the Army Senate  Liaison Division, where he was invaluable in informing Senators and  staff on Army priorities and policy initiatives.   Over the course of the last 2 years, Major Alban also provided  support to multiple congressional delegations to locations within the  United States and to various countries around the world. He became a  trusted adviser and friend to many of us. He distinguished himself by  going above and beyond the call of duty to facilitate and successfully  execute each and every trip, despite any number of weather, aircraft,  and diplomatic complications.   Prior to his time on the Hill, Major Alban served our Army and our  Nation for more than 10 years. He commissioned as an Active-Duty  infantry officer from Officer Candidate School at Fort Benning, GA. He  began his career as a weapons platoon leader, air operations officer,  and adjutant in the 10th Mountain Division (Light Infantry) at Fort  Drum, NY. While there, he deployed to Afghanistan in support of  Operation Enduring Freedom. After returning home, Ryan transitioned to  the Missouri National Guard. Soon after, he was mobilized to Ferguson  in order to protect persons, property, and civil liberties. He was then  selected to command a rifle company and, later, a headquarters company,  the former of  [[Page S7067]]  which he led to the Middle East in support of Operation Spartan Shield.   Major Alban is the epitome of a soldier-scholar. He holds a master of  laws in national security law from Georgetown University Law Center, a  juris doctor from St. Louis University School of Law, a master of  professional studies in legislative affairs from George Washington  University, and a bachelor of arts in political science from Webster  University.   On behalf of Congress and the United States of America, we thank MAJ  Ryan Alban, his wife, and their son for their continued commitment,  sacrifice, and contributions to this great Nation. We join our  colleagues in wishing him future successes as he continues to serve our  great Army and Nation.                            ____________________
