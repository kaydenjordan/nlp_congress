 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague from Florida  for yielding.   Today, the House considers historic legislation to lower prescription  drug prices and deliver a transformational expansion to Medicare under  H.R. 3, the Elijah E. Cummings Lower Drug Costs Now Act of 2019.   The namesake of this bill inspired many Members of this body, myself  included, to act boldly on behalf of working families like the one I  grew up in. It is time to flip the status quo on a system that has  pocketed billions off the backs of patients like my dad who suffer from  chronic diseases like MS.   I am proud to have championed a provision which added a critical  lever of transparency and accountability by requiring a GAO study on  the negotiation program, essentially ensuring that there is no unfair  manipulation or gaming at play. While I regret that my amendment to  support baseline knowledge of addiction among prescribers was not made  in order, I look forward to supporting this important bill.   I am grateful to leadership, my colleagues, and the committees of  jurisdiction for bringing us all here to this point today.
