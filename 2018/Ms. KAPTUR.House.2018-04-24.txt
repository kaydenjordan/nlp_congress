 Mr. Speaker, for more than 30 years, greedy corporate  chieftains, enabled by the Republican Party, have chip, chip, chipped  away at workers' rights, decent wages, and secure pension benefits. In  fact, they have even moved corporations to penny-wage environments, all  in the name of preventing workers from improving their lives here and  the lives of their families.   Our latest fight is to ensure pension security for retirees who have  already paid into their earned benefits. Since 2014, we have fought to  protect millions of multi-employer pensioners at risk of insolvency.  Pensioners should yield what they were guaranteed.   Democrats have proposed solutions to ensure these retirees get a  better deal. We have rallied behind the Butch Lewis Act, which has 156  cosponsors, including Republicans.   But where is the House Republican leadership? Instead of helping  retirees across this Nation with pension security, they forced passage  of a $1 trillion tax cut for the rich. This should tell you all you  need to know about the Republicans' raw deal.   Our 2018 recent funding bill vote secured a Committee on Pension  Solvency that is tasked to find a solution by the end of this year.  America's retirees shouldn't be let down. They have earned a better  deal.                            ____________________
