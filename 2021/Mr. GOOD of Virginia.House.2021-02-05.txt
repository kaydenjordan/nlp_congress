 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the  National Apprenticeship Act.   Republicans and Democrats agree that apprenticeships are important  for workforce development. Unfortunately, House Democrats think that  Federal bureaucrats, who rely on an almost century-old system, should  manage all apprenticeship programs, not businesses and job creators.   This legislation represents a classic Democrat one-size-fits-all  approach, as it would make the existing Registered Apprenticeship  Program the only option for businesses. Registered programs are only a  small fraction of total apprenticeships, representing only about 20  percent of apprenticeships in 2019.   Instead of reducing options and increasing bureaucracy, Republicans  support policies that maximize flexibility and innovation, like  President Trump's landmark and highly successful Industry-Recognized  Apprenticeship Program.   It is tragic that during a time of historic unemployment, the House  of Representatives is taking up a bill that stifles employment and  workforce development opportunities when we need it least.   I stand in opposition to H.R. 447.
