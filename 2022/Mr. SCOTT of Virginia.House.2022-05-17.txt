 Madam Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution  1119, I call up the bill (H.R. 7309) to reauthorize the Workforce  Innovation and Opportunity Act, and ask for its immediate  consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and insert extraneous material on H.R. 7309, the Workforce  Innovation and Opportunity Act of 2022.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Madam Speaker, the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act, or WIOA,  is the backbone of our Nation's workforce development system. Each  year, WIOA programs help working people across the country get the  skills they need to find better-paying careers and help employers  access a dedicated and skilled workforce.   Unfortunately, our investment in workforce development has fallen  significantly over time. While the U.S. labor force has grown  approximately 50 percent over the last four decades, Federal investment  in workforce development has fallen by two-thirds when adjusted for  inflation. Federal investment in workforce development has fallen by  two-thirds.   This underinvestment hurts workers, it hurts businesses, and it hurts  our economy's competitive edge. Other developed countries spend between  one-half of 1 percent to 1 full percent of their gross domestic product  on workforce development. We spend only one-tenth of 1 percent.   The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act of 2022 addresses this  chronic underinvestment so that we can finally meet the needs of  workers and businesses, fill job openings with qualified workers,  reduce supply chain shortages, and lower costs for families.   By investing approximately $80 billion over the next 6 years, this  legislation would more than double the number of people receiving  training services in fiscal year 2023 and allow us to train 1 million  workers per year by 2028.   The legislation modernizes WIOA to help expand work opportunities for  disconnected youth. It makes critical reforms to improve Job Corps, and  it expands sector-based training so that we can train for entire  sectors such as electric cars, trucking, and nurses. It strengthens  community colleges' capacity to help workers succeed in in-demand  industries. It helps justice-involved individuals re-enter the labor  force and obtain sustainable career paths.   Madam Speaker, if we want to keep our global competitive edge, if we  want to lower costs, and if we want to accelerate our economic  recovery, then we must pass the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity  Act of 2022.   This legislation is the product of a largely bipartisan, year-long  effort, including a bipartisan roundtable and three bipartisan hearings  in our committee. While many of my counterparts across the aisle have  voiced opposition to the size of the investments in the bill, I remain  hopeful that all of my colleagues will join me in voting to stand with  America's workers.   Madam Speaker, I thank the chair of the Higher Education and  Workforce Investment Subcommittee, Ms. Wilson, for her work on this  critical priority, and I urge support of the legislation.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Oregon (Ms. Bonamici), the chair of the Subcommittee  on Civil Rights and Human Services.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Mrvan), a distinguished member of the  Committee on Education and Labor.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from New York (Mr. Espaillat), a distinguished member of the  Committee on Education and Labor.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Courtney), a distinguished member of  the Committee on Education and Labor.    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute  to the gentleman from Connecticut.    Madam Speaker, could you advise as to how much  time is remaining on both sides?    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Levin), a distinguished member of the  Committee on Education and Labor.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Cohen).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Cartwright).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Connecticut (Mrs. Hayes), a distinguished member of  the Committee on Education and Labor.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of  my time.   Madam Speaker, the evidence is clear that our economy has made  meaningful progress toward recovering from the pandemic. Thanks to the  efforts of Congress and the Biden-Harris administration, our economy  has added a record 8.3 million jobs since the start of 2021, and the  unemployment rate has fallen to 3.6 percent.   Despite this progress, we know that job openings currently exceed job  applicants and employers are clamoring for skilled workers. In fact,  research suggests that workers are leaving their job to seek better  career opportunities in record numbers. This bill takes a critical step  forward to empower workers to fill those competitive job positions and,  in turn, helps reduce supply chain shortages, lower costs for families,  increase their incomes, and improve our business competitiveness.   Madam Speaker, investing in workforce development has historically  been a priority for both Democrats and Republicans. That is why our  committee conducted an extended bipartisan process to put this  legislation together, despite the opposition we have heard from our  colleagues today.   As our economy rebounds from the pandemic, we should all agree that  we must take this opportunity to expand access to high-quality job  training opportunities for America's workers.   I thank my colleague again, Ms. Wilson, for her leadership in  bringing this critical legislation to the floor, and I urge my  colleagues to vote in favor of the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity  Act of 2022.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, pursuant to section 4 of House  Resolution 1119, I rise to offer amendments en bloc No. 1.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Madam Speaker, this en bloc contains several bipartisan amendments  from our colleagues to continue improving the Workforce Innovation and  Opportunity Act of 2022.   This en bloc contains commonsense proposals that strengthen the  underlying bill, and I thank my colleagues for their contributions.   Madam Speaker, I strongly urge support for both the en bloc and the  underlying bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur), the chair of the Subcommittee on  Energy and Water Development of the Committee on Appropriations, and a  strong supporter of sector grant training.                                time  1515     Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Gottheimer).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Nevada (Mr. Horsford).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of  my time.   Madam Speaker, I reiterate that this is an en bloc amendment  containing commonsense, bipartisan proposals that strengthen the  underlying bill. I strongly urge support for both the en bloc amendment  and the underlying bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, pursuant to section 4 of House  Resolution 1119, I rise to offer amendments en bloc No. 2.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Madam Speaker, this en bloc amendment contains additional Democratic  amendments from my colleagues to continue improving the Workforce  Innovation and Opportunity Act of 2022.   This en bloc amendment contains proposals that strengthen the  underlying bill, and I thank my colleagues for their contributions.   I strongly urge support for both the en bloc amendment and the  underlying bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the  gentlewoman from Delaware (Ms. Blunt Rochester), who is a former member  of the Committee on Education and Labor and a strong supporter of  workforce development.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of  my time.   I reiterate that this en bloc amendment contains commonsense  proposals that will strengthen the underlying bill.   Madam Speaker, I strongly urge support for both the en bloc amendment  and the underlying bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, pursuant to section 4 of House  Resolution 1119, I rise to offer amendments en bloc No. 3.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Madam Speaker, this en bloc amendment contains several amendments  which I oppose; therefore, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I am the only speaker on this  side. I am prepared to close, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of  my time.   Madam Speaker, I focus my comments on two of the amendments in this  en bloc that undermine the improvements we are putting forward in this  legislation.   The first strikes language from the bill that prevents nonregistered  apprenticeships from receiving WIOA funds. If you want to have a  nonregistered apprenticeship program you can do that, but we ought to  fund the registered programs first since they are much better, and we  shouldn't spend money on those nonregistered programs.   Registered apprenticeship programs are a proven strategy that have  demonstrated high-quality training and wage progression across multiple  industries. This bill supports efforts to expand registered  apprenticeships to additional populations and industries, by reserving  50 percent of the funds for programs serving individuals with barriers  to employment.   Many of my colleagues have opposed the so-called Industry-Recognized  Apprenticeship Programs, or IRAPs, because that program discards key  features that are the cause of success for our registered  apprenticeship program, including quality standards, worker  protections, national recognition, and the fact that virtually all  registered apprenticeship graduates end up in jobs that pay well above  the median wage.   The second amendment in this en bloc amendment group prohibits WIOA  funds from being used to reimburse any healthcare services. I am not  sure where they find that physical health is included. Mental health  counseling and substance abuse is included as possible funding.   The question about whether WIOA will pay for health services is a  distraction from the work we are trying to do today, to ensure an  equitable recovery, and provide opportunity for economic advancement  for all individuals in all communities.   This legislation reflects the input from stakeholders across the  country who know what it takes to expand access to high-quality job  training, career navigation services, and other critical services.   The statute has long provided for flexibility for local programs. The  statute also allows for the provision of supportive services, such as  assistance with transportation, childcare, dependent care, or housing;  services that are crucial to facilitating individuals' ability to  participate in WIOA-funded programs.   In fact, the legislation specifically ensures that treatment of  substance use disorder is a permissible use of supportive services  under WIOA.   Fundamentally, needs of individuals seeking job training are not  always distinct from health needs. These programs should meet people  where they are to facilitate full participation to ensure continued and  sustained economic success.   Updating and improving programs authorized through WIOA, such as the  bill we are considering today, will lift up communities and help us  achieve that goal. This is what we need to do today by voting ``no'' on  this en bloc amendment and ``yes'' on the underlying bill.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I claim the time in opposition  to the amendment.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of  my time.   Madam Speaker, we are here today to modernize and reauthorize the  Nation's premier job training program to help jobseekers and workers  connect with well-paying jobs and career pathways.   Although the substitute offered by our colleagues does not meet the  urgent needs to strengthen the programs, I do want to make it clear  that we welcome the opportunity to have further discussion as the bill  heads toward the Senate. My goal is to forge common ground wherever we  can, and I am hoping that this can be the beginning, not the end, of  the conversation.   The Republican substitute reauthorizes funding for the formula  programs, regrettably, at roughly the same levels as we have today. The  status quo is not working. As a result, the substitute will not provide  the level of intensive training needed to move people into higher wage  jobs.   The average amount the adult formula program spends per participant  today is about $2,000, not nearly enough to provide quality job  training to lead to good jobs with competitive wages, benefits, and  other hallmarks of job quality. The Republican substitute continues the  unacceptable status quo with respect to underinvestment in training.   To meet the moment, the underlying bill also codifies SECTOR grants,  which are demonstrated to be effective in training workers for jobs in  high-demand sectors.    The gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur) talked about electric cars. We  need a lot of training in that area, but regrettably, the substitute  omits the SECTOR grants.   Our committee meetings held last year highlighted bipartisan support  for reentry programs for justice-involved individuals. In response, the  bill codifies the program at the Department of Labor and commits $250  million for fiscal year 2023, more than double the amount appropriated  this year, and provides stable funding amounting to $2.3 billion over 6  years.   With 600,000 individuals released from our prisons and jails each  year, close to half of them experiencing repeat contact with the  criminal justice system within a year, funding levels in the substitute  do not come close to meeting the critical needs to invest in services  to help these individuals obtain and retain employment.   We also reject the requirement of the substitute for non-Federal  match to receive a grant. This matching requirement is not part of the  existing grant program and would exclude many grassroots organizations  that are best positioned to meet the needs of justice-involved  individuals in our communities.   When we provide subsidies to employers in the form of on-the-job  training or customized training, we also need to make sure that it is  matched by job quality.   The Republican substitute, regrettably, leaves too many disconnected  youth behind.   To help our youth, whether in school or not, gain life skills, the  bill invests almost $1 billion in fiscal year 2023 for summer and year- round youth employment opportunities. The evidence is abundant that  these youth employment opportunities increase lifelong earnings and  reduce engagement in the criminal justice system.   The Republican substitute also fails to meet the moment and address  the needs of the workers in the 21st century, so I urge a ``no'' vote  on this amendment.   In the remaining time, Madam Speaker, I would like to thank members  of my staff on the Committee of Education and Labor. They worked hard  on this legislation, starting with Kevin McDermott, Scott Estrada,  Lorin Obler, Phoebe Ball, Danyelle Honore, Jessica Schieder, and former  staff members Richard Miller and Katie McClelland.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that in  the engrossment of H.R. 7309, the Clerk be authorized to correct  section numbers, punctuation, spelling, and cross-references, and to  make such other technical and conforming changes as may be necessary to  reflect the actions of the House.
