 Mr. President, in a moment, I will call up a resolution  to govern the structure of the second impeachment trial of Donald John  Trump.   It has been agreed to by the House managers, the former President's  counsel, and is cosponsored by the Republican leader. It is bipartisan.   It is our solemn constitutional duty to conduct a fair and honest  impeachment trial on the charges against former President Trump--the  gravest charges ever brought against a President of the United States  in American history.   This resolution provides for a fair trial, and I urge the Senate to  adopt it.   Mr. President, I send a resolution to the desk on my behalf and that  of the Republican leader for the organizing of the next phases of this  trial.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the resolution by  title.   The legislative clerk read as follows:         A resolution (S. Res. 47) to provide for related procedures       concerning the article of impeachment against Donald John       Trump, former President of the United States.                              Vote on S. Res. 47    The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The question is on agreeing to the  adoption of the resolution.    I ask for the yeas and nays.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second?   There appears to be a sufficient second.   The clerk will call the roll.   The legislative clerk called the roll                           [Rollcall Vote No. 56]                                  YEAS--89       Baldwin      Barrasso      Bennet      Blackburn      Blumenthal      Blunt      Booker      Boozman      Braun      Brown      Burr      Cantwell      Capito      Cardin      Carper  [[Page S590]]        Casey      Cassidy      Collins      Coons      Cornyn      Cortez Masto      Cotton      Cramer      Crapo      Daines      Duckworth      Durbin      Ernst      Feinstein      Fischer      Gillibrand      Graham      Grassley      Hassan      Heinrich      Hickenlooper      Hirono      Hoeven      Hyde-Smith      Inhofe      Kaine      Kelly      Kennedy      King      Klobuchar      Lankford      Leahy      Lujan      Lummis      Manchin      Markey      McConnell      Menendez      Merkley      Moran      Murkowski      Murphy      Murray      Ossoff      Padilla      Peters      Portman      Reed      Risch      Romney      Rosen      Rounds      Sanders      Sasse      Schatz      Schumer      Shaheen      Shelby      Sinema      Smith      Stabenow      Sullivan      Tester      Thune      Tillis      Toomey      Van Hollen      Warner      Warnock      Warren      Whitehouse      Wicker      Wyden      Young                                  NAYS--11       Cruz      Hagerty      Hawley      Johnson      Lee      Marshall      Paul      Rubio      Scott (FL)      Scott (SC)      Tubervill   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. On this vote, the yeas are 89, the nays  are 11.   The resolution (S. Res. 47) was agreed to.   (The resolution is printed in today's Record under ``Submitted  Resolutions.'')                              Order of Business    The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Pursuant to the provisions of S. Res. 47,  there shall now be 4 hours of argument by the parties, equally divided,  on the question of whether Donald John Trump is subject to the  jurisdiction of a Court of Impeachment for acts committed while  President of the United States, notwithstanding the expiration of his  term in that office.   Mr. Manager Raskin, are you a proponent or an opponent of this  question?   Mr. Manager RASKIN. I am a proponent.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Mr. Castor, are you a proponent or an  opponent of this question?   Mr. Counsel CASTOR. We are an opponent.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Opponent, thank you.   Mr. Manager Raskin, your party may proceed first. You will be able to  reserve rebuttal time, if you wish.   Mr. Raskin, you are recognized.                         Managers' Opening Statements    Mr. Manager RASKIN. Thank you very much, Mr. President, distinguished  Members of the Senate. Good afternoon.   My name is Jamie Raskin. It is my honor to represent the people of  Maryland's Eighth Congressional District in the House and also to serve  as the lead House manager.   And Mr. President, we will indeed reserve time for rebuttal. Thank  you.   Because I have been a professor of constitutional law for three  decades, I know there are a lot of people who are dreading endless  lectures about the Federalist Papers. Please breathe easy, OK. I  remember well W.H. Audens' line that a professor is someone who speaks  while other people are sleeping.   You will not be hearing extended lectures from me because our case is  based on cold, hard facts. It is all about the facts.   President Trump has sent his lawyers here today to try to stop the  Senate from hearing the facts of this case. They want to call the trial  over before any evidence is even introduced.   Their argument is that if you commit an impeachable offense in your  last few weeks in office, you do it with constitutional impunity; you  get away with it. In other words, conduct that would be a high crime  and misdemeanor in your first year as President and your second year as  President and your third year as President and for the vast majority of  your fourth year as President you can suddenly do in your last few  weeks in office without facing any constitutional accountability at  all.   This would create a brandnew January exception to the Constitution of  the United States of America--a January exception. And everyone can see  immediately why this is so dangerous. It is an invitation to the  President to take his best shot at anything he may want to do on his  way out the door, including using violent means to lock that door, to  hang on to the Oval Office at all costs, and to block the peaceful  transfer of power.   In other words, the January exception is an invitation to our  Founders' worst nightmare. And if we buy this radical argument that  President Trump's lawyers advance, we risk allowing January 6 to become  our future.   And what will that mean for America? Think about it. What will the  January exception mean to future generations if you grant it? I will  show you.   (Video footage of 1-6-2021.)          Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there now be  a 10-minute break. I ask unanimous consent that the Senate recess for  10 minutes.   There being no objection, at 2:41 p.m., the Senate, sitting as a  Court of Impeachment, recessed until 3:01 p.m.; whereupon the Senate  reassembled when called to order by the President pro tempore.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Mr. Castor has 2 hours, and Mr. Raskin has  33 minutes.   Mr. Counsel CASTOR. May I proceed, Mr. President?   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. You may.                         Counsels' Opening Statements    Mr. Counsel CASTOR. Mr. President and Members of the U.S. Senate,  thank you for taking the time to hear from me.   My name is Bruce Castor. I am the lead prosecutor--lead counsel--for  the 45th President of the United States. I was an assistant DA for such  a long time, I keep saying ``prosecutor,'' but I do understand the  difference, Mr. Raskin.   Before I begin, I want to comment on the outstanding presentation  from our opponents and the emotion that certainly welled up in  Congressman Raskin about his family being here during that terrible  day.   You will not hear any member of the team representing former  President Trump say anything but, in the strongest possible way,  denounce the violence of the rioters and those who breached the  Capitol, the very citadel of our democracy--literally, the symbol that  flashes on television whenever you are trying to explain that we are  talking about the United States, an instant symbol. To have it attacked  is repugnant in every sense of the word.   The loss of life is horrific. I spent many long years prosecuting  homicide cases, catching criminals who committed murders. I have quite  an extensive experience in dealing with the aftermath of those things.   Certainly, as an FOP member and a member of many police organizations  myself, we mourn the loss of the Capitol Police officer, whom I  understand is laying not too far away from here.   And, you know, many of you in this room, over your careers, before  they reached this summit here in the Senate, would have had times where  you represented your local communities as assistant district attorneys,  assistant Commonwealth attorneys, assistant State attorneys. And you  know this to be true--that when a horrific event occurred in your  county or in your jurisdiction, if it was a State jurisdiction, you  know that there was a terrible outcry, and the public immediately  reacts with a desire that someone pay because something really bad  happened. And that is a natural reaction of human beings. It is a  natural reaction of human beings because we are generally a social  people. We enjoy being around one another, even in DC.   We recognize that people all the world over, and especially Americans  who share that special bond with one another, love the freedoms that  this country gives us. And we all feel that if somebody is unsafe when  they are walking down the street, that the next person who is unsafe  could be you, your spouse, one of your children, some other person that  you love and know personally.   So you will never hear anybody representing former President Trump  say anything at all other than what happened on January 6 and the  storming and breaching of the Capitol should be denounced in the most  vigorous terms, nor that those persons responsible should be prosecuted  to the fullest extent that our laws allow.   Indeed, I have followed some of those cases and those prosecutions,  and it seems to me that we are doing a pretty good job of identifying  and prosecuting those persons who committed those offenses. And I  commend the FBI and the District of Columbia police and the other  Agencies for their work.   It is natural to recoil. It is an immediate thing. It comes over you  without your ability to stop it, the desire for retribution. Who caused  this awful thing? How do we make them pay?   We recognize in the law--and I know many of you are lawyers.  Probably, lawyers--some of you have been a lawyer for 35 years, longer  than me--many, longer than me, probably. And we know we have a specific  body of law that deals with passion and rage, blinding logic and  reason. That is the difference between manslaughter and murder.   Manslaughter is the killing of a human being upon sudden and intense  provocation. But murder is done with cold blood and reflective thought.   We are so understanding of the concept that people's minds can be  overpowered wit emotion, where logic does not immediately kick in, that  we have recognized examples that otherwise would be hearsay, and said  that,  [[Page S598]]  no, when you are driving down the street and you look over at your wife  and you say: ``Hey, you know what, that guy is about to drive through  the red light and kill that person,'' your wife can testify to what you  said because, even though it is technically hearsay, it is an exception  because it is the event living through the person. Why? No opportunity  for reflective thought.    There are all sorts of examples that we recognize in the law for why  people immediately desire retribution, immediately recognize in the law  that people can be overcome by events.   And you know, Senators of the United States, they are not ordinary  people. They are extraordinary people--in the technical sense,  extraordinary people.   When I was growing up in suburban Philadelphia, my parents were big  fans of Senator Everett Dirksen from Illinois. Senator Dirksen recorded  a series of lectures that my parents had on a record. We still know  what records are, right? The thing you put the needle down on and you  play it.   And here is little Bruce--8, 9, 10 years old--listening to this back  in the 1960s. And I would be listening to that voice.   If you ever heard Everett Dirksen's voice, it is the most commanding,  gravelly voice that just oozes belief and sincerity. He must have been  a phenomenal U.S. Senator. He doesn't talk about ordinary people, as we  do in the law. We apply the ordinary person standard. He talks about  extraordinary people. He talks about ``Gallant Men,'' which was the  name of the album, and, now, of course, as a sign of the times, gallant  men and women.   I would watch television, and I would watch Senator Goldwater or  Senator Byrd or Senator Mansfield or Senator Dole, and I would be  fascinated by these great men.   And everybody's parents say this when they are growing up: You could  grow up to be a U.S. Senator. You could do that. They are just men and  women like you are.   Well, then, Everett Dirksen tells us that they are not; they are  gallant men and women who do extraordinary things when their country  needs them to do it.   U.S. Senators really are different. I have been around U.S. Senators  before. Two of them in this room from Pennsylvania, I would like to  think, are friendly toward me or at least friends of mine when we are  not politically adverse. And I have been around their predecessors.   One thing I have discovered, whether it be Democrats or Republicans,  U.S. Senators are patriots first--patriots first. They love their  country. They love their families. They love the States that they  represent.   There isn't a Member in this room who has not used the term ``I  represent the great State of''--fill in the blank. Why? Because they  are all great? Yeah. But you think yours is greater than others because  these are your people. These are the people who sent you here to do  their work. They trusted you with the responsibility of representative  government.   You know, I feel proud to know my Senators--Senator Casey, up here in  the back, and Senator Toomey, over to the left.   You know, it is funny. This is an aside, but it is funny. Do you ever  notice how, when you are talking or you hear others talking about you,  when you are home in your State, they will say, ``You know, I talked to  my Senator'' or ``I talked to somebody on the staff of my Senator''? It  is always ``my Senator.''   Why is it that we say ``my Senator''? We say that because the people  you represent are proud of their Senators. They absolutely feel that  connection of pride because that is not just Pat Toomey of  Pennsylvania. That is my Senator from Pennsylvania. Or Bob Casey from  Scranton--that is my Senator.   And you like that. People like that. The people back home really do.   U.S. Senators have a reputation, and it is deserved. They have a  reputation for coolheadedness, being erudite--the men and women who we  send from back home to DC to look after our interests. We feel a sense  of ownership and a sense of pride in our Senators.   There is plenty of times I have been around in political gatherings  where I hear, There is no way Senator Toomey is going to allow that--I  don't mean to pick you on, Pat--or There is no way Senator Casey is  going to allow that--because we feel pride.   When something bad is potentially in the wind, we expect our U.S.  Senators not reacting to popular will and not reacting to popular  emotions. We expect them to do what is right, notwithstanding what is  immediately and expedient that the media tells us is the topic of the  day.   So Senators are patriots. Senators are family men and women. They are  fierce advocates for the great State which they represent. And  somewhere far down that list of attributes, way below patriot and way  below love of family and country and way below fierce advocates for  their States, far down--at least that is what I thought, anyway, and I  still think that. Somewhere far down that list, Senators have some  obligation to be partisans, to represent a group of beliefs that are  similar to beliefs shared by other United States Senators.   I understand that. And, in fact, I have no problem with that system.  It helps us debate and decide what is best for America, the robust  debate of different points of view. And I dare say that Senator Schumer  and Senator McConnell represent those things in this body and make sure  that everything is talked out and robustly debated in this room before  United States Senators make a decision of extreme importance to the  people they represent.   I know you aren't allowed to talk, but I don't see either one of them  jumping up and saying I am wrong about that because I think that that  is what happens. I think United States Senators try to listen to each  other's views. I think United States Senators try to do what is right  for the country, and far down is partisanship.   In our system of government, and if you read the Federalist Papers-- we are very fortunate because the Federalist Papers were authored as an  explanation for why it is the States, the original States, should adopt  the Constitution. These were persuasive documents about why the  Constitution is a good thing, because if the individual State  legislatures didn't adopt the Constitution, we would not have it.   So Mr. Jay and Mr. Madison and Mr. Hamilton, they had an incentive to  explain what they were thinking when they wrote it because they are  explaining to other erudite people who represent individual States why  it is that they feel that this is the right thing to do. And, in fact,  as many of you well know, Madison had to promise that there would be a  Bill of Rights immediately upon adoption or we wouldn't have a  Constitution. Even then there was horse trading going on in the  legislative body of the United States.   The other day, when I was down here in Washington--I came down  earlier in the week to try to figure out how to find my way around. I  worked in this building 40 years ago. I got lost then, and I still do.   But in studying the Constitution in all the years I was a prosecutor,  where so many things depend on interpretations of phrases in the  Constitution, I learned that this body, which one of my worthy  colleagues said is the greatest deliberative body in the entire world-- and I agree--that was--that particular aspect of our government was  intentionally created, if you read the Federalist Papers.   The last time a body such as the United States Senate sat at the  pinnacle of government with the responsibility that it has today, it  was happening in Athens and it was happening in Rome.   Republicanism, the form of government republicanism, throughout  history has always and without exception fallen because of fights from  within, because of partisanship from within, because of bickering from  within. And in each one of those examples that I mentioned--and there  are certainly others, probably, that are smaller countries that lasted  for less time that I don't know about off the top of my head.   But each one of them, once there was the vacuum created that the  greatest deliberative bodies--the Senate of Greece sitting in Athens,  the Senate of Rome--the moment that they devolved into such  partisanship, it is not as though they ceased to exist; they ceased to  exist as representative democracy, both replaced by totalitarianism.  [[Page S599]]    Paraphrasing the famous quote from Benjamin Franklin, who, as a  Philadelphian, I feel as though I can do that because he is my Founding  Father too: He who would trade liberty for some temporary security  deserves neither liberty nor security. If we restrict liberty to attain  security, we will lose both.   And isn't the way we have enshrined in the Constitution the concepts  of liberty that we think are critical, the very concepts of liberty  that drove us to separate from Great Britain--and I can't believe these  fellas are quoting what happened prerevolution as though that is  somehow of value to us.   We left the British system. If we are really going to use  prerevolutionary history in Great Britain, then the precedent is we  have a Parliament and we have a King. Is that the precedent that we are  heading for?   Now, it is not an accident that the very first liberty--if you grant  me that our liberties are enumerated in the Bill of Rights, it is not  an accident that the very first liberty in the first article of the  Bill of Rights is the First Amendment, which says: ``Congress shall  make no law . . . abridging freedom of speech,'' and et cetera.  ``Congress shall make no law . . . ''--the very first one, the most  important one, the ability to have free and robust debate, free and  robust political speech.   Something that Mr. Raskin and his team brought up is that it is  somehow a suggestion from former President Trump's team that when  various public officials were not denouncing the violence that we saw  over the summer, that that was somehow the former President equating  that speech to his own. Not at all. Exactly backwards.   I saw a headline: Representative so-and-so seeks to walk back  comments about--I forget what it was--something that bothered her. I  was devastated when I saw that she thought it was necessary to go on  television yesterday or the day before and say she needs to walk back  her comments.   She should be able to comment as much as she wants, and she should be  able to say exactly as she feels. And if she feels that the supporters  of then-President Trump are not worthy of having their ideas  considered, she should be permitted to say that, an anybody who agrees  should be permitted to say they agree. That is what we broke away from  Great Britain in order to be able to do: to be able to say what we  thought in the most robust political debate.    My colleague Mike van der Veen is going to give you a recitation on  the First Amendment law of the United States. I commend to your  attention the analysis that he is going to give you.   I don't expect and I don't believe that the former President expects  anybody to walk back any of the language. If that is how they feel  about the way things transpired over the last couple of years in this  country, they should be allowed to say that, and I will go to court and  defend them if anything happens to them as a result. If the government  takes action against that State representative or that U.S.  Representative who wants to walk back her comments, if the government  takes action against her, I have no problem going into court and  defending her right to say those things, even though I don't agree with  them.   This trial is not about trading liberty for security. It is about  trading--it is about suggesting that it is a good idea that we give up  those liberties that we have so long fought for. We have sent armies to  other parts of the world to convince those governments to implement the  freedoms that we enjoy.   This trial is about trading liberty for the security from the mob?  Honestly, no, it can't be. We can't be thinking about that. We can't  possibly be suggesting that we punish people for political speech in  this country. And if people go and commit lawless acts as a result of  their beliefs and they cross the line, they should be locked up.   And, in fact, I have seen quite a number of the complaints that were  filed against the people who breached the Capitol. Some of them charged  conspiracy. Not a single one I noticed charged conspiracy with the 45th  President of the United States, probably because prosecutors have an  ethical requirement that they are not allowed to charge people with  criminal offenses without probable cause. You might consider that.   And if we go down the road that my very worthy adversary here, Mr.  Raskin, asks you to go down, the floodgates will open. I was going to  say it will--instead of ``floodgates,'' I was going to say originally  it will ``release the whirlwind,'' which is a Biblical reference, but I  subsequently learned, since I got here, that that particular phrase has  already been taken, so I figured I had better change it to  ``floodgates.''   But the political pendulum will shift one day. This Chamber and the  Chamber across the way will change one day, and partisan impeachments  will become commonplace.   You know, until the impeachment of Bill Clinton, no one alive had  ever lived through a Presidential impeachment, not unless some of you  are 150 years old. Not a single person alive had lived through a  Presidential impeachment. Now most of us have lived through three of  them.   This is supposed to be the ultimate safety valve, the last thing that  happens, the most rare treatment, and a session where this body is  sitting as a Court of Impeachment among the most rare things it does.   So the slippery-slope principle will have taken hold if we continue  to go forward with what is happening today and scheduled to happen  later this week. And after we are long done here and after there has  been a shift in the political winds and after there is a change in the  makeup of the United States House of Representatives and maybe a change  in the makeup of the United States Senate, the pressure from those  folks back home, especially for Members of the House, is going to be  tremendous because, remember, the Founders recognized that the argument  that I started with, that political pressure is driven by the need for  immediate action because something under contemporary community  standards really horrific happened and the people represented by the  Members of the United States House of Representatives become incensed.   And what do you do if a Federal issue--you are back in suburban  Philadelphia and something happens that makes the people who live there  incensed? You call your Congressman. And your Congressman, elected  every 2 years, with their pulse on the people of their district,  750,000 people, they respond. And, boy, do they respond. The  Congressman calls you back, a staffer calls you back, and you get all  the information that they have on the issue. Sometimes you even get  invited to submit language that would improve whatever the issue is.    Well, when the pendulum swings, perhaps the next person who gets  impeached and is sent here for you to consider is Eric Holder during  Fast and Furious, the Attorney General of the United States, or any  other person whom the other party considers to be a political danger to  them down the road because of their avowed abilities and being  articulate and having a resume that shows that they are capable.   I picked Eric simply because I think he has a tremendous--he has had  a tremendous career, and he might be somebody whom some Republicans  somewhere might be worried about. So maybe the next person they go  after is Eric Holder.   And, you know, the Republicans might regain the House in 2 years.  History does tend to suggest that the party out of power in the White  House does well in the midterm elections. Certainly, the 2020  elections, the House gained--the House majority narrowed, and there was  a gain of Republicans.   The Members of the House--they have to worry about these consequences  because if they don't react to whatever the problem of the day is,  somebody in that jurisdiction there--somebody is going to say: If you  make me the Congressman, I react to that. And that means that the  sitting Member has to worry about it because their terms are short.   And it is not just Members of the House of Representatives with their  short--with their short terms. I saw on television the last couple of  days the honorable gentleman from Nebraska, Mr. Sasse--I saw that he  faced backlash back home because of a vote he made some weeks ago, that  the political party was complaining about a decision he made as a  United States Senator.  [[Page S600]]    You know, it is interesting because I don't want to steal the thunder  from the other lawyers, but Nebraska, you are going to hear, is quite a  judicial-thinking place, and just maybe Senator Sasse is onto  something, and you will hear about what it is that the Nebraska courts  have to say about the issue that you all are deciding this week. There  seem to be some pretty smart jurists in Nebraska, and I can't believe a  United States Senator doesn't know that.   A Senator like the gentleman from Nebraska, whose Supreme Court  history is ever present in his mind, and rightfully so, he faces the  whirlwind even though he knows what the judiciary in his State thinks.   People back home will demand their House Members continue the cycle  as political fortunes rise and fall. The only entity that stands  between the bitter in-fighting that led to the downfall of the Greek  Republic and the Roman Republic and the American Republic is the Senate  of the United States.   Shall the business of the Senate and thus the Nation come to a halt,  not just for the current weeks while a new President is trying to fill  out his administration, but shall the business of the Senate and the  Nation come to a halt because impeachment becomes the rule rather than  the rare exception? I know you can see this as a possibility because  not a single one of you ever thought that you would be doing a second  impeachment inside of 13 months, and the pressure will be enormous to  respond in kind.   To quote Everett Dirksen, the gallant men and women of the Senate  will not allow that to happen. And this Republic will endure because  the top responsibility of the United States Senator and the top  characteristic that you all have in common--and, boy, this is a diverse  group, but there isn't a single one of you who, A, doesn't consider  yourself a patriot of the United States, and 2, there isn't a single  one of you who doesn't consider the other 99 to be patriots of the  United States. And that is why this attack on the Constitution will not  prevail.   The document that is before you is flawed. The rule of the Senate  concerning impeachment documents, Articles of Impeachment, rule XXIII,  says that such documents cannot be divided. You might have seen that we  wrote that in the answer. It might have been a little legalistic or  legalese for the newspapers to opine on very much, but there is some  significance.   The House managers, clever fellows that they are, they cast a broad  net. They need to get 67 of you to agree they are right. And that is a  good strategy. I would use the same strategy, except there is a rule  that says you can't use that strategy. You see, rule XXIII says that  the Article of Impeachment is indivisible, and the reason why that is  significant is you have to agree that every single aspect of the entire  document warrants impeachment because it is an all-or-nothing document.  You can't cut out parts that you agree with that warrant impeachment  and parts that don't, because it is not divisible. It flat-out says in  the Senate rules it is not divisible   Now, previous impeachments, like President Clinton's, said the  President shall be found guilty of high crimes and misdemeanors for  engaging in one or more of the following and then gives a list, so all  you had to do was win one, but they didn't do that here. It has to be  all or nothing.   Some of these things that you are asked to consider might be close  calls in your mind, but one of them is not. The argument about the 14th  Amendment is absolutely ridiculous. The House managers tell you that  the President should be impeached because he violated the 14th  Amendment. Here is what the 14th Amendment says:         No person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress,       or elector of President and Vice President, or hold any       office, civil or military, under the United States, or [any       other] state, who, having previously taken an oath, as a       member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States, or       [as] a member of any state legislature, or as an executive or       judicial officer of any state, to support the Constitution of       the United States, [and] shall have engaged in insurrection       or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the       enemies thereof. But Congress may vote by two-thirds of each       House [to] remove such disability.    It doesn't take a constitutional scholar to recognize that that is  written for people who fought for the Confederacy or who were previous  military officers or were in the government of the Confederacy, and it  doesn't take a constitutional scholar to require that they be convicted  first in a court, with due process of law. So it never--that question  can never be ripe until those things have happened.   If you agree with those arguments--and I know you will all get your  Constitutions out and you will read it, and if you agree with those  arguments, the suggestion that the 14th Amendment applies here is  ridiculous. And if you come to that conclusion, then, because the  managers have not separated out the counts, any counts within the  Article of Impeachment, the whole thing falls.   I didn't write that. They are married to that. I wrote it out in  individual responses because I didn't know how to respond to the cast- the-wide-net effort. And fortunately Senators sometime in the past  realized that you can't do that because you passed a rule that says:  Hey, you can't do that. So that is why it is flawed. It is flawed in  other ways, too, and my colleague will explain that.   I was struck--I thought the House managers who spoke earlier were  brilliant speakers, and I made some notes. They will hear about what I  think about some of the things they said later when I am closing the  case, but I thought they were brilliant speakers, and I loved listening  to them. They are smart fellows. But why are the House managers afraid  and why is the majority--the House of Representatives afraid of the  American people?   I mean, let's understand why we are really here. We are really here  because the majority in the House of Representatives does not want to  face Donald Trump as a political rival in the future. That is the real  reason we are here. That is why they have to get over the  jurisdictional hurdle, which they can't get over, but that is why they  have to get over that in order to get to the part of the Constitution  that allows removal. So that is the--nobody says it that plainly, but  unfortunately I have a way of speaking that way.   And the reason that I am having trouble with the argument is, the  American people just spoke, and they just changed administrations. So  in the light most favorable to my colleagues on the other side of the  aisle here, their system works. The people are smart enough--in the  light most favorable to them, they are smart enough to pick a new  administration if they don't like the old one, and they just did, and  he is down there at Pennsylvania Avenue now, probably wondering, how  come none of my stuff is happening up at the Capitol?   Why do the Members of the House of Representatives--the majority of  the House of Representatives--why are they afraid of the very people  who sent them to do this job, the people they hope will continue to  send them back here? Why are they afraid that those same people who  were smart enough to pick them as their Congressmen aren't smart enough  to pick somebody who is a candidate for President of the United States?  Why fear that the people will all of a sudden forget how to choose an  administration in the next few years?   In fact, this happens all the time when there are changes in  administrations from one-term Presidents to others. Well, Nixon was  sort of 1\1/2\ term, but Nixon to Ford, Ford to Carter, Carter to  Reagan, Bush 41 to Clinton. It happens. The people get tired of an  administration they don't want, and they know how to change it. And  they just did.   So why think that they won't know how to do it in 2024 if they want  to, or is that what the fear is? Is the fear that the people in 2024,  in fact, will want to change and will want to go back to Donald Trump  and not the current occupant of the White House, President Biden?  Because all of these other times, the people were smart enough to do  it, choose who the President should be, and all these other times, they  were smart enough to choose who their Members of Congress were--and, by  the way, choose you all as well--but they are not smart enough to know  how to change the administration, especially since they just did. So it  seems pretty evident to me that they do know how. It has worked 100  percent of the time. One hundred percent of the time in the  [[Page S601]]  United States, when the people had been fed up with and had enough of  the occupant of the White House, they changed the occupant of the White  House.   Now, I know that one of the strengths of this body is its  deliberative action.   I saw Senator Manchin on the TV the other night talking about the  filibuster. And the main point was that Senator Manchin was explaining  to those of us who don't operate here all the time, that this body has  an obligation to try to reach consensus across the aisle to legitimize  the decisions it makes. Obviously, he is capable of making his own  pronouncements on it, but that is what came across on the television.  And I think that that is a good way of saying why the Senate of the  United States is different than other places.   You know, the Constitution is a document designed to protect the  rights of the minority, not the rights of the majority. Congress shall  make no law abridging all of these things. That is because those were  the things that were of concern at the time. It is easy to be in favor  of liberty and equality and free speech when it is popular.   I think that I want to give my colleague Mr. Schoen an opportunity to  explain to all of us the legal analysis on jurisdiction.   I will be quite frank with you. We changed what we were going to do  on account that we thought that the House managers' presentation was  well done, and I wanted you to know that we have responses to those  things.   I thought that what the first part of the case was, which was the  equivalent of a motion to dismiss, was going to be about jurisdiction  alone, and one of the fellows who spoke for the House managers--who was  a formal criminal defense attorney--seemed to suggest that there was  something nefarious that we were discussing jurisdiction in trying to  get the case dismissed, but this is where it happens in the case  because jurisdiction is the first thing that has to be found.   We have counterarguments to everything that they raised, and you will  hear them later on in the case from Mr. van der Veen and from myself.   But on the issue of jurisdiction--the scholarly issue of  jurisdiction--I will leave you with this before I invite David to come  up and give you the erudite explanation. Some of this was shown on the  screen, but article I, section 3 says:         Judgment in Cases of Impeachment shall not extend further       than to removal from Office, and disqualification to hold . .       . any Office of honor, Trust or Profit under the United       States: but the Party convicted shall nevertheless be liable       and subject to Indictment, Trial, Judgment and Punishment,       according to law.    So this idea of a January amnesty is nonsense. If my colleagues on  this side of the Chamber actually think that President Trump committed  a criminal offense--and let's understand a high crime is a felony and a  misdemeanor is a misdemeanor. The words haven't changed that much over  time. After he is out of office, you go and arrest him.   So there is no opportunity where the President of the United States  can run rampant into January, the end of his term, and just go away  scot-free. The Department of Justice does know what to do with such  people. And so far, I haven't seen any activity in that direction.   And not only that, the people who stormed this building and breached  it were not accused of conspiring with the President. But the section I  read--``Judgment''--in other words, the bad thing that can happen--the  ``Judgment in Cases of Impeachment''--i.e., what we are doing--``shall  not extend further than . . . removal from Office.''   What is so hard about that? Which of those words are unclear?         Shall not extend further than removal . . . from Office.    President Trump no longer is in office. The object of the  Constitution has been achieved. He was removed by the voters.   Mr. Schoen, are you ready--now that I have taken all of his time.   Thank you, Mr. President.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Mr. Schoen.   Mr. Counsel SCHOEN. Mr. President, leaders.   I stand before you in what I always thought as the hallowed ground of  democracy. In this room, American lives have been changed so  dramatically in just my lifetime through so many of your legislative  initiatives from the Civil Rights Act, when I was a child, through,  most recently, the FIRST STEP Act--laws that have provided major  opportunities for Americans to move forward and upward and more fully  enjoy all of the attributes of what has been the greatest Nation on  Earth.   I have seen the changes these laws have made to my clients every day  for the past 36 years. These laws have enabled me to fight for their  enjoyment of a fair stake in our American project.   I stand before a group of 100 United States Senators who have chosen  to serve your country from all corners of this great Nation, giving up  all sorts of professions, time with family, and perhaps other more  lucrative opportunities to serve your country.   Mr. President, you are a man who so honorably served this Nation in  the Senate and in public service before your tenure here. It is an  honor to appear in this historic hall of democracy.   Yet today, that honor is tempered by an overriding feeling of grave  concern, grave concern for the danger to the institution of the  Presidency that I believe even convening these proceedings indicates.  The joy I believed I would feel if I ever had the great privilege of  appearing before this body is replaced by sadness and pain. My  overriding emotion is, frankly, wanting to cry for what I believe these  proceedings will do to our great, so long-enduring, sacred Constitution  and to the American people on both sides of the great divide that now  characterizes our Nation.   Esteemed Members of the Senate, going forward with this impeachment  trial of a former President of the United States is unconstitutional  for reasons we have set out in our brief, some of which we will focus  on here. And as a matter of policy, it is wrong as wrong can be for all  of us as a nation.   We are told by those who favor having these proceedings that we have  to do it fo accountability. But anyone truly interested in real  accountability for what happened at the Capitol on January 6 would, of  course, insist on waiting for a full investigation to be completed.  Indeed, one is underway in earnest already, intent on getting to the  bottom of what happened.    Anyone interested in ensuring that it is truly the one or ones  responsible from whom accountability is sought would more than  willingly wait for the actual evidence, especially with new evidence  coming in every day about preplanning, about those who were involved,  and about their agenda bearing no relationship to the claims made here.   They say you need this trial before the Nation can heal, that the  Nation cannot heal without it. I say our Nation cannot possibly heal  with it. With this trial, you will open up new and bigger wounds across  the Nation, for a great many Americans see this process for exactly  what it is: a chance by a group of partisan politicians seeking to  eliminate Donald Trump from the American political scene and seeking to  disenfranchise 74 million-plus American voters and those who dare to  share their political beliefs and vision of America. They hated the  results of the 2016 election and want to use this impeachment process  to further their political agenda.   These elitists have mocked them for 4 years. They called their fellow  Americans who believe in their country and their Constitution  ``deplorables.'' And the latest talk is that they need to deprogram  those who supported Donald Trump and the Grand Old Party. But at the  end of the day, this is not just about Donald Trump or any individual.  This is about our Constitution and abusing the impeachment power for  political gain.   They tell us that we have to have this impeachment trial, such as it  is, to bring about unity, but they don't want unity. And they know this  so-called trial will tear the country in half, leaving tens of millions  of Americans feeling left out of the Nation's agenda, as dictated by  one political party that now holds the power in the White House and in  our national legislature.   But they are proud Americans who never quit getting back up when they  are down, and they don't take dictates from another party based on  partisan  [[Page S602]]  force-feeding. This trial will tear this country apart, perhaps like we  have only seen once before in our history.   And to help the Nation heal, we now learn that the House managers, in  their wisdom, have hired a movie company and a large law firm to  create, manufacture, and splice for you a package designed by experts  to chill and horrify you and our fellow Americans. They want to put you  through a 16-hour presentation over 2 days, focusing on this as if it  were some sort of blood sport. And to what end? For healing? For unity?  For accountability? Not for any of those. For, surely, there are much  better ways to achieve each. It is, again, for pure, raw, misguided  partisanship that makes them believe playing to our worst instincts  somehow is good.   They don't need to show you movies to show you that the riot happened  here. We will stipulate that it happened, and you know all about it.   This is a process fueled irresponsibly by base hatred by these House  managers and those who gave them their charge, and they are willing to  sacrifice our national character to advance their hatred and their fear  that one day they might not be the party in power. They have a very  different view of democracy and freedom.   From Justice Jackson who once wrote:         [But][F]reedom to differ is not limited to things that do       not matter much. That would be a mere shadow of freedom. The       test of its substance is the right to differ as to things       that touch at the heart of the existing order.    They have a very different view of democracy and freedom. This is  nothing less than the political weaponization of the impeachment  process--pure, raw sport, fueled by the misguided idea of party over  country when, in fact, both will surely suffer.   I can promise you that if these proceedings go forward, everyone will  look bad. You will see and hear many Members of our Congress saying and  doing things they must surely regret. But, perhaps, far worse than a  moment of personal shame in a world in which history passes from our  memories in a moment, our great country, a model for all the world,  will be far more divided and our standing around the world will be  badly broken. Our arch enemies who pray each and every day for our  downfall will watch with glee, glowing in the moment as they see you at  your worst and our country in internal divide.   Let's be perfectly clear. If you vote to proceed with this  impeachment trial, future Senators will recognize that you bought into  a radical, constitutional theory that departs clearly from the language  of the Constitution itself and holds--and this is in their brief--that  any civil officer who ever dares to want to serve his or her country  must know that they will be subject to impeachment long after their  service in office has ended, subject only to the political and cultural  landscape of the day that is in operation at any future time. This is  exactly the position taken by the House managers at page 65 of their  brief--unprecedented, radical position. They unabashedly say so.    Imagine the potential consequences for civil officers you know and  who you believed served so honorably but who, in the view of a future  Congress, might one day be deemed to be impeachment worthy. Imagine it  now because your imagination is the only limitation.   The House managers tell you a correct reading of the impeachment  power under the Constitution is that it has no temporal limit and can  reach back in time without limitation to target anyone who dared to  serve our Nation as a civil officer. Now add that to their demand that  you Members put your imprimatur on the snap impeachment they returned  in this case and can do again in the future if you endorse it by going  forward with this impeachment trial. This is an untenable combination  that literally puts the institution of the Presidency directly at risk,  nothing less, and it does much more.   Under their unsupportable constitutional theory and tortured reading  of the text, every civil officer who has served is at risk of  impeachment if any given group elected to the House decides that what  was thought to be an important service to the country when they served  now deserves to be canceled.   They have made clear in public statements that what they really want  to accomplish here, in the name of the Constitution, is to bar Donald  Trump from ever running for political office again, but this is an  affront to the Constitution no matter who they target today. It means  nothing less than the denial of the right to vote and the independent  right for a candidate to run for elective political office, guaranteed  by the 1st and 14th Amendments to the Constitution, using the guise of  impeachment as a tool to disenfranchise.   Perhaps my friend put the situation simply and sharply into focus  last week on his radio show. My friend is a distinguished lawyer who  served as an Ambassador to former President Obama and has friends among  you. He described himself to his listeners as a dyed-in-the-wool,  lifelong Democrat, but he said the idea of 100 people in these  circumstances deciding that tens of millions of American voters cannot  cast their vote for their candidate for President ever again is  unthinkable, and it truly should be.   I will discuss today several reasons this matter should not and must  not proceed; why the Senate lacks jurisdiction to conduct this trial of  a former President--a President no longer in office and now a private  citizen. Any single reason in our trial memorandum or discussed today  suffices, but I want to start with a discussion of the fundamental due  process lacking from the start, and that would last through the end if  this goes forward because it is this irretrievably flawed process and  its product--a dangerous snap impeachment--that brings us here and that  threatens to send a message into the future that we will all regret  forever and that will stain this body, which up to now our Founding  Fathers believed was uniquely suited for the most difficult task of  conducting an impeachment trial, as Mr. Hamilton wrote in Federalist  No. 65.   These aren't just niceties. I make no apology for demanding in your  name, in the name of the Constitution, that the rights to due process  guaranteed under the Constitution are adhered to in a process as  serious as this in our national lives.   The denial of due process in this case, of course, starts with the  House of Representatives. In this unprecedented snap impeachment  process, the House of Representatives denied every attribute of  fundamental constitutional due process that Americans correctly have  come to believe is part of what makes this country so great. How and  why did that happen? It is a function of the insatiable lust for  impeachment in the House for the past 4 years.   Consider this:   (Video footage.)         Mr. Raskin: I want to say this for Donald Trump who I may       well be voting to impeach.        Mr. Ellison: Donald Trump has already done a number of       things which legitimately raise the question of impeachment.        Ms. Waters: I don't respect this President, and I will       fight every day until he is impeached!        Mr. Castro: That is grounds to start impeachment       proceedings. Those are grounds to start impeachment. Those       are grounds to start impeachment proceedings. Yes, I think       that's grounds to start impeachment proceedings.        Mr. Green: I rise today, Mr. Speaker, to call for the       impeachment of the President of the United States of America.        Ms. Waters: I continue to say, Impeach him! Impeach 45!       Impeach 45!    (People chanting: ``Yeah.'')         Mr. Cohen: So we are calling upon the House to begin       impeachment hearings immediately.        Mr. Commentator: On th impeachment of Donald Trump, would       you vote yes or no?        Ms. Ocasio-Cortez: I would vote yes.        Ms. Omar: I would vote to impeach.        Ms. Tlaib: Because we're going to go in there, and we're       going to impeach the [bleep bleep]!        Mr. Sherman: The fact is I introduced Articles of       Impeachment in July of 2017.        Mr. Green: If we don't impeach this President, he will get       reelected.        Mr. Cohen: My oath requires me to be for impeachment, have       impeachment hearings, and leave a scarlet ``I'' on his chest.        Mr. Booker: The Representatives should begin impeachment       proceedings against this President.        Ms. Warren: It is time to bring impeachment charges against       him. Bring impeachment charges.        Mr. Nadler: My personal view is that he richly deserves       impeachment.        Ms. Tlaib: We are here at an impeachment rally, and we are       ready to impeach the--    (People chanting: ``Yeah.'')   I can't say it.   The relevant timeline in the House reveals the rush to judgment.  [[Page S603]]    On the day following the January 6 riot, the House leadership  cynically sensed a political opportunity to score points against the  outgoing then-President Trump, and the Speaker demanded that Vice  President Pence invoke the 25th Amendment, threatening immediate  impeachment for the President if Mr. Pence did not comply with this  extraordinary and extraordinarily wrong demand.   Four days later, on January 11, 2021, the instant Article of  Impeachment was introduced in the House. Speaker Pelosi then gave the  Vice President another ultimatum, threatening to begin impeachment  proceedings within 24 hours if he did not comply. Vice President Pence  rejected Speaker Pelosi's demand, favoring instead adherence to the  Constitution and the best interests of the Nation over a politically  motivated threat.   On January 12, Speaker Pelosi announced who the nine impeachment  managers would be, and on January 13, 2021, just days after holding a  press conference to announce the launching of an inquiry, the House  adopted the Article of Impeachment, completing the fastest impeachment  inquiry in history and, according President Trump, no due process at  all over strong opposition, based in large part on the complete lack of  due process.   To say there was a rush to judgment by the House would be a grave  understatement. It is not as if the House Members who voted to impeach  were not mightily warned about the dangers to the institution of the  Presidency and to our system of due process. They were warned in the  strongest of terms from within their own ranks adamantly, clearly, and  in no uncertain terms not to take this dangerous snap impeachment  course. Those warnings were framed in the context of the constitutional  due process that was denied here.   Consider the warnings given by one Member during the House  proceedings, pleading with the other Members to accord this decision  the due process the Constitution demands.   This is Representative Cole of Oklahoma:         With only 1 week to go in his term, the majority is asking       us to consider a resolution impeaching President Trump, and       they do so knowing full well that even if the House passes       this resolution, the Senate will not be able to begin       considering these charges until after President Trump's term       ends.        I can think of no action the House can take that is more       likely to further divide the American people than the action       we are contemplating today. Emotions are clearly running high       and political divisions have never been more apparent in my       lifetime.    Said by Representative Cole.   Mr. Cole's words on the floor emphasizing the care that must be taken  with respect to the consideration of the Article of Impeachment echo  the concerns by our Founding Fathers on this subject.   Listen to this from Mr. Hamilton in Federalist No. 65:         A well constituted court for the trial of impeachments, is       an object not more to be desired than difficult to be       obtained in a government wholly elective. . . . The       prosecution of them, for this reason, will seldom fail to       agitate the passions of the whole community, and to divide it       into parties, more or less friendly or inimical, to the       accused. In many cases, it will connect itself with the pre-      existing factions, and will inlist all their animosities,       partialities, influence and interest on one side, or on the       other; and in such cases there will always be the greatest       danger, that the decision will be regulated more by the       comparative strength of parties than by the real       demonstrations of innocence or guilt.    Prescient thinking by Mr. Hamilton, as we see often   In what I say to you is a proof of the need for due process, based on  the critically serious nature of the singular role the impeachment  process has in our government, Mr. Hamilton characterized the  consideration of an impeachment in these terms:         The delicacy and magnitude of a trust, which so deeply       concerns the political reputation and existence of every man       engaged in the administration of public affairs, speak for       themselves.    This, too, is in Federalist No. 65.   Now back to the House and the warnings against this rushed judgment  in this case.   Mr. Cole of Oklahoma again. In the name of healing, a path forward he  said our people so desperately need, he warned that ``the House is  moving forward erratically with a truncated process that does not  comport with the modern practice and that will give members no time to  contemplate the serious nature of action before us.''   Mr. Cole emphasized to his colleagues that such care must be taken  with the consideration of an Article of Impeachment ``in order to  ensure that the American people have confidence in the procedures the  House is following and because the Presidency itself demands due  process in the impeachment proceedings.''   Congressman Cole continued:         Unfortunately, the majority has chosen to race to the floor       with a new Article of Impeachment, forgoing any       investigation, any committee process or any chance for       Members to fully contemplate this course of action before       proceeding.    Mr. Cole complained that ``the majority is failing to provide the  House with an opportunity to review all the facts--which are still  coming to light--to discuss all the evidence, to listen to scholars, to  examine the witnesses, and to consider precedence.''   He noted further:         This is not the type of robust process we have followed for       every modern impeachment, and the failure to do so does a       great disservice to this institution and to this country.    Mr. Cole complained right on the House floor that ``rather than  following the appropriate processes the House has used in every modern  impeachment, the majority is rushing to the floor, tripping all over  themselves in their rush to impeach the President a second time.'' And  in Mr. Cole's words, it was doing so to ``settle scores.'' He warned  this snap impeachment approach would cause great division as the  country looks ahead to the start of a new administration.   He said to them:         In a matter as grave and consequential as impeachment,       shouldn't we follow the same process we have used in every       modern impeachment rather than rushing to the floor?    And he implored them:         On behalf of generations of Americans to come, we need to       think more clearly about the consequences of our action       today.    Mr. Cole then reached across the aisle and credited a Member of this  body, Senator Manchin, having voiced similar sentiments about how ill- advised this rushed process was, suggesting that the underlying events  were a matter for the judicial system to investigate, not one for a  rushed political process.   Finally, Mr. Cole admonished his fellow House Members, telling them:         We need to recognize that we are following a flawed       process.    The alarm Mr. Cole sounded went unheeded.   Now let us consider the process in the House that actually was due.  The House managers assert in their memorandum that ``[t]he House serves  as a grand jury and prosecutor under the Constitution.'' They told you  that again today. If this is accurate, then they highlight the complete  failure to adhere to due process.         One should not diminish the significance of impeachment's       legal aspects, particularly as they relate to the formalities       of the criminal justice process. It is a hybrid of the       political and the legal, a political process moderated by       legal formalities.    This is a quote, Richard Broughton.   The Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides, in  relevant part, that ``no person shall be . . . deprived of life,  liberty or property, without due process of law.'' The Supreme Court  long ago recognized in Matthews v. Eldridge that, at its core, due  process is about what we all want, what we all have the right to  demand--fundamental fairness. One scholar, Brian Owsley, has written  that ``the impeachment process should and does include some of the  basic safeguards for the accused that are observed in a criminal  process such as fairness, due process, presumption of innocence, and  proportionality''--basic American values. And, of course, we know that  the Supreme Court has recognized that due process protections attend  congressional investigations. While Congress is empowered to make its  own rules of proceeding, it may not make rules that ignore  constitutional restraints or violate fundamental rights.   While the case law is limited in terms of spelling out what due  process looks like in impeachment hearings and, of course, in the Nixon  case--Walter, not Richard--we know that there is a great deal of leeway  afforded Congress with respect to its impeachment  [[Page S604]]  rules. It is clear that the fundamental principles that underlie our  understanding of what due process must always look like apply.   In Hastings v. United States, a DC court case vacated on different  grounds, they address the matter, clearly concluding that the due  process clause applies to impeachment proceedings and that it imposes  an independent constitutional constraint on how the Senate exercises  its sole power to try all impeachments under article I, section 3,  clause 6.   The court wrote in Hastings:         Impeachment is an extraordinary remedy. As an essential       element of our constitutional system of checks and balances,       impeachment must be invoked and carried out with solemn       respect and scrupulous attention to fairness. Fairness and       due process must be the watchword whenever a branch of the       United States Government conducts a trial, whether it be in a       criminal case, a civil case or a case of impeachment.    A 1974 Department of Justice memo suggested the same view, opining  that ``whether or not capable of judicial enforcement, due process  standards would seem to be relevant to the manner of conducting an  impeachment proceeding.''   More specifically, as the Hastings court described it, ``one of the  key principles that lies at the heart of our constitutional democracy:  fairness.''   Again, fairness.   The Supreme Court's ``precedents establish the general rule that  individuals must receive notice and an opportunity to be heard before  the government deprives them'' of a constitutionally protected  interest. It is also true that ``in any proceeding that may lead to  deprivation of a protected interest, it requires fair procedures  commensurate with the interests at stake.''   Impeachment proceedings plainly involve deprivations of property and  liberty interests protected by the due process clause, and the House  surely seeks to strip Donald Trump of his most highly cherished  constitutional rights, including the right to be eligible to hold  public office again, should he so choose.   Due process must apply, and, at a minimum, due process in the  impeachment process must include that the evidence must be disclosed to  the accused, and the accused must be permitted an opportunity to test  and confront the evidence, particularly through ``the rights to  confront and cross-examine witnesses,'' which ``have long been  recognized as essential to due process.'' In almost every setting where  important decisions turn on questions of fact, due process requires an  opportunity to confront and cross-examine.   It is unfathomable that the Framers, steeped in the history of Anglo- American jurisprudence, would create a system that would allow the  Chief Executive and Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces to be  impeached based on a process that developed evidence without providing  any of the elementary procedures that the common law developed over  centuries for ensuring the proper testing of evidence in an adversarial  process. We would never countenance such a system in this country.   Current Members of the House and Senate leadership are themselves on  record repeatedly confirming these procedural due process requirements.  Indeed, Congressman Nadler is on record asserting that, in the context  of the House impeachment investigation, due process includes the  ``right to be informed of the law, of the charges against you, to call  your own witnesses, and to have the assistance of counsel.''   Then-President Trump was not given any semblance of the due process  Congressman Nadler clearly believes he deserves, based on the  Congressman's description of due process, that must be afforded to an  accused in an impeachment proceeding, as reflected in the statement he  made relating to another impeachment in 1998. No reason was found for  the apparent change in the Congressman's point of view with respect to  the two objects of the impeachments at issue.   These fundamental aspects of due process have been honored as  required parts of modern impeachment protocol since at least 1870. It  is not seriously debatable, nor should it be--nor should it be--by any  American legislator.   In spite of all this, the House leadership defied all the norms and  denied the then-President all of his basic and constitutionally  protected rights. With then-President Donald Trump, the House  impeachment procedure lacked any semblance of due process whatever. It  simply cannot be credibly argued to the country, and we do not make  special rules for different targets. It is the very integrity of the  institution that suffers when we do, and that is what the House  leadership knowingly has caused.   A review of the House record revealed that the Speaker streamlined  the impeachment process--H. Res. 24--to go straight to the floor for a  2-hour debate and a vote, without the ability for amendments. The House  record reflects no committee hearing, no witnesses, no presentation or  cross-examination of evidence, and no opportunity for the accused to  respond or even have counsel present to object.   As the New York Times recently reported, ``there were no witness  interviews, no hearings, no committee debates and no real additional  fact finding.''   House managers claim the need for impeachment was so urgent that they  had to rush the proceedings, with no time to spare for a more thorough  investigation or really, any investigation at all.    But that claim is belied by what happened or didn't happen next. The  House leadership unilaterally and by choice waited another 12 days to  deliver the Article to this Senate to begin the trial process. In other  words, the House leadership spent more time holding the adopted Article  than it did on the whole process leading up to the adoption of the  Article.   That intentional delay, designed to avoid having the trial begin  while Mr. Trump was still President, led to yet another egregious  denial of due process. Article I, section 3, clause 6 of our  Constitution, of course, provides, in pertinent part, that:         The Senate shall have the sole Power to try all       impeachments. When sitting for that Purpose, they shall be on       Oath or Affirmation. When the President of the United States       is tried, the Chief Justice shall preside.    By intentionally waiting until President Trump's term of office  expired before delivering the Article of Impeachment to the Senate to  initiate trial proceedings, Speaker Pelosi deprived then-President  Trump of the express constitutional right--and the right under the  Senate's own rule IV--to have the Chief Justice of the United States  preside over his trial and wield the considerable power provided for in  the Rules of Procedure and Practice in the Senate when sitting on  impeachment trials.   That power includes, under rule V, the Presiding Officer's exclusive  right to make and issue all orders; under rule VII, to make all  evidentiary orders subject to objection by a Member of the Senate.   We say, respectfully, that this intentional delay by Speaker Pelosi,  such that in the intervening period, President Trump became private  citizen Mr. Trump, constitutes a lapse or waiver of jurisdiction here,  for Mr. Trump no longer is ``the President'' described as subject to  impeachment in article I, section 3, clause 6 and in article II,  section 4, and this body, therefore, has no jurisdiction as a function  of that additional due process violation by Speaker Pelosi.   Moreover, with all due respect, then-President Trump suffered a  tangible detriment from Speaker Pelosi's actions, which violates not  only his rights to due process of law, but also his express  constitutional right to have the Chief Justice preside.   That tangible detriment includes the loss of the right to a conflict- free, impartial Presiding Officer--with all due respect--the very  purpose behind requiring the Chief Justice to preside over the  President's impeachment trial, along with the other benefits of having  the two branches combined--the Chief Justice from the Judiciary and the  Senate--for the impeachment trial of the President, reflected in  Federalist 66, one of the reasons the Chief Justice was chosen for that  task.   Mr. Trump now faces a situation in which the Presiding Officer will  serve as both judge, with all the powers that the rules endow him with,  and juror with a vote. And beyond that, the Presiding Officer, although  enjoying a lifelong, honorable reputation, of course,  [[Page S605]]  has been Mr. Trump's vocal and adamant opponent throughout the Trump  administration. And, in fact, in the very matter on trial, the  Presiding Officer, respectfully, already has publicly announced his  fixed view before hearing any argument or evidence that Mr. Trump must  be convicted on the Article of Impeachment before the Senate and,  indeed, that Members in both parties have an obligation to vote to  convict, as well.   Nowhere in this great country would any American--and, certainly, not  this honorable Presiding Officer--consider this scenario to be  consistent with any stretch of the American concept of due process and  a fair trial and certainly not even the appearance of either.   By no stretch of the imagination could any fairminded American be  confident that a trial so conducted would or could be the fair trial  promised by the leader   While most procedural aspects of a Senate impeachment trial may be  nonjusticiable political questions, this is not an excuse to ignore  what law and precedent clearly require. The present situation either  presents a violation of the constitutional text found in the articles  mentioned above that require the Chief Justice to preside when the  President is on trial or it is a clear denial of due process and fair  trial rights for Private Citizen Trump to face an impeachment trial so  conducted by the Senate.   The impeachment Article should be treated as a nullity and dismissed  based on the total lack of due process in the House. It should be  dismissed because of Speaker Pelosi's intentional abandonment or waiver  of jurisdiction, if the House ever acquired jurisdiction, and the  Article should be dismissed because the trial in the Senate of a  private citizen is not permitted, let alone with the conflicts just  described that attend this proceeding.   Finally, on the subject of due process in this matter, I say the  following: This is our Nation's sacred Constitution. It has served us  well since it was written, and it has been amended only through a  careful process. It is a document unique in all the world. It is a  foundational part of what makes the United States a beacon of light  among the other nations of the world. It not only has room for a  tremendous variety of perspectives on the philosophical and political  direction our country should take, it encourages the advocacy of our  differences.   But we have long held that fundamental to its health and well-being  and, therefore, to ours as a nation, is its insistence on due process  for every citizen. The emphasis on the right to due process long ago  was recognized as its life breath, a primary guarantor of its eternal  viability as our political, civic, and national guiding light.   We all well know that there are many systems in other countries  around the world that do not offer any semblance of the safeguards our  constitutional concept of due process provides. Some of them have  chosen their own handbooks, which direct their citizens' conduct on  penalty of death. This is one of them.   There can be no room for due process in such a system as this or the  system would be lost. Snap decisions are required in a system like this  to maintain power for one political philosophy over all others in those  kinds of systems.   But we as a nation have rejected those systems and the kind of snap  decisions they demand to maintain control for one party, for one point  of view, and for an imposed way of life. We choose to live freely under  a constitution that guarantees our freedom.   Other countries fear those freedoms and seek to ensure adherence to a  party line in all civic, political, spiritual, and other affairs and to  ensure that the party line is toed. And those systems have no place for  due process. Snap decisions that remove political figures are the norm.  Maintaining their systems depend on it. That is not our way in America  and never must be.   We choose in America to live by our Constitution and its amendments  and the due process this document demands for every citizen among us.  By putting your imprimatur on the snap judgment made in this matter, to  impeach the President of the United States without any semblance of due  process at every step along the way, puts the Office of the President  of the United States at risk every single day. It is far too dangerous  a proposition to countenance, and you must resoundingly reject it by  sending the message now that this proceeding, lacking due process from  start to finish, must end now with your vote that you lack jurisdiction  to conduct an impeachment trial for a former President, whose term in  office has expired and who is now a private citizen.   So one reason you must send this message here and now is because of  the complete lack of due process that brought this Article of  Impeachment before this body. God forbid we should ever lower our  vigilance to the principle of due process.   An impeachment trial of Private Citizen Trump held before the Senate  would be nothing more nor less than the trial of a private citizen by a  legislative body. An impeachment trial by the Senate of a private  citizen violates article I, section 9 of the United States  Constitution, which provides that ``[n]o bill of attainder . . . shall  be passed.''   The bill of attainder, as this clause is known, prohibits Congress  from enacting ``a law that legislatively determines guilt and inflicts  punishment upon an identifiable individual without provision of the  protections of a judicial trial.''         A bill of attainder is a legislative act which inflicts       punishment without a judicial trial--    A judicial trial--       The distinguishing characteristic of a bill of attainder is       the substitution of a legislative determination of guilt and       legislative imposition of punishment for judicial finding and       sentence.   [The Bill of Attainder Clause], and the separation of powers doctrine  generally, reflect the Framers' concern that trial by a legislature  lacks the safeguards necessary to prevent the abuse of power.    As the Supreme Court explained in United States v. Brown, ``[t]he  best available evidence, the writings of the architects of our  constitutional system, indicate that the Bill of Attainder Clause was  intended not as a narrow, technical (and therefore soon to be outmoded)  prohibition, but rather as an implementation of the separation of  powers, a general safeguard against legislative exercise of the  judicial function, or more simply--trial by legislature.'' The bill of  attainder ``reflected the Framers' belief that the Legislative Branch  is not so well suited as politically independent judges and juries.''   When the Senate undertakes an impeachment trial of a private citizen,  as it clearly understands to be the case here, supported by the fact  that the Chief Justice is not presiding and Mr. Trump is not ``the  President,'' it is acting as a judge and jury rather than a legislative  body. And this is exactly the type of situation that the bill of  attainder constitutional prohibition was meant to preclude.   It is clear that disqualification from holding future office, the  punishment the House managers intend to seek here, is a kind of  punishment, like banishment and others, that is subject to the  constitutional prohibition against the passage of bills of attainder,  under which designation bills of pains and penalties are included. The  cases include Cummings, Ex parte Garland, and this Brown case. The  Supreme Court three times has struck down provisions that precluded  support of the South or support of communism from holding certain jobs  as being in violation of this prohibition. Thus the impeachment of a  private citizen in order to disqualify them from holding office is an  unconstitutional act constituting a bill of attainder.   Moreover, this is the exact type of situation in which the fear would  be great that some Members of the Senate might be susceptible to acting  in the haste the House acted in when it rushed through the Article of  Impeachment in less than 48 hours, acting hastily simply to appease the  popular clamor of their political base--the very kind of concern  expressed by Mr. Hamilton in Federalist 65.   Moreover, as Chief Justice Marshall warned in Fletcher v. Peck, ``it  is not to be disguised that the framers of the constitution viewed,  with some apprehension, the violent acts that might grow out of the  feelings of the moment; and that the people of the United States, in  adopting that instrument, have manifested a determination to shield  themselves and their property  [[Page S606]]  from the effects of those sudden and strong passions to which men and  women are exposed. The restrictions on the legislative power of the  states are obviously founded in this sentiment; and the constitution of  the United States contains what may be deemed a bill of rights for the  people of each state. No state shall pass any bill of attainder. In  this form the power of the legislature over the lives and fortunes of  individuals is expressly restrained.''   So now let's turn to the text of the Constitution.   Turning to the text of the Constitution is, for many, of course, the  most appropriate and the most important starting place to trying to  answer a Constitution-based question. There are several passages of the  United States Constitution that relate to the Federal impeachment  process. Let's turn to a reading of the text now.   A true textual analysis, as the name implies, always begins with the  words of the text and only resorts to legislative history or history  itself if the meaning of the text is not plain. As the Supreme Court  has emphasized, ``[s]tatutory interpretation, as we always say, begins  with the text.'' ``In interpreting this text, we are guided by the  principle that the Constitution was written to be understood by the  voters; its words and phrases were used in their normal and ordinary as  distinguished from technical meaning.'' And ``[w]e must enforce plain  and unambiguous statutory language according to its terms.''   If a President is impeached, the unambiguous text of the Constitution  commands that the Chief Justice of the United States shall preside, as  we discussed earlier. Again, the Chief Justice is disinterested and  nonpartisan. His presence brings dignity and solemnity to such a  proceeding. In this case, the Chief Justice clearly is not presiding,  and the conflict of interest wouldn't necessarily just arise as a  substitute for the Vice President. It is the appearance of a conflict  of interest and the--and a conflict of interest and the prejudgment  that we have discussed. In this case, as we say, the Chief Justice  clearly is not presiding. The Senate President pro tempore is  presiding. It appears that in the leader's view, undoubtedly joined by  other Senators, this is permitted by the Constitution because the  subject of the trial is a non-President. As such, it is conceded, as it  must be, that for constitutional purposes of the trial, the accused is  a non-President. The role of th Senate, though, is to decide whether or  not to convict and thereby trigger the application of article II,  section 4:         The President, Vice President and all civil Officers of the       United States, shall be removed from Office on Impeachment       for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high       Crimes and Misdemeanors.    From which office shall a non-President be removed if convicted? A  non-President doesn't hold an office, therefore cannot be impeached  under this clause, which provides for the removal from office of the  person under the impeachment attack.   The House managers contend that the fact that the Chief Justice is  not presiding does not impact the constitutional validity of this  trial. Notably, they devote only a single paragraph of their trial  memorandum to a development so significant that it prompted multiple  Senators to declare the entire proceeding suspect, with one going so  far as to say it ``crystalized'' the unconstitutional nature of this  proceeding. And the single paragraph that the House managers do devote  to the issue is entirely unpersuasive on the merits.   The House managers' position ignores traditional statutory canons of  interpretation. It is well established that ``[a] term appearing in  several places in a statutory text is generally read the same way each  time it appears.'' This presumption is ``at its most vigorous when a  term is repeated within a given sentence.'' Additionally, the Court in  at least one instance has referred to a broader ``established canon''  that similar language contained within the same section of a statute be  accorded a consistent meaning.   I know this is a lot to listen to at once--a lot of words, but words  are what make our Constitution, and the interpretation of that  Constitution, as you well know, is a product of words.   If the text, ``the President of the United States'' in the  constitutional provision requiring the Chief Justice to preside can  refer only to the sitting President, and not to former presidents, then  the textual identification of ``[t]he President'' contained in article  II, section 4, which makes the President amenable to impeachment in the  first place, also excludes anyone other than the sitting President. In  full, that sentence provides that ``[t]he President, Vice President and  all civil Officers of the United States, shall be removed from Office  on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high  Crimes and Misdemeanors.'' This is the substantive phrase of the  Constitution vesting the conviction and removal power in the Senate,  and it contains a clear jurisdictional limitation. The House managers  do understand what the word ``President'' means for the purposes of  other constitutional provisions, and so they should understand this  limitation as well. Only a sitting President is referred to as the  President of the United States in the Constitution. And only a sitting  President may be impeached, convicted, and removed upon a trial in the  Senate. ``The President'' in article II, section 4 and ``the  President'' in article I, section 3 identify the same person. If the  accused is not ``the President'' in one, he is not ``the President'' in  the other. No sound textual interpretation--I emphasize ``textual  interpretation''--principle permits a contrary reading. In the words of  the Supreme Court, it is a ``normal rule of statutory construction that  identical words used in different parts of the same act are intended to  have the same meaning.'' Unwittingly or unwillingly as it may be,  Senate Democrats, in their announcement that Senator Leahy will  preside, have already taken their position on this matter. The accused  is not the President. The text of the United States Constitution  therefore does not vest the Senate with the power to try him and remove  him--a factual nullity; he can't be removed--or disqualify him--a legal  nullity--as if he was the President.   The House managers contend that the Senate has jurisdiction over this  impeachment because despite the fact that he is no longer the  President, the conduct that the former President is charged occurred  while he was still in office. That argument does not in any way alter  the Constitution's clear textual identification of ``the President.''   The House managers justify their strained argument by noting that  ``[t]he Constitution's impeachment provisions are properly understood  by reference to this overarching constitutional plan.'' But with that  very justification in mind, their argument fails once again. In an  impeachment, it is the accused's office that permits the impeachment.  Ceasing to hold that office terminates the possibility and the purpose  of impeachment.   Private persons may not be impeached in America, and so they ask you  to look back at the British model. The Constitution, as I see it, does  not make private citizens subject to impeachment. The Founders rejected  the British model that allowed Parliament to impeach anyone, except for  the King, and so they limited impeachment to certain public officials,  includin Presidents in our country.    Next on the textual front, the primary and, in fact, only required  remedy of a conviction is removal.         Article II, Section 4, states a straightforward rule:       whenever a civil officer is impeached and convicted for high       crimes and misdemeanors, they shall be removed.    It is undeniable that in this instance removal is moot in every  possible regard. Removal is a factual and legal impossibility. Yet the  Article of Impeachment itself--read it in the wherefore clause; it  calls for removal. This is one reason why impeachment proceedings are  different from ordinary trials and why the Constitution pointedly  separates the two. In ordinary criminal jurisprudence, a person  convicted of public crimes committed while he or she was in office may  still be punished even though they no longer hold that office. Not so  with impeachment. In a Senate impeachment trial, conviction means and  requires removal, and conviction without a removal is no conviction at  all. Only upon a valid conviction and its requisite, enforceable  removal may the additional judgment of disqualification plausibly be  entertained.  [[Page S607]]    Presidents are impeachable because Presidents are removable. Former  presidents are not because they cannot be removed. The Constitution is  clear. Trial by the Senate sitting as a Court of Impeachment is  reserved for the President of the United States, not a private citizen  who used to be President of the United States. Just as clear, the  judgment required upon conviction is removal from office, and a former  President can no longer be removed from office.         The purpose, text and structure of the Constitution's       impeachment Clauses confirm this intuitive and common-sense       understanding.    So wrote Judge Michael Luttig, former judge in the United States  Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.   And, indeed, there are State court decisions that analyze this very  same language and conclude that impeachment can only be entertained  against an existing officer subject to removal, in State v. Hill, from  Nebraska, and Smith v. Brantley, a 1981 decision from the Florida  supreme court.   This is the first time that the United States Senate has ever been  asked to apply the Constitution's textual identification of ``the  President'' in the impeachment provisions to anyone other than the  sitting President of the United States. And, of course, most  significantly from a textual approach, the term specifically used is  ``the President'' not ``a President.'' And there can only be one ``the  President''--the incumbent--at a time. Judge Luttig relies on this  textual reading for his firm conclusion that a former President cannot  be impeached or convicted. Consider the alternative, as Robert  Delahunty and John Yoo have: If Mr. Trump can be convicted as ``the  President,'' the language the Constitution uses, then why is he still  not ``the President'' under the Commander in Chief clause, for example?  They are joined by Professor Alan Dershowitz and University of Chicago  Professor Richard Epstein in their focus and conclusion. They point out  the dangers of an approach that deviates from a focus on the text. If  there is no temporal limitation--that is what they suggested to you-- remember, you can go back in time and impeach any civil officer who  ever served for anything that occurred during the course of their  service, time immemorial. With the House managers' position, the  concept necessarily includes all executive officers and judges,  including, perhaps, the impeachment now of Jimmy Carter for his  handling of the Iran hostage scandal, as one example. That flows  logically from their argument without any hesitation. Further, they  ask, why not then countenance the broad reading of other terms? When I  say ``they ask,'' I mean the experts who opined on this.   Why not then countenance a broad reading of other terms, such that  terms like ``high crimes and misdemeanors,'' however broadly construed,  are not intended to be exclusively the only kind of conduct intended as  impeachable. They conclude--these experts--by writing that a nontextual  impeachment power would undermine the Constitution's effort to make the  President independent of Congress, a central goal of the Founding  Fathers. The authors convincingly argue for textual analysis over  nontextual reliance on a presentation of history, suggesting that if  one's presentation of history were to control, it would expressly  permit conduct contrary to the express language, leading to clearly  unintended results.   I must tell you that I have spoken to Judge Ken Starr at some length  over this past week about this. This textual approach is something he,  too, feels very strongly about. I also happen to be friendly with Chuck  Cooper, by the way. He is a fine person. He also happens to be a person  who has a strong animus against President Trump. But Chuck Cooper is a  fine lawyer and a fine person, as I am sure our friends from Alabama  know.   As we already have discussed, the risks to the institution of the  Presidency and to any and all past officers is limited only by one's  imagination. The weakness of the House managers' case is further  demonstrated by their reliance on the unproven assertion that if  President Trump is not impeached, future officers who are impeached  will evade removal by resigning either before impeachment or Senate  trial.   For example, they contend, citing various law professors, that ``[any  official] who betrayed the public trust and was impeached could avoid  accountability simply by resigning one minute before the Senate's final  conviction vote.''   This argument is a complete canard. The Constitution expressly  provides in article I, section 3, clause 7 that a convicted party,  following impeachment, ``shall nevertheless be liable and subject to  indictment, trial, judgment, and punishment according to law'' [after  removal]. Clearly, a former civil officer who is not impeached is  subject to the same.   We have a judicial process in this country. We have an investigative  process in this country to which no former officeholder is immune. That  is the process that should be running its course. That is the process  the bill of attainder tells us is the appropriate one for  investigation, prosecution, and punishment, with all of the attributes  of that branch. We are missing it by two articles here that the article  III courts provide. They provide that kind of appropriate adjudication.  That is accountability.   There are appropriate mechanisms in place for full and meaningful  accountability not through the legislature, which does not and cannot  offer the safeguards of the judicial system, which every private  citizen is constitutionally entitled to.   But more to the point here. Their argument does nothing to empower a  different reading of the Constitution's plain text; that is, one that  reads ``the President'' in one provision to include former Presidents  but reads ``the President'' in the other provision to mean only the  sitting President.   Second, this red herring of an argument also fails because the former  President did not resign, even amid calls by his opponents that he do  so. As a result, the Senate need not decide whether it possesses the  power or jurisdiction to try and convict the former President who  resigned or how it might best proceed to effectuate justice in such a  case. That is not this case.   The plain meaning of the Constitution's text, faithfully and  consistently applied, should govern whether the United States Senate is  vested by the Constitution with the power to convict a private citizen  of the United States. It is not.   The House managers posit in their trial memorandum that despite the  fact that the primary and only necessary remedy upon conviction,  removal, is a legal nullity, this late impeachment trial is appropriate  because the other, secondary, optional remedy that the Senate is not  even required to consider and which only takes effect upon a later,  separate vote--disqualification from future office--can still  theoretically be applied to a former President.   The managers contend that ``Article II, Section 4 states a  straightforward rule: whenever a civil officer is impeached and  convicted for high crimes and misdemeanors, they `shall be removed.'  Absolutely nothing about this rule implies, let alone requires, that  former officials--who can still face disqualification--are immune from  impeachment and conviction.''   That is what they say. I told you that today. In other words, so the  argument goes, a President no longer holding office does not moot the  entirety of remedies afforded by impeachment. This, however, also flies  in the face of both the plain meaning of the text and the canons of  statutory interpretation.   First of all, the managers, once again, simply choose to ignore the  text. Even in the passage that the managers cite, the word ``shall''  does, to put it mildly, imply a requirement, an imperative such that an  impeachment in which removal would be impossible is invalid. `` `Shall'  means shall. The Supreme Court . . . ha[s] made clear that when a  statute uses the word `shall,' Congress has imposed a mandatory duty  upon the subject of the command,'' as in shall remove. Indeed, ``the  mandatory `shall' . . . normally creates an obligation impervious to  judicial discretion.''   And ``[w]herever the Constitution commands, discretion terminates.''  ``Shall'' means mandatory, and ``shall be removed'' is not possible for  a former officer no longer in office. Impeachment cannot apply.   Now, here is the ``and'' argument. You may have heard about it or  read  [[Page S608]]  about it if you follow such things. This is another one Judge Starr is  big on, and many of the textual scholars have written about it.   The managers critically ignore this language in article I, section 3,  clause 7, which states that ``[j]udgment in Cases of Impeachment shall  not extend further than to removal from Office, and disqualification to  hold and enjoy any Office of honor, Trust or Profit under the United  States.''         Ordinarily, as in everyday English, use of the conjunctive       ``and'' in a list means that all of the listed requirements       must be satisfied, while use of the disjunctive ``or'' means       that only one of the list of requirements needs to be       satisfied.    Judge Kenneth Starr subscribes strongly to this argument and  understands the comma to provide further support for the reading.   As Judge Michael Luttig, again, recently argued, ``The Constitution  links the impeachment remedy of disqualification from future office  with the remedy of removal from the office that person currently  occupies; the former remedy does not apply in situations where the  latter is unavailable.'' Conviction and removal are inextricably  entwined. If removal no longer is possible, neither is an impeachment  conviction.   Judge Luttig's view is consistent with that of Justice Joseph Story  in his famous ``Commentaries on the Constitution of the United  States,'' wherein Justice Story analyzed ``that impeachment is  inapplicable to officials who have left their position because  removal--a primary remedy that the impeachment process authorizes--is  no longer necessary.''   Justice Story noted that he is not coming to a firm posit on this.  This is his belief, and this is his thought process.         There is also much force in the remark, that an impeachment       is a proceeding purely of a political nature. It is not so       much designed to punish an offender, as to secure the state       against gross official misdemeanors. It touches neither his       person, nor his property; but simply divests him of his       political capacity.    Professor Philip Bobbitt. Now, this is--I have to say this is  insulting. We heard earlier today we don't cite any scholars. Professor  Philip Bobbitt is a distinguished Webster professor at Columbia  University who, along with Professor Charles Black, wrote the handbook  on impeachment used for many, many years. He is a constitutional expert  on impeachment. He has written that ``there is little discussion in the  historical record surrounding the precise question of whether a person  no longer a civil officer can be impeached--and in light of the clarity  of the text, this is hardly surprising,'' Professor Bobbitt wrote.   Professor Bobbitt, by the way, who has a rich family history in the  Democratic Party--LBJ--also asserted the following, as recently as  January 27, 2021, arguin against holding this trial. He said:         There is no authority granted to Congress to impeach and       convict persons who are not ``civil officers of the United       States.'' It's as simple as that. But simplicity doesn't mean       unimportance.    Professor Bobbitt wrote:         Limiting Congress to its specified powers is a crucial       element in the central idea of the United States       Constitution: putting the state under law.    Professor Bobbitt and former Stanford University Law professor  Richard Danzig have remarked that impeachment's principal purpose, as  the 66th of the Federalist Papers makes clear, is to check the  ``encroachments of the executive.'' Trial by jury, rules of evidence,  and other safeguards are put aside, they write, because of the need to  protect the public from further abuse of office.   Similarly, yesterday, Professor Eugene Kontorovich wrote: The  Constitution provides that the impeachment process is to be used to  remove ``all Civil officers of the United States''--that is, people  holding a government position. Yet in the case of Mr. Trump, the House  is reading the Constitution as if it said the process applies to ``all  Civil officers of the United States, and people who aren't civil  officers, but once were.'' Exactly what it does not say.   We have been told by the House managers about missed citations in our  brief. I would like to draw your attention to page 37. This is a  substantive misrepresentation to you, I would respectfully suggest, and  it reflects to me a very different view of democracy--a fear of  democracy.   They wrote on page 37 of their brief that the Framers--I am  paraphrasing the first part.         The Framers themselves would not have hesitated to convict       on these facts. Their worldview was shaped by a study of       classical history, as well as a lived experience of       resistance and revolution. They were well aware of the danger       posed by opportunists who incited mobs to violence for       political gain. They drafted the Constitution to avoid such       thuggery, which they associated with ``the threat of civil       disorder and the early assumption of power by a dictator.''    The citation is ``178, Bernard Bailyn, The Ideological Origins of the  American Revolution.'' That is this book.   Professor Bailyn, when he gave his description of the threat of civil  disorder and the early assumption of power by a dictator and thuggery,  was referring to early colonists' view toward democracy. They feared  democracy. That is what they called thuggery, democracy, because it is  an elitist's point of view--an elitist's political point of view. We  don't fear democracy. We embrace it.   In summing up, let's be crystal clear on where we stand and why we  are here. The singular goal of the House managers and House leadership  in pursuing the impeachment conviction of Donald J. Trump is to use  these proceedings to disenfranchise at least 74 million Americans with  whom they viscerally disagree and to ensure that neither they nor any  other American ever again can cast a vote for Donald Trump. And if they  convince you to go forward, their ultimate hope is that this will be a  shot across the bow of any other candidate for public office who would  dare to take up a political message that is very different from their  own political point of view as to the direction in which they wish to  take our country.   Under our Constitution, this body and the impeachment process must  never be permitted to be weaponized for partisan political purposes.  This Article of Impeachment must be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction  based on what we have discussed here today and what is in our brief.  The institution of the Presidency is at risk unless a strong message is  sent by the dismissal of the Article of Impeachment.   Before we close, I want to leave you with two thoughts. One was  expressed by Abraham Lincoln. He comes to mind first because of the way  in which our Nation is now divided. We must learn from his times. He  had a simple but important message about the paramount importance of  doing what is right. Mr. Lincoln said:         Stand with anybody that stands Right. Stand with him when       he is right and Part with him when he goes wrong. . . . In       both cases you are right. In both cases you oppose the       dangerous extremes. In both cases you stand on moral ground       and hold the ship level and steady. In both you are national       and nothing less than national.    And the second message is from one of Mr. Lincoln's favorite poets  who wrote in 1849, at a time fraught with division and at risk for even  more. The message from that other time of division--a call for hope and  unity to bring strength--has special meaning today.   A poem Longfellow wrote:       Sail forth into the sea, O ship!      Through wind and wave, right onward steer!      The moistened eye, the trembling lip,      Are not the signs of doubt or fear.      Sail forth into the sea of life,      O gentle, loving, trusting wife,      And safe from all adversity      Upon the bosom of that sea      Thy comings and thy goings be!      For gentleness and love and trust      Prevail o'er angry wave and gust;      And in the wreck of noble lives      Something immortal still survives!      Thou, too, sail on, O Ship of State!      Sail on, O Union, strong and great!      Humanity with all its fears,      With all the hopes of future years,      Is hanging breathless on thy fate!      We know what Master laid thy keel,      What Workmen wrought thy ribs of steel,      Who made each mast, and sail, and rope,      What anvils rang, what hammers beat,      In what a forge and what a heat      Were shaped the anchors of thy hope!      Fear not each sudden sound and shock,      'Tis of the wave and not the rock;      'Tis but the flapping of the sail,      And not a rent made by the gale!      In spite of rock and tempest's roar,      In spite of false lights on the shore,      Sail on, nor fear to breast the sea!      Our hearts, our hopes, are all with thee,      Our hearts, our hopes, our prayers, our tears,      Our faith triumphant o'er our fears,      Are all with thee,--are all with thee!   [[Page S609]]         Mr. Manager RASKIN. Mr. President, it has been a long day. We thank  you, and we thank all the Senators for their careful attention to the  legal arguments and your courtesy to the managers and to the lawyers  here.   This has been the most bipartisan impeachment in American history,  and we hope it will continue to be so in the days ahead. And nothing  could be more bipartisan than the desire to recess.   So the only issue before the Senate today, of course, is whether  Donald Trump is subject to the Court of Impeachment that the Senate has  convened. We see no need to make any further argument that this body  has the power to convict and to disqualify President Trump for his  breathtaking constitutional crime of inciting a violent insurrection  against our government.   Tomorrow, we will address the amazing array of issues suggested by  the thoughtful presentations by our colleagues, by including the First  Amendment, due process, partisanship under our Constitution, the bill  of attainder clause, and many, many more.   But, in the meantime, we waive all further arguments. We waive our 33  minutes of rebuttal, and we give those 33 minutes, gratefully, back to  the Senate of the United States.   (Chorus of Hear! Hear!)   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is all time yielded back?   All time has been yielded back.   The question is whether Donald John Trump is subject to the  jurisdiction of a Court of Impeachment for acts committed while  President of the United States, notwithstanding the expiration of his  term in that office?    I ask for the yeas and nays, Mr. President.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second?   There is a sufficient second.   The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk called the roll                           [Rollcall Vote No. 57]                                  YEAS--56       Baldwin      Bennet      Blumenthal      Booker      Brown      Cantwell      Cardin      Carper      Casey      Cassidy      Collins      Coons      Cortez Masto      Duckworth      Durbin      Feinstein      Gillibrand      Hassan      Heinrich      Hickenlooper      Hirono      Kaine      Kelly      King      Klobuchar      Leahy      Lujan      Manchin      Markey      Menendez      Merkley      Murkowski      Murphy      Murray      Ossoff      Padilla      Peters      Reed      Romney      Rosen      Sanders      Sasse      Schatz      Schumer      Shaheen      Sinema      Smith      Stabenow      Tester      Toomey      Van Hollen      Warner      Warnock      Warren      Whitehouse      Wyden                                  NAYS--44       Barrasso      Blackburn      Blunt      Boozman      Braun      Burr      Capito      Cornyn      Cotton      Cramer      Crapo      Cruz      Daines      Ernst      Fischer      Graham      Grassley      Hagerty      Hawley      Hoeven      Hyde-Smith      Inhofe      Johnson      Kennedy      Lankford      Lee      Lummis      Marshall      McConnell      Moran      Paul      Portman      Risch      Rounds      Rubio      Scott (FL)      Scott (SC)      Shelby      Sullivan      Thune      Tillis      Tuberville      Wicker      Young   The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

There being no objection, at 5:10 p.m., the Senate, sitting as a  Court of Impeachment, adjourned until Wednesday, February 10, 2021, at  12 noon.
