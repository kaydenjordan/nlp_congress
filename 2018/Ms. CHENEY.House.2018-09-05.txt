At any time after adoption of this resolution the       Speaker may, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare       the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on       the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R.       4606) to provide that applications under the Natural Gas Act       for the importation or exportation of small volumes of       natural gas shall be granted without modification or delay.       The first reading of the bill shall be dispensed with. All       points of order against consideration of the bill are waived.

The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the       bill and amendments thereto to final passage without       intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or       without instructions.     Mr. Speaker, during consideration of this resolution all  time yielded is for the purpose of debate only. I yield the customary  30 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Torres), pending  which I yield myself such time as I may consume.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution  1049, which provides a structured rule for consideration of H.R. 4606,  the Ensuring Small Scale LNG Certainty and Access Act, and a structured  rule for H.R. 1635, the Empowering Students Through Enhanced Financial  Counseling Act. These bipartisan bills provide commonsense changes that  will strengthen our economy by removing unnecessary regulatory burdens  and improving financial counseling for our students.   Student loan debt in our country hit a record high of $1.5 trillion  in the first quarter of this year, Mr. Speaker. Furthermore, both the  number and size of student loans are increasing, while the repayment  rates are decreasing. Students are not receiving the proper counseling  when they enroll in Federal aid programs. This has the potential to  cost them immense amounts of money.   Right now, schools are only required to provide entry and exit  financial counseling to students who receive Federal loans. Often, the  counseling offered does not give students a realistic understanding of  their anticipated finances and income during their studies and after  graduation, or information about other Federal aid programs they could  turn to before a private loan.   By enhancing the financial counseling offered and expanding it to  students who receive Pell grants and to the parents of students who  take out Federal loans to pay for their children's education, students  will better be able to manage their finances and maximize their  opportunities, saving themselves and the taxpayers money every single  year.   Mr. Speaker, we provide over $120 billion of Federal student aid  every year, without providing adequate education and support about how  to use those funds. This must change. With this bill, we will begin to  give our students the tools and resources necessary to ensure they put  themselves in the best financial position for the future. H.R. 1635  does just that.   Additionally, the rule we are considering today makes in order  several bipartisan amendments that are aimed at making this good bill  even better.   The rule that we are debating this afternoon, Mr. Speaker, also  provides for consideration of H.R. 4606, the Ensuring Small Scale LNG  Certainty and Access Act. This rule makes in order two Democrat  amendments to this bipartisan bill which also will help strengthen our  economy and create more American jobs.   Mr. Speaker, as you know, the United States is now the world's  leading producer of oil and natural gas. And my home State of Wyoming  ranks sixth in production of crude oil, and eighth in natural gas  production. However, despite the important and even monumental efforts  by the Trump administration so far, uncertainty and burdensome  regulations still stifle operations and further growth.   Currently, the Natural Gas Act does not specify an amount threshold  for the Department of Energy's lengthy regulatory process for the  exportation of liquefied natural gas. This means that producers wanting  to export a small amount of gas are forced to go through the same  process as major producers.   By providing greater regulatory certainty and a clear timetable for  the  [[Page H7835]]  process of exporting small amounts of LNG, we will better enable  exporters to move forward with capital-intensive projects that create  American jobs.   We also are able, Mr. Speaker, through this bill, to preserve  existing environmental laws and ensure that small-scale export  facilities receive the proper review.   Wyoming's petroleum industry directly employs over 7,000 people, with  an annual payroll of over $668 million, contributing over $900 million  to our economy.   The small scale LNG export market is a growing sector of our economy  with immense potential that can further expand the economic benefits  the petroleum industry yields to my State and to the Nation. This bill  will open up markets where large-scale exports are simply not  economical and help jump-start growth in this important industry.   H.R. 4606 places small-scale exports on a level playing field with  exports to free trade agreement nations. Many of our neighboring  countries are forced to rely on unstable or unfriendly nations for  their energy needs because the regulations we currently place on our  small-scale LNG exporters makes exporting to these nations  uneconomical.   Mr. Speaker, by reducing these regulations, U.S. LNG exports can play  an important role in rebuilding parts of the Caribbean devastated by  hurricanes in 2017, as well as provide a stable source of energy. It  will also prevent our neighbors from having to turn, potentially, to  our adversaries to meet their energy needs.   Mr. Speaker, we are in the midst of an energy boom that is  revitalizing our economy. It is also putting us in a position where we  can greatly assist our neighbor countries by providing them a stable  source of energy and offering support in the event of a natural  disaster.   The current unnecessary and overly burdensome regulations on small  LNG exporters prevent us from taking full advantage of this  unprecedented growth in our energy production and industry. H.R. 4606  allows us to address this issue and to provide an additional boost to  our economy.   Mr. Speaker, the bills that will be considered under this rule are  bipartisan bills that will help strengthen our economy and support our  students. Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this rule that will  allow consideration of H.R. 4606 and H.R. 1635, and I reserve the  balance of my time.     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from the Rules Committee, Mrs.  Torres, for her comments today.   I think that Mrs. Torres and I both agree that Congress needs to  ensure that we are playing our constitutional role, and that is why I  find it particularly surprising that my colleagues on the other side of  the aisle want to further empower the Consumer Financial Protection  Bureau, which is a completely unaccountable and, I would argue,  unconstitutional agency.   In fact, statutorily, Mr. Speaker, with the regulation of student  loans under the Higher Education Act, Congress has charged the  Department of  [[Page H7836]]  Education with this obligation and responsibility, not the CFPB, and  that is where we think it should belong. We don't think that the answer  to congressional oversight and to increasing congressional oversight is  to give further power to a completely unaccountable Federal agency.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr.  Higgins).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio  (Mr. Johnson).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I again would like to thank my colleague from the Rules  Committee for her work and her participation in this debate.   I hope that the minority leader of the United States Senate, Mr.  Schumer, might have been listening to her arguments just now, and I  would just recall for our colleagues that it was the Democrats in the  Senate, led by Mr. Schumer, who shut the government down earlier this  year, not the Republicans.   Mr. Speaker, it was the Democrats in the House and the Senate who  walked away from the negotiations on the budget deal that we finally  were able to strike, but not before they refused to show up for at  least one meeting at the White House.   So it is the case that the Republicans are in control of this body.  It is the case that we have a majority in the Senate. As my colleague  knows, we don't have 60 votes in the Senate, and so Mr. Schumer and the  Democrats in the Senate are able to gum up the works pretty  extensively.   But as for us in the House, we have, Mr. Speaker, been successful in  passing all 12 appropriations bills. We have been successful in passing  the necessary appropriations bills without the help of the Democrats in  order to make sure that we are providing the funds that we need to keep  the government open and keep the government functioning.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to  participate in a good-faith manner, particularly in the coming weeks as  we deal with the Defense Appropriations bill once again on this floor,  and just remind them how important it is that we make sure that our men  and women in uniform receive the funds that they deserve.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank both the gentleman from Ohio (Mr.  Johnson) and my colleague from Kentucky (Mr. Guthrie) for their  important and hard work on these bills. We must continue to roll back  the regulatory burdens that make doing business in our country so  difficult.   We also have to give our students the tools they need to maximize  their opportunities for success and to understand the financial  liabilities that they are undertaking when they receive these student  loans. We don't want them to have a future that is diminished by the  burden of unnecessary debt that they can't repay once they graduate.   Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the rule and passage of  the underlying bills.   The material previously referred to by Mrs. Torres is as follows:             An Amendment to H. Res. 1049 Offered by Ms. Torres         At the end of the resolution, add the following new       sections:        Sec. 3. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the       Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare       the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on       the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R.       6543) to amend and strengthen the Higher Education Act of       1965 so that every student has a path to a quality, debt-free       degree or credential that leads to a rewarding career. The       first reading of the bill shall be dispensed with. All points       of order against consideration of the bill are waived.       General debate shall be confined to  [[Page H7838]]       the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally divided and       controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the       Committee on Education and the Workforce. After general       debate the bill shall be considered for amendment under the       five-minute rule. All points of order against provisions in       the bill are waived. At the conclusion of consideration of       the bill for amendment the Committee shall rise and report       the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been       adopted. The previous question shall be considered as ordered       on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without       intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or       without instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and       reports that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then       on the next legislative day the House shall, immediately       after the third daily order of business under clause 1 of       rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further       consideration of the bill.        Sec. 4. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 6543.          The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a       vote about what the House should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to       a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to       yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first       recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution. . . . [and] has no       substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''       But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the       Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in       the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,       page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous       question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally       not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member       controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the       motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the       time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering       the previous question. That Member, because he then controls       the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for       the purpose of amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on       Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further       debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:       ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a       resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control       shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous       question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who       controls the time for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools for those who oppose the Republican       majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the       opportunity to offer an alternative plan.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.
