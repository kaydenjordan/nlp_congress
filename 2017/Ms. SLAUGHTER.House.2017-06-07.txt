 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume. I thank my colleague for yielding me the time.   Mr. Speaker, 7 years ago, I brought the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform  and Consumer Protection Act to the floor of the House as chairwoman of  the House Rules Committee. This law was a statement from Congress on  behalf of the American people that unchecked corporate greed will never  again bring the United States of America to financial collapse.   My colleague began his speech this morning by saying that this law  had not worked, but I am not aware of major bank failures or bank  failures of any kind since we passed it, and I would say, indeed, this  law has worked.   Since it has been enacted, our economy has had over 80 consecutive  months of private sector job growth. That is pretty good. In fact, it  is a record-setting streak. More than 16 million jobs have been  created, and business lending has been increased by 75 percent. I am  not getting all the complaints that I used to get that they could not  borrow money from banks, particularly the small businesses.   Along the way, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau established  under this law has helped 29 million people in all of our 50 States to  receive nearly $12 billion in relief from companies that engaged in  irresponsible or predatory practices.   One group that sent us a letter begging us not to do away with Dodd- Frank was the Veterans of Foreign Wars who said that far too often  their veterans were the victims of predatory lenders--shysters, people  not telling them the truth--and that is exactly what the Consumer  Financial Protection Bureau was established to do.   You can't argue about whether or not it has been a success if 29  million people in 50 States have gotten back $12 billion in relief of  bad practices. But this legislation completely will do away with the  Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the only thing we have left to  protect Main Street and the small investors.   These gains weren't a coincidence, Mr. Speaker. They were the result  of the Dodd-Frank law. Gutting Wall Street reform will be a historic  giveaway to special interests.                                time  1315    The Wall Street firms who plunged our country to the brink, in 2008,  would be free once again to take advantage of consumers and force  middle class families to go it alone, without the protections this bill  has provided them.   The CHOICE Act is the wrong choice for consumers and families.  Instead of standing with financial lobbyists, I urge the majority to  uphold the trust of the people we all represent.   Five years ago, Democrats and Republicans came together to almost  unanimously pass my bill to end insider trading in Congress. The STOCK  Act passed this Chamber by a vote of 417-2, one of the most bipartisan  bills of that entire session of Congress.   It wasn't easy. I led a 6-year fight to get it signed into law after  learning that Members of Congress and their staffs were abusing their  positions by making money from the information that they gleaned and  that was not available to everybody else in America. They gleaned this  information while  [[Page H4666]]  working on behalf of the people whose information they were stealing.  It took a ``60 Minutes'' investigation on television and a groundswell  of public support, but the bill became a reality.   For me, upholding the people's trust is the most sacred  responsibility I have as a Member of Congress. That is why I am waging  a new battle to strengthen the STOCK Act, after learning that some in  this Congress have used legal loopholes to get around this law.   Once again, we see the importance of investigative journalism and a  free press, which has shined a light on the fact that some Members of  Congress have purchased private, discounted stock deals and taken a  part in initial public offerings outside of the United States. These  special deals are not available to the general public.   All this would have remained in the dark, had the STOCK Act not put  into place a new requirement to timely disclose sales and purchases of  stock. This is precisely the kind of outrageous conduct we intended to  outlaw under the STOCK Act. It plays directly into the public's most  cynical view of Congress.   This, Mr. Speaker, comes at a time when just 20 percent of the public  approves of how Congress is doing its job under the majority's  leadership. That is according to the latest figures from Gallup.   This Chamber put aside partisanship and took a strong, bipartisan  stand against this abhorrent behavior just a few years ago. It has  become increasingly clear that we need to act again today to hold  ourselves accountable to both the letter and the spirit of the STOCK  Act law.   We are not doing that today. Once again, we are taking away the  regulations because some people find them so terribly abhorrent, but  they protect the small investor and the people in the banks. We surely  will never, I hope, see the day where we will ask the taxpayers of the  United States to bail out the enormously rich, big banks. One of the  worst things of that whole era was not a single fraudulent banker went  to jail.   Just 535 of us in a country of more than 300 million people have been  chosen to serve on the American people's behalf in Congress. It is a  sacred responsibility, one we should not be squandering, doing the  bidding of the financial lobbyists or Wall Street firms, who are the  ones behind the CHOICE Act.   The majority should stop fulfilling the wish list of Wall Street and  act on behalf of millions of Americans outraged by insider trading and  other chicanery that still permeates the halls of Congress today. This  Chamber must take action so that Americans recognize we came here to  represent them, not enrich ourselves.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Doggett).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  New York (Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney) the distinguished ranking member of  the Financial Services Subcommittee on Capital Markets, Securities, and  Investments.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman an additional 1  minute.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. Jayapal).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional minute to the  gentlewoman.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire of my colleague if he has  further speakers?    I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   With each passing day, we learn more about the tangled web of  conflicts of interest and links to Russia and the Trump administration.  Just last week we learned that President Trump's son-in-law, Jared  Kushner, attempted to establish a back channel of communications with  Russia and the Trump transition team before they were even inaugurated.   Tomorrow, former FBI Director James Comey will likely testify that  President Trump attempted to influence the FBI's investigation into  possible collusion between his campaign and the Russian Government.   Who knows what further ties to Russia we will uncover from his  testimony.   Without President Trump's tax returns, we simply have no way of  knowing if he himself has financial ties to Russia, as news reports  have suggested. The American people deserve to know whether or not our  President has any business dealings with Russia or other foreign  governments. It is imperative that we prevent the White House from  becoming another arm of the Trump organization.    Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an  amendment to the rule to bring up Representative Eshoo's bill, H.R.  305, which would require Presidents and major party nominees for the  Presidency to release their tax returns.   If the President has nothing to hide, including financial interests  or business dealings with Russia, then he should freely release his tax  returns to reassure the American people.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to include in the Record the  text of my amendment, along with extraneous material, immediately prior  to the vote on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, let me remind the majority why we enacted  the Wall Street reform in the first place.  [[Page H4670]]    Our country was plunged into the worst recession since the Great  Depression after big Wall Street firms played Russian roulette with our  future for years. During the 2008 financial crash, more than 8 million  Americans lost their jobs, $13 trillion in wealth vanished overnight,  and 11 million homes were lost.   After years of excesses and dodging regulation, the financial firms  were finally brought under control by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform  and Consumer Protection Act. The perverse notion of too big to fail was  finally ended, and the financial playing field was tilted back toward  consumers.   We have all seen the results of the law in the form of record-setting  private sector job growth, millions of new jobs, and historic rates of  business lending. It is beyond me why anyone in the world would want to  repeal this law and threaten this progress. Instead of doing the  bidding of the financial lobbyists who don't really care for the law,  we should be acting to uphold the trust of the people who sent us here.   This begins with passing the End Congressional Stock Market Abuse Act  to bring an end to the egregious use of exclusive stock deals and  foreign initial public offerings by Members of Congress.   The American people must be able to trust what we are doing here and  trust that it is right for them without concern that we are using our  position to enrich ourselves.   My bill would enhance the STOCK Act, which passed the Chamber  virtually unanimously--two ``no'' votes--in 2012, with provisions that  I think we could all agree on: no exclusive stock deals for Members of  Congress, no initial public offerings, regardless of where they are  offered.   Mr. Speaker, that is what we should be focusing on today, not  dismantling a law that has brought financial security to millions of  Americans.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose the rule, to oppose the  underlying legislation, the ``Wrong'' CHOICE Act, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
