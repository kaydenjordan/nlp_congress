 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the lives  of Mr. Arnold Tenenbaum, who passed away on March 24, and his loving  wife, Mrs. Lorlee Tenenbaum, who passed away just 5 days later on March  29.   Mr. and Mrs. Tenenbaum were pillars in the Savannah community and  committed their lives to serving others through their work with United  Way, the Georgia Chamber of Commerce, food banks, and more.   Mr. Tenenbaum was a renowned businessman, philanthropist, and civic  leader, and Lorlee joined alongside him in giving back to their  community through serving on numerous boards and spearheading projects  to promote Savannah's bright future.   Arnold was influential in both his business ventures, leading Chatham  Steel Corporation, and his pursuits to better the lives of youth in his  community through his efforts to improve public education in Savannah.   Devoting their lives to helping others and always bringing positivity  to every room they entered, they greatly impacted the culture of  Savannah.   The Tenenbaums loved others deeply and were loved by many, including  their four amazing children.   I am proud and thankful to have had such an honorable couple dedicate  their lives to serving their community in the First Congressional  District of Georgia, and I am grateful for the lasting impact they made  on Savannah.   My heart goes out to their family and friends and the entire Savannah  community during this most difficult time.                            ____________________
