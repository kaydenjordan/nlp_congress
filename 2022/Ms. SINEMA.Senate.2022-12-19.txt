 Mr. President, I rise today to honor supervisory air  interdiction agent Dean A. Williams for his steadfast service to the  United States for the past 36 years and to wish him well on his  retirement from Air and Marine Operations--AMO--U.S. Customs and Border  Protection--CBP--Department of Homeland Security.   Born in Indiana and raised in New York City and Oklahoma, Dean  attended Oklahoma State University and Tulsa Junior College. He earned  an associate degree in respiratory therapy and later worked in a  neonatal intensive care unit. Being a patriot and adventure seeker,  Dean was drawn to military service and joined the Navy to pursue a  career as a naval aviator.   In 1986, Dean reported to Naval Aviation Officer Candidate School,  where he excelled in academics and physical fitness. Upon graduation,  he was assigned to Naval Flight Training in Pensacola, FL, and earned  his Wings of Gold. During his time serving on active duty in the Navy,  Dean distinguished himself on missions, piloting the Navy's medium  lift, multimission helicopter, the SH-60 Seahawk, and also on several  deployments aboard naval ships, where he held leadership positions,  including Aviation Department Head aboard the USS Denver (LPD-9).   After his honorable discharge from the Navy in 1996, Dean furthered  his education, earning a bachelor of science from Embry-Riddle  Aeronautical University. In 1997, he chose to continue his service to  the United States by joining the U.S. Border Patrol, employing his  skills as a senior patrol agent and pilot in San Diego and along the  southwest border. In 2005, Dean became an air interdiction agent  (pilot) for AMO and was later promoted to supervisory air interdiction  agent. At AMO, Dean served not only as a skilled helicopter and  unmanned aircraft system pilot, but also in other integral positions,  including northern border program manager and critical incident  response team manager.   As accomplished as Dean has been in his previous roles, it is in his  position as a congressional liaison where he excelled the most. In  2014, Dean was hand-picked by AMO leadership to represent the Agency as  a member of the Border, Air, and Marine Operations Team at the CBP  Office of Congressional Affairs. In this role, Dean served as the key  adviser and subject matter expert on all AMO-related matters before  Congress, including drafting legislation, responding to congressional  inquiries, and carefully planning and executing congressional and staff  delegation visits. He has been a stalwart supporter of AMO policy and  funding priorities, especially those that support AMO personnel in the  field. Notably, Dean is recognized as the main driver for the 2016  passage of Public Law 114-250, which makes all CBP law enforcement  agents eligible for law enforcement availability pay. His determination  to pass this legislation earned him respect both at AMO and on Capitol  Hill.   In 2017, Dean was selected to serve as an AMO congressional fellow on  Capitol Hill. He first served in the office of Senator Heidi Heitkamp,  where he provided subject matter expertise on border security, air  operations, and unmanned aircraft systems. In 2018, Dean became a  fellow on the staff of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental  Affairs Subcommittee on Government Operations and Border Management,  which I chair. Committee members and staff alike greatly benefited from  Dean's wise counsel, friendly demeanor, and outstanding knowledge of  border security, specifically air operations in Arizona and along the  southwest border. His willingness to share his expertise and to dig in  on critical policy matters was invaluable to the staff. His high-level  work added greatly to the overall success of the subcommittee. Although  he returned to AMO Headquarters in 2020, I am pleased that he continued  to work closely with the subcommittee and other offices on Capitol Hill  on AMO matters right up to his retirement.   Dean Williams' 36 years of devoted service to our great Nation is a  shining example of a life deserving of our gratitude. His meaningful  contributions, talent, and endearing sense of humor have enriched us  all. Dean will be missed, but I am happy to know that he will be able  to spend more time with his wife Denise and his dog Ace. As they say in  the Navy, I wish Dean fair winds and following seas in retirement.  [[Page S7310]]                                ____________________
