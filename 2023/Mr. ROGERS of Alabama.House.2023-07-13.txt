 Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   DOD's abortion travel policy is a flagrant violation of the  congressional intent and our Nation's moral principles. This policy is  part of the Biden administration's politicization of the military. It  is completely unnecessary, and it is clearly unlawful.   Madam Chair, I urge all Members to support this amendment.    Mr. Chair, I rise in strong opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chair, this amendment would remove a  section in the bill relating to the B83 nuclear gravity bomb and  prohibit any funding for B83 sustainment.   The B83 is the last megaton-class nuclear weapon in our arsenal. It  exists to destroy deeply buried targets. China, Russia, North Korea,  and Iran are putting some of the things they value most underground,  covered in steel and concrete. The B83 is currently our only way of  getting to those targets.   When the Biden administration proposed to begin retiring the B83 last  year, we asked: How are you going to replace them?   They didn't have an answer. So, Democrats and Republicans agreed on a  provision in the FY 2023 NDAA that allowed the Department to retire up  to 25 percent of those bombs but prohibited any further retirements  until the Department completed the study on how to replace that  capability.   As of this date, the Biden Pentagon is still studying the problem,  and we are not any closer to the B83 replacement.   The language included in our bill repeats the bipartisan compromise  struck in last year's NDAA--nothing more and nothing less.   I also note this amendment would prohibit all sustaining funding to  the B83. Not even the Biden administration thinks this is a good idea.  Stockpile sustainment includes the safety and surveillance activities  necessary to keep nuclear weapons safe and secure.   There is no exception in this amendment to allow for those activities  to continue. Completely cutting off funds is irresponsible.   Mr. Chair, I urge Members to oppose this amendment, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Colorado (Mr. Lamborn), my friend and colleague from the Armed  Services Committee and the chair of the Strategic Forces Subcommittee.    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Alabama (Mr. Strong), who is an outstanding freshman member of the  Armed Services Committee.    Mr. Chair, I believe this amendment is bad  policy. Not even the Biden administration is proposing to zero out this  funding. It would also be dangerous from a safety point of view.   Mr. Chair, I urge all Members to oppose this amendment, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in strong opposition to the  amendment.    This amendment would strike a provision in the  bill that prohibits the Nation's ICBM fleet from falling below its  current size of 400.   In 2014, the Obama administration decided to reduce the ICBM fleet to  400 missiles to comply with the New START Treaty. Ever since 2016, the  Congress has included provisions in the defense authorization bill to  effectively prohibit any further reduction.   The reason is simple. Nuclear threats are growing. In fact, just this  year, the commander of U.S. Strategic Command notified Congress that  China now possesses more ICBM launchers than the United States.   Now is not the time to be considering cuts to our ICBM fleet, which  remains central to our deterrent.   I want to quote former Vice Chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff John  Hyten, whom many of us know and respect. When asked specifically about  reducing the ICBM force, he replied: ``I don't understand how, with the  threats that we face today, which are growing, not shrinking, we would  make a decision today as a nation to lessen our overall strategic  deterrent. That makes no sense to me, and my best military advice is  that we do not do that.''   Mr. Chair, I urge all Members to oppose the amendment, and I reserve  the balance of my time.                                time  1630     Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Lamborn).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. Bacon), an outstanding member of the Armed  Services Committee.    Mr. Chair, this amendment will strike  commonsense provisions that have been consistent policies since 2016.   Mr. Chair, I urge Members to oppose the amendment, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   I would ask my friend and colleague from South Carolina, does he  believe his amendment is intended to impact uniformed personnel who  work in these offices?    I yield to the gentleman from South Carolina.    It is not?    It is not. That is what I was hoping to hear.    Mr. Chairman, I thank my friend from Virginia  for yielding. I urge adoption of this amendment. I will remind people  that this commission was established for the purpose of renaming our  major military installations that had been named after Confederate  officers. That mission is complete.   There is no reason for us to continue to spend funding on this  commission to hunt for things to do. We were told it was going to cost  only a million dollars, but they have gone over $30 million. We need to  just let them complete their job, which they have done. Stop this  funding and adopt this amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I urge a favorable vote on my colleague's amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I thank my friend from  California. I support the gentleman's intentions, but I have concerns  with the impacts if this amendment were enacted as written.   Lumber is a sustainable building product. Innovative timber products  are currently being used in military construction projects throughout  the country. I don't think anyone wants to limit the use of these  timber products.   The American Wood Council and the Southeastern Lumber Manufacturers  Association are opposed to this amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to oppose it.    Mr. Chair, this amendment would prohibit the  Department of Defense from spending any research and development  funding on solar cells and other technologies on Earth or in orbit.   Most people who know me know that I spend a lot of time on national  security space. Mr. Chair, 100 percent of our U.S. satellites, both  government and commercial, rely on secure communications. Missile  warning and global positioning are powered by solar cells.   Ending research and development on cutting-edge solar technology does  not advance national defense. In fact, it would limit our ability to  confront China in space as they seek to challenge our superiority.   I agree that DOD shouldn't waste time on fake green initiatives, but  advancing key space capabilities with these technologies makes our  military more lethal. I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I support the amendment and  believe it will help the Armed Services and Foreign Affairs Committees  in their ongoing investigations of the war in Afghanistan.    Mr. Chair, I move that the Committee do now  rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.  Fry) having assumed the chair, Mr. Womack, Acting Chair of the  Committee of the Whole House on the State of the Union, reported that  that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 2670) to  authorize appropriations for fiscal year 2024 for military activities  of the Department of Defense and for military construction, and for  defense activities of the Department of Energy, to prescribe military  personnel strengths for such fiscal year, and for other purposes, had  come to no resolution thereon.                            ____________________
