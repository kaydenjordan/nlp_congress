 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of a  veteran, public servant, and fellow brother in blue, John Patrick  Kilbride, better known as Jack.   Jack Kilbride was a man who lived a life of service to the people of  America, his fellow Long Islanders, and his comrades from the United  States military.   Indeed, as a young man and recent graduate of Division Avenue High  School in Levittown, Jack enlisted in the United States Marine Corps in  1967, at the height of the Vietnam war. Jack was sent to Vietnam as a  member of the India Company in the 3rd Battalion, 26th Marine Regiment,  where he fought valiantly at Khe Sanh and earned two Purple Hearts.   After catching malaria, Jack was sent home, only to be redeployed to  Vietnam for a second tour with the 9th Marines, also known as the  Walking Dead, a reputation they earned through their valor in combat.   After his honorable discharge from military service, Jack joined the  ranks of the Freeport Police Department back on Long Island, where he  served that community faithfully for 18 years, also as a member of  their PBA.   Upon his retirement from the Freeport Police Department, Jack  continued his life of public service by joining Congressman Pete King's  staff as his military congressional aide, a position he held for 10  years.   Jack's remarkable record of selfless service truly distinguished him  in the community, but Jack was not just a committed public servant. He  was also a dedicated family man, as well.   Jack was a loving husband to Virginia, known to many as Ginny; a  father to Michael, Kelly, and Kristin; and grandfather to 12  grandchildren, who lit up his world and knew him best as Pop.   He was also the brother to Marine Corps Major Chuck Kilbride, a great  man who works on Long Island to make sure underprivileged children see  the blessings of the holiday season each and every year by leading our  Toys for Tots program.   Upon Jack's death, he marked the members of the Veterans of Foreign  Wars, American Legion, Marine Corps League, and Law Enforcement  Foundation as his friends and comrades in arms.   On this day, I join many friends, and my friend, Major Chuck  Kilbride, in remembering the life and legacy of John Kilbride, a man  who lived his life in service to his family, his community, and this  great Nation.   New York's Fourth Congressional District truly lost an incredible,  selfless neighbor, but Jack's memory will live on forever.   May he rest in peace.                            ____________________
