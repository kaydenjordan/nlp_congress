 Madam Speaker, I rise to highlight a great injustice  happening to constituents of mine in Siskiyou County, California.  Against their wishes and interests, the hydroelectric dams on the  Klamath River are in line to be demolished and removed.   These removals will have a very negative effect on the economy for  the residents of Siskiyou County as much of their tax base relies on  those dams and the power and energy they produce. It will devalue their  property. The hydroelectric power--everyone wants green power--carbon- free power will be eliminated and have to be found some other way.   These property owners are going to be hurt drastically by this, but  they are supposed to be compensated by what is called the Klamath  Mitigation Fund. It seems that the parent agency of this fund, the  Klamath River Renewal Corporation, a shell corporation created to take  over the ownership of the dams and have no liability, has used  extremely subjective criteria when evaluating which property owners  will get compensation, which won't even be close to the amount that  they lose in their water wells and their property values as the  lakefront will no longer be a lake from the Copco Reservoir.   They should really be compensated for this, but on top of that, we  really shouldn't be tearing out dams when we already have a shortage of  electric power, especially green hydroelectric power that renews every  time it rains.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr.  Johnson) for leading us once again as we get out the good word of our  optimism for Congress and for the people of the United States.    This being National Police Week, I start off my portion by extending  my gratitude to all those officers who bravely wear the badge and  uphold our laws.   As my colleagues before me have emphasized, crime rates, indeed, are  rising exponentially due to soft-on-crime attitudes, early-release  policies, district attorneys that will not prosecute crimes that people  really care about, and even calls to defund police departments, though  some of the cities that have done that are now seeing the fruits of  that labor and are backtracking on that, embarrassingly for them.   In 2021, a record number of officers were killed in the line of duty.  Many more have been injured by dangerous criminals while on the job. We  pray for the safety of our law enforcement personnel as they continue  carrying out their mission to uphold the law for us. My heart goes out  to all the families who have lost a loved one in the line of duty.  Indeed, the price has been too high as there have been too many lost.   This week, we are honoring all who lost their lives while in the line  of duty. I highlight one from Arbuckle, California, a native of  northern California. Natalie Corona was a rising star of the Davis  Police Department. One of her colleagues recalled the time when she  went out of her way to aid a victim of the Camp fire in Paradise,  California, in response to a call.                                time  1945    Her father, a 26-year veteran of the Colusa County Sheriff's  Department said there was no question that Natalie Corona would one day  work in law enforcement.   In 2019, though, when Natalie was only 22 years old, she was ambushed  while responding to a minor three-vehicle collision. Natalie was  randomly shot and killed without warning for doing her job and helping  others.   Ultimately, I don't think it is fair that our law enforcement  personnel are expected to put their lives on the line to protect law  and order, meanwhile, Democrat lawmakers here in D.C. and Sacramento  and our State capital continuously fuel crime and put officers like  this needlessly in danger for what they do and lack of prosecution and  lack of making them see through their terms in our prisons. These  policies and hateful rhetoric really make their job that much harder.   There are plenty of those lawmakers in our California State capital  and this Capitol right here right now trying to still make it harder  for the police while simultaneously spending hundreds of thousands of  dollars on their own private security for themselves. That is amazing.   The names of 54 fallen law enforcement officers in California's First  District are inscribed at the National Law Enforcement Officers  Memorial. Indeed, once again, that is far too many.   Lawmakers in D.C. and in blue States such as my own, California, need  to get serious about locking up criminals and leaving them there for  their full term. Do not let them out for sorry excuses such as, oh,  COVID releases or, oh, we don't want the death penalty in California  for heinous crimes that they commit.   We need to give our law enforcement personnel the encouragement that  their work will not be made trivial by these release programs, these  lack of prosecutions and that we are going to have the resources for  them to stop crime and to help hold up the law that we ask them to do  as Americans.   Indeed, it is a somber occasion when we memorialize those that we  have lost, but we are very grateful that they are willing to serve in  what is a really tough business at a time when they seem more and more  persecuted than ever. We want them to know that still the very vast  majority of Americans appreciate them, that they answer the call, that  they are willing to line up and do this work for us in order to help  keep our streets in a way that we can be normal and do normal things  and not have to worry about endless break-ins or thuggery taking  advantage of innocent people just going along trying  [[Page H2416]]  to do normal things in their day-to-day lives.   We are eternally grateful for our law enforcement officers as we  recognize them this week. To my colleague, Mr. Johnson, I thank him  once again for hosting this Special Order.
