 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to take from the  Speaker's table H.R. 3401, with the Senate amendment thereto, and  concur in the Senate amendment. This bipartisan bill passed the Senate  with 84 votes and could be sent to the President's desk for his  signature today.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in very strong support of H.R. 3401, as amended by the Senate.   Hundreds of thousands of people have arrived at our border this year.  More than 100,000 have crossed each of the last 3 months, with 144,000  in May alone. Some of these people are coming through points of entry,  but the overwhelming majority are walking through the desert or  swimming the Rio Grande.   Men and women across agencies and departments have been working  together night and day trying to respond to the overwhelming surge, and  they desperately need resources to cover the growing costs. This is a  real crisis, and this bill provides funds for all those who are  representing us and working without adequate pay.   As I said just yesterday, we are out of time. Some of our agencies  are spending money they don't have because they have must-pay bills for  contracts for food, for shelter, for transportation, and for medical  care.   People are waiting in terrible conditions in the desert, and summer  in Texas is here. Children are sleeping on the ground and need to be  moved to shelters or homes. We need doctors and pediatricians and  caregivers.   This bill gives the agencies the funds to care for these children, to  reduce the overcrowding at border facilities, to repay the States, and  to add immigration judge teams.   The Senate has already passed this bill on an overwhelmingly  bipartisan basis. Now we should do the same and send this bill to the  President for his signature.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a strong ``yes'' vote on this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
