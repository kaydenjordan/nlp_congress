 Madam Speaker, I rise today to discuss the Lower Energy  Costs Act, or H.R. 1.   That is a joke. Once again, the title of a Republican bill does not  match the content.   This bill does not save Americans one dime in energy costs. Instead,  it will cost them at least $2.4 billion, according to the Congressional  Budget Office.   It will pollute drinking water and poison the air we breathe. It  eliminates Federal funds to decrease greenhouse gases, and it increases  dangerous drilling on Federal lands and in national parks.   It was Republican President Richard Nixon who started the  Environmental Protection Agency. Back then, Republicans cared about the  health and safety of the environment and Americans. Clearly, this bill  shows they could care less about both.                            ____________________
