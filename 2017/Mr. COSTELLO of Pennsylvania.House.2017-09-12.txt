 Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to rise in  support of this en bloc amendment, specifically the amendment I offered  with Congresswoman Bonamici.  [[Page H7277]]    Our amendment would help ensure adequate funding for a grant program  available to States, including my home State of Pennsylvania, to tailor  assessment systems to work for teachers, parents, and students. The  amendment would provide $378 million in funding for State assessment  grants, the amount authorized for these grants in the Every Student  Succeeds Act but, notably, $8.9 million more than that which was  included in the legislation we are currently debating.   Including full funding for State assessment grants is a critical way  for Congress to fulfill our promise under ESSA that we would streamline  testing so the high-stakes testing culture that has burdened schools  and students for too long is rolled back.   I thank the chairman and ranking member for the opportunity to offer  this amendment, and I urge the adoption of the en bloc amendment.
