 MALONEY of New York asked and was given permission  to address the House for 1 minute.)    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, last week the FCC  abdicated its responsibility to serve the public interest and put at  risk the free and open internet that we have all come to depend on when  its three Republican commissioners voted to repeal the Obama-era net  neutrality protection.   Net neutrality keeps access to the internet equal for everyone. It  protects free speech. It protects equal access to the marketplace of  ideas. It has been the fundamental principle underpinning the massive  innovation and opportunity that the internet has unleashed. But that is  all at risk now.   Fortunately, Congress has a say. I am proud to support Congressman  Mike Doyle's resolution to overturn the FCC's decision and restore our  net neutrality protections. I also believe the House Oversight and  Government Reform Committee should investigate the reports and  allegations of fraudulent public comments.   Repealing net neutrality will inhibit innovation, stifle competition,  and threaten free speech. It is time for Congress to overturn this  decision.                            ____________________     MALONEY of New York (for herself,               Mr. Khanna, Mr. Cummings, Ms. Norton, Ms. Shea-              Porter, Mr. Connolly, Mr. David Scott of Georgia, Mr.               Raskin, Mr. Suozzi, Ms. Kuster of New Hampshire, Ms.               Moore, Mrs. Dingell, and Mr. Pallone):        H.R. 4729.
