 Mr. Chairman, I thank the distinguished chair of the  Budget Committee for a job well done.   Mr. Chairman, I came to the floor today to weigh in on this budget  debate.   I find it incredible that my friends on the other side of the aisle  seem to be in a state of denial on the fact that this country, the  greatest on the planet, is $20 trillion in debt.   These are the same people in opposition, Mr. Chairman, who will  present a budget tomorrow that will add nearly $3 trillion in more  taxes and more than $6 trillion in more spending. This debt is going to  land squarely on the shoulders of our children, our grandchildren,  and--let me just say it for the record--is so large that it is going to  land on our grandchildren's grandchildren.   When does this insanity stop?   There is not an easy way out of the mess. This budget puts us on a  path to fiscal sanity. It targets Federal spending that is outside the  purview of the Appropriations Committee.   The budget ensures a strong national defense. It puts us on a path to  fiscal sustainability, and it gives us the opportunity to do deficit  reduction. The budget has progrowth policies that move us in a more  sustainable direction.   I understand the opposition coming from the other side. Their answer,  Mr. Chairman, as always, is: let's tax more and let's spend more. That  is not a responsible course. It won't lead to a good outcome for this  country.   Mr. Chairman, let me finally say that it is time we had a national  conversation about the math problem facing this country. This budget  starts that conversation. I encourage all my colleagues to support it,  recognize where we are as a country, and resolve to do something about  it.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the House  adjourns today, it adjourn to meet at 9 a.m. tomorrow.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Arkansas?   There was no objection.                            ____________________
