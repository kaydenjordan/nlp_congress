 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 1170, I call  up the bill (H.R. 2773) to amend the Pittman-Robertson Wildlife  Restoration Act to make supplemental funds available for management of  fish and wildlife species of greatest conservation need as determined  by State fish and wildlife agencies, and for other purposes, and ask  for its immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 2773.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 2773, the  Recovering America's Wildlife Act. This legislation has been years in  the making, and this moment is the culmination of the collected works  of a bipartisan group of Members, a strong, diverse coalition of  advocates, and grassroots support from across the country.   This work began in 2015 when the Association of Fish and Wildlife  Agencies--which represents State fish and wildlife agencies across the  country--established a blue ribbon panel on sustaining America's  diverse fish and wildlife resources.   After working closely with hunting and fishing organizations, as well  as partners in the sportsmen's community, businesses, and other  advocates, it was decided that we needed a 21st century model of  funding conservation to address the current shortfalls in wildlife  conservation.   Right now, the United States is facing an unprecedented biodiversity  crisis. One-third of all bird species are in need of urgent  conservation action. In fact, the number of birds in the United States  and Canada have fallen by 29 percent since 1970; a decline of almost 3  billion fewer birds.   We have seen similar declines across the board. For example, 40  percent of freshwater fish species are also at risk. One-third of all  U.S. wildlife species are currently imperiled or vulnerable.   These developments threaten our common environmental heritage, reduce  opportunities for outdoor recreation, and will require costly and  aggressive interventions if not addressed soon.   This legislation is particularly critical for the sportsmen's  community. As one of the co-chairs of the Congressional Sportsmen's  Caucus, I have always said that sportsmen and women are some of our  best conservation advocates, as they understand the on-the-ground  reality of the decline in wildlife and the importance of cost-effective  conservation.   Their input has been critical to the historic and innovative  legislation before us today. Without a change in the way we finance  fish and wildlife conservation, the list of Federally threatened and  endangered species will balloon from nearly 1,600 species today to  thousands more in the future.                                time  1500    The cost of inaction is immense. The longer we wait to address this  issue, the more resources we will ultimately need to safeguard our  Nation's wildlife and environment. And we cannot keep waiting. We must  take the bold, urgent action that addresses the scale of the threat. We  need strong, proactive conservation measures to address these  [[Page H5511]]  unmet needs, and that is why the Recovering America's Wildlife Act is  necessary.   The legislation provides approximately $1.4 billion in dedicated,  annual funding to the States, territories, and Native American Tribes  for proactive conservation efforts for the approximately 12,000 species  of wildlife and plants identified under State wildlife action plans.   This bold investment in our Nation's wildlife will pay significant  dividends. It will allow States to take proactive action that will  prevent at-risk species from becoming endangered. This is critical not  only to preserving our common environmental heritage, but for  supporting hunters, anglers, and the almost $900 billion outdoor  recreation economy.   As I have said previously, as one of the co-chairs of the  Congressional Sportsmen's Caucus, I understand the importance of these  measures to support fishermen and hunters across the country.   I thank my three fellow co-chairs of the Congressional Sportsmen's  Caucus who have sponsored the Recovering America's Wildlife Act as  well. It shows the strong, bipartisan support for this bill.   The broad group of stakeholders supporting the Recovering America's  Wildlife Act underscores the need for action and the support for this  approach. Hundreds of leading sportsmen's groups, hunting and fishing  advocates across the country, conservation organizations, environmental  organizations, and businesses, all support the legislation for good  reason: it utilizes proven funding mechanisms, boldly addresses  pressing conservation needs, and prevents the need for more costly  interventions in the future.   The Recovering America's Wildlife Act is the product of years and  years of work and consultation with these stakeholders and has broad  bipartisan support. This legislation has received bipartisan support in  both the House and Senate, and the thoughtful input of my colleagues  has resulted in strong consensus legislation that will benefit every  single congressional district in the country.   We have a conservation, economic, and moral rationale to act in order  to protect and recover America's wildlife for future generations. This  is an opportunity to take historic action to address a pressing  conservation need, and I ask my colleagues that they support the  Recovering America's Wildlife Act.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my colleague's perspective on permanent  funding, and I have a great deal of respect for him. We have and will  always continue to work together on conservation issues. But the fact  is we know that stable and predictable funding is critical to effective  conservation efforts, and that is what the blue ribbon panel on  sustaining America's diverse fish and wildlife resources--which  included 26 members from the hunting and fishing business and outdoor  recreation communities--found in their 2016 report whose  recommendations formed the basis of this legislation. We have seen that  this funding structure has been fundamental to the success of Pittman- Robertson and Dingell-Johnson conservation programs upon which this is  built.   I appreciate my colleague's views on oversight. This legislation  contains robust guardrails to ensure that there is appropriate use of  public funds, including reporting requirements and other oversight  provisions.   So the Recovering America's Wildlife Act does meet the moment because  of its funding structure and because of the strong oversight language  which is  [[Page H5512]]  supported by the coalitions of hundreds of organizations.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr.  Huffman).    Mr. Speaker, I would like to note that hunting and  angling collectively support over $200 billion in economic activity  annually, including over 1.5 million jobs as well as almost $15 billion  in Federal tax revenue.   My home State of Michigan, the Great Lakes State, is home to almost  650,000 licensed hunters and over 1.1 million licensed fishermen and - women as of last year. However, with over 40 percent of freshwater fish  at risk, and significant declines in game and nongame species that  support local ecosystems, we need RAWA's investments in on-the-ground  conservation to support hunting and fishing for future generations,  which is why the major sportsmen's groups, like the Congressional  Sportsmen's Foundation and Ducks Unlimited, have endorsed this  legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr.  Panetta).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Before recognizing my colleague, I would like to talk about these  costs and address the fact that dollars invested properly do save  dollars.   I note that the droughts in the American West cost $8.6 billion just  last year, according to NOAA, and that the impact of wildfire cost over  $10 billion last year alone.   Restoration efforts, which this bill would help do, that make  habitats and communities more resilient to climate change have an  exceptionally high return on investment, such as reducing drought and  wildfire risks, increasing job opportunities, and growing local  economies.   Conservation and restoration of key habitats help reduce the threats  of wildfires and help States conserve water and improve water quality,  making their water systems more resilient to the drought.   Finally, full implementation of State and Tribal wildlife plans will  help species recover and be removed and even stay off the endangered  species list, which is what we want, saving the U.S. taxpayers millions  of dollars each year.   The large economic and social benefits of this legislation would  boost our economy and help us deliver on our climate commitments for  years to come as well.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to my distinguished colleague from  Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Washington (Mr. Kilmer).    I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I say to my colleague, I deeply agree that these fires are horrific  in what they are doing to our natural resources and our habitat, but  that is why this bill is so important.   It is not Washington telling the States or the Native lands or  territories in the Native lands what to do. It is the State wildlife  plans that are being drafted at the local level where they know what  needs to be done that we will be funding and trying to prevent fires  like that.   Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the very  distinguished gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Grijalva), the chairman of  the Committee on Natural Resources, who leads all of us on so many of  these issues.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I say to my colleague, we have worked in good faith. We will continue  to work in good faith.   The Senate, which doesn't work together as closely at times the way  we do, has negotiated a legacy fund that is a bipartisan negotiated  provision by the chairman and the ranking member of the Senate  Committee on Environment and Public Works. Actually, more Republicans  voted for that than Democrats did.   This bill has been supported by a broad cross-section of Senate  Republicans and Senate Democrats. Quite frankly, there are some of your  Senate Republican colleagues who will only support it the way it is  now. I have talked to many Republicans who want to see this bill go  through. I don't know how the final vote will be today. I know people  want to support it.   By the way, it addresses a shared goal, what the Senate did, that  third provision helping to move species off of the ESA listings more  quickly. It contains guardrails on the use of funds that I know were  important to my Republican colleagues. These include prohibitions on  the use of funds to make any listing or critical habitat determination  relating to the endangered or threatened status of any species or to  acquire any Federal land, which I know is really important on your  side.   The broad coalition supporting the bill, including the State wildlife  agencies and sportsmen's groups, have also backed all these provisions.  We are not done. If the bill passes the House, we will go to conference  with the Senate. We will all be at that table. But the time is now. We  need to get this done. We have lost almost 3 billion birds since 1970.  We are losing 40 percent of our fish. You and I both fish. I am not as  great a hunter as you guys are, but I was married to one. But they know  what is happening. The time for action is now.   Mr. Speaker, we are prepared to close, and I reserve the balance of  my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume  to close.   I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for the constructive  debate and input that we have had to date on Recovering America's  Wildlife Act. This legislation is historic, and our shared efforts  today will help move us one step closer to a bold solution to the  biodiversity crisis and will establish conservation measures that will  endure for generations, which I know we both care about.   The Recovering America's Wildlife Act has strong bipartisan support,  the backing of hundreds of meetings of sportsmen's groups, hunting and  fishing advocates, conservation organizations, environmental advocates,  businesses, and countless others.   It will fund proactive conservation measures that will benefit every  State and territory and contains a strong Tribal title to support  Tribal organizations' efforts to protect wildlife on tens of millions  of acres of land.   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the Recovering  America's Wildlife Act. It will make a difference in every  congressional district in this country.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 1170, I offer  amendments en bloc.    Mr. Speaker, this en bloc consists of four amendments:  Amendment No. 3, offered by the gentlewoman from Texas; amendment No.  7, offered by the gentleman from Georgia; amendment No. 6, offered by  the gentlewoman from Washington; and amendment No. 1, offered by the  gentlewoman from Florida.   Amendment No. 3, offered by the gentlewoman from Texas, requires the  Secretary of the Interior to submit a report to the House Committee on  Natural Resources and the Senate Committee on Environment and Public  Works outlining the dollar amount of grants, contracts, and  subcontracts, and the percent of total awards and grants that were  awarded or allocated under RAWA to HBCUs and minority-serving  institutions, minority- and women-owned businesses, and community-based  organizations serving minority communities.   Current conservation and restoration practices underutilize the  breadth of traditional, indigenous, and local knowledge found in our  communities. To be successful in our restoration and conservation  goals, we must use all of the tools at our disposal.   Amendment No. 7, offered by the gentleman from Georgia, adds  activities that support native pollinator conservation and restoration  to the list of appropriate uses of funds from the Wildlife Conservation  and Restoration Subaccount.   While many State wildlife action plans already include projects that  will conserve and restore native pollinator species and habitat, we  recognize the important role that pollinators play in ecosystem  functionality.   Twenty-seven States included monarch butterflies in their State  wildlife action plans, and thousands of other pollinators are  identified as species of greatest conservation need.   Our pollinators are at risk, and it is important that we not forget  the important impact they have on our landscape.   Amendment No. 6, offered by the gentlewoman from Washington,  clarifies that the Wildlife Conservation and Restoration Subaccount  funds may include conservation infrastructure projects related to the  protection and conservation of a species of greatest conservation need  and the habitat of those species.   Conservation infrastructure projects are cost-effective methods to  enhance conservation and build climate resiliency. They can protect  against excessive heat and coastal storms while improving wildlife  habitat and carbon sequestration.   Conservation infrastructure projects improve the health and  management of ecosystems so that they provide important benefits and  services. Examples include managing stormwater runoff, improving water  quality for wildlife, restoring wildlife habitat in the built  environment, and attracting beneficial species.                                time  1600    Finally, amendment No. 1, offered by the gentlewoman from Florida,  broadens the appropriate uses of Wildlife Conservation and Restoration  Subaccount funds to include using innovative technologies, tools,  strategies, or collaborative partnerships that accelerate, expand, or  replicate effective and measurable recovery efforts for species of the  greatest conservation need and endangered species.   Supporting the implementation and expansion of new, creative  conservation methods is of the utmost importance if we wish to  interrupt the ongoing mass extinction event. In this time of need, our  species and ecosystems need all the help we can provide. Funding  innovative ideas will fill the gaps left by traditional conservation  methods while spurring research and creating jobs.  [[Page H5521]]    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes,'' and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am glad we found an area of agreement  this afternoon. I think we have more agreement than people realize.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms.  Jackson Lee), the author of one of these very critical amendments.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Texas.    Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this  en bloc package as well as the bill upon final passage, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 1170, I offer  amendments en bloc.    Mr. Speaker, en bloc No. 2 consists of two good- government amendments offered by my Republican colleagues: amendment  No. 2 offered by the gentleman from Oregon and amendment No. 8 offered  by the gentleman from Wisconsin.   Amendment No. 2 stipulates that no more than 1.85 percent of funds  can be used for administrative costs in the grant programs authorized  by title III.   The purpose of the Recovering America's Wildlife Act is to fund on- the-ground efforts that are focused on conserving and restoring  wildlife and habitat. This 1.85 percent cap will ensure that these  dollars are being used toward actions that create the most impact.   Amendment No. 8 offered by the gentleman from Wisconsin requires that  half of 1 percent of the money in the Endangered Species Recovery and  Habitat Conservation Legacy Fund be directed to the Office of the  Inspector General of the Department of the Interior to oversee the  expenditure of the fund.   This amendment will ensure that money from the Endangered Species  Recovery and Habitat Conservation Legacy Fund is used appropriately and  in a manner that is in line with the spirit of this legislation.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on en bloc No. 2,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support the  en bloc package as well as the bill upon final passage, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague and friend from  Michigan for this amendment.   This bipartisan amendment offered by the gentleman from Michigan and  cosponsored by the Republican gentleman from northern Michigan makes it  clear--or western Michigan, not from where Dan and I are, but it is  Michigan--makes it clear that eligible funding for conservation  activities under the Endangered Species Recovery and Habitat  Conservation Legacy Fund include invasive species and disease  management control and prevention efforts.   Invasive species and diseases pose severe threats to our Nation's  wildlife population, especially for species that are already threatened  or endangered.   Few places in the United States are more familiar with invasive  species than the Great Lakes region which has been battling sea  lampreys, zebra and quagga mussels, and now Asian carp. Native fish  species are smaller and less plentiful than they once were thanks to  these invasive species.   On the disease front, chronic waste and disease, a fatal disease for  North America's deer, elk, and moose have spread to 25 States posing  significant risks to those populations.   To properly recover native species, we must provide the resources and  coordinate efforts to eradicate or control invasive species, prevent  new introductions, and better understand emerging diseases.   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.    Madam Speaker, this amendment offered by the  gentlewoman from Arizona and the gentleman from North Carolina adds  nonprofit organizations to the list of entities that are eligible to  compete for innovation grants funded by the Wildlife Conservation and  Restoration Subaccount.    Ten percent of subaccount funds are used to fund innovation grants.  These grants are meant to catalyze the innovation of techniques, tools,  and strategies while fostering collaborative partnerships that  accelerate, expand, or replicate effective and measurable recovery  efforts for species of greatest conservation need and species listed  under the Endangered Species Act.   Including nonprofit organizations in this competitive grant process  will foster collaboration and ensure that the best strategies and  efforts are being funded.   Madam Speaker, I am sure that none of the groups are the radical  groups that you are referring to, but I don't know. It is a competitive  process that will be carefully managed.   Madam Speaker, I support my colleague's amendment.
