 Mr. Speaker, before I start my presentation--and I am  going to focus sort of on some of the economics, the debt and economic  growth, particularly in some of the proposals that are hitting the  House right now--I wanted to touch on something.   We just heard a number of folks get up and talk about their love and  caring for Israel, the Middle East, and the concerns of the conflict. I  want to do something that is a little bit different. I have intense  concern that our relationship with a fair and functioning republic in  the Middle East never become a partisan issue.   Maybe this will make sense. I have been here for a few years, and  there has always been the ability for those on the left and the right  to stand up and say: Look, we have a country that works. No country is  perfect, but it works, and it respects human rights, and it is a  functioning republic and a democracy in the Middle East.   I was really sort of heartbroken last week. Just before I did one of  these presentations, there was a presentation by not many Members, but  some who said some pretty awful things. So I hope as we all want the  country of Israel to prosper and do well--we want everyone in the  region to prosper and do well--but we have to accept there are other  bad actors particularly financing things coming through Iran to some  very bad actors to do horrible, horrible things in the region.   I wish we could sort of step back a few months and think of the joy  that many of us felt with the Abraham Accords that good things were  happening. The caring for Israel needs to be bipartisan, and my fear is  we are seeing that start to slip where some on the hard left are moving  away from supporting a fellow republic.   This is not a good thing for all of us, and we need to sort of  rethink that discussion, stand up for our friends, and tell our enemies  that they can have a home in our hearts if they stop the bad acts. And  maybe the Middle East, one day, really does have a future, as we saw  with the vision that came from the Abraham Accords.   Mr. Speaker, I get frustrated when I watch the floor. We all sit in  committee, and so often what comes through these microphones are sort  of trite talking points.   So let's go back to the big picture: What are we doing to actually  deal with it?   I have a new chart. I am trying to find over and over and over how do  we actually all come together and understand the reality?   This is our future. This is my 5-year-old daughter's future. It is  $101 trillion in debt adjusted in today's dollars. So this isn't 30  years of inflation. This is today's dollars. This is our future in 30  years.   Many of us want to get behind the microphone and say: This is  Democrat; this is Republican.   It is demographics. We are getting older as a society. We are getting  older as a people. And the reality of it is 67 percent of our 30-year  debt is the unfunded portion of Medicare.   Remember, Mr. Speaker, when you pay your FICA tax, you are paying the  part A, the hospital portion. The part B and D, someone, a retiree  contributes a little tiny sliver to. The rest comes out of the general  fund. When you actually take a look at our population, Mr. Speaker, the  cost of healthcare, those things, then you start to realize it is the  core driver of our debt.   The blue here is the unfunded liability with Social Security. So if  you believe Americans have the right to these  [[Page H2603]]  earned benefits--these are earned benefits--then why is it so hard to  have an honest conversation about the unfunded liability?   Because, Mr. Speaker, you will get behind these microphones and the  handful around here who would tell the truth about the math, then this  becomes an attack television commercial because you told the truth. I  am passionate that during my time here I am going to make these  programs survive and prosper, but you first have to understand the  scale of the problem.   Mr. Speaker, do you see the little green wedge over here?   At the end of 30 years, the $101 trillion of debt in today's dollars,  only $3 trillion of it is the rest to government. So when you get a  politician who will say: Oh, it is the military; it is waste and fraud;  it is foreign aid, then they are lying to you or they don't own a  calculator.   Once again, we have got to have this honest conversation: The  unfunded liabilities in Medicare and Social Security drive U.S.  sovereign debt.   So why talk about this today?   We have lots and lots and lots and lots and lots of spending that has  come up this year. I want to walk through what that does. I haven't  even been able to do the math on the charts if we continue just what we  have done this year, just in the few months what that actually means to  the future.   You would think we would be having this discussion: Hey, the economy  is getting better. Our society is opening up. Let's get Americans to  work, and let's get prosperity going. Because if we don't have actually  amazing and robust economic growth, then dealing with that $101  trillion of unfunded liability becomes almost mathematically  impossible.   So just to try to put some things in context, we held a hearing today  in the Ways and Means Committee on infrastructure. Now, most of the  discussion ended up becoming about infrastructure financing. But I  decided it was good to actually come up here and show what is actually  roads and bridges.   So, Mr. Speaker, do you see the orange right there?   Mr. Speaker, $115 billion out of the--what is it--$2-something  trillion is actually just roads and bridges. Much of the rest of the  spending, if you want to be brutal about it, is other things that come  shockingly close to paybacks for constituencies that help finance the  left. But a lot of them are things that ultimately don't belong in the  infrastructure: medical expansion and long-term care. It is something  that is real we need to deal with.    Does long-term care belong in an infrastructure bill?   Republicans and Democrats can nail this. We can get this here.   I will also give you another thing, Mr. Speaker. Many of us believe  infrastructure is actually much more than our traditional idea of roads  and bridges.   If you start to think it through, how much of it is technology?   If I came to you tomorrow, Mr. Speaker, and said: What is the street  down in your neighborhood going to look like a decade from now?   Fifteen years from now?   I am desperately hoping my 5-year-old never drives. I want her in an  autonomous vehicle.   If we actually have this technology coming, then what does traffic  look like?   What does a smart city look like?   I have done presentations here on the floor before of what does the  future of infrastructure look like in a world of interconnectivity,  where cars can be traveling at pretty impressive speeds talking to each  other, your carrying capacity on the existing roads today change.   How much discussion have we had that the future of infrastructure has  a huge technology base to it?   The information coming to your vehicle tells you when there is a fire  truck, when school is out, when there is a water main break to keep  moving and flowing traffic.   That is when my intense frustration is--much of the debate we have  today is: Let's pay back our political constituencies. Let's put this  much into roads and bridges. And, oh, let's completely be funding the  infrastructure of past decades instead of being visionary about what  the future looks like.                                time  2030    I will give you a simple example of that just as a thought  experiment. I have a fixation on the future of healthcare as a type of  interconnectivity. Telemedicine becomes sort of a telehealth using  sensors and those things--cars talking to each other, transportation,  products, drones. Okay, you need broadband.   Broadband in the future for areas like my State of Arizona that don't  have it isn't running a copper line or a fiber-optic line out to the  middle of nowhere. It is a satellite. This last weekend, I think we  launched another 54, or whatever it is, low-Earth orbit satellites.   But we have $100 billion of spending for moving broadband  particularly out to rural America. Rural America, if we would  understand technology of today instead of sounding like we are a decade  behind, we have for my Tribal communities in the middle of nowhere  broadband. We just now need to get our laws, our financing, our  subsidies to this part of this century. That is part of the thought  experiment.   This is one I want to try to have a real, brutally honest  conversation about because the President has gotten up multiple times  and said his infrastructure package is paid for. Well, it is not. When  you spend some time on it, the new taxes, a substantial number of them  are fake. They are just fluff because when you look at the $265  trillion in spending that is the baseline in the bill, as best we can  score it, $1.95 trillion is the revenue. It is not real. A big portion  of it comes from, hey, we are going to get the entire world to do a  corporate minimum tax inversion so the companies leaving the United  States because we raised corporate taxes won't happen.   For the Biden tax plan, for Nancy Pelosi's, for the Democrats' tax  plan to actually work, there are components in here. You need the rest  of the world to adopt a minimum tax so we don't go back to pre-2016  when companies were abandoning the United States and taking much of  that tax revenue with them.   Another thing, there is a substantial area there where we believe  there are billions and billions--maybe a couple of hundred billion--and  we are going to collect more taxes. We are going to get those tax  cheats. Okay, let's say that is even real. How many years would it take  to hire, train, and be able to collect? Some of the estimates you are  talking about will take several years before that even becomes  effective.   There are a number of things like that on the revenue side that are  fanciful. Also, no one has started to score the raise of corporate  taxes that are in the Democrats' tax portion of the infrastructure  plan. We did a presentation last week that showed about a million  people will lose their jobs in the first 24 months. There will be a  million less jobs because of the corporate tax, and that is just the  corporate tax. That is not talking about the change of basis, the  capital gains, the tax on the wealthy, all of those other things.   We were trying to make an argument: If the hunger is for revenues for  some of these, stop subsidizing the really, really ultrarich. When they  buy their multimillion-dollar house on a beachfront, should we  subsidize flood insurance? If someone is really wealthy, should you  subsidize their electric vehicle, their solar panels, their power wall?   It turns out, we were coming up with close to $1.4 trillion in the  10-year window that looks to be subsidies for the very well-off. If you  do the ultra-well-off, it cuts that number down, but it is still a  stunning amount of money.   So, there is a path where you could cut spending instead of doing  things that would distort economic growth because, as many of you know  who may have watched some of these presentations, I have an absolute  fixation on the working poor. The miracle we had in this country in  2018 and 2019, where we were starting to crush the separation of income  and equality, it was working. We came up with something that I believe  Democrats supported, but they just didn't support how we got there.   We made working men and women's labor valuable. We made what talents  they brought to the marketplace valuable. We tried to once again say:  If you care and love the working poor, and  [[Page H2604]]  you want them to become much less poor, you can't devalue their labor.  But that is what we are doing right now.   The number one thing you can do to do economic violence to the  working poor is open up your borders. What happens when you import  substantial numbers of people with similar skill sets? We have great  data on this. You functionally have subjected that working-poor  population in your country to a decade of misery where their wages  don't flatline. They actually go down.   The other thing you do is inflation. Inflation concentrates  punishment on elderly who have saved and the working poor because now  the ability to buy that house, now the ability to buy an asset becomes  so much more difficult to get to.   I am not sure the left has processed what is going on at this moment  and how much economic violence is actually being done by the economic  decisions that have happened the last few months here. So, let's take a  quick look here.   Do you remember a couple of years ago, you know, way, way back, maybe  like 2019? We would engage in debates here on how we are spending too  much money on the military, too much for this, and 4.7 percent of GDP  that year was going to be in borrowing. People were really upset on the  left, and many of us were upset with too much spending on the right.   This year, we are over 20\1/2\ percent. If you want to understand  inflation, if you want to understand what is happening to asset prices,  if you are wanting to understand why that first-time homebuyer can't  buy the home, why that working-poor family can't seem to dig themselves  out, this is the beginning of what we are doing.   We are pumping so much spending, and the Federal Reserve is having to  finance it, to create functionally fake money, because here is what we  are doing. We sell bonds. Right now, the Federal Reserve is buying our  bonds like crazy--in many ways, just creating cash out of thin air.  There is this old saying: What is inflation? Inflation is too many  dollars chasing too few goods.    Instead of financing production and productivity in our society like  the tax reform did in 2017, where we saw incredible wage growth with no  inflation, what we did now is we helicopter-dropped money. Now, we have  lots of cash in our society, which has all been borrowed, chasing not  enough production because we didn't incentivize production. We  incentivized buying things. Great politics until you start to blow up  people's lives with the cost of their goods.   How dangerous is inflation? You hear a number of our friends from the  Federal Reserve--I talked to one a couple of nights ago, one of the  region presidents. She said: David, it is transitory. How many of you  have watched a lot of the leading economists, even the leading  economists on the left side, in the last 3 or 4 days? They are now  sounding the alarm. This inflation rate is not what they call  transitory. It is not just a blip for 90 days, and then it is going  away.   There are geeky things. I am the senior Republican on the House side  for the Joint Economic Committee, and there are things we will look at,  being able to buy a futures contract on a steel that you are doing a  multiyear project on, things like that. You almost can't buy those  right now.   There are so many industries that say their inflation curve is  already out beyond this year and into 2022. This is really dangerous,  where we are at.   Think of this. Last month, if you had annualized, we were at 4.2. But  the important thing is, look at the explosion. Functionally, as soon as  the administration started rolling out this functionally deficit  financing, even though the President says, hey, I am paying for it--but  you just saw, on giving credit for everything, there is still another  $600 billion of borrowing in just the infrastructure proposal, not all  the others.   This is a problem. There is a canary in a mine. Some folks should be  really starting to make a point on this.   Mr. Speaker, how many minutes do I have remaining?    Okay, I will talk faster.   I know this is a little bit geeky, but this is important. Open  borders, inflation, these are components that just crush the very  people who we were having so much success with for a couple of years.   We all talk a great game about caring about working men and women,  but we are engaged in economic malfeasance right now. I understand it  is complicated, but the numbers don't lie.   When you start looking at these charts right now, when you start  seeing just parts of the PPI hitting a 12 percent annualized in the  commodity goods last month, we really, really, really need to start  taking this seriously.   Do you continue to float more debt to chase more helicopter money to  go out and buy more constituents? You are going to see sort of a false  economy for some of the calculations this year, where you may see a  number that says: Hey, income inequality also shrunk this year because  we gave out so much cash, but we also created economic violence because  we created detachment from work.   Remember, losing a year of work, losing a year of skills, losing a  year of progress in your career path even for the working poor has a  multiplier effect that if you look over the lifetime career, it is  pretty devastating.   You saw the decisions that were made to keep schools closed and the  amount of economic violence to working women in our Nation. In 2019,  there were more females in the labor market than men. Today, that just  isn't true.   The last one I will give, for those folks who fixate on monetary  policies, you are in an unusual moment. Remember, there is a difference  between fiscal policy and monetary policy. Monetary is Federal Reserve:  Hey, we are going to shrink the money supply. We are going to increase  the money supply. We are going to do this to protect the purchasing  value of the dollar for overseas, for in the country. We are going to  use interest rates. We are going to use bank reserves. We are going to  use those things as tools.   The fiscal side is: We spend money. We borrow money.   What happens when we are borrowing, because we are spending so much,  we are borrowing so much that we distort what they call monetary  supply. All of a sudden, the Federal Reserve is having to step in and  finance our chaos. It turns out Congress, because of its spending now,  is distorting monetary supply.   What this chart shows is--just take a look--this was the Federal  Reserve balance sheet. Just before COVID, it was shrinking. The economy  was doing so stunningly well. We had economic growth. The working poor  were getting dramatically less poor. We had almost no inflation.  Productivity was beginning to spike in the economy.    Remember, how do you pay people more money? You pay them more because  of inflation and productivity. Well, when you pay someone more for  inflation, they don't get anything. When you pay them for productivity  because there are new plants and equipment and these types of economic  investments, that is the golden child. That is where you are paying  people more because we have invested in them and in plants and  equipment.   That is also what is so devastating about the left's tax plan right  now. When you raise capital gains the way they are talking about doing  without incentivizing investments in productivity and investments in  people through those organizations, they are going to be paid less  money.   When you raise corporate taxes, there will be less money for those  things that make jobs more productive, and we have already seen the  numbers. We are going to unemploy a million people if the current  corporate tax model comes in.   We are now spending so much money that we are just distorting the  monetary supply for us in the world because the Federal Reserve needs  to keep buying our bonds. They try to keep interest rates as level as  possible for as long as possible because, God forbid, when you are  floating the scale of debt we are floating today, could you imagine if  the next set of refinancing, the next set of bonds, were at  traditionally the interest rates we had a decade or two decades ago?                                time  2045    So I want to sort of close on this.  [[Page H2605]]    This over here is 2013 to 2016. This is 2016 to 2019. Most of this  economic change was really 2018 and 2019.   This is mean family income. If you take a look, the blue is the  poorest quartiles in our society. 2016, 2015, 2014, 2013, going back,  they were getting their heads kicked in. Income inequality really was  growing, but it was growing under the Obama's administration's  policies.   If you take a look at what happened after tax reform, income  inequality shrank. The blue here is our lowest quartiles. I hate that  number, but it is economics. Working men and women, particularly the  working poor, saw almost a 10 percent increase in their wages in those  couple years. The wealthy only saw about 2.9 percent.   If anyone ever wants to really dive into it, the discussion between  supply-side economics and Keynesian economics and the distortion that  politics have turned to those things, if you actually care about where  we are going--you remember the very first chart that showed $101  trillion of debt that is coming at us. We are making our society and  our country incredibly fragile to an interest rate spike, a military  conflict, or another pandemic.   If we need infrastructure, let's build infrastructure. We can work  out the financing mechanisms. But does long-term care really belong in  the infrastructure bill? We need a revolution in what healthcare is,  because you saw on the first chart, healthcare is the primary driver of  U.S. sovereign debt. Once again, understand the ACA, Obamacare, the  Republican alternative, Medicare for All, are not pieces of legislation  that change the cost of healthcare. When you see them, the percent of  GDP that goes to healthcare stays the same. They are financing bills.  This is one of the thought processes here that has been so difficult to  crack through our skulls. We keep having debates on this floor that are  about who pays and who gets subsidized. We don't have conversations of  what we can do to unleash creativity in technology, whether it be in  environment, whether it be in infrastructure, whether it be in  healthcare.   Until this place starts to see this in a holistic sort of continuous  circle of healthcare actually has something to do with infrastructure,  but the way you keep debt financing it, the debt becomes our fragility,  and the debt is what is going to crush our future and do true economic  violence to the working poor, and even to my 5-year-old daughter's  future.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
