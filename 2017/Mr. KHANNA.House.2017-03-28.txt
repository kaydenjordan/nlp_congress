 Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Polis for yielding and for your  leadership on this issue.   This resolution would overturn rules that protect a consumer's  privacy, and they would be a handout to internet service providers:  Comcast, Verizon, AT&T. Now, as it is, the average American, 80 percent  of Americans, don't have a choice about which internet service provider  they can use, and they pay six to seven times more than people pay in  France, than people pay in Britain. And people wonder: Why is this?   Obviously, the United States did all of the research that invented  the internet. Why are Americans paying more? It is because they have  monopolistic, anticompetitive practices. So what is the solution?  Instead of making the industry more competitive so Americans have more  choice and don't have to pay as much, what this bill wants to do is  give these four or five internet service providers even more power,  allowing them to take an individual's data and sell it to whoever they  want.   The fear of Big Brother is so real out there, as it is, people fear  that the bureaucracy and big companies are controlling their lives.  This bill would allow that to continue and get worse.  [[Page H2483]]    What we need is more anticompetitive legislation. What we need is a  stronger internet bill of rights that applies to ISPs and other  internet service companies not a rollback of the regulations that  currently exist.
