 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 446,  legislation aimed that at protecting older Americans from falling  victim to scammers.   Throughout the pandemic, uncertainty has led to many Americans  falling victim to scam callers, especially vulnerable populations like  seniors. We have a responsibility to stop bad actors like these scam  artists in their tracks. That starts with empowering the American  people with information to better protect themselves and their loved  ones from falling victim.   H.R. 446 would direct the Federal Trade Commission to identify  scammers and make such information publicly available. This legislation  also equips the FTC to more proactively alert the public about known  scams, specifically in their region.   Mr. Speaker, our seniors have suffered enough. It is time to better  supply them and their loved ones with the information needed to protect  themselves against scammers who shamelessly prey on the most  vulnerable. That is why I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting  H.R. 446, the Protecting Seniors from Emergency Scams Act.
