 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding to me. He is a  valued member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. Let me start by  thanking Mr. McGovern for his hard work on this legislation.   The relationship between the United States and Hong Kong is rooted in  our shared values. Among them are a fierce belief in the freedom of  speech, and the right to assemble. That is why the American people are  so troubled by the images coming out of Hong Kong lately.   Hundreds of thousands of protesters who have taken to the streets  have been met with increasing violence by the Hong Kong Police Force.  These pro-democracy activists faced teargas, pepper spray, and rubber  bullets by the police force sworn to supposedly protect them.   I remember when China took over Hong Kong from the U.K. and said that  they would adhere to a system of two systems in China, and that the  people of Hong Kong would have freedom like they had before to speak  their mind. And here it is, probably about 20 years later, and that is  already being eroded, taken away, and the people of Hong Kong see that  they were promised something which isn't being brought forth from the  Beijing regime.    Mr. McGovern's measure would ensure that American companies are not  contributing equipment for the Hong Kong police to use against  protesters. This bill also calls on the police to take the steps needed  to address those issues from within. When there are instances of police  brutality, there must be prompt, independent investigations and proper  accountability.   The PROTECT Hong Kong Act shows the people of Hong Kong that the  United States stands with them in their fight for their freedoms. It  makes sure that American companies are not facilitating violence  against brave Democratic protesters.   It is a shame that it has come to this, but it is really uplifting to  watch people possess enormous courage in the wake of having their lives  threatened. In the wake of having their society destroyed, they stood  up and they are standing up to the Beijing regime and to the people who  would try to strip them of their basic freedoms.   I think that we all, no matter where we are on this planet, have to  admire the brave people of Hong Kong. We had the good fortune of  meeting a number of the protesters when Speaker Pelosi called a press  conference a few weeks ago, and we talked about this bill. It was  really heartening to be able to speak to these young people one-on-one.  These are young people who have shown just enormous amounts of courage.  And they should know that the United States will always support them,  will continue to support them, and we won't stop until the people of  Hong Kong have their democracy and the freedom they deserve.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 4270.                                time  1630     Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the  resolution (H. Res. 521) commending the Government of Canada for  upholding the rule of law and expressing concern over actions by the  Government of the People's Republic of China in response to a request  from the United States Government to the Government of Canada for the  extradition of a Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd., executive.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows:                                H. Res. 521         Whereas, on December 1, 2018, Canadian authorities detained       Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd., chief financial officer Meng       Wanzhou based on an arrest warrant issued pursuant to a       request made by the United States under the Extradition       Treaty Between the United States of America and Canada,       signed at Washington December 3, 1971;        Whereas, on January 24, 2019, the United States filed a       superseding indictment in the United States District Court       for the Eastern District of New York against Huawei       Technologies Co., Ltd. (``Huawei''), Huawei Device USA Inc.,       Skycom Tech Co. Ltd. (``Skycom''), and Meng Wanzhou;        Whereas the January 24, 2019, indictment charges two counts       of bank fraud, two counts of conspiracy to commit bank fraud,       one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, one count of       wire fraud, one count of conspiracy to defraud the United       States, two counts of conspiracy to violate the International       Emergency Economic Powers Act, two counts of violations of       the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, one count of       money laundering conspiracy, and one count of conspiracy to       obstruct justice;        Whereas the January 24, 2019, indictment charges that       ``Huawei operated Skycom as an unofficial subsidiary to       obtain otherwise prohibited U.S.-origin goods, technology,       and services, including banking services, for Huawei's Iran-      based business while concealing the link to Huawei'';        Whereas the United States Government is seeking the       extradition of Meng Wanzhou;        Whereas Canadian authorities granted Meng Wanzhou access to       Chinese consular officials, and she was able to engage a       lawyer of her choice and was released on bail pending the       outcome of the extradition hearing;        Whereas the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs strongly       urged Canada ``to immediately release'' Meng Wanzhou and       threatened that otherwise ``it will definitely have grave       consequences, and [Canada] will have to bear the full       responsibility for it'';        Whereas the Government of the People's Republic of China       detained Canadian diplomat Michael Kovrig and Canadian       executive Michael Spavor on December 10, 2018, in apparent       retaliation for the arrest of Meng Wanzhou;        Whereas Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig have faced harsh       conditions while in detention that include limited consular       access, no access to a lawyer, being unable to turn off the       lights at night, and lengthy interrogations, including in the       case of Mr. Kovrig, about his official activities during his       previous tenure as an accredited diplomat in the People's       Republic of China, potentially in violation of the Vienna       Convention on Diplomatic Relations, done at Vienna April 18,       1961;        Whereas, on January 14, 2019, a third Canadian, Robert       Schellenberg, in Chinese custody for drug smuggling, had his       case reviewed and his 15-year sentence changed to the death       penalty;        Whereas the Department of State's Country Report on Human       Rights Practices for 2018 stated that ``[a]rbitrary arrest       and detention remained serious problems'' in China and that       Chinese judges ``regularly received political guidance on       pending cases, including instructions on how to rule, from       both the government and the CCP [Chinese Communist Party],       particularly in politically sensitive cases''; and        Whereas while neither Michael Kovrig nor Michael Spavor has       been formally charged with any crime under Chinese law, the       Government of the People's Republic of China formally       arrested them on May 6, 2019, following their detention on       December 10, 2018: Now, therefore, be it        Resolved, That the House of Representatives--        (1) commends the Government of Canada for upholding the       rule of law and complying with its international legal       obligations, including those pursuant to the Extradition       Treaty Between the United States of America and Canada,       signed at Washington December 3, 1971;        (2) commends the Government of Canada for providing       consular access and due process for Huawei Technologies Co.,       Ltd., chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou;        (3) expresses concern over the Government of the People's       Republic of China's apparent arbitrary detention and abusive       treatment of Canadian nationals Michael Spavor and Michael       Kovrig in apparent retaliation for the Government of Canada's       detention of Meng Wanzhou; and        (4) joins the Government of Canada in calling for the       immediate release of Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig and       for due process for Canadian national Robert Schellenberg.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H. Res. 521.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this is a good, bipartisan resolution, and I was glad to  join Ranking Member McCaul as a cosponsor of this bill. This measure  deals with something that we have all seen lately--how China responds  to those who go against the Chinese Communist Party's agenda. Whether  we are talking about individuals, private companies, or countries,  China doesn't hesitate to extort, coerce, and punish those who  challenge it.   Right now, our neighbor to the north, Canada, is experiencing this  firsthand. Back in December, Canada arrested and extradited the chief  financial officer of Chinese company Huawei for her role in violating  American sanctions law. The Canadians were completely in the right  here. They were upholding the rule of law.   China launched an outrageous response, arresting two innocent  Canadian citizens on trumped-up charges. These men are still  languishing in China's detention and legal process limbo, deprived of  their freedom and denied basic consular rights--rights that all  countries should honor--solely because China wanted to use them in a  political bullying tactic. Their rights went out the window.   This is an outrageous affront to the rule of law, and we must condemn  it.   H. Res. 521 denounces this practice by China and sends a clear signal  that the United States Congress stands with Canada in demanding the  immediate release of their innocent citizens.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this good  measure, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume for  the purpose of closing.   Mr. Speaker, again, I thank Ranking Member McCaul for his leadership  in introducing this measure and his hard work in seeing its passage.   China is flouting the international rule of law, targeting anyone who  goes against them. And now, they have our ally Canada in their  crosshairs.   This is a commonsense resolution that shows the United States  condemns this behavior and stands with our ally and with the families  of those unjustly detained.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to support it, and I urge my colleagues to do  the same. I thank Mr. McCaul for introducing it, and I yield back the  balance of my time.
