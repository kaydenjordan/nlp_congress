 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 831, and I thank my friend,  the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline) for carrying the ball  on this one.   Madam Speaker, our scenic byways, the national program, has a few  mottos. One of them is: No two experiences are the same. Another one  is: Exploring the heart and soul of America.   Madam Speaker, some of the top or most visited tourist destinations  in the United States are areas like Central Park and other areas of  Manhattan. You have Las Vegas, our own Union Station, Disneyland,  Disney World, and the Golden Gate Bridge.                                time  1245    But some of the real experiences in America are in some of these more  scenic areas, and we have such extraordinary treasures in our country.  There is much more to America.   By reopening the scenic byways designations, we are giving access to,  we are bringing attention to some of these great places, some of these  great experiences in helping to highlight those and bring tourists to  those areas.   In my home State of Louisiana, we have two right now. Number one, we  have the Louisiana Great River Road, a scenic byway which goes along  the length of the Mississippi River, through my hometown of Baton  Rouge; and, also, the Wetlands Cultural Byway that goes through our  wetland areas in south Louisiana's Sportsman's Paradise.   Madam Speaker, it really is just incredible. Years ago, the  Department of Tourism in Louisiana came up with a motto saying, ``the  Atchafalaya Basin, America's Foreign Country,'' and I really think that  applies to much of south Louisiana, which is home and where I  represent. It is such a unique place in terms of the food, the culture,  the people. We need to bring more attention to some of these treasures  that America has.   I thank, again, my friend from Rhode Island, for carrying the ball on  this.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Rodney Davis).    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of  my time.
