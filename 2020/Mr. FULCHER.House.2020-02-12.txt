 Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in opposition to H.R. 2546. Regardless of what the House does,  this bill is not going to be signed into law, and I find it only fair  to explain why.   This package of bills is based on an ideological thought process that  has always failed and is going to continue to fail. It will fail  because this will add collectively about 1.5 million new wilderness  acres. Yes, that is 1.5 million. Although we already have about 111  million, this is going to add another 1.5 million.   This bill will fail because the sponsors think they are protecting  this land. In truth, the opposite is true. This bill will fail because  unmanaged land equals fuel load. Fuel load equals wildfire.   Mr. Chairman, according to the Insurance Information Institute, over  the last 5 years, an average of 7.86 million acres per year has burned  in the United States. According to the Congressional Research Service,  about 78 percent of that is on public land.   The wilderness designation is the most vulnerable public land there  is. More wilderness equals more fire. More fire equals more carbon,  somewhere in the region of about 40 tons per acre when a wildfire  burns.   And it gets worse. If a forest burns, that is God's best tool for  absorbing greenhouse gases, and that is destroyed. That is like taking  out your lungs.   Mr. Chairman, I can't count the number of times that I have heard the  term ``climate change'' since I have taken office. The same people  sponsoring these bills, the climate change fighters, are fighting to  increase one of the most major causes of just that.   So, yes, this bill will get stalled. It may pass the House, but it  will fail. And all this land happens to be in the west, Colorado,  Washington, California. It is easy if you are from Connecticut or New  York or some other eastern State to vote for a 1.5-million-acre  wilderness designation somewhere in the western U.S. and then not have  to explain to constituents the real impact. You can go home and say I  expanded wilderness, saved all this land.   Well, guess what, it does impact your constituents and here is why:   Creation of wilderness, scenic rivers, and monuments is a creation of  another Federal dependent. Disease and fire are inevitable on these  lands. Those of us who live in those States or surrounding States, we  are trying to govern in those States, and under these designations, you  just can't touch it until there is a fire, and then you have to fight  it. Those States that are helping make this decision, your constituents  are subsidizing us.   Now, the Senate and the President know that this is not right. The  Senate and the President know that having 47 States in this case decide  what happens in three is not right, so they will stall this bill. I am  simply hoping to raise the truth in this situation in a way that will  at least make people think. I am not naive about what is going to  happen with this bill.   This package designates about 100,000 acres of national monument  expansion, so I will use the same argument there. Ditto. It also has  843 miles of wild scenic rivers. Just to drive home a point, please  know this, sometimes our fish need some human help, and this  designation will prevent that. Sometimes our fires create devastating  silt flow into our waterways, and that would need some human help, but  we won't be able to do it under these circumstances.   Massive new management burdens on a Federal Government already $2.3  trillion in debt. Mr. Chairman, our Federal  [[Page H1060]]  Government is in over its head already. We can't afford to manage what  we have already got, so we don't.   This is the wrong bill for the West. It is the wrong bill for Idaho.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from California (Mr. LaMalfa).    Madam Chairman, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Colorado (Mr. Lamborn).    Madam Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. McClintock).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Arizona (Mr. Gosar).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Minnesota (Mr. Stauber).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Utah (Mr. Bishop).    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Chairman, it was alluded to once, but I want to underscore that  passage of this would add massive new burdens on Federal agencies. We  need to be using those resources to better manage what we have already  got as public land and public resources.   As a reminder, we are $2.3 billion in debt. What that means is the  Federal Government is way over its head. We can't afford to manage  land, and we can't afford to take care of it.   So guess what?   It doesn't do it. Then we all pay, typically, when things go on fire.   Mr. Chairman, in my State of Idaho, because of all that massive  amount of Federal land, we are really more like tenants than we are  landlords. But to make an analogy, our landlord can't afford to fix a  broken roof. That is what we have got with responsibility on these  government agencies unable to take care of these resources.   Mr. Chairman, you have heard testimony from my colleagues that many  of the local communities impacted have raised significant concerns  ranging from loss of access, recreation, elimination of constructive  and wise management, and threats to rural economies. In addition to the  concerns and opposition raised by local stakeholders and counties, some  of the provisions in the package are opposed by the actual Members who  represent the areas affected. It is troubling.   This effort is also funded in part by some special interest groups,  and they sometimes will call themselves environmentalists. To those  people, I just want to communicate: I live in this area. All too often  you don't. We are the real environmentalists because we take care of a  fabulous resource.   Public lands decisions should be made with local collaboration and  input. This set of bills does not do it. They have real consequences on  real people. Sound, proven, and scientific management are critical.   Mr. Chairman, God gave us a fabulous resource here, but he also gave  us a brain. We need to use our brain.   Now, I am not naive. I know my colleagues across the aisle have got  to vote for this thing. Part of that is that some people's DNA says  that wilderness is good and human involvement is bad.   I would just close by saying this: Facts are stubborn things. The  first fact is this set of bills is going nowhere.  [[Page H1065]]    The second fact is wise management--that is using our mind--is much  better than stagnating this resource.   Fact number three is when this stalls--and it will--those of us on  this side of the aisle and those of us who live in the West will still  be here asking for your cooperation in working with us.   Mr. Chairman, please don't let pride blind you. Work with us on  putting some intelligence and some wisdom into managing this resource.   Mr. Chairman, I include in the Record a Statement of Administration  Policy recommending a veto of this bill package.                     Statement of Administration Policy   H.R. 2546--Protecting America's Wilderness Act--Rep. DeGette, D-CO, and                             Rep. Neguse, D-CO         The Administration opposes H.R. 2546. This bill would       impose unnecessary and harmful restrictions on more than 2.5       million acres of land in Colorado, California, and Washington       State, including nearly 1.5 million acres in the form of       wilderness designations. These restrictions will greatly       reduce opportunities for multiple uses on these public lands,       limit access to them, and significantly reduce the available       productive acreage in working forests, rendering them more       prone to catastrophic wildfires.        The Administration has expanded access to America's public       lands; increased hunting, fishing, and recreational       opportunities nationwide; and enhanced conservation       stewardship of our vast natural resources. With regard to the       designation of wilderness on public lands, the Administration       generally supports congressional action to resolve wilderness       designation and Wilderness Study Areas (WSA) release issues,       particularly for WSAs that were established more than 30       years ago. Many WSAs were recommended for designation, while       others were recommended as not suitable, with suggestions       that they be returned to agency management to integrate their       other intrinsic values into surrounding land management       plans. The Administration recommends addressing these long       overdue WSA decisions before undertaking potential       designations of new areas that did not meet the criteria       established in the 1964 Wilderness Act when inventories were       completed many years ago.        The Administration strongly believes that before new or       potential wilderness areas or wild and scenic rivers are       designated, it is important to first ensure that such       designation is the most appropriate land management tool for       a given parcel. For this and other reasons, successful       conservation proposals that have incorporated this tool over       the last decade have been more limited in geographic scope       than this bill. It is important to ensure that designating       new wilderness areas on public lands does not unnecessarily       impede public access, limit outdoor recreational       opportunities, or conflict with pre-existing uses.       Unfortunately, a number of the proposals for wilderness       designations in H.R. 2546 fail to follow this successful       model.        While many recreational activities, such as hunting,       fishing, and hiking, are compatible with wilderness       designation, other activities, such as mountain biking and       off-highway vehicle use, are not. Some of the areas proposed       for wilderness designation in H.R. 2546 contain popular       motorized or mechanized recreation areas. In addition,       existing energy development poses inherent challenges for       wilderness designations, creating complex management issues       pertaining to active mining claims and oil and gas leases       within a designated wilderness area. The designations under       this bill could impede future energy and mineral development,       including development that is important to the economic and       national security of the United States.        The Administration is committed to managing public lands as       a good neighbor to the local communities and to the Americans       who live and work in close proximity to them. Engaging local       stakeholders and considering their on-the-ground expertise       are critical steps in making decisions about public lands       management, and local communities have concerns that many       aspects of H.R. 2546 would produce negative effects for their       citizens and their economies.        The Administration is willing to work with Congress to make       the necessary improvements to this bill if it is considered       further. If H.R. 2546 were presented to the President in its       current form, however, his advisors would recommend that he       veto it.     Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Will the gentleman yield?    Mr. Chairman, I just want to make a comment. We haven't  been shy so far today over here on criticizing where we see issues. I  just wanted to communicate with the gentleman that, in this case, I  also want to point out the positive things.   I support the gentleman's amendment, and I commend him for bringing  that forward.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition, although I am  not opposed to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, as stated, this amendment allows the  Secretary of the Interior or the Secretary of Agriculture to manage for  fire, insects, or disease the wilderness areas designated by this act.  Again, I am not opposed to that, but I just want to point out in real  life what really happens.   Many wilderness areas are overgrown and suffer from insect  infestations. We have already talked about that. That contributes  significantly to uncontrollable wildfires that really don't respect  manmade boundaries very well.   In wilderness areas, the reality is that fires are allowed to  continue, and they are only suppressed once they leave that wilderness  boundary. That is a particular bummer for wildlife. We haven't talked  about what happens in those situations, that wildlife is often  decimated by this type of activity.   The other thing I just want to point out is that mechanized fire  mitigation tools are banned in wilderness areas for anybody, including  the Department of the Interior, Department of Agriculture, or the  Forest Service. That is another thing that is bothersome about all of  this is that, when we make these designations, we throw out the  commonsense ability to use appropriate tools when there are problems.   Again, we are in support of this amendment, but it will do nothing to  improve the conditions in these wilderness areas.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to claim the time  in opposition to the amendment, although I am not opposed to it.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this amendment.   It is a simple study. We don't know what the cost is, but I want to  use that comment to correct myself previously. I said that the Federal  Government is $2.3 trillion in debt. I was off by a decimal there. It  is over $23 trillion.   Wilderness areas are supposed to be ``untrammeled by man, where man  himself is a visitor who does not remain.''   It is true that wildfires in wilderness areas definitely increase  flood risk, and perhaps that points out an underlying flaw in the  underlying bill, of course, and that is that there are wilderness areas  too close to where residences are.   But, again, the study is okay. The amendment is okay. I think it does  identify one of the 992 flaws in this underlying bill, which is that  wilderness is too close to residential areas.   And that 992, Mr. Chairman, is an estimate.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
