 I thank my colleague, and I thank both of my colleagues  for their very, very powerful remarks.  [[Page S693]]                             Nomination of Daniel I. Werfel    Madam President, the Senate this afternoon is going to vote on the  nomination of Mr. Danny Werfel to serve as the next Commissioner of the  Internal Revenue Service.   I want to say that I believe Mr. Werfel is superbly qualified. He is  a good-government nominee, and I urge my colleagues strongly to support  him.   Mr. Werfel--and this is true of his professional life and at his  hearing--has made it clear that he is going to make sure that the IRS  does its job consistent with the law and that transparency will be a  top priority for his service, which is focused on building trust.   This means a lot because Mr. Werfel has done that at the IRS before.  He stepped up when President Obama asked him to serve as Acting  Commissioner during a very challenging time a decade ago.   Now, the issues were different then. Danny Werfel came in after the  public learned that the IRS had used some very sloppy methods of  monitoring the political activities of tax-exempt groups. In the  Finance Committee, particularly Chairman Hatch and myself, we did an  extensive investigation, and we found that both left-leaning and right- leaning groups were affected.   While Mr. Werfel served in that acting role, he worked effectively  with both sides of the Finance Committee. He helped right the ship and  improve confidence in the IRS.   The late-Senator Hatch, who was certainly conservative but somebody  who always valued fairness and professionalism, spoke to me several  times and to our colleagues about his high regard for Danny Werfel. In  my view, that is a big reason why Danny Werfel has bipartisan support  today.   I have a few comments on the big initiatives he is going to lead when  he is confirmed.   After a decade of Republican budget cuts, the Inflation Reduction Act  finally gave the IRS the resources it needs to go after tax cheating by  too many of the very wealthy and multinational corporations, and it is  in a position to improve customer service for everybody else, the vast  majority of Americans who follow the law.   I will start with customer service, where the IRS is making  significant improvements. Let's go back a few years when the IRS was  able to answer only 11 percent of the phone calls it was receiving. In  2022, it was 13 percent. This time last year, there was a backlog of 24  million unresolved tax returns. As of a few days ago, the IRS was  answering 90 percent of phone calls. It has processed more than 99  percent of the returns filed so far this season. And the IRS has cut  the backlog of individual returns by 92 percent.   Now, they have achieved that by spending about 1 percent of the IRA  funding. In my view, that is a record that we ought to put a lot of  focus on because, if it continues, it will be an historic return on  investment. We expect it to continue. We are counting on Mr. Werfel to  maintain that progress.   The long-term initiative is also stepping up the fight against,  unfortunately, the fact that there are too many of those wealthy tax  cheats and scofflaw corporations that rip off American taxpayers too  easily today, and the Republican budget cuts over the years resulted in  a double standard in tax enforcement. The IRS' ability to go after  sophisticated wealthy tax cheats, who are employing armies of lawyers  and accountants, was severely limited for years. The burden of tax  audits shifted far too heavily onto working people and the middle  class.   The reason that was the case is that for working people in Wisconsin  and Oregon--nurses and firefighters and teachers--the government has  most of the information about their lives. So it is very  straightforward, if there is something to question there.   The wealthy tax cheats use their accountants and the lawyers to pay  taxes very differently. Billionaires tend, to a great extent, to pay  little or nothing for years on end because they structure their affairs  to knock out their annual income.   Democrats have made clear from the very beginning that this isn't  about increasing audits of people with incomes under $400,000. In fact,  we wrote that limitation into the Inflation Reduction Act.   Republicans struck the language from the bill during the debate.  Nevertheless, Secretary Yellen has ensured the Congress and everyone  concerned know that the Treasury will stand by that commitment. The  plan laying out how the IRA funding will be used is in the works.   I want to be clear this afternoon because I have been asked about  this. Colleagues on the Finance Committee, of both political parties,  are insisting that we get that report on how the funds are going to be  used--that we get it soon.   Frankly, that is one of the reasons to support Danny Werfel this  afternoon, because he is experienced in this deal. He stepped in for  President Obama. We are convinced that he is going to follow that  directive and focus on getting us the plan and ensure that the focus is  on better service and on wealthy tax cheats and multinational  corporations paying their fair share.   I think he is going to handle his position in a way that is  transparent. He made it clear that he would be open to talking to  Senators on both sides of the aisle and that he will strongly favor  protections for confidentiality of taxpayer data. That is the kind of  good-government approach that both sides of the aisle should support.   This is a highly qualified, highly experienced nominee. He is the  right choice to lead the IRS. He has earned bipartisan support. A  number of our colleagues, both in the committee and here on the floor  on both sides of the aisle, support him. I would just urge my  colleagues, this afternoon--I think we will vote in a couple of hours-- to strongly support his nomination.                     Remembering Bill and Dottie Schonely    Madam President, I want to rise today on behalf of all the people  that I have the honor to represent to honor the late Bill Schonely, the  Portland Trail Blazers' radio voice for the better part of three  decades, and his late wife Dottie.   Bill passed in January, leaving a timeless legacy for all of us  Blazer fans in ``Rip City,'' the name that Bill coined for my hometown.   Dottie passed last month, leaving her own legacy as an accomplished  woman who radiated smarts and kindness to everybody she met in Oregon.   Bill and Dottie were the ultimate teammates, as the ``First Couple of  Rip City.'' So perhaps it is fitting they could not be separated for  long.   In fact, when Bill and I spoke last, before his passing in January,  he made sure to ask me if I was doing my level best to protect Social  Security. I have kept the message on my phone with his resonating voice  saying: Ron, what are you doing to protect Social Security and the Gray  Panthers? I am really concerned about it. And make sure you also do it  for Dottie as well.   That will be on my phone forever.   Like storied broadcasters Johnny Most for the Boston Celtics fans or  Chick Hearn for Los Angeles Lakers fans, my friend Bill was much more  than an NBA play-by-play guy for us Trail Blazers fans in Portland and  throughout Oregon. As the Blazers' first broadcaster, starting with the  team's inaugural season in 1970--that was a world long before ESPN or  even before the team's games aired on local TV--Bill became the  soundtrack for generations of Portland fans. He connected our State's  first big-league franchise with Oregonians in every nook and cranny of  Oregon.   I have logged lots of miles getting around Oregon for 1,040 open-to- all townhall meetings. In fact, I have got two more scheduled this  weekend in Jefferson and Deschutes Counties in Central Oregon. But I  bet Bill covered just as many miles as the Blazers' ambassador in every  part of Oregon.   I can't tell you how many times I would show up at a radio station in  a small Oregon town--you know, there are lots of those kinds of towns  in Wisconsin--and I would see a photo of Bill there, from back in the  day, when he was on a local golf course or some local community  function. And any elected official in Oregon will tell you how  fortunate we were that Bill Schonely never ran against any of us.   In addition to coining the phrase ``Rip City,'' which is forever tied  with my hometown, Bill had an expansive basketball lexicon in his  unofficial role as professor of basketball English for Blazers fans.   Unlike me, he had a baritone voice, and he taught all of us how  rebounders  [[Page S694]]  ``climbed the golden ladder'' and how point guards dribbled ``lickety  brindle up the middle.'' As a former player myself, I always nodded my  head in agreement whenever Bill would intone, pausing theatrically with  each word, ``You've got to make your free throws.''   So as Rip City prepares to say good-bye to Bill and Dottie at a  public memorial service in Portland, in which I will be at on Monday  the 13th, I will close with this:   Oregon is said to have ``Seven Wonders,'' including Mount Hood and  Crater Lake. In my scorebook and the scorebooks of Blazer fans, ``The  Schonz'' and Dottie are our State's ``Eighth Wonder.''   So today, on behalf of all Oregonians, I extend my condolences to all  Bill and Dottie's loved ones. I will always remember both with a smile  and be forever grateful that they leave so many wonderful memories as  part of their unforgettable legacy for our community.   On behalf of all Oregonians, today, I close by simply saying: Thank  you, Bill and Dottie Schonely.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I rise in strong support of the Women's  Health Protection Act.   This legislation needs to be a centerpiece in the battle to defend  privacy rights in America. This is the third week I have stood on the  Senate floor to talk about this extraordinary assault on privacy and  bodily independence that is taking place in America, and it started, of  course, with the horrendous Dobbs decision.   When that decision came down, Republicans all over America said that  this was going to be a matter of State's rights. They weren't telling  the truth to the American people.   Shortly after the decision, there was a full-court press by  Republicans at the local level, State level, and, yes, the national  level to claw back the rights of women and deny access to reproductive  care. Months after the Dobbs decision, a bill to enact a 6-week  abortion ban, to ban abortion before most women even know they are  pregnant, was introduced in this body.   That was a national ban--every single State--every single State. So  much for State's rights.   Anti-abortion activists are not only working Senate Republicans, they  are working the court system as well. I call it court washing. It goes  way beyond the issue--and I know we have got an expert lawyer in the  Chair. It goes way beyond so-called judge shopping that everybody has  heard about in the past. It is not simply a matter of looking at a  judge's long record of soundly reasoned opinions and hoping for an  outcome.   Republicans--particularly talking about this Texas case, this one in  Amarillo, TX. Republicans picked him because he was a lifelong  rightwing activist who was planted in a district court to deliver the  decision they wanted, the verdict that they have been scheming to  deliver. We are talking about banning mifepristone nationwide, a drug  approved by the Food and Drug Administration. This is something I care  about deeply because I held the first congressional hearing on the role  of the FDA, particularly with  [[Page S706]]  mifepristone. It has been safe and effective, and it has been the law  of the land for years and years. If you throw that out, you take away  women's independence, and the government puts itself front and center  in the exam room and in the private decisions about whether and when to  start a family.    As women grapple with restrictive State laws that take away their  right to privacy and threaten their health, they are also facing a  crisis of digital privacy and--what I call--the threat of uterus  surveillance.   We have long been concerned about location data leaching from phone  apps and how ripe for abuse it is. In States where extremists have  restricted or banned abortion, the whole issue of women having their  personal data weaponized against them is now front and center. Shady  data brokers have already tracked women to and from Planned Parenthood  health centers and have sold their information, basically, to anybody  who has got a credit card. In States where abortion is illegal,  anything women say or read online can be used against them. Researching  birth control online, updating a period tracking app, or even carrying  a phone into a doctor's office may become weaponized against you. It  could be evidence for the prosecution--the most personal and private  data about women's bodies and their health. Just imagine how much worse  it could get if more States pass draconian laws or Republicans get  their nationwide ban.   That is why we are here to pass this legislation: to ensure that  every woman in every State is in a position to make private medical  decisions, where that woman is in the driver's seat with respect to her  privacy and her independence. To do otherwise is going to keep  healthcare providers from doing their jobs. To do otherwise is going to  mean more delaying care for women and more bullying pharmacies out of  providing medications that are completely legal and FDA-approved.   These providers ought to be able to do their jobs based on science.  That is what the FDA decision was all about. It wasn't a political  decision. It wasn't made here on the floor of the U.S. Senate and  having people go back and forth about their opinions. It was an FDA  decision based on science. These policies are common sense, and they  are popular.   I am going to close with just a couple of quick points.   Once women lose the ability to make private healthcare choices about  their reproductive healthcare, I think we ought to make sure everybody  understands that there will be women who will die.   I think we need to understand that what this is about is whether  freedom is going to mean the same thing for women as it does for men.  Women do not have the same privacy rights right now. They don't have  the same freedom. If women are subjected to uterus surveillance, they  don't have true freedom. If Republican politicians dictate what goes on  in an exam room, they don't have true freedom. If women can't control  their own bodies and make their own decisions about when and whether to  get pregnant, they don't have true freedom. If women are forced to give  birth--and in some cases, Republicans want to force women to give birth  even after cases of rape and incest--those women do not have true  freedom.   So if there is one word--one word--that this debate is all about for  women as to what is at stake, that one word is ``freedom,'' and our  legislation ensures they will have it. I urge colleagues to support it.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, I would ask unanimous consent that the  following members of my team be granted floor privileges for the  remainder of the Congress: Marta Silva, Sophie Song, Robert Walsh,  Jacob Medvitz, and Veronique Bourassa.
