 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks on the  subject of my Special Order hour.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from the great  State of Louisiana (Mr. Richmond), who is the chairman of the  Congressional Black Caucus.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the chair of the Congressional  Black Caucus, my friend and colleague, the Honorable Cedric Richmond,  for his leadership in our caucus as well as his continued fight on the  issues impacting Black Americans and other minority communities in  underserved American communities in this great Nation.   I would also like to thank my colleague, the Honorable Marc Veasey of  Texas, for joining me and sharing this evening's Special Order hour and  my many colleagues of the Congressional Black Caucus who are here to  speak on this most important issue. Mr. Speaker, we are here tonight as  Representatives of America's minority communities to respond directly  to President Trump's inaugural address, and specifically to his new  deal for African Americans.   During President Trump's campaign, he promised to address issues  confronting African Americans, and he gave a 10-point plan outlining  that. We have studiously reviewed the issues outlined in the plan and  have concrete suggestions for him in accomplishing those goals.   While I acknowledge President Trump's willingness to confront these  issues, I find the points in his new deal do not go far enough in  substance to adequately address the needs of African American  communities and rely heavily on assumptions that African American  communities are primarily in the inner cities. Just as the chairman  spoke of earlier this evening, let's not continue with this fallacy and  stereotyping of the dynamic diversity of African Americans in this  country. African Americans live in the Rust Belt. They live in rural  areas across this country, in suburbs, and they live in territories.   My home district of the U.S. Virgin Islands has a population of  100,000 American citizens and permanent residents. It is a majority  minority, and it, too, has experienced the same slow recovery as many  of the economically dispossessed communities across America. The issues  of African Americans cannot be solved in just 10 bullet points directed  to a small portion of the African American community.   Mr. Speaker, we are here this evening, in large part, to send a  message, suggestions, thoughts, ideas, and support to President Trump  that, if he is serious about addressing the issues in disadvantaged  communities, it would be wise to tap into the decades of experience  held by the members of this caucus. The answers to those 10 points are  very nuanced, and we have been working on them for decades, and we are  happy to support positive improvements in our underserved communities.   For almost a half century, this caucus has advocated to improve the  lives of millions of Americans in both rural and urban communities-- African Americans and all Americans. The 49 members of this caucus who  sit in both Houses of Congress and the members before us tonight have  offered policy solutions for decades that would help not only those  African American communities, but underserved areas nationwide.                                time  2030    We will continue to lead by offering solutions to improve the lives  of all Americans in search of a better opportunity. We are hopeful to  give you an idea of some of those this evening.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Veasey), my  able colleague, for his remarks on this matter.    I appreciate the remarks that the gentleman has given,  particularly about the grim view that was given of African Americans  during the inauguration that didn't really expound on the great  diversity that is here.   We have someone from another part of our country who is now going to  speak. I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lee), one of our  senior great leaders of the Congressional Black Caucus, former  chairwoman of the Caucus from California, who is going to give us her  remarks and her thoughts on this topic this evening.    Mr. Speaker, I was really very interested in the  discussion the gentlewoman had and about the work that you have done to  alleviate poverty both in the Democratic Caucus as well as the  Congressional Black Caucus, particularly her words about not allowing  immigration to be divisive and used as a means to separate Americans  and not being able to realize the American Dream. America is big enough  to have immigrants under a comprehensive immigration plan that will  allow all of us to be able to lift it up.   I want to thank the gentlewoman for her leadership on that and  particularly the fight that she has been fighting for so many years  when it comes to alleviating poverty in the United States.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs.  Lawrence), but more specifically from the great city of Detroit, where  she has been a strong voice for the people of Detroit, a strong voice  for surrounding areas, and her work on Flint, Michigan, and its water  crisis, and other areas of people who are in the inner city that need  support in so many areas, to speak on the issues that are the topic for  today.    I thank the gentlewoman for those words and thoughts on  these issues.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee),  who has been a stalwart for social justice, a stalwart on the Judiciary  Committee, and is going to speak on the issue that is here before us  this evening, the CBC Special Order hour, ``A Response to President  Trump's Inaugural Address and New Deal for African Americans.''  [[Page H602]]         I thank the Congresswoman from Texas. I want to thank  her for all the work she has been doing not just in terms of  incarceration reform, but pointing out to us that the safety of  children also includes gun violence in their communities. That is so  very important. And, of course, the real tireless work that she has  done in terms of juvenile justice.   Mr. Speaker, Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee has been at the  forefront of changing the dynamic in how we see juveniles and the  things that lead them into incarceration or lead them into problems  with the law, and the solutions that are on the table. This is what we  are speaking about this evening, giving real solutions and concrete  legislation that has already been drafted and worked on by members of  the Congressional Black Caucus that President Trump can use in carrying  out the 10-point plan that he has.   I yield to the Congresswoman from Wisconsin (Ms. Moore), who also  would like to speak on this topic and who has been doing tireless work  in her district of Wisconsin and throughout the United States for  communities, for children, for working mothers, for women who are  attempting to move ahead, to receive a part of the economic justice,  who has really been concerned about so many of the things that we are  talking about this evening.  [[Page H603]]    I yield to her to speak to us this evening.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania  (Mr. Evans) and ask if he has additional thoughts on this after having  that colloquy with Ms. Moore.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Pennsylvania,  Dwight Evans. I know that he is new to this Congress, but he has worked  for so many years on the issues that we are talking about today. I look  forward to our continued collaboration in supporting so many  communities throughout our country.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Mrs. Beatty), who  has been a stalwart voice on so many of the issues that the  Congressional Black Caucus has brought here this evening and is here,  Mr. Speaker, to share some of her thoughts on the things that have been  spoken about earlier today.    I thank the gentlewoman.  [[Page H605]]    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    I thank the gentlewoman.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Veasey).    And education and workforce development.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 9 o'clock and 22 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Tuesday, January 24, 2017, at 10 a.m. for morning-hour debate.                            ____________________
