 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Christene Moss  for 29 years of dedicated service to our community as a trustee on the  Fort Worth Independent School District Board of Education.   Christene has dedicated her time on the board to improving children's  literacy by working with parents and teachers to close the achievement  gap and pushing to create a facility for homeless students.   Christene, who is from Lake Como, Texas, now living in Carver Heights  in the Stop Six community, spearheaded projects for the board of  education, including creating the Fort Worth ISD's first community  forum and working to reinstate music and art programs into the school  curriculum.   In 2013, she also made history becoming the board's first Black  president. For years, Christene has been an active member of the Texas  Caucus of Black School Board Members where she served as president and  helped to mentor the next generation of Black leaders.   Her passion for the community will be enshrined in our neighborhood  through the children's library, and elementary school named in her  honor.   We will miss Christene's service on the board, but we are very  grateful for her decades of service and the legacy that she has left  behind for students in Fort Worth.   We wish her the very best as she moves on to the next chapter in her  life.  [[Page H3119]]                                ____________________
