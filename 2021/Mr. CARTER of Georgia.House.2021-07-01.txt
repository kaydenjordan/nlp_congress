 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember and  honor the life of Mr. Vernon Dee Martin of St. Simons Island, Georgia,  who peacefully passed away on June 12 at the age of 78.   Vernon was born in Oklahoma and moved to St. Simons Island in 1969,  after accepting a position with the Coastal Georgia Regional  Development Commission. At the time, he would become the youngest  executive director of a regional agency in the United States. It is at  the Coastal Georgia Regional Development Commission that I met Vernon,  as I served as the chair of that commission during the time that he was  executive director.   Some of Vernon's accomplishments include securing the Federal Law  Enforcement Center in Brunswick and the Kings Bay Naval Submarine Base  in Camden County. He also proudly served in the Georgia Army and  Georgia Air National Guard for 40 years, retiring as a colonel.   Through every position he had, he worked to better his community and  improve the lives of others. One cannot visit Georgia's First  Congressional District without seeing the profound impacts Vernon made  for his community.    My thoughts and prayers are with his family, friends, and all who  knew him during this most difficult time.                            ____________________
