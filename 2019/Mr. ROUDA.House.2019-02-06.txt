 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in response to yesterday's  address by the President to this body.   The guests the President invited represented America's finest hours  and most compelling stories. They serve as a reminder of a history much  larger than any individual among us and as an invitation to recommit to  our values and promises to our people.   But last night, the President chose to invoke a national unity that  he has made every effort to fray. It has been his cynical and sinister  political strategy to divide our country and burn bridges among us.   The State of the Union is a platform for the President to inject  urgency into the problems the country faces. As a member of the  Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, I am encouraged that he  has indicated he will sign bipartisan infrastructure legislation, and I  am prepared to work with all Members to do so serving our country and  communities.   The President also raised the specter of declaring a national  emergency to build a monument to his ego, but the real national  emergency is the looming climate crisis. As seas rise, fires burn, and  the weather becomes more extreme, the people of Orange County and  across our country are already suffering its effects, and action from  the executive branch can no longer wait--let alone denial of climate  change altogether.   He warned us not to cross him, to abandon our constitutional duty to  exercise oversight and shine a light on the practices of the executive  branch. Congress will not be intimidated.   We should not wait for nor should we expect the President to lead an  agenda for the people, but this Congress can move forward with a  seriousness befitting the problems of our time and work with one  another regardless of party to improve the lives of the people who  trusted us to represent them.                            ____________________
