 Mr. Speaker, during the long, dark, lamentable days  of World War II, Serbians and Americans forged a bond in a secret  mission that remained classified for almost 60 years.   What was known as Operation Halyard became the largest rescue  operation of American airmen in history. It would not have been  possible without the courage of the Serbian people.   In 1944, as the Allies advanced into fortress Europe, American  bombers based in southern Italy began to strike Germany's vital oil  supplies in Romania. The 15th Air Force launched nearly 20,000 sorties  into Eastern Europe to degrade Hitler's war machine. To do this, they  had to fly over Nazi-occupied Yugoslavia. As many as 1,500 pilots and  airmen were shot down during these dangerous flights.   Serbians who had been resisting German forces since 1941 risked their  own lives to rescue American aircrews and hide them from patrolling  Nazis. One of them was Serbian George Dudich, the father of Elaine  Dudich, my chief of staff when I was a judge in Texas.   For months, George Dudich and the other Serbians aided downed  Americans, caring for and protecting the pilots, and then smuggling the  aircrews back to Allied lines.   By August 1944, hundreds of other downed aircrews were being  sheltered by the Serbian guerillas. The OSS, the predecessor to the  CIA, devised a plan to evacuate the Allied pilots in a daring mission  coordinated with the Serbian resistance.   On August 10, unarmed American C-47s flew numerous sorties deep into  enemy territory and landed at an improvised airfield built and  protected by local Serbians near the village of Pranjani. By the 18th,  more than 500 Allied airmen had been secretly rescued and flown back to  Italy.   Here on this poster you see the Serbian resistance, along with  American aircrews that had been downed, moving them to hiding from the  Nazis that were patrolling the areas. For over 60 years, this bold,  unbelievable secret operation was kept classified.   Our alliance with Serbia and the Serbian people goes back even  further to the First World War. One hundred years ago, Serbia stood up  to the aggression from the larger Austrian-Hungarian empire. We should  admire such defiance against overwhelming odds.   Serbia's stand against tyranny also set events in motion that would  lead the U.S. to take up the cause of freedom in Europe in World War I.  That common devotion to liberty and the spirit of the Halyard mission  still lives today with the close ties between the United States and  Serbia.   As was the case in both World Wars, Serbia and the United States  still face shared threats. We work together now to preserve each  others' security. Serbian soldiers serve along with U.S. forces in  fighting terrorism in Afghanistan, and Serbia is a partner in keeping  terrorism from spreading in Serbia and in Europe.   However, Russian propaganda efforts in the country are particularly  strong and anti-Western. We must be vigilant to thwart the Kremlin's  efforts to poison our relationship with Serbia.   Fortunately, Serbia's integration into the West has continued to move  in spite of Russian disinformation. In 2006, Serbia joined NATO's  Partnership for Peace and, in 2015, signed an Individual Partnership  Action Plan with the alliance to strengthen cooperation.   Serbia has no stronger supporter for increased integration with the  EuroAtlantic community than the United States. So for more than 100  years, we have been friends with the Serbian people. And as co-chair of  the Serbian Caucus, along with the gentleman from Missouri (Mr.  Cleaver), I want to welcome Serbian Ambassador Matkovic and his staff  to the House Chamber today.   With our shared events in Operation Halyard, our combined history,  and our fight for freedom, the American people are forever grateful for  those Serbs who came to America's rescue during those bleak days of  World War II.   And that is just the way it is.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, sitting a mere 20 feet away from the  man that raped and trafficked her daughter, Jennifer waited anxiously  in the courtroom as the judge prepared to announce the sentence.   The amount of pain and turmoil this criminal inflicted on her family  could never be undone.   A few years ago, this man pulled up alongside Jennifer's daughter as  she walked down the street. He lured the 15-year-old into his car, and  he sexually assaulted her. He then took her to a motel and began  forcing her to have sex with numerous men for money. He posted an ad  about her online offering buyers a chance to ``play with innocence.''  He literally stole her youth, her happiness, and he sold her to the  highest bidder.   When Jennifer finally heard the judge's sentence, she wept with tears  of joy--180 years in prison for the trafficker, from the right-thinking  judge.   Let the word get out to deviants and traffickers and buyers: Our  children are not for sale. There is a price to pay for the trafficker  who sells our kids.   And that is just the way it is.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me  time. I want to thank him and the ranking member for moving this  legislation forward.   Mr. Speaker, Iran is the number one state sponsor of terrorism in the  whole world. Out of 195 countries, they are the worst country in the  world when it comes to exporting terrorism.   The mullahs in Tehran not only support worldwide terrorist groups,  terrorist groups that have American blood on their hands, they resort  to terrorist tactics to extort and blackmail the American people.   For decades, Iran has held American citizens in prisons unlawfully.  They detain these Americans under the charge of espionage. We all know  that this is just a ploy to extract concessions from the United States.   Earlier this month, we learned that Iran threw another American  citizen in jail last year. This time it was a Princeton Ph.D. student  conducting research in Iran for his dissertation. This student is now  being held in Iran's most notorious prison, Evin Prison. If anyone  thought that Iran was going to moderate as a result of the nuclear  deal, these ongoing unlawful detentions are evidence to the contrary.   Iran has been emboldened, and there is no indication they will stop  this tactic of terror. We need to get the attention of the barbaric  mullahs that seem to take delight in imprisoning Americans and even  Iranian citizens for political reasons.   We know at least eight Americans currently languish in Iranian jails.  Iran is not content with just holding these Americans. They are  actively working to extract payments and concessions from the United  States, like sanctions relief, as a condition for their release. This  is old-fashioned textbook extortion.   This resolution will send a clear message to the mullahs: Release the  Americans and return them to their homes. Let the American hostages go.   I was glad to see the new sanctions imposed by the Treasury in April  on the Tehran Prisons Organization. More pressure is needed by our  country.   I urge the administration to spare no effort to secure the release of  American hostages. These hostages have been held by Iran too long, and  Iran has proven that they do not respond very well to carrots. Since we  gave away the courthouse and the mineral rights in the Iranian deal,  maybe it is time we pull out the stick. As Teddy Roosevelt said:  ``Speak softly, and carry a big stick.''   And that is just the way it is.    Will the gentleman yield?    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding  and for filing this amendment.   Mr. Chairman, the VA has been using taxpayer dollars to have  experiments on dogs. It is hard to believe that would occur in our  culture today.   I have had three Dalmatians over the years, and I know there are a  lot of other people who have dogs. They have service dogs that are used  by our vets and our agencies. And the thought that our Veterans  Administration would go ahead and torture dogs in the name of science  and experiments is not acceptable; it is just not.   If citizens committed these acts that the VA is committing on dogs,  under most laws, that would be animal cruelty. They could be prosecuted  and go to jail. But because it is the VA, because it is a government  agency, that doesn't apply.   But we do want the agency to stop torturing dogs in the name of  science. There are better ways that they can spend the money, better  ways they can figure out how to help our veterans besides taking  careless actions against, as my friend from Virginia said, man's best  friend. And if it's going to be man's best friend, maybe we shouldn't  be, or we should not be torturing those dogs for any reason. So I  support the amendment.
