 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the  bipartisan Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 Reform Act,  introduced by the House Administration chairman, Mr. Harper, and the  ranking member, Mr. Brady.   I also want to thank my colleagues who have helped lead the effort,  Representative Byrne and Representative Speier, along with my  colleague, the ranking member of the House Ethics Committee,  Representative Deutch.   Current law, the CAA, as we call it, was enacted over 20 years ago,  and it has become so outdated. The proposed reforms in this CAA Reform  Act work to improve our response to harassment and discrimination so  that allegations of wrongdoing can be investigated swifter, fairer, and  in a more efficient manner. This legislation prioritizes protecting the  victims while ensuring due process for the accused.   Congress must be a force for justice in order to ensure all employees  have a safe workplace environment that is free of sexual harassment or  discrimination of any kind, because it is completely unacceptable to be  subjected to harassment or discrimination of any kind at any workplace  in our country.   The element of the CAA that allowed for silencing of victims and  spending taxpayer dollars to settle claims for Members of Congress must  be changed.   The CAA Reform Act will increase transparency and accountability in  Congress and create a more victim-friendly process. It ensures sexual  harassment and discrimination settlements made, moving forward, will no  longer be secret.   This bill will protect taxpayer dollars by requiring Members of  Congress who have an award or judgment against them for harassment to  personally pay for any settlement.   As chairwoman of the House Ethics Committee, I am proud to work  alongside the ranking member, Representative Deutch, on this important,  bipartisan legislation. I want to thank our colleagues who worked to  ensure that, in order for the Ethics Committee to fulfill its  obligation of the House to investigate and potentially discipline  Members and staff, now the committee must be given information on  potential bad actors. The CAA Reform Act ensures the Ethics Committee  is given that information.                                time  1200    The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.    It provides an automatic referral to the  Ethics Committee upon disposition of claims before the Office of  Congressional Workplace Rights, currently known as the Office of  Compliance, so now the House Ethics Committee can quickly investigate  allegations of wrongdoing while protecting the identity of the accuser  and ensuring due process for the accused.   By supporting this Reform Act, we are showing the Nation that  Congress is taking strong bipartisan action to improve the workplace  called the people's House and the conduct of those who work in it.
