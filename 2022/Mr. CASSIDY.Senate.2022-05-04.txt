 Mr. President, I call up my motion to instruct  conferees, which is at the desk.    Mr. President, the importance of trade agreements is  that everyone follows the rules they agreed to. Mexico is not following  the USMCA.   They have forced the closures or partial closures of dozens of fuel  facilities and have canceled permits for the import and export of  fuels. They are favoring their national industry, PEMEX, and  disadvantaging American companies, including companies building  renewable projects. These actions chill foreign direct investment with  Mexico, hurt American businesses, and undermine climate goals; but  Mexico continues to benefit from the rest of the USMCA.   We wish to be a strong and dependable trade partner with Mexico, but  the USMCA should be honored. The role of the USTR is to represent the  interests of the United States and hold trade partners to their word.  Mexico should respect property rights for U.S. businesses. This should  be a priority for the USTR.   I yield back all time.                                Vote on Motion
