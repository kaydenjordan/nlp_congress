 Madam Speaker, I rise to celebrate the Right to  Contraception Act, which will soon pass the House with the support of  House Democrats.   Women's rights have been under attack for decades. The recent  overturning of Roe v. Wade has sadly provided a roadmap for future  courts to reconsider and overrule the right to contraception and other  fundamental rights.   In fact, Republicans have used this decision as an opening to try to  block or ban contraceptive methods already. But House Democrats won't  stand for this, not under our watch.   Today, we will further protect women and their fundamental rights by  passing the Right to Contraception Act because we trust women. The bill  will protect women's access to birth control because no one should  control women and make their healthcare decisions for them. No one.   We trust women.                            ____________________
