 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize May as Mental  Health Awareness Month. Now, more than ever, we must acknowledge the  mental health crisis facing our Nation, particularly among school-aged  children.   Repercussions from the pandemic and increased social pressure from  social media have led to reports of rapidly rising mental health  struggles.   In my home State of North Carolina, our K through 12 students are  struggling. Last month, I hosted a roundtable with school counselors,  administrators, and teachers to hear firsthand about the challenges  impacting young people. Suicide attempts and youth depression are  rising at alarming rates. Congress must act to address students' mental  health needs.   I am preparing to reintroduce my bipartisan bill, Improving Mental  Health and Wellness in Schools Act, legislation to integrate mental  health education and services into existing wellness policies in  schools.   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation and  taking swift action to address the mental health needs of our students.                            ____________________
