 Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment.   Tonight, I am speaking on behalf of thousands of Virginians who rely  every single day on the Metro. They take it to work. They take it to  school. They take it to see their families.   This cut would hurt their commutes. This cut would eliminate funding  for urgent capital projects, meaning it would impact the safety and  reliability of the system. This cut would be a slight to the Federal  workers, including those who work right here on Capitol Hill and those  who rely on the Metro to get to their jobs so that they can keep our  government functioning, our country safe, and our economy running.    Historically, support for Metro's capital funding has not been  hyperpartisan, and we should not change course right now. That is why I  am proud to stand with members of the Maryland and Virginia delegations  and my colleagues from the District of Columbia in pushing back against  this senseless proposal.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.
