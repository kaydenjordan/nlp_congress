 Mr. Speaker, 2 weeks ago, a human rights activist  in my native homeland of Cuba, Jorge Luis Garcia Perez, better known as  Antunez, was detained in Cuba on his way to the airport. Antunez was  going to speak at an event hosted by Freedom House and Justice Cuba,  right here in D.C., to educate the public on the brutal realities of  what continues to occur every day in Cuba.   But, instead, Raul Castro sent his thugs to detain Antunez and  prevent him from boarding the plane. The regime promised Antunez that  he could travel if he only ``tempered his activism.''   Mr. Speaker, anyone who knows Antunez, who spent many a year in  Castro's jails, knows that he will not abandon his principles, nor  should he ever be forced to do so.   As Antunez always says, ``Ni me callo, ni me voy,'' which means, ``I  won't stay silent and I won't leave.'' He is talking about his activism  in Cuba.   Mr. Speaker, the Castro regime wants to paint a picture that people  on the island are free, that human rights abuses do not exist in Cuba,  but we know better. That is why there continues to be, every day,  arbitrary arrests and beatings to stop dissidents and activists from  speaking out--that is the menu every day--reminding the world that what  these activists want is freedom. That is really what transpires in  Castro's Cuba for dissidents.   Our message to those brave fighters for freedom in Cuba must be that  we are listening to their plight, that we will stand with them in  opposing Castro's evil rule, and that we have not forgotten about them  or their continued fight for freedom and democracy.   So I urge this administration to continue to undo the damage done by  the previous administration and their failed policy toward Cuba. I urge  the administration to offer unequivocal support for the brave Cuban  people, like Antunez. They deserve our unwavering support, and they  deserve our solidarity so that the people of Cuba achieve what they  have been seeking for decades, and it is simple, Mr. Speaker: freedom,  democracy, respect for human rights, respect for the rule of law, free  and open markets, and liberty from communism.   Mr. Speaker, in Cuba, Venezuela, and Nicaragua, leftist dictators  refuse to follow the rule of law, circumventing or ignoring completely  their constitutions in order to maintain their hold in power. This  practice has now spread to Bolivia, where strongman Evo Morales is  taking a page from this playbook.   Less than 2 years ago, in 2016, Morales imposed a constitutional  referendum to eliminate term limits for Presidents so that he could run  for a third term.   But what happened in Bolivia?   The majority of the people said no. They went to the ballot box and  they rejected this by a vote through a referendum.   What did Morales do?   He went to the court system that he has already rigged in his favor  to seek the outcome that he desired. And, sure enough, his spineless  cronies granted him his wish and approved his illegitimate run for a  fourth term, agreeing that it was his human right--the only right,  apparently, that is respected in Bolivia--to run for another term,  ignoring completely the human rights of millions who voted to uphold  their laws under their constitution.   The court's decision last week to lift constitutional limits on  reelection should be disturbing to all of us and should serve as a  wake-up call throughout the hemisphere. If we don't pay attention to  Bolivia, it will soon become another Cuba or another Venezuela--failed  states.    The decision to allow Morales to run for yet another term further  erodes the democratic institutions in that country.   Sadly, this was not the first time that Morales or his thugs have  chipped  [[Page H9630]]  away at Bolivia's democratic foundations in order to remain in power.  In 2013, the constitutional court allowed him to run for a third term,  stating that his first term didn't count--do-over, mulligan--because it  occurred before the 2009 constitution took effect. What a farce.   This was obviously a cynical, political ploy, and should have served  as the harbinger of worse things to come for Bolivia, and indeed it  was, not to mention the ruling falls outside of the court's mandate to  interpret and evaluate compliance with the constitution.   Responsible nations in our hemisphere, Mr. Speaker, must not remain  silent, nor should this esteemed body. We must speak out in the support  of the people of Bolivia to democratically elect their next leader.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in support of the  Bolivian people before there is another crisis of democracy right in  our hemisphere.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Royce and Ranking  [[Page H9646]]  Member Engel for their leadership in bringing this important resolution  to the floor.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Con. Res. 90, condemning the  ethnic cleansing of the Rohingya and calling for an end to the attacks  in Burma and the immediate restoration of access to humanitarian aid. I  am proud to be a cosponsor of this resolution.   I thank our previous speaker, my colleague, Joe Crowley, as well as  our Republican colleague, Steve Chabot, sitting in front of us, for  authoring this measure.   We are seeing condemnations of the atrocities occurring in Burma from  across the world, Mr. Speaker, as well as calls for the nation's de  facto leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, to make greater efforts to stop the  violence there.                                time  1430    Last month, our U.S. administration issued an official determination  that the Burmese military's actions constitute ethnic cleansing, and  rightly so. The atrocities being committed against this ethnic minority  have been well documented and they deserve the utmost condemnation.   The reality on the ground is shocking, Mr. Speaker. Over 600,000 were  forced to flee to neighboring Bangladesh; the systematic massacre, the  rape, the pillaging, all in an effort to eliminate any trace of these  Muslim minorities in Burma.   No one is safe, no Rohingya is safe, yet the world continues to sit  back and watch as these individuals are targeted for extinction and  eradication from the history books.   We as a United States Congress can do more, we must do more, and we  expect responsible nations and responsible actors to do more to end  this persecution.   Last week, Pope Francis met with Aung San Suu Kyi and Burma's top  military commander, delivering the message that these atrocities must  be stopped. The Dalai Lama has spoken out against this systematic  campaign.   Now it is time for us in the U.S. Congress to add our voice and send  a strong message of our own, and this resolution does just that.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman and my good  friend, Ranking Member Eliot Engel, for his hard work. I especially  want to thank the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Lamborn) for offering  this important bill.   Sadly, as we have heard, Mr. Speaker, Taylor Force is the name and  the face of the disgusting and reprehensible practice in place by the  Palestinians that we know as pay to slay.   Taylor Force, as we have heard, was an Eagle Scout, a West Point  graduate, a veteran of two wars, who served our Nation bravely and with  distinction. It was a life cut tragically short at 28 years old, when  he was murdered by a Palestinian terrorist while in Israel.   While the world condemned this attack and while Taylor Force's  friends and family mourn his loss, the Palestinian leaders fail to take  responsibility. No, instead, Abu Mazen and the Palestinian leadership  continue to incite violence, continue to support terror. Because, make  no mistake, Mr. Speaker, as long as the Palestinian Authority or the  PLO--whatever name they want to use--make payments to terrorists, they  are supporting terror.   How can you conclude otherwise?   It is irresponsible and it is shameful to think that the American  taxpayer and the U.S. Government are in any way, shape, or form helping  to support this pay-to-slay program. This is why this act will ensure  that, until pay to slay is ended, we will not be a willing contributor  to the Palestinian scheme. This is just another tool that Congress has  given the administration to use in order to hold the Palestinian  leaders accountable.   However, I do believe that we should not allow for exceptions, not  allow for carve-outs in this important bill, because that flexibility,  sadly, is sometimes used to circumvent the spirit of the law and the  congressional intent.   I would like to remind our body that the administration already has  the tools it needs to withhold assistance to the Palestinian Authority  and the West Bank and Gaza, so we must exercise existing authorities  and send a message to the Palestinians once and for all.   Mr. Speaker, I urge the administration to use all of the tools at its  disposal, to not waive provisions of U.S. law, to not selectively  enforce some laws and apply others. That means ending all assistance to  the Palestinian Authority--all. It means closing the PLO office in D.C.  until pay to slay has ended and until the Palestinians stop their  incitement and stop their support for terror.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this important and  tragic measure, and I urge the administration to use these tools that  we continue to provide to it. I thank the chairman and the ranking  member for rapidly bringing this important bill to the floor.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for the time, and  I thank the ranking member for those very sweet words.   Mr. Speaker, I echo what Ranking Member Engel said about my trusted  staff director, Eddy Acevedo. This is his last week with us. He starts  Monday with the USAID. He has got the whole weekend to party on. He has  been my partner in all of these battles in favor of freedom and  democracy and against autocratic regimes, which brings us to this bill  before us, Mr. Speaker.   I rise in strong support of this bill, H.R. 2658, the Venezuela  Humanitarian Assistance and Defense of Democratic Governance Act of  2017. I am proud to be, as the chairman said, the Republican lead on  this important legislation.   I have been proud to work side by side with the author of the bill,  our ranking member on the Foreign Affairs Committee, Mr. Eliot Engel,  in putting this bill together. Eliot has been a leading voice in this  legislative body in support of freedom and democracy across the globe,  as has our esteemed chairman. But Eliot has really focused in on this  hemisphere, especially on Venezuela. I want to thank him for his  leadership on this issue.   I also want to thank his trusted adviser sitting two seats away from  him on all Western Hemisphere-related items. Eric Jacobstein is my  buddy from Haiti. We have enjoyed as much as one can enjoy going to an  island nation that needs so much help. The people of Haiti are  beautiful, and it has been a joy to travel with Eric and with Eddy.  Throughout the years, Eric has worked closely with us and with our  office. We work in a bipartisan manner. That is the tone that our  esteemed chairman has set for the committee. Eric and Eliot work that  way as well. Their knowledge and expertise on this topic has been  instrumental to our committee.   The bill before us, Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2658, is simple, it is  straightforward, and it is important. Maduro, like Chavez before him-- two thugs--has turned Venezuela from a once vibrant and thriving nation  into a country on the brink of utter collapse. The results have been  disastrous for the people of Venezuela. There is food shortage, there  is water shortage, and there is a severe lack of medicine and medical  supplies. There is a lack of goods and services everywhere you turn.    The people need to get proper nutrition. They need proper care, but  they can't find it. It is a crisis that Maduro and his thugs have  denied exists because he is eating very well. The other day he was  making a televised public declaration. He opens up the drawer, takes an  empanada, and he is stuffing his face. But the people are starving. But  recognizing it would mean that Chavismo has utterly failed, so they  refuse to recognize this.   So what happens?   The Venezuelan people suffer from severe malnutrition. They are  subject to price controls. It is unbelievable the prices of items  there. If they can ever get the food, if they can ever get the services  they need, then the people can't afford them. They are subject to  substandard and unhygienic conditions. This has led to a sharp rise in  infant mortality, and really mortality rates across the board in  Venezuela have gone up.   In short, the majority of the people in Venezuela are living in  misery. What was once the breadbasket of the whole hemisphere, now the  people don't have food. They are living in misery. The Maduro regime is  not only to blame, but it is ensuring that the humanitarian situation  gets even worse. It was Maduro who ordered the supreme court to block a  law from the opposition that would have helped facilitate humanitarian  aid from NGOs and other international entities. As a result, it is ever  so difficult to get the supplies needed to respond to this crisis into  Venezuela to the people who so desperately need it. That is why, Mr.  Speaker, this bill is so important.                                time  1545    It directs USAID, the institution Eddy will be a partner of in just a  few days, and our great Department of State to develop a plan in order  to determine if and how the U.S. can possibly help with some of the  humanitarian assistance through credible and independent NGOs, or  nongovernmental organizations, that are operating in Venezuela or  neighboring countries to ensure that this assistance does get to the  people who desperately need it.   The bill also directs our Ambassador to the United Nations to use our  full voice, full vote, and full influence of the United States to place  the humanitarian and political crises in Venezuela on the agenda at the  U.N.   Mr. Speaker, this body, alongside our friends in New York at the  U.N., has worked to hold rogue regimes accountable for failing to allow  humanitarian assistance in their countries. Whether it is Syria or  Yemen, this body has spoken in a unified manner that humanitarian  assistance should not be prevented from reaching the people.    But on Venezuela, Mr. Speaker, it seems as if we  hold a different standard, and that is  [[Page H9658]]  unacceptable. For too long, Venezuela has been shielded from criticism  and action at the U.N. by its cronies, like the equally corrupt and  morally reprehensible Castro regime in Cuba.   This is precisely the kind of situation for which the U.N. was  created to respond; yet, to date, the response has been woefully  inadequate and shamefully void of substance.   We have got to lead on this effort, and this bill is what we need.  There are millions of people suffering in Venezuela. We are in a  situation to help.   I would point out to our chairman and the ranking member that we had  some excellent news in the minutes that we have been speaking. The  Senate Foreign Relations Committee approved the nomination of our  former committee chief of staff, Yleem Poblete, for Assistant Secretary  of State for Verification and Compliance. It now goes to the full  Senate. I know that she will be with us on these measures that attack  atrocious regimes and will help alleviate the humanitarian crisis.    Mr. Speaker, I thank our wonderful chairman for  yielding me time. I also thank our ranking member, Eliot Engel for his  hard work. This committee is a model for other committees in the U.S.  House of Representatives. We truly work in a bipartisan manner and it  is because of the leadership of Mr. Royce and Mr. Engel. They set the  pace.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill before us, H. Res. 259,  by my Florida colleague, Congressman Ron DeSantis, who has been very  active in the issue of human rights in our Western Hemisphere. His bill  expresses concern and condemnation over the dire political, economic,  social, and humanitarian crisis that is taking place in Venezuela  today. I am proud to be a cosponsor of this important resolution. I  thank him for his leadership on this issue, on the issue of the lack of  freedom and democracy in my native homeland of Cuba, and what he is  helping the people of Nicaragua achieve in having separation of powers.   Mr. Speaker, there has been a real problem throughout the hemisphere,  and by approving this important measure, which is bipartisan, today,  this body will once again demonstrate that we stand in solidarity with  the people of Venezuela and their fight for justice, freedom, and  democracy.   These are values that we hold so dearly in our country. We take it  for granted that we live in this great country where we can express our  thoughts in this wonderful republic, but in so many places in our very  own hemisphere, Mr. Speaker, they don't have that luxury.   Venezuelans have been deprived of these key values of justice,  freedom, and democracy for far too long, first at the grip of Hugo  Chavez, a failed socialist leader, and now with his handpicked  successor, another failure of a man and a leader, Nicolas Maduro.   The Maduro regime has hijacked all democratic institutions in  Venezuela. It has run the economy so far into the ground that there is  hardly any food or medicine or even basic necessities. Inflation is at  an all-time high and people cannot afford their daily life.   The economic situation is in turmoil. It is heading towards an even  deeper downward spiral because this regime of Nicolas Maduro is corrupt  and is incompetent and they only care about filling their own coffers  and staying in power, no matter what. All the while, the people of  Venezuela continue to suffer.   But this does not seem to trouble Maduro. It does not seem to trouble  his cronies. They are enriching themselves on the suffering of the  people of Venezuela. From this illicit activity, like drug trafficking  and corruption, they are filling their coffers.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, they are even using this humanitarian crisis that they  have created to defraud organizations that are looking to bring much- needed food into the country.   This resolution in front of us, Mr. Speaker, is bipartisan and  strong. It calls on the administration to support the people of  Venezuela, to continue to impose targeted sanctions on those  responsible for the destruction of democratic institutions in  Venezuela.   This resolution also urges important bodies, like the Organization of  American States--and we will have soon a new U.S. Ambassador to that  esteemed institution--to support the principles of the Inter-American  Democratic Charter. It demands a noncorrupt electoral council, as well  as calling for the release of all political prisoners.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. DeSantis for authoring this resolution. I  urge my colleagues to offer their strong support and to join us in  sending a unified message to Maduro that his actions will not be  allowed to continue without a strong U.S. response.   What is that response, Mr. Speaker?   I call on the administration to use more targeted sanctions. We have  sent to the administration a very long list of names. So have Senators  Rubio and Menendez. Mr. Sires, Mr. Royce, and Mr. Engel have joined me.   There are many more people, thugs and cronies of Maduro, who are  enriching themselves with the suffering of the Venezuelan people. They  want to come to the U.S. We should not extend that courtesy to them.  There are consequences to these acts. We will continue to pressure the  Maduro regime until democratic order is restored in Venezuela and this  grave humanitarian crisis is resolved once and for all.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Royce for the time. I thank Mr. Engel; my  friend, Mr. Acevedo; and Eric Jacobstein on the Democratic side for  their help with this resolution. I most especially thank the author of  this resolution, our great Congressman, Ron DeSantis.
