 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk about the reality of  Bidenomics.   We have heard the President say time and time again that his economic  policies have worked. He actually believes that the American economy is  better today than it was before he took office.   Mr. Speaker, let's look at the facts because we know this  administration has a habit of changing terms, redefining issues, and  really not looking at the facts.   So let's look at the facts.   Gas is up 34 percent since Joe Biden took office, energy prices are  up 28.5 percent, and the average American family is paying almost  $1,200 more per month in everyday needs.   Now, tell me, Mr. Speaker, does that sound like an economy that is  strong?   The clear answer is no, the economy is not strong. It is actually a  lot weaker than it was before Joe Biden took office.   The sad reality is that hardworking taxpayers are footing the bill  for Biden's policy failures. I think it is time we tell the truth, that  Bidenomics has been a complete and utter failure.                            ____________________
