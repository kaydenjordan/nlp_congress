 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, my amendment would prevent the enforcement of  several arbitrary, self-imposed State Department restrictions that  limit communication and cooperation between U.S. officials and their  counterparts in Taiwan.   This amendment is similar to one that was adopted earlier in the  Department of Defense appropriations bill. As I discussed then, these  restrictions are not required by any provision of law and have been put  in place at the behest of Communist China.   They make it difficult for senior U.S. officials to travel to Taiwan  and to interact with their Taiwanese counterparts. In essence, these  guidelines are designed to prevent and limit high-level, bilateral  cooperation.   Not only does this make little sense, it is in direct conflict with  existing laws that call for expanding such cooperation, such as the  Taiwan Travel Act.   Mr. Chair, a State Department memorandum should never trump the laws  we pass in this body or outsource American foreign policy to the CCP.   My amendment will make sure that neither of those things happen by  scrapping these restrictive guidelines. I ask for a ``yes'' vote on  this amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, why do we allow the State Department through  a bureaucratic memo to impose these unnecessary and counterproductive  limits on communication and cooperation with Taiwan?   We don't have rules like this in place for the totalitarian rulers of  Cuba or Russia, both of whom operate embassies just a few miles away  from where we are standing right now.                                time  1145    We don't have rules like this for our interaction with Iran. John  Kerry has  [[Page H4770]]  met on several occasions with high-ranking Iranian officials, and the  White House just paid a $6 billion hostage ransom to the ayatollah.   We don't have rules like this for U.S. interaction with Communist  China. Biden administration officials continue to sit down at the table  with the same CCP officials who our own Secretary of State has accused  of committing genocide.   Yet, we continue to enforce these degrading conditions on Taiwan, a  longtime friend and fellow democracy.   Mr. Chair, as the old Sesame Street song goes, ``One of these things  is not like the other.''   It is time to stop treating our friends like enemies and our enemies  like friends.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, here is part of the memo that I read last  night from the State Department:         You should not refer to Taiwan as a country or to the       authorities of Taiwan as a government, instead, refer to       Taiwan authorities or Taiwan counterparts.    That is the kind of thing that is happening in our State Department  and it projects weakness to countries across the world, in particular,  our adversaries, when we need a foreign policy that is strong, we are  not receiving it now. That is why this amendment should be passed.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
