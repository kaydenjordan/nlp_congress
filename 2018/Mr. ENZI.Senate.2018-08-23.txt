 Mr. President, immediately following some comments I will  [[Page S5905]]  be raising a budget point of order. I find this circumstance to be  unfortunate, given that I have filed an amendment that would have cured  the budget violation.   The substitute increases the maximum discretionary Pell grant award.  Under the Pell Grant Program's complicated funding structure, this  increase triggers a point of order for a change in mandatory spending,  or CHIMP, which results in a net increase in spending and would  increase mandatory spending by a total of $390 million.   While we are unable to consider my solution--one supported by the  National Taxpayers Union and the Committee for a Responsible Federal  Budget--I believe the only alternative I have as Budget chairman is to  enforce the budget rules we have agreed to. In this case, the budget  rule being violated is bipartisan. It was first created by the Senate  Democrats in 2008.   If this point of order is sustained, the bill can still move forward,  but together we will have prevented $350 million in increased direct  mandatory spending from being rolled into the baseline where it will  evade budget enforcement. Now is the time to enforce our budget rules.  I urge my colleagues to support fiscal discipline and not to waive this  point of order.   The provision on page 270 of the pending substitute amendment in  division B, title III, lines 7 and 8 under ``Student Financial  Assistance'' would result in a net increase in the cost of mandatory  programs affected by the bill.   Therefore, I raise a point of order against that provision pursuant  to section 314(a) of S. Con. Res. 70, the concurrent resolution on the  budget for fiscal year 2009.
