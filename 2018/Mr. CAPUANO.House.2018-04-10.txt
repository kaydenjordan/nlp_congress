 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, very briefly, this is a short bill, an easy bill. It  simply tells the STB that they should do something about cybersecurity  as directed by their own inspector general.   It is a very simple bill. It is a bipartisan bill. It is something we  should pass as quickly as we can.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, again, this is a relatively easy bill and a bipartisan  bill. It simply requires that the FRA train people when they report  incidents of safety, that they report them in a uniform manner so that  when somebody goes to look to see how many accidents there were or a  certain type of accident, they can compare apples to apples instead of  apples to oranges. It is kind of simple. It is a straightforward bill  and, again, it is bipartisan.   Mr. Speaker, I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from New  Jersey (Mr. Gottheimer), the author of this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
