 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the Born- Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act.   From New Albany to Salem to Madison, Hoosiers across southern Indiana  feel as I do, that every life is precious and all lives deserve the  dignity and respect of lifesaving care. That is why I am proud to stand  alongside my colleagues in support of this pro-life bill.   This legislation would ensure that children who are born alive  despite an attempted abortion are given the same medical care and help  as any other newborn infant. We know the majority of Americans agree on  this issue, that saving the lives of babies who survive a botched  abortion is not just humane, but it is necessary and foundational to  our constitutional right to life. It is why I am an original cosponsor  on this important bill to support mothers and their children. I stand  with Hoosiers on behalf of these vulnerable infants.   Unfortunately, Madam Speaker, Democrats support the radical position  of abortion on demand up until birth, funded by the taxpayers, and they  would even deny care to an innocent child that miraculously survives a  botched abortion.   This is a commonsense support of life. Madam Speaker, I urge the rest  of my colleagues to stand with us in defending life. On this issue, we  should all agree.
