Sec. 2.         Upon adoption of this resolution it shall be in order to       consider in the House the bill (H.R. 4607) to amend the       Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act of       1996 to ensure that Federal financial regulators perform a       comprehensive review of regulations to identify outdated or       otherwise unnecessary regulatory requirements imposed on       covered persons, and for other purposes. All points of order       against consideration of the bill are waived. An amendment in       the nature of a substitute consisting of the text of Rules       Committee Print 115-61, modified by the amendment printed in       part B of the report of the Committee on Rules accompanying       this resolution, shall be considered as adopted. The bill, as       amended, shall be considered as read. All points of order       against provisions in the bill, as amended, are waived. The       previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill,       as amended, and on any further amendment thereto, to final       passage without intervening motion except: (1) one hour of       debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and       ranking minority member of the Committee on Financial       Services; and (2) one motion to recommit with or without       instructions.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr.  McGovern), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume.  During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the  purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule and the  underlying legislation.   Just 3 weeks ago, we hosted a small lender in my district office who  was being hindered in his efforts to serve home buyers in eastern  Colorado. Why? Washington, in its unyielding effort to regulate every  decision of Americans, lumped this lender into a broader regulation  that came out of the housing crisis 10 years ago. This isn't some  theoretical exercise. These regulations have real impact on Coloradans.   The last time I was on the floor debating these issues, I discussed  the affordable housing situation in Colorado. Without completely  recounting that debate, I want to reiterate the basic facts.   From 2009 to 2016, Colorado had a net increase of 600,000 people. In  that same time, housing costs skyrocketed by more than 57 percent.   Since 2016, our growth has begun to fall off considerably. When The  Denver Post researched why a State with a high quality of life and  decades more growth potential had a dramatically slowing growth rate,  they found that a substantial part of it had to do with rising housing  costs.   We must reconsider our Washington-knows-best regulatory approach. We  here in Washington can't possibly know what is the best for a potential  home buyer in Trinidad or Las Animas or Fort Morgan or Greeley or  Castle Rock, Colorado.   I, for one, am tired of the arrogance of Washington telling us in  eastern Colorado which banks we can and can't use to finance our  mortgages. It is time that we bring financial accountability to the  place that needs it most: Washington.   That is what these two financial bills do. They return power to the  American people. They reduce unnecessary regulations on small community  banks and credit unions, thereby freeing up capital that small  businesses and employers can access to create new jobs. They make  commonsense changes to Federal laws so that regulators have to  routinely review their regulations to ensure that the regulations are  not overly burdensome.   Eastern Coloradans are frustrated with the Washington-knows-best  mindset of their government, and I am listening to them.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Loudermilk), a member of the Financial Institutions and  Consumer Credit Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman from Georgia.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Missouri (Mr. Luetkemeyer), the chairman of the Financial Institutions  and Consumer Credit Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to close debate by reviewing a few basic truths.   In the aftermath of the financial meltdown last decade, Washington  embarked on a campaign to reduce the power of Wall Street over  Americans. In typical Washington fashion, we, instead, got a  monstrosity of a new regulatory infrastructure that has all but snuffed  out Main Street lenders. The plan to reduce Wall Street's influence  actually increased it.   This House--not the Senate, because the Senate has refused to act-- listened to the American people and passed the Financial CHOICE Act.  Instead of embarking on a campaign that hurt American people and  propped up Wall Street, we set out with one goal: increase the  financial freedom of Americans.   And we did that. We passed a bill that would make substantive changes  to our financial regulations to the betterment of Americans.   These bills before us today continue on that path. They recognize  that this government should work for all Americans, not just those who  can afford political connections.   Eastern Coloradans should know that I serve them and them alone. As  long as I have this responsibility to represent them, I will work to  reduce Washington's role in their life.   I thank Chairman Hensarling for his leadership on the Financial  CHOICE Act and these bills. I hope that he will remain engaged in this  effort as he commences the next chapter in his life at the end of this  Congress.   I thank Chairman Sessions for his leadership in bringing this debate  to the floor today.   We must never yield in putting Americans first in our public policy.   Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of the rule and the underlying bill.   The material previously referred to by Mr. McGovern is as follows:            An Amendment to H. Res. 747 Offered by Mr. McGovern         At the end of the resolution, add the following new       sections:        Sec. 3. That immediately upon adoption of this resolution       the Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII,       declare the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole       House on the state of the Union for consideration of the bill       (H.R. 4240) to protect Second Amendment rights, ensure that       all individuals who should be prohibited from buying a       firearm are listed in the National Instant Criminal       Background Check System, and provide a responsible and       consistent background check process.

Sec. 4.

Sec. 6. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 4240, H.R. 3464, or H.R. 2598.                                   ____           The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a       vote about what the House should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to       a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to       yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first       recognition.''  [[Page H1286]]         The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no       substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''       But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the       Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in       the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,       page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous       question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally       not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member       controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule . . . When the       motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the       time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering       the previous question. That Member, because he then controls       the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for       the purpose of amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on       Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further       debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:       ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a       resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control       shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous       question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who       controls the time for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools for those who oppose the Republican       majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the       opportunity to offer an alternative plan.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.
