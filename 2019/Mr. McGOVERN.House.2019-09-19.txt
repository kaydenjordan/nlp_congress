 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 564 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 564         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 4378) making       continuing appropriations for fiscal year 2020, and for other       purposes. All points of order against consideration of the       bill are waived. The bill shall be considered as read. All       points of order against provisions in the bill are waived.       The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the       bill and on any amendment thereto to final passage without       intervening motion except: (1) one hour of debate equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on Appropriations; and (2) one motion       to recommit.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Cole),  pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During  consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose  of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  be given 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, today the Rules Committee met and reported  a rule, House Resolution 564, providing for the consideration of H.R.  4378 under a closed rule. One hour of general debate has been provided,  controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on  Appropriations.   Mr. Speaker, before I begin my formal remarks, let me just take this  moment also to recognize the leadership of the ranking member on the  Rules Committee, Mr. Cole. He is not only a friend, but he is a fair  and evenhanded appropriator that can work with both sides. I know if  the gentleman could control this entire process, we would not be having  continuing resolutions; we would be actually voting for funding for the  entire year.   As my colleagues know, funding for the Federal Government runs out on  September 30, and that is less than 2 weeks from now. I had hoped that  we would have finished all of our work by now. Certainly, the House has  done its lion's share of work, but instead of prioritizing that,  President Trump has been obsessed with drawing on weather maps and  Twitter fights and cozying up to dictators.                                time  1230    And the Republican Senate is completely dysfunctional. It seems like  we have a better chance of getting struck by lightning than seeing them  pass a bill.   The House has passed bills that fund 96 percent of the government.  Again, 96 percent of the government is funded by the actions in this  House. But the Republican Senate has passed zero. Nothing. What are  they doing over there, Mr. Speaker?   The Senate is just starting to get its act together, but where have  they been all summer?   This House is the only adult in the room. That is why we are acting  today to keep the lights on. This continuing resolution will keep the  government funded through November 21. It is bipartisan and it is  drafted as cleanly as possible to encourage the Republicans in the  Senate and the White House to finally negotiate on a long-term deal.   I know my Republican colleagues on the other side of the Capitol are  afraid to stand up to the President. They have stood by as President  Trump ransacked funding for military construction projects in their  States and diverted it, instead, to pay for his ineffective border  wall, a border wall that I am now being told you can fry an egg on.   The President is hurting our brave servicemen and -women, their  families, and their communities, but still Senate Republicans do  nothing. They won't be able to shirk their responsibilities here  because any compromise will require bicameral support and the  President's signature.   Someone over there is going to have to deliver some bad news to  Donald Trump: that he is going to have to log off Twitter and actually  govern. It may not make for good television but keeping the government  open for business is the most basic responsibility that we have.   Make no mistake, Mr. Speaker, when we finally do go to conference,  this majority is going to defend our values. That means fully funding a  fair and accurate census, securing our elections from foreign  interference, and supporting Federal research into our Nation's gun  violence epidemic, all while working to fund education, healthcare, and  infrastructure.   This is what responsible governing looks like. I know that may be a  radical concept for some of my friends on the other side, who enabled  this President to launch the longest shutdown in American history, but  we don't believe in shutting down the government. The last Trump  shutdown cost us $3 billion in economic activity that can never be  recovered. That is according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget  Office.   We cannot afford a repeat at a time when Moody's has found the  President's disastrous trade war is already resulting in 300,000 fewer  jobs created. That is a figure that could increase to 450,000 fewer  jobs by the end of the year if he continues these policies.   It is tough to know what will happen because it seems like the  President can't make up his own mind. You would have better luck at a  casino than betting what President Trump will do next. That is not  master negotiation, that is madness.   Our farmers are hurting. I am glad that this bill lessens the impacts  they are facing as a result of the President's trade war. These  families need our help, and I stand with them.  [[Page H7784]]    Someone has to lead here to keep our government funded, and we are.  No gamesmanship, just the cleanest possible plan to keep the lights on  for another month.   So I encourage all my colleagues: let's say enough to this  uncertainty. Enough with the shutdowns and enough with the President's  inaction. Let's pass this short-term CR and finally make bipartisan,  bicameral negotiations on a long-term deal a reality.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I don't have any other speakers on this  side of the aisle, and I am prepared to close.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote yes on the previous  question and, obviously, yes on the rule.   Let me just say that we need to do something about campaign finance.  I think our current system is corrupt. I think people wonder why this  institution has enacted tax bills that favor billionaires and  millionaires at the expense of the middle class. Well, I think you can  tie that to the money. When people want to know why we can't get the  United States Senate to take up sensible gun control legislation, like  universal background checks, I tell them to follow the money. I think  we need to even the playing field so that middle class families, and  those struggling to get into the middle class, are heard on this Hill  as much as corporations and special interests have been over the past  several years.   H.R. 1, which we passed in this House, I think is a step in the  direction  [[Page H7785]]  toward giving government back to the people and taking it away from big  corporations, ending the practice of tax bills that just favor the very  well-off and the well-connected, so I disagree with the gentleman's  amendment.   But let me say this in conclusion. As my good friend, Mr. Cole,  pointed out, this is a bipartisan compromise continuing resolution. I  thank Chairwoman Lowey and Ranking Member Granger, as well as my  colleague from Oklahoma (Mr. Cole) who I know worked so hard on the  Appropriations Committee, for getting us to this point.    I wish we did not have to do continuing resolutions. In the future  that would depend on whether our colleagues in the United States Senate  want to get their act together and deliberate and legislate in a timely  fashion. We need to pass this because our farmers are hurting. Our  retailers, our small businesses, and our local manufacturers are  hurting.   Virtually, anyone who sets foot into a store is forced to pay more  for products today than before he took office because President Trump's  tariffs are causing the typical U.S. household $1,000 a year. That is  $1,000, Mr. Speaker.   None of us can control the President's haphazard so-called  negotiation with China, but we can control whether Congress acts to  lift the threat of another shutdown. The Senate may be in disarray and  the President may be focused on his latest Twitter feud or talking  about how many mountain climbers couldn't climb over his new wall, or  whether you can fry an egg on it, but this majority is focused on the  American people. We are doing our job to prevent a shutdown to provide  necessary funding that benefits all people in this country and buying  some time so that we can work out a long-term deal.   So I urge all my colleagues to join with us today. Let's encourage  the Senate Republicans and the President to finally do the jobs they  were elected to do and keep this government funded. We are doing our  job, and in here, today, we will bring a bipartisan product to this  floor--this bipartisan continuing resolution--that deserves a strong  vote on both sides of the aisle.   The text of the material previously referred to by Mr. Cole is as  follows:                     Amendment to House Resolution 564    At the end of the resolution, add the following:         Sec. 2. That immediately upon adoption of this resolution,       the House shall resolve into the Committee of the Whole House       on the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R.       4261) to prohibit the use of federal funds for payments in       support of campaigns for election for the offices of Senator       or Representative of Congress. The first reading of the bill       shall be dispensed with. All points of order against       consideration of the bill are waived. General debate shall be       confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on House Administration. After       general debate the bill shall be considered for amendment       under the five-minute rule. All points of order against       provisions in the bill are waived. When the committee rises       and reports the bill back to the House with a recommendation       that the bill do pass, the previous question shall be       considered as ordered on the bill and amendments thereto to       final passage without intervening motion except one motion to       recommit with or without instructions. If the Committee of       the Whole rises and reports that it has come to no resolution       on the bill, then on the next legislative day the House       shall, immediately after the third daily order of business       under clause 1 of rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of the       Whole for further consideration of the bill.        Sec. 3. Clause l(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 4261.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.
