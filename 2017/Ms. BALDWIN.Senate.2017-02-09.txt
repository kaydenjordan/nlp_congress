 Madam President, I rise to urge my colleagues to join me  in opposing the confirmation of Congressman Tom Price to be Secretary  of the Department of Health and Human Services.   Congressman Price has a long political record in Washington of siding  with Big Business and not American families. He has led efforts that  would force families to lose their health care coverage, that would end  Medicare as we know it, and increase costs for our seniors, and that  would let politicians choose what health care is best for women and  their doctors. Perhaps most troubling, though, are recent revelations  about Congressman Price's deep and ethically questionable financial  ties to health companies that are looking to turn a profit.   The people of Wisconsin elected me to the United States Senate to  stand up to powerful interests, to stand up for the working people of  my State. They surely did not send me to the Senate to take away  people's health care. That is why I simply cannot vote for a nominee  whose financial activities with health companies raise such serious  ethical questions and who has repeatedly opposed measures that would  improve the health of our hard-working middle-class families in  America.   During his time in Congress, reports show that Congressman Price  traded more than $300,000 in shares of health companies while he was  advancing health-related legislation which could directly impact these  companies' profitability. Congressman Price's financial disclosures  show that he has purchased stock in medical device companies, leading  pharmaceutical companies, and medical equipment companies. He also led  a number of legislative efforts to restrict or delay implementation of  several Medicare programs that would have impacted reimbursement for  these very industries.   I don't know who Congressman Price is working for. Is he working for  the American people or is he working for the powerful corporations to  help advance his financial interests and his investments in them? This  ethically questionable activity raises too many unanswered questions  about his professional judgment and his ability to fairly lead a  department that is charged with protecting the health of all Americans.   Even more troubling are reports that he had access to a special  private deal to buy discounted stock in an Australian biomedical firm,  Innate Immunotherapeutics. Reports show he received this special deal  from his colleague in the House, Congressman Chris Collins, who sits on  the company's board and is their largest investor. I sent a letter  asking Congressman Price to explain his relationship, his involvement  with Innate Immuno, and how his relationship with Congressman Collins  influenced those purchasing decisions, but he hasn't responded. His  financial dealings raise serious concerns about potential STOCK Act and  insider trading law violations. That is why I have called on the U.S.  Securities and Exchange Commission to investigate his stock market  trading activities. These questions must be answered and his stock  trading should be fully investigated before the Senate is able to  adequately consider his nomination. Yet we are probably hours from the  vote without all the information.   While there are so many unanswered questions about Congressman  Price's ethical judgment, there is a lot we do know about his record as  a politician that is deeply concerning.   We know Congressman Price wants to end Medicare as we know it and  raise costs for our senior citizens. Medicare is a promise, a promise  to current and future generations that guaranteed health care will be  there for them when they need it. Congressman Price wants to break that  promise, that promise to millions of seniors across this country. He  has spearheaded proposals that would convert Medicare into a voucher  system, essentially privatizing Medicare. He also supports raising the  eligibility age for participation in Medicare, forcing hard-working  Americans to wait to receive the benefits they have already earned. His  dangerous proposals would force seniors to pay more and would  jeopardize guaranteed access to the Medicare benefits they have today,  but we don't need to take my word for it. Listen to the thousands of  Wisconsinites who have written to me just since the start of this year,  urging me to oppose Congressman Price's confirmation and to fight  against any efforts that would take away their Medicare benefits.   Richard from Fond du Lac, WI, is just one of those Wisconsinites.  Richard and his wife are now retired and on Medicare. He wrote to say:         We both spent decades in teaching and while we knew we       would never get rich, we believed we were doing important       work with our students.        Both of us felt secure in knowing that Medicare would be       there for us when we left the profession and moved on to our       retirement years.    Richard cannot understand why politicians like Congressman Price are  proposing to fundamentally change a system that has worked well for  decades. He told me: ``Now we feel as if our world is being turned  upside down.''   Congressman Price's views are not only out of touch with America's  seniors, but they are also, interestingly, in conflict with President  Trump's promise not to cut Medicare. Price's legislative record also  conflicts with President Trump's public commitments to improve this  program by allowing Medicare to negotiate lower drug prices for our  seniors. Just this week, the White House confirmed the President's  support for this proposal again. Yet, during his hearing before the  Senate Health Committee, Congressman Price refused to answer my  questions when I repeatedly asked him if he would commit to standing  with the President and with American seniors by supporting Medicare  negotiation of better prescription drug prices. We don't know where he  stands on this issue, but we do know Congressman Price does not stand  with seniors, and he does not stand for protecting the guarantee of  Medicare coverage that our families rely on.   We also know that Congressman Price does not stand for the millions  of Americans who rely on the health care coverage and protections  available under the Affordable Care Act. Congressman Price almost  personifies the Republican agenda and battle to repeal the Affordable  Care Act and all of its benefits and protections, which would force 30  million Americans to lose their current insurance through participation  in the program. He has led the effort in the House to take away  guaranteed health care coverage and has championed dangerous measures  that would put insurance companies back in charge of health care and  lead to higher costs and more uncertainty for American families.  Congressman Price's agenda is putting the health care coverage of over  200,000 Wisconsinites at risk.   I wish to share the story of Sheila from Neenah, WI. She is a small  business owner and relies on the premium tax credits that helped her  purchase her health plan through the marketplace. She wrote:         I just wanted to let you know how devastating it would be       for my family if the Affordable Care Act is repealed. To take       away the subsidies would pretty much turn the plan into the       Unaffordable Care Act.    Sheila said that premium tax credits under the law have made it  possible for her to buy decent insurance for the first time in her  whole career.   I am listening to Chelsea from Shelby, WI. Her daughter Zoe was born  with a congenital heart defect. At just 5 days old, Zoe needed to have  open heart surgery. Chelsea said:         The Affordable Health Care Act protects my daughter. . . .       I'm pleading to you as a mother to fight for that and follow       through on that promise. There are so many kids in Wisconsin       with heart defects (as well as other kids with pre-existing       conditions) that are counting on you to protect that right.    I am listening to Maggie, who attends college in DePere, WI. Maggie  was diagnosed with cancer in 2015. Thanks to the Affordable Care Act,  she was able to stay on her parents' health insurance, which covered  most of her  [[Page S994]]  care. The Affordable Care Act also ensured that Maggie did not face  lifetime limits on coverage for her multiple rounds of chemotherapy and  radiation. Thankfully, Maggie is now cancer-free, but Maggie is  terrified--terrified that if the law's benefits are repealed, she could  face a situation where her chemo isn't covered if she ever needs it  again. She also fears being denied coverage because of her preexisting  condition or not being able to stay on her parents' plan.   During my time serving in the House of Representatives, I championed  the provision in the Affordable Care Act that allows young adults like  Maggie to remain on their parents' health care plan until age  26. Congressman Price would take that away, as well as other  protections that Maggie relies on, and instead go back to letting the  insurance companies decide what to do.    During his HELP Committee hearing, I asked him directly if he  supports the current requirement that insurance companies cover young  adults until age 26. Essentially, he refused to answer my question but  instead said that he trusts insurance companies to do this on their  own. He said: ``I think it's baked into insurance programs.''   Our future leaders like Maggie can't afford to take his word for it  that insurance companies will choose to protect their care. The stakes  are too high when it comes to accessing the lifesaving health care for  cancer or other serious conditions.   As I travel my State, I listen and I hear the voices of people who  are struggling. Too many people feel that Washington is broken and it  isn't working for them. People are scared because they can't make ends  meet and provide a better future for their children. We need to change  that. Our work here should be focused on making a difference in  people's everyday lives.   I am concerned that if confirmed as Secretary of Health and Human  Services, Congressman Price would make it harder for people to get  ahead. I am concerned that he will work with special interests who  already have too much power here in Washington instead of working for  the Wisconsin families I was sent here to serve.   For all these reasons, Congressman Price is not the right choice for  Secretary of Health and Human Services, and I urge my colleagues to  oppose his confirmation.   I yield the floor.
