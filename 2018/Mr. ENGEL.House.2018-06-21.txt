 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to the rule  and the shameful Border Security and Immigration Reform Act.   I am dismayed and embarrassed that the Republicans are attempting to  claim that this bill is a compromise. This partisan anti-immigrant  legislation is the opposite to the idea of compromise.   If Republicans were serious about compromise and protecting the  Dreamers, they would have allowed the bipartisan discharge petition and  queen-of-the-hill rule to move forward. Instead, Republicans have spent  the last 10 months ignoring the will of the American people and holding  Dreamers and young immigrant children hostage to implement their  hardline agenda.   This legislation does not provide a path to citizenship. It  eliminates asylum protections, drastically cuts legal immigration,  removes basic requirements for safe and humane detention, fails to end  family separation, and does nothing to reunite the children who have  been separated from their parents.   Some of these children are being held 2,000 miles away from their  parents, including in my district in New York, without any idea where  their parents are or if they will ever see them again.   This is cruel. What we need is a compassionate solution with a path  to citizenship and reunification of these families. Instead, this bill  is an attack on family values and an insult to our country's heritage  as a beacon of freedom and opportunity for all.
