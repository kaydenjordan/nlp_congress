Is there objection?   Without objection, it is so ordered.   (The bill, H.R. 2810, as amended, will be printed in a future edition  of the Record.)                            ____________________     Mr. President, the Senate has spent a great deal of time  over the last 6 or 7 months on healthcare in America. For years after  the passage of the Affordable Care Act, the Republican Party--the House  and Senate--has called for repeal of the bill. Yet, when the time came,  with the majority of Republicans in the House and the Senate and, of  course, a Republican President, and the task was immediately before  them, they faltered because they didn't have a replacement. They didn't  have something to propose that was better. As a consequence, their  efforts stopped short--one vote short--on the floor of the Senate  several weeks ago.   We still face some significant challenges. Some of those are very  immediate.   Before the end of September, we will face the prospect of needing to  reauthorize the Children's Health Insurance Program, known as CHIP.  This program provides health insurance coverage for more than 9 million  children and pregnant women across the country--350,000 in my State.  This vital program, the CHIP program, has had two decades of broad  bipartisan support, and it is going to expire in 12 days.   The good news is that the Finance Committee chairman, Orrin Hatch of  Utah, and his ranking member, Ron Wyden of Oregon, have reached a  bipartisan agreement on a 5-year reauthorization of the CHIP program.  [[Page S5797]]    The bad news is that instead of preserving healthcare for low-income  children and pregnant women, the Senate Republican leadership seems  more interested in the next 12 days in calling a different issue--a  different bill--altogether, the Graham-Cassidy bill, relating to health  insurance across America. That bill would take health insurance  coverage away from millions of Americans, including 1 million in the  State of Illinois.   From where I am sitting, reauthorizing the CHIP program is a priority  to not only serve the 9 million children and pregnant women across our  country but 350,000 in my State.   There is another bill we need to reauthorize before the end of  September: the funding of our Nation's community health centers. Like  CHIP, funding for community health centers expires at the end of this  month--in just a few days. Also like CHIP, community health centers  have enjoyed decades of broad bipartisan support. We have 10,000  community health centers across our country. They serve 26 million  Americans. Community health centers serve 1 out of every 10 children, 1  in 6 Americans living in rural areas, and more than 330,000 of our  Nation's veterans.   Illinois' 52 health center organizations receive $150 million in  Federal funding in order to provide care to the 1.3 million people in  360 locations in the State of Illinois. I have been to many of these  locations, and I have said in real candor and honesty that if I had a  medical issue or if there were one in my family, I would enter the  community health centers in my State with confidence that I and my  family would receive the very best of care. They are outstanding  organizations.   If Congress doesn't act within 12 days, community health centers in  my State and across the Nation will see their funding cut by 70  percent. That dramatic funding cut would result in 2,800 community  health centers closing across America, 50,000 jobs lost, and 9 million  people losing access to healthcare.   Well, there is good news here as well. Because of Senators Blunt and  Stabenow taking the lead, they are pushing for swift reauthorization of  community health center funding. But the problem is that there is  another bill--the Graham-Cassidy bill--which has captured the attention  and apparently the calendar time for the Senate--at least that is the  possibility we hear. So why shouldn't Congress be spending the next 12  crucial days reauthorizing the Children's Health Insurance Program  across America and making certain our community health centers don't  lose the critical Federal funding they need to serve so many people?   Right now, we know we face some challenges when it comes to the  health insurance market in America. Approximately 6 percent of  Americans--3 percent of people in my State--purchase their health  insurance in the individual marketplace, with more than 50 percent of  these people receiving some subsidies to help pay for costs. However,  many of these people are seeing dramatic increases in premiums. We know  that, and we know it is a challenge and one we need to address.   Here is the good news--and it is time for some good news when it  comes to healthcare. Almost from the minute that the critical vote was  cast ending the repeal of ObamaCare, meetings started taking place. I  can recall, as the Senate was adjourning, I looked back by the  cloakroom, and there was Senator Lamar Alexander and Senator Patty  Murray talking in the middle of the night--about 3 o'clock in the  morning. I later learned that they had reached an agreement between  them--a Republican, a Democrat--on the HELP Committee to start a series  of hearings about what we could do as a Senate to actually strengthen  the healthcare system in America. That was before our August recess.   When we got back from recess, they had kept their word. I attended  three or four of the Member hearings, which they held before the  official public hearings a little later in the morning. These were good  meetings. At the first one, I recall Senator Alexander saying 53  Senators--Democrats and Republicans--showed up for coffee and doughnuts  to meet with insurance commissioners from five different States. Just a  few days after that, there was another coffee-and-doughnut session,  another good bipartisan turnout of Senators as we sat down with five  Governors, Democrats and Republicans, who talked about health  insurance. A few days later, another meeting took place where experts  came in and talked about the subject.   I felt there was more accomplished in those 3 hours with those  outstanding witnesses from across the country than all of the time we  had spent giving speeches to one another on the floor of the Senate in  the previous 7 months. It was interesting. We brought in these people  from different States, different political parties, and they virtually  had the same thing to tell us. There were a handful of things which we  could do that could make an immediate, positive impact to make the cost  of health insurance a lot more predictable--not to say we are going to  bring it down--I don't want to be overpromising--but to slow the rate  of growth in health insurance costs as well as provide stability in the  insurance market.   Here are the things that came out loud and clear from these  bipartisan Senate meetings.   First, they told us to stop playing games with cost-sharing reduction  subsidies. These are subsidies to insurance companies that take on  individuals with expensive health histories. These insurance companies  are given support by subsidies so that they can keep the premium costs  for these individuals under control.   These cost-sharing reduction subsidies help 7 million Americans  afford their copayments and deductibles on their health insurance  policies. The current Trump administration has repeatedly threatened to  stop the payments. As a result, individual market premiums keep going  up because of the uncertainty of whether the government is going to  keep its promise to make these cost-reduction subsidies.   I remember the commissioner from the State of South Carolina told us,  I say to the Senator from Oregon, who is our ranking Democrat on the  Finance Committee--he said: I am going to announce a 30-percent  increase in health insurance premiums. If I knew that these cost- sharing reduction subsidies were coming, it would be 10 percent. I can  eliminate 20 percent of the anticipated increase in premium costs if  these subsidies come through.   It is pretty clear to me, this is sound policy, on a bipartisan  basis, which would have a dramatic impact in reducing the cost of  premiums to many individuals. That came through loud and clear in every  meeting we had with Senators Murray and Alexander.   The second thing they talked about was State reinsurance. I don't  understand that as well as some, but it has worked in States where the  State picks up a share of the liability for health insurance between  certain dollar amounts so the private insurance companies don't end up  with that burden. Because of this reinsurance, they are able to keep  premium costs down.   The third thing is to provide States with more flexibility without  undermining some really fundamental issues--without undermining, for  example, the preexisting condition protection we currently have.   I left those meetings feeling encouraged. After 7 months of bitter  political rhetoric, which led to nothing on the floor of the Senate, we  were finally sitting down, on a bipartisan basis, with Democrats and  Republicans all across our country with specific suggestions which  could help our healthcare system. That, to me, is the way to move  forward. That, to me, is the lesson learned from much wasted time so  far this year. Unfortunately, this whole effort may be derailed.   Senators Cassidy and Graham have come up with a legislative  alternative they want to move forward. Unfortunately, the measure they  have proposed has not been scored by the Congressional Budget Office  nor carefully measured to find out what impact it would have on the  American healthcare system, which accounts for one-sixth of the  American national economy.   Here is what we know about the Cassidy and Graham proposal. What they  are suggesting is basically eliminating the subsidies which help  individuals pay for private health insurance and bringing to a halt the  Medicaid expansion which has covered millions of Americans and given  them health insurance.   What they say instead is something which has been said many times on  the  [[Page S5798]]  floor: We will just give all the money to the Governors, and they will  figure it out. They will figure out how to save money in their States.  It turns out, Governors of both political parties warn us: If you are  going to give us a set amount of money as the cost of healthcare  continues to go up, don't expect us to cover as many people or provide  as good a coverage if we do it on a State-by-State basis.   So who supports this new Cassidy-Graham approach and who opposes it?  Every single medical advocacy group--the hospitals, the doctors, the  nurses--all across America oppose this Cassidy-Graham approach, as well  as the medical advocacy groups, because they understand their approach  would allow discrimination against individuals insured based on a  history of preexisting conditions--going back to the bad old days  before we passed the Affordable Care Act.   The Cassidy-Graham approach, which they brought to us, doesn't add  up. If you take $300 billion or $400 billion out of this healthcare  system, dump it into the laps of Governors across this country and say,  ``Good luck. Do it on a local basis. I am sure it will all work out,''  they will quickly tell you, as they have had in the bipartisan meetings  we have had, it will not work. It does not compute. It may be able to  check the box from some things to repeal the Affordable Care Act, but  they certainly didn't replace it with anything of equal or better  value. The opposite is true. That is why I think we ought to think  twice.   There is a mad dash now in the last 12 days to do many things. From a  political viewpoint, there is a limited opportunity for this repeal  effort. That 12-day period is a limited window under the Senate rules  of reconciliation. It is a mistake, as far as I am concerned, for us to  move toward Cassidy-Graham--concepts which have been roundly opposed in  my State and across the Nation, concepts which have failed on the floor  of the Senate.   Let us roll up our sleeves and do three things that do make sense:  Let's reauthorize the Children's Health Insurance Program. Let's make  sure those kids and their pregnant moms are going to have the basic  coverage they have enjoyed for almost 20 years.   Let's also reauthorize the community health centers. We know they  work. We know when people have a medical home, they are less likely to  let medical conditions get worse and more expensive. That, to me, is a  good investment to make sure they continue.   Finally, let's turn toward a real bipartisan effort, a measure which  can emerge soon--I hope within days--from Senators Murray and Alexander  on a bipartisan basis. I know they are still working on it. They  haven't reached a final agreement on what they are doing, but I hope  all of us, in both political parties, will encourage them to do the  right thing.   Remember when John McCain came to the floor after he had been  diagnosed with the cancer he is battling now. He came here and cast a  crucial vote to proceed to debate this whole issue of healthcare. Then  he asked to speak for 15 minutes, and I stayed in my chair. I wanted to  hear it. He reminded us of the importance of doing things on a  bipartisan basis and doing them thoughtfully when it comes to something  as important as healthcare. Let us keep that speech by John McCain and  that lesson in mind. Let us resist this Cassidy-Graham approach, which  has no support when it comes to the medical community, and instead work  on the bipartisan approach from Alexander and Murray, together with the  Finance Committee--which I know Senator Wyden is going to address  next--so we can have a bipartisan solution.   The American people sent us here to solve problems, not to create  them. Cassidy-Graham creates problems. Let's find solutions which solve  problems.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.
