 I ask unanimous consent that, at 6:15 p.m., all  postcloture time on the House message to accompany S. 610 be expired;  that the motion to concur with amendment be withdrawn; that if cloture  is invoked on the Koh nomination, the Senate vote immediately--vote  immediately--on the motion to invoke cloture on the Sung nomination;  further, that if cloture is invoked on either nomination, all  postcloture time be expired and the confirmation vote on the Koh  nomination occur at 5:30 p.m. on Monday, December 13, and the  confirmation vote on the Sung nomination occur at a time to be  determined by the majority leader in consultation with the Republican  leader; further, that the cloture motions on the Elliott nomination and  on the House message to accompany S. 1605 ripen on Tuesday, December  14.    For the information of Senators, there will be three  rollcall votes beginning at 6:15.                          Unanimous Consent Request     Mr. President, I want to rise today to support the  nominations of Victoria Wassmer to be Chief Financial Officer of the  Department of Transportation, and Mohsin Syed to be the Department's  Assistant Secretary for Governmental Affairs.   Right now, we are facing supply chain issues. The reason for this  includes unprecedented demand for goods, market disruptions caused by  the pandemic, and greater demand.   But the biggest issue is the lack of investment in our Nation's  infrastructure over the past half century. Simply put, we need better  infrastructure to move things in, out, and across the country. And that  is why it is so important that we pass the bipartisan infrastructure  bill.   The bill provides a historic $567 billion to the Department of  Transportation, including $37 billion for freight investments. It  creates new programs to reduce bottlenecks and ease supply chain  congestion.   The $1.5 billion for my home State of Hawaii will give a massive  boost to our local economy. But DOT needs staff to make this investment  work.   Ms. Wassmer is well qualified to serve as CFO, with private- and  public-sector experience, including as CFO of the FAA.   The same goes for Mr. Syed as Assistant Secretary for Governmental  Affairs. He spent 6 years on Capitol Hill, including in my office, and  worked in the DOT general counsel's office. That is why he passed out  of the Commerce Committee with overwhelming bipartisan support, and  that is why it is so maddening that Republicans are now refusing to  move these nominations forward.   These are not controversial individuals. This is basically a blanket  hold to stop the government from functioning, to stop the  infrastructure bill from being implemented. And nobody wins here. We  don't win passing a huge bill and then kneecapping it. And the American  people who sent us here to serve certainly don't win.   So let us do our job and move these nominees forward. And so,  therefore, I  [[Page S9079]]  ask unanimous consent that notwithstanding rule XXII, the Senate  proceed to executive session to consider the following nominations:  Executive calendar Nos. 468 and 469; that the nominations be confirmed;  the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table  with no intervening action or debate; that no further motions be in  order the nominations; that any related statements be printed in the  Record; and that the President be immediately notified of the Senate's  action, and that the Senate resume legislative session.
