 Mr. President, first I want to thank my friend from  Ohio for his passionate leadership on this very, very important issue  and the importance of standing with Ukraine. I want to thank him for  that.                    Nomination of Chavonda J. Jacobs-Young    Mr. President, we are about to vote on a very important position in  the Department of Agriculture, and I am urging my colleagues to confirm  Dr. Chavonda Jacobs-Young as our next Under Secretary for Research,  Education, and Economics at the Department of Agriculture.   It is critical to quickly confirm Dr. Jacobs-Young because without  Agency leadership and senior staff, the research Agencies at USDA can't  do the really essential work that our producers are counting on.   Dr. Jacobs-Young is extremely qualified. She has held leadership  roles at multiple research Agencies at the USDA and the White House.  She will be the first woman of color to serve in the USDA's highest  scientific post.   She was the first African-American woman in the country to receive a  Ph.D. in wood and paper science and the first woman of color to serve  as the Administrator for the Agriculture Research Service.   She has even got her own statue on the National Mall as part of the  IfThenSheCan exhibit to celebrate contemporary women innovators in  science, technology, engineering, and math--her own statue on the Mall.   Her commitment to science, research, and education is a true  inspiration.  [[Page S2809]]    I am excited about the nomination of Dr. Jacobs-Young, and I know  that she will help protect scientific integrity at the USDA and build a  diverse and resilient scientific workforce. I appreciate the  cooperation of my colleague and friend, our Ranking Member Senator  Boozman, in moving this nomination forward, and I urge my colleagues to  vote to confirm Dr. Jacobs-Young today.                            ____________________     I ask for the yeas and nays.
