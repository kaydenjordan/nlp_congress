 Mr. President, before I start my speech today on  another topic, I want to take just a moment to discuss what is on all  of our hearts across the country and across the world, that we should  be praying for the Ukrainian people. We have got a mess in Ukraine.   A lot of us have been to Ukraine over the last few months. We have  made friends. I went over and met with the President a few months ago  and a lot of his staff--and what good people. But they told us then  that they needed help. And for some reason, this administration decided  to drag its feet and tried to talk its way out of it.   Sometimes, when you try to talk your way out of it instead of putting  facts in front of you, you have problems. Well, we have had real  problems. President Putin, who is a murderous tyrant, thought this was  going to be easy. He didn't realize that the people of Ukraine were  going to stand up and fight for their country. And they have done just  that. They have lost many lives, Ukrainian soldiers, men and women, and  also many, many citizens, but it has made NATO stronger. Putin never  thought that would happen.   So as I said earlier, I think that we all should remember every day  and every night our prayers will go out to the Ukrainians, and,  hopefully, in the near future, we can all come to some kind of  consensus of what works best and that President Putin will come to his  senses and call this off.                                  Inflation    Mr. President, the other thing I want to talk about real quickly is  rising prices, inflation. I was back in my home State of Alabama this  week, and prices are at historic highs and getting higher every day.  But we were told by this administration that inflation was transitory.  We heard that all last year. The definition of transitory: not for  long. Well, they were very wrong on that.   They also said inflation was due to COVID. Well, COVID is not gone,  but it has died down, and inflation is getting higher.   We were told by this administration that it was due to corporate  greed. Well, we have had the same corporations for years and years.  Inflation has been low, but now still going higher and higher.   And the last reason that this administration said inflation is going  up is because of war, and there is probably something to that.  Obviously, we have got an energy crisis in this country, and everything  runs off of energy.   But one thing this administration didn't tell us was they didn't  blame it on the trillions of dollars that we basically have taken and  thrown out of helicopters all over this country. We have got more money  now, 36 percent more money in circulation than we had 2 years ago in  this country, and we have less goods. And that is when you have  inflationary prices that creep up.   But we have got to get control of our energy crisis. If we don't do  that, then the economy is not going to have a chance. That is the  bottom line. That is the basics of the economy. Our farmers are getting  killed with planting as we speak. They are in the fields paying more  and more every day for their fuel. Small businesses are struggling with  rates that are climbing at double and triple the rates in terms of  being shipped their goods, and they are having to pay the price for  that. And then the price goes up, and the American consumer pays that  much more.   So we have got a problem, and we better get control of that in the  very near future, or our economy is going to continue to go down and  continue to get in debt.   So we have got those two problems, one at home and one on the road.  It is a road game in Ukraine; and, hopefully, we can help out the  Ukrainian people, give them what they need to continue to fight. But as  we watch television each day, they continue to lose ground each day.  But they are going to fight for what they believe in, and that is their  freedom.                             Daylight Saving Time    Mr. President, my topic today, though, is--I think it is something  that we need to listen to from people across this country. It is not  war. It is not inflation. It has something to do with basic life here  in this country. To be their voice, I am advocating on the people's  behalf of this country.   So let me read you a little bit about something that comes from my  people in Alabama. A constituent from Talladega County writes:         Daylight savings time year-round means the elderly, like       myself, will be able to be more active in early evenings.    Another from Mobile writes:         Please try and do whatever is necessary to have daylight       savings time permanent in the State of Alabama and our       country. Everyone I know and everyone that I talk to, they       want more daylight in the evening.    And this is from a mental health professional:         I am writing to let you know of the negative effects of my       population of having the time change the way it does in       November towards an earlier sundown, less daylight hours. It       increases depression and decreases productivity in about half       of my psychiatric patients.    In other words, he is having problems when the sun goes down,  basically because people can't get outside. These messages make  important points, and I couldn't agree more. That is why I cosponsored  Senator Rubio's bill, the Sunshine Protection Act, which would make  daylight saving time permanent. That would mean an extra hour of  sunlight during the dark and cold winter months.   And ahead of this weekend, when we start daylight saving time this  coming Sunday, I want to take a moment to discuss the many reasons why  we should do away with the outdated practice of springing forward and  falling back.   Daylight saving time should be a thing of the past, because it  literally is. Introduced as a temporary measure during World War I,  daylight saving time was originally called ``wartime,'' and it was a  way to help conserve fuel and better utilize resources.   Following the end of World War I, the 1918 Standard Time Act was  enacted that discontinued daylight saving time nationally, but  individual States continued to spring forward and fall back.   Then, during World War II, there was a renewed Federal push for full- time daylight saving time, which then was repealed in 1945. Finally, in  1966, Congress passed legislation to set a national standard time.   All this to say, changes to our clocks might have made sense when it  first began, but it certainly doesn't now.   In fact, as recently has 2005, Congress moved the start of the date  of daylight saving time 1 month earlier in the spring and 1 month later  in the fall. This change was implemented in 2007, giving us the ratio  of daylight saving time that we have now--8 months to 4 months.   The ways we consume energy have dramatically changed since the  beginning of World War I. What started as an energy saver now just does  not make sense for these modern times. To turn the clocks back each  year is a nuisance and not smart policy.   You know, kids get out of school and the Sun is starting to set.  Families in their kitchen are cooking dinner, and it seems more like a  bedtime dinner. Weekends have less sunlight hours, limiting the amount  of time folks of all ages can spend enjoying the outdoors.   Additionally, reduced levels of sunlight are known to disrupt the  body's internal clock, which regulates sleep and alertness. It is no  wonder that cases of SAD, S-A-D, or seasonal affective disorder, are  much more common in the winter months than they are in the spring.   And for our farmers, longer days mean more time to work in the fields  under sunlight, which translates to a more profitable bottom line.   From an economic perspective, the time change costs the U.S. economy  an  [[Page S1006]]  estimated $430 million annually when accounting for lost productivity  in the change of sleep.   That is why Alabama, along with 17 other States, have passed  legislation or resolutions to flip the switch on this outdated  practice, permanently increasing our daylight hours.   However, for the will of the States to be enacted, the Federal  Government--this body, this building--has to get involved. The 1966 law  must be changed, and the Sunshine Protection Act does just that.   The Sunshine Protection Act makes sense from a health and economic  perspective, and it is just common sense. It is time we passed the  Sunshine Protection Act. Let's give Americans something to celebrate:  longer days and more sunshine.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
