 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and  join him in opposing the previous question so that Congress can meet  its most fundamental responsibilities under the Constitution.   Article I, Section 8 says that it is Congress' responsibility to  ``raise and support,'' ``provide and maintain'' for the military forces  of the United States.   Congress is failing in that responsibility. Not only have we missed  the October 1 deadline, but we are currently operating under a stopgap  funding measure that prevents our military from adapting to a volatile  world, and even that expires in less than a month.   In this debate today, we have heard a lot about Russian attempts to  interfere in our elections. Well, who is on the front lines of  protecting the country in cyberspace as well as the other domains? It  is the American military. It is the Cyber Command that is funded for  less than a month.   It seems to me that we ought to start with the first responsibility  of providing for our military, which is on the front lines of defending  us, yes, in cyberspace as well as all the other domains of warfare.   While this House and Washington in general are consumed by secret  impeachment proceedings, adversaries are looking to take advantage of  this Washington dysfunction.   Who gets caught in the middle of all this political squabbling? It is  our troops, the very men and women who volunteer to risk their lives to  protect us. They are the ones who suffer the most.   There are dozens of programs in every military service that cannot  begin under the current stopgap funding measure. There are dozens of  programs in every service where we need to do more of something, but we  can't do more under the current continuing resolution.   There are many programs we need to hire good people to work on. You  can't do that under the current stopgap funding measure.   Instead, what we get is political squabbling.   Now, I know there will be people who say: Well, the House has passed  these bills. It is the Senate's fault. It is Trump's fault. It is  somebody else's fault.   We have enough of that squabbling, finger-pointing, and blame. What  we need are results. Results will require the leadership of this House  to focus on getting first things done first, and that means we need to  get these essential defense bills signed into law. To get them signed  into law, they have to be done in a bipartisan way.   Madam Speaker, I am absolutely convinced that, given the chaos and  volatility of this world, the United States is going to be tested  severely in the weeks to come. The best thing this Congress can do is  put aside the political squabbling and focus on support for those  people who are defending us, the American military.                                time  1300
