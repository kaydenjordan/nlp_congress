 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, over the past week, the Palestinian  terrorist organization Hamas has launched more than 3,000 rockets at  civilian targets in Israel. Violent mobs have taken over the streets of  Jerusalem, and even seasoned veterans of the Palestinian-Israeli  conflict have expressed shock at the intensity of the violence.   This isn't normal. This isn't the Middle East version of the  Resistance. This is terrorism. Still, pro-Hamas activists have flooded  the media with Instagram-friendly content condemning Israel for  defending itself and questioning the legitimacy of Israel's very  existence, which is an argument that in any other context would bring  all hell down on the person foolish enough to say it out loud.   The level of denial and misinformation about what is happening in  Israel and why it is happening is appalling. Nearly every single member  of the United Nations Security Council embarrassed themselves this  weekend by embracing a generic draft statement condemning the violence  but refusing to acknowledge the hundreds of Hamas rockets that started  it.   The U.N. has a shameful history of ignoring threats and violence  against Israel, but rarely in recent memory has the Security Council so  blatantly regurgitated anti-Israel propaganda while Israeli civilians  cower in fear under persistent rocket fire.   Thankfully, the U.S. mission blocked the statement's release, but I  think it is important--important--to inject a little reality into the  ongoing discussion.   First, we must acknowledge that Israel has the absolute right to  defend itself, no matter the state of their relations with the  Palestinian Authority. There is a world of difference between a state- sponsored terrorist attack on a civilian population and action taken to  stop that attack. We have a responsibility to counter the dangerous  argument that because Hamas currently lacks the weapons capability to  win this battle, Israel must stand by and allow terrorists to slaughter  civilians.   Second, I would encourage all of my colleagues to join me in making  it clear that the United States is and will remain Israel's closest  friend and ally. We will continue to assist with the development and  production of advanced missile defense systems like the Iron Dome. We  will not step away from that obligation simply because celebrity  influencers would rather witness a slaughter than a proportionate  response to mass terror.   Last, it is important to acknowledge that this violence is a symptom  of a much more serious disease. Hamas terrorists may be the ones  launching rockets at civilians, but it is Iran, the world's leading  state sponsor of terror, that is paying for it. That is right, Madam  President--it is Iran, the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism,  that is footing the bill for these attacks. When we provide assistance  and support to Israel, we are not just  [[Page S2538]]  protecting an ally; we are containing the destructive influence of our  most belligerent adversary in the Middle East.   This month, the Biden administration traveled to Vienna to negotiate  sanctions relief with Iranian officials. Since then, President Biden  has also spoken to Prime Minister Netanyahu and reaffirmed Israel's  right to defend itself from these attacks.   However, I would take this opportunity to remind my Democratic  colleagues that the United States designated Hamas as a terrorist  organization more than 20 years ago. That is right. For the past two  decades, we have recognized Hamas as a terrorist organization. As a  rule, we do not provide them assistance of any kind. They are a  terrorist organization. But by opening the door to sanctions relief for  Iran, we cannot help but enrich a regime that will not stop until it  destroys Israel. That is their goal. We know it because they have told  us that is their goal. We must not provide sanctions relief to Iran or  give quarter to any regime that allies itself with this evil.   It is my hope that all Americans will take some time this week to  just unplug and think about this and reflect and then pray--pray that  reason and wisdom will prevail as we seek an end to this outbreak of  violence and the defeat of this terrorist group that wants to destroy  the nation of Israel.                                  Tennessee    Madam President, this weekend, we had a positive development in the  status of the I-40 bridge that connects West Memphis, AR, and Memphis,  TN. Just as a reminder, last week, inspectors discovered a crack in one  of the steel beams supporting the bridge. The crossing was immediately  closed to all vehicle and barge traffic. On Friday morning, the Coast  Guard reopened the stretch of Mississippi River that runs under the  bridge, but the bridge itself remains closed indefinitely.   Now, a lot of armchair experts have decided to sound off with the  argument that this closure won't affect local economies, but with all  due respect, those making this argument really should spend a little  bit more time out in the real world. This part of Middle America that  we are talking about is an incredibly important part of our Nation's  domestic supply chain. We have a 15-mile stretch along the Mississippi  River, and that houses 68 waterfronted facilities. Thirty-seven of  those facilities are terminal facilities moving products such as  petroleum, tar, asphalt, cement, steel, coal, salt, fertilizers, rock  and gravel, and grains.   Shipping companies and cross-country trucking companies depend on the  I-40 crossing, and so do the local grocery stores, industrial  facilities, restaurants, retail outlets that purchase the cargo, and,  of course, our Nation's farmers.   Commercial trucking constitutes 25 percent of all traffic that  crosses the I-40 bridge. The river traffic that flows beneath the  bridge is just as important. When the Coast Guard reopened that stretch  of the Mississippi, they had to juggle 60 vessels hauling more than  1,000 barges. Yes. We had a little traffic jam in the Mississippi  River.   It is amazing to me how quickly a problem like this does turn into a  bottleneck. Tennessee and Arkansas transportation officials are still  working out a timeline for repairs, but as of now, the trucking  industry is preparing for a downward spiral.   According to the Arkansas Trucking Association, this could cost  operators and their customers more than $2 million a day, which is an  amount that the industry actually cannot absorb. This means that the  delay could end up costing consumers an additional $2 million a day.  And depending on what they are buying, they could also see empty  shelves due to a supply chain interruption.   Meanwhile, the Biden administration is putting all their energy and  focus into checking items off of a decades-old wish list of social  programs. They put forward an infrastructure package worth more than $2  trillion that wastes about two-thirds of this total pricetag on  projects that have nothing to do with infrastructure, nothing to do  with making sure that major bridges and thoroughfares are safe and open  or expanding broadband access or making sure that parents in rural  Tennessee can get their kids to school without worrying that a  rainstorm will flood the road on the way to town. This is making the  American people feel so incredibly unsettled and very frustrated, and  Tennesseans are pretty nervous about the future.   If I could give the President one piece of advice, it would be this:  If you want to waste time peddling Green New Deal policies or expanding  social safety nets, admit it--just admit it. Call it what it is. Don't  call it infrastructure and then turn around and throw pocket change at  actual infrastructure problems that need to be addressed right now.  That mislabeling makes it look like you are trying to pull a fast one  over the American people, and it makes the American people believe that  you really don't care. And that is a dangerous message to send in the  middle of a traumatic pandemic recovery, especially considering that  prices are already on the rise. We see it in utilities. We see it at  the gas pump. We see it in the packaged snacks we purchase for the  children's Sunday school class. Even basics in the produce section at  the grocery store are beginning to get out of reach. It is affecting  basic nutrition.   This is the Biden surcharge. We are paying a premium just to live  from the moment our feet hit the floor in the morning to the time we  brush our teeth and get into bed at night. The barebones cost of living  is going up thanks to these reckless spending priorities.   My Democratic colleagues need to understand that a government subsidy  cannot save a family from that kind of hit to their monthly budget,  affecting everything from the moment their feet hit the floor in the  morning to the time they brush their teeth and go to bed in the  evening.   The Biden administration is creating a perfect storm of income  insecurity, shortages, and the uneasiness that comes when Americans see  more month at the end of their money than money at the end of the  month.   They know how to manage their budget, and they know what they have to  do when prices creep up 25 cents, $1 or $2 at a time. Their instinct  isn't to reach out to the Federal Government for help; their instinct  and their action is to cut back on the extras and to prepare for harder  times ahead.   The only way to avoid this even now is to make prudent, targeted  investments in economic recovery, supply chain security, cyber  security, and, yes, actual real infrastructure projects.   The American people cannot afford all the extras that are on the  Democratic Party's wish list. Their income can't keep up with the  inflation that is hitting their pocketbook every single day of the  week. And they really are concerned with what will happen when those  trend lines cross and inflation heads north every single day.   I would, again, ask my Democratic colleagues to step back from the  money printer and recognize the effect all this spending is having on  American families.   I yield the floor   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
