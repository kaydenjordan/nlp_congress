 Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Connolly), a scholar and a gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, I want to remind the Members that my  Republican Senator Bob Corker said that this Congress will go down in  history as the worst fiscal Congress in history for having voted for  both the tax scam bill and the big cuts for the wealthy.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr.  Scott).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Oregon (Mr. DeFazio), the ranking member of the Transportation and  Infrastructure Committee, who is always so generous and kind.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, government is and should be about more than just dollars  and cents. Government, and especially democratic government, is about  nurturing community, taking care of one another, and defending our  common humanity.   H.J. Res. 2, proposing a constitutional amendment requiring a  balanced budget every fiscal year strikes sharply against those core  values, as much that we see in government these days does.   A balanced budget amendment undermines our commitment to each other,  as expressed through critical social safety-net programs like the  Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, SNAP; Medicare; Medicaid;  and Social Security. My constituents in my congressional district of  Tennessee and millions of vulnerable Americans nationwide depend on  these and other programs to make ends meet in difficult economic  circumstances.   Therefore, it concerns me greatly that this Congress, which  hypocritically passed massive tax giveaways to corporations and the  superwealthy, has chosen to devote its limited time to what is  essentially a gimmick to avoid actually making politically difficult  decisions about the Federal budget.   Just this week, my Tennessee colleague, respected Senator Bob Corker,  called out his fellow Republicans when he tweeted: ``If we were serious  about balancing the budget, we would do it. But instead of doing the  real work, some will push this symbolic measure so they can feel good  when they go home to face voters.''    I wear on my lapel the letter ``F.'' That is the grade that Bob  Corker and I give this Congress for its work toward balancing a budget:  trillions of dollars of debt with tax giveaways to the wealthiest,  trillions of dollars of debt with a budget that gives the Pentagon $70  billion more than they want.   A balanced budget is nothing but an attempt to shortcut government,  and it would impose real harm on millions of Americans. Social safety- net programs would be at particular risk if a balanced budget amendment  were to be adopted because they are funded every year by drawing on  savings accumulated in prior years.   And let's be real about what is going on. After giving tax breaks to  the wealthiest and corporations, after giving away massive budget  amounts, particularly to defense, they want a balanced budget  amendment. How would they balance the budget? On Medicare, on Social  Security, and on Medicaid. On people who are ill and seniors who need  money to live on and healthcare to keep their lives going. That is who  this cruel Congress would say the balanced budget amendment falls on.  They would be on the chopping block.   This funding mechanism ensures that benefits could be paid to those  who need them and provides the opportunity to stave off funding  shortfalls before they occur.   The state of the Department of Justice is another example, given  President Trump's sharp political attacks on General Sessions out of  frustration with his recusal from any investigation concerning Russia's  interference in our Presidential election. Voter suppression efforts,  the resurgence of white nationalists in American politics, and the  active efforts to undermine the work of a free press are other  meaningful topics worthy of our attention; issues that are important to  the American public, not a balanced budget amendment that won't come  into existence and will harm the American people.   I strongly oppose the idea of a balanced budget amendment to the  Constitution because it threatens Social Security, Medicare, and  Medicaid; it threatens SNAP; it threatens programs that keep people  alive and make their existence tolerable. Many constituents of mine  depend on these and many in America do.   The House has better things to devote its time to. I strongly oppose  H.J. Res. 2, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky).    Mr. Speaker, I want to say, Mr. Fitzpatrick got the award  from the American Bar Association for his good work on legal services,  and I compliment him on that.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts  (Mr. Neal).   (Mr. NEAL asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)                                time  1430     Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Massachusetts an  additional 1 minute.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Kentucky (Mr. Yarmuth), who is the ranking member and future chairman  of the Budget Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Pelosi), the leader, the once and future Speaker.    Mr. Speaker, the previous speaker said: Does anybody have  the guts to stand up? I am standing up, and I voted against the tax cut  bill and against the mammoth budget bill that caused this deficit to go  up by $4 trillion.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from Rhode  Island (Mr. Langevin).    Mr. Speaker, today is Holocaust Remembrance Day;  remembrance of the horrors of 6 million Jews being killed in Nazi  Germany, and others being killed as well: homosexuals, Communists, and  other minorities that were objectionable, like Gypsies.   In recent polls, it shows millennials, over a third, don't realize  what Auschwitz was, or that the Holocaust occurred. On this day, Yom  HaShoah, we need to remind the world of what horrendous events occurred  on this planet just 75 years ago.   Never again. Never again.
