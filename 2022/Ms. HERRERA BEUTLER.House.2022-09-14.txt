 Madam Speaker, today, I rise to honor and  recognize my friend and fellow Southwest Washingtonian and State  Representative Larry Hoff, who is retiring at the end of this term.   Larry has been just an upstanding member of Southwest Washington's  community for over 40 years. After serving in the Navy and graduating  from college, Larry moved to Vancouver, where he was an executive in  the financial services industry before successfully running to serve  Clark County in the 18th Legislative District.   In Olympia, Larry fought hard to get things done for Southwest  Washington's small businesses, for our farmers, families, and our  communities. But it is really Larry's heart for serving our community  that is what stands out to all of us who know him.   Whether it is his role on the board of the Doernbecher Children's  Hospital Foundation, or the Clark County Department of Community  Services, or the countless other stories of coming alongside his  neighbors, Larry's infectious optimism and selflessness are apparent to  all who meet him.    Thank you, Larry, for your many years of service and hard work to  make our Evergreen State a better place to live, work, and raise a  family.                   Recognizing the Service of Brandon Vick     Madam Speaker, I rise today to who honor and  recognize Southwest Washingtonian and State Representative Brandon  Vick, who is retiring at the end of this term.   Brandon is a lifelong resident of Southwest Washington and a rock- solid member of our community. In addition to serving in the State  House of Representatives, he also gives his time to the Boy Scouts and  to the Boys and Girls Club.   In Olympia, Brandon has been a champion for his home county, my home  county, Clark County, for the last decade. Under his leadership on the  Consumer Protection and Small Business Committee, 14 bills that he  wrote and led have been signed into law, including recent legislation  to help small businesses obtain work permits for rehabilitated  individuals.   Brandon's work in the State Legislature has earned him many awards,  including Vancouver Business Journal's ``Accomplished and Under 40``  list.   Thank you, Brandon, for your many years of service. I am hopeful that  you are going to have more time to spend with your wonderful wife,  Darci, and daughter, Makena. You have made Southwest Washington proud.                            ____________________
