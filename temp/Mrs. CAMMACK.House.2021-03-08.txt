 Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition to this rule  as well as H.R. 8 and H.R. 1446, a/k/a the legislation to deny  Americans their Second Amendment rights.   Common sense and data tell us that these bills will do nothing to  prevent criminals from obtaining firearms or stop mass shootings in the  United States. Instead, these bills will make it more difficult for  law-abiding citizens to exercise their constitutionally  protected rights.    H.R. 8 would lead to a national gun registry which every American  should be concerned about. Even former Obama officials acknowledge that  universal background checks are only effective with a national registry  in place. H.R. 1446 would lead to unnecessary and potentially  indefinite delays in law-abiding citizens purchasing the tools  necessary to defend their families and their homes.   My colleagues on the other side of the aisle claim that H.R. 1446  would close a loophole, but we know the truth. The only loophole will  be that the criminals will continue to get guns on the black market  while lawful citizens are denied their rights.   As Members of Congress we swore an oath to defend the Constitution,  and that includes the Second Amendment; and it reads plainly: shall not  be infringed.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to stand up for all Americans'  rights to bear arms, uphold their constitutional oath, and reject this  rule and these horrendous bills.
