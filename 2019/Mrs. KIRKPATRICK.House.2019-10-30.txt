 Madam Chair, I rise in support of H.R. 1373, the  Grand Canyon Centennial Protection Act.   I have lived in Arizona my entire life, born and raised there. I  remember frequently visiting the canyon as a child, marveling at its  magnificence and its beauty. I have hiked down the Grand Canyon with my  family, camped on the banks of the Colorado River. It is not a place  where we should have uranium mining.   There are many Native American Tribes who live in that area and who  consider that a sacred site. For hundreds of years, their ancestors  visited the Grand Canyon. They continue to worship there and have  ceremonial sites in the Grand Canyon.   We just cannot allow this kind of contamination to continue. The  problem with uranium mining is that the retroactive disposal of uranium  is very, very difficult to clear from the land.    Madam Chair, one more point. When it rains in that  watershed, rain carries that uranium contamination to our stock tanks  and ponds, and then that contamination goes into our cattle.   Madam Chair, this is a very serious issue. I urge my colleagues to  support H.R. 1373.
