EXEMPTION RELATING TO CONSUMER PROTECTIONS FOR                     STUDENT LOAN BORROWERS.

The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Oregon.    Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of the amendment to  protect student loan borrowers from the dangerous provisions of the  SCRUB Act.   More than 40 million Americans have student loan debt. Roughly one- quarter of these borrowers are behind on their payments either in  delinquency or default. The Federal Government has a responsibility to  protect these borrowers and American taxpayers from unscrupulous  institutions that saddle students with exorbitant debt in exchange for  an education of dubious value.   Hardworking students, like those who attended Corinthian Colleges or  ITT Tech, could be harmed if Congress passes a law that potentially  strips them of a clear process for having their debt forgiven after  institutions fabricate job placement figures or close unexpectedly.   This bill could allow institutions like Corinthian Colleges to  require pre-dispute arbitration clauses, and prohibit class-action  lawsuits--making it much less likely that students will get the justice  they deserve when a school misrepresents the quality of its programs.   Millions of borrowers who rely on popular income-driven repayment  plans could be left without options for keeping their payments  affordable.   Active-Duty servicemembers could lose access to deferment benefits.   Rules banning incentive pay could be undone, exposing student  veterans and others to aggressive marketing.   This bill could weaken Federal protections for millions of student  loan borrowers when, instead, Congress should be working together to  make college more affordable.   I encourage my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Mrs. Davis), the ranking member of the Subcommittee on  Higher Education and Workforce Development.    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Colorado (Mr. Polis), the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Early  Childhood, Elementary, and Secondary Education.    Mr. Chairman, the SCRUB Act is completely unnecessary.  Agencies can already review and repeal regulations that are no longer  needed. The only thing this bill does for people with student loan debt  is give them less certainty that their investment will be worth it.   At a time when a college degree or credential is a critical tool for  securing a family-wage job, it makes no sense to threaten to rescind  rules that shield Americans from career programs that leave students  with large debts and low wages.   I encourage all of my colleagues to adopt this amendment to safeguard  consumer protections for student loan borrowers.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentlewoman from Oregon (Ms. Bonamici).   The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes  appeared to have it.  [[Page H1410]]         Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.   The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further  proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Oregon  will be postponed.                   Amendment No. 9 Offered by Ms. Bonamici    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 9  printed in House Report 115-20.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 31, after line 24, add the following new title (and       update the table of contents accordingly):                            TITLE VI--EXEMPTIONS       SEC. 601. EXEMPTION RELATING TO ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY                     EDUCATION ACT OF 1965.         The provisions of this Act do not apply to any rule or set       of rules relating to title I of the Elementary and Secondary       Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 6301 et seq.).    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 150, the gentlewoman  from Oregon (Ms. Bonamici) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Oregon.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the amendment to  exempt rules related to title I of the Elementary and Secondary  Education Act from the misguided provisions of the SCRUB Act.   Title I is the core feature of the Elementary and Secondary Education  Act, a critical civil rights law that holds States accountable for  helping all students succeed.   The SCRUB Act threatens rules for implementing title I, which, in  turn, threatens students. For example, title I rules clarify important  accountability requirements that we passed into law just last session  with strong bipartisan support.   Clear rulemaking is necessary to give education leaders certainty so  they can benefit from the law's new flexibility and innovate on behalf  of students.   Title I rules also include important details about the use of  assessments in schools. These rules were negotiated with broad  consensus. Would the SCRUB Act repeal them and deny States  clarification about reducing the burden of testing?   My colleagues across the aisle may argue that no rule should be  exempt from the SCRUB Act and that somehow the unelected commission in  the bill will identify only bad rules. I am not so sure. The commission  in the bill could create any methodology for targeting rules and,  without knowing the commission's method, it is disingenuous to say that  essential rules, good rules, wouldn't be affected.   Additionally, rules are rarely black and white as the majority  suggests. Title I accountability rules, for example, sometimes push  States to report on how they are serving each subgroup of students. But  where some local officials may complain, these rules make sure that  low-income and minority families are being counted.   Will the commission hear the concerns of those families?   I ask my colleagues to protect vulnerable students across the country  by supporting this amendment.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Colorado (Mr. Polis), the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Early  Childhood, Elementary, and Secondary Education.    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Mrs. Davis), the ranking member of the Subcommittee on  Higher Education and Workforce Development.    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Mrs. Davis), the ranking member of the Subcommittee on  Higher Education and Workforce Development.    Mr. Chair, may I inquire to the remaining time, please?   The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from California has 1 minute  remaining.    Mr. Chair, title I of the Elementary and Secondary  Education Act is a key Federal law for advancing equity in our Nation's  classrooms. The rules implementing title I provide important details  that make sure historically underserved students have access to an  equal public education. These rules are too important to entrust to a  mysterious commission.   I am very proud of the work I did in the State legislature repealing  unnecessary education rules and statutes. We did it in a very  collaborative, bipartisan manner through existing processes. That is  what we should be doing, not going through this SCRUB Act.   I urge my colleagues to protect title I rules, stand up for  educational equity, and support the amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentlewoman from Oregon (Ms. Bonamici).   The amendment was rejected.                    Amendment No. 10 Offered by Mr. Raskin    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 10  printed in House Report 115-20.
