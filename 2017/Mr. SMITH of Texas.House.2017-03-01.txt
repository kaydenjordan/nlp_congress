 Madam Speaker, President Trump hit a home run in  the State of the Union Address last night. As he said, the way to renew  the American spirit is to put Americans first--their jobs, their  safety, their education, and their health. He also focused on border  security. The rule of law will stop drugs and protect American jobs and  lives.   A recent poll found that, by a 2-to-1 ratio, voters feel that the  President has kept his promises to the American people. Another poll  revealed that 78 percent of Americans had a positive response to  President Trump's State of the Union speech. No doubt Americans will  rally behind him and support his efforts to put Americans first.   President Trump's words will be long remembered: ``My job is not to  represent the world. My job is to represent the United States of  America.''                            ____________________
