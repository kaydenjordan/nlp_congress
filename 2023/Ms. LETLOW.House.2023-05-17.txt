 Mr. Speaker, earlier this week we passed H. Res. 363 that  I proudly introduced with Representative Michael Guest memorializing  law enforcement officers killed in the line of duty. I join 110 of my  colleagues recognizing and commemorating the ultimate sacrifices made  by our law enforcement officers.   Honoring our officers is not just an act of appreciation, it is a  fundamental  [[Page H2384]]  responsibility of all citizens throughout this great Nation. Our police  officers are the very sentinels who selflessly dedicate their lives in  the pursuit of preserving the safety and security of the citizens they  are committed to protecting. They stand as a brave shield between us  and danger, strengthening the foundation of our communities and  embodying the very best of our society.   Today, I will take a moment to honor five courageous heroes from my  home State of Louisiana who paid the ultimate sacrifice in the line of  duty:   Walter Soileau, Jr., with the Cameron Parish Sheriff's Department;  Trey Copeland with the Cotton Valley Police Department; William  Collins, Jr., with the Doyline Police Department; Nicholas Tullier with  the East Baton Rouge Parish Sheriff's Office; and Louis Estay with the  St. Charles Parish Sheriff's Office.   I ask everyone to join me in praying for these officers and their  families who put their lives on the line each day for every American.  As we pay our respects and honor these brave heroes for their ultimate  sacrifice, let us all commit to supporting and uplifting the women and  men who wear the badge each day.   Let us teach our children as well as future generations the critical  mission that law enforcement personnel undertake in service to our  beloved cities and our communities.   Today, let us respect, let us honor, and let us remember these fallen  heroes.                Honoring State Representative Francis Thompson     Mr. Speaker, I stand before you to honor an extraordinary  individual who has dedicated over 50 years of his life to public  service in the great State of Louisiana. That person is my good friend,  State representative Francis Thompson, the longest serving State  legislator in Louisiana history and one of the longest serving in our  country.   Representative Thompson was born and raised in his hometown of Delhi,  Louisiana, right in the heart of Richland Parish. Thompson was first  elected to the Richland Parish School Board in 1968 before winning a  special election for District 19 in the Louisiana House in 1975. Voters  have re-elected Thompson 11 times since then, serving 12 years in the  State senate and 37 years and counting in the statehouse.   His unwavering commitment to north Louisiana and our State is  remarkable. From the halls of the State legislature, Representative  Thompson has been a strong and unwavering voice for north Louisiana.  Throughout his distinguished career, he has championed crucial issues  such as education, economic development, healthcare, and  infrastructure, always striving to improve the lives of those whom he  serves.   Representative Thompson's leadership and experience have been  invaluable in shaping legislation that addresses the unique challenges  faced by Louisiana. His extensive knowledge and understanding of the  intricacies of governance have earned him the respect of his peers and  colleagues on both sides of the aisle.   Mr. Speaker, not only his legislative achievements make  Representative Thompson a remarkable public servant, as a former  educator, he possesses a rare quality: the ability to connect with  people on that personal level. Throughout the years, Representative  Thompson has been a true friend to those whom he serves. He is known  for his accessibility, his willingness to listen, and his genuine care  and empathy has touched the hearts of so many, creating lasting bonds  that will extend far beyond politics.   As we reflect on Representative Thompson's lifelong commitment to  public service, let us acknowledge his unwavering dedication to our  great State of Louisiana. He is an exemplary leader, a tireless  advocate, and a true champion for the people of north Louisiana.   It is with great respect and gratitude that we acknowledge his  remarkable contributions to Louisiana.                            ____________________
