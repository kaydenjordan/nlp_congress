 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to introduce the Reverend Dr.  Daniel Cube Gunn, who has so eloquently opened our session in the daily  prayer. Father Gunn joins us in the House Chamber from St. Andrew's  Episcopal Church and School in New Providence, New Jersey, a beautiful  community in the district I have the honor of serving.   Father Gunn's professional ministry, education, and service to his  and my faith of Christianity has spanned several States and  experiences. He graduated from Lee College, earned his master's degree  in divinity at the Church of God Theological Seminary and a master's  degree in philosophy at West Chester University in Pennsylvania. Father  Gunn later completed a master's degree of sacred theology in  [[Page H5105]]  Anglican theology and ethics at Yale University's Divinity School.   Father Gunn heard the call of ministry at a young age. During service  in Tennessee, he served the Department of Corrections, bringing hope  and wisdom to those incarcerated. He then brought his ministry to St.  Luke's Hospital in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, completing a clinical  residency where he brought comfort to patients and their families.   Father Gunn was ordained to the deaconate and priesthood in 2002, and  his assignments brought him to Bronxville, New York; Wilkes-Barre,  Pennsylvania; Clarksboro, New Jersey; and Ridgewood, New Jersey. Father  Gunn was then named priest-in-charge and superintendent of St. Andrew's  in New Providence, New Jersey.   I thank him for his stewardship at St. Andrew's. Its mission  statement gives the church the welcoming moniker of ``a big heart,  making God's love known to the world.''   I thank Father Gunn for being here and for offering our daily prayer.                            ____________________
