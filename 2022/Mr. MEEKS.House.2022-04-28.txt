 Madam Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 1065, I call  up  [[Page H4595]]  the bill (S. 3522) to provide enhanced authority for the President to  enter into agreements with the Government of Ukraine to lend or lease  defense articles to that Government to protect civilian populations in  Ukraine from Russian military invasion, and for other purposes, and ask  for its immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on S. 3522.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, today, I rise in support of S. 3522, the Ukraine  Democracy Defense Lend-Lease Act of 2022.   When Russia launched its renewed war against Ukraine, it thought  Ukraine would fall in a matter of days. Putin and Russia thought the  West would be divided, unable to offer Ukraine the support that it  needed. They thought the world would believe their Russian lies. They  thought that we would never stay together.   Well, Madam Speaker, on all accounts, Putin has been proven wrong.  Two months ago, the people of Ukraine united in defense of their home.  I visited Ukraine at that time, before the invasion, and they said: We  will fight; we will defend our democracy and our country.   Then what happened? President Biden kept all 30 nations of NATO  together, joining with and bringing along other allies and other  democracies from around the world, all united like never before. We  have jointly imposed devastating sanctions on Russia and provided  Ukraine with billions of dollars of security, humanitarian, and  economic assistance. And we have demonstrated to Putin and to the  Russian Government that their actions have left them isolated.   At the time, our goal was clear: Help Ukraine do what we heard the  people ask us to do, defend themselves. But it is now abundantly clear  that we must adjust our assumptions and our strategies and that we must  help Ukraine, as Secretary Austin said, win.   I strongly support the efforts of the administration, in coordination  and in close cooperation with Congress, to provide as much assistance  as we can to help Ukraine protect itself. We must look forward to what  Ukraine needs to fend off the renewed Russian offensive in the east  and, ultimately, win this war, to retake territory, to liberate the  towns and cities from Russian occupation and ongoing Russian war  crimes, and to maintain and regain their sovereignty and territorial  integrity.   This bill is a further step in that direction of thinking toward the  long term. It can and must be part of a strategy to not only continue  providing Ukraine with the weapons systems its soldiers are well  trained to use, including Russian tanks and planes, the U.S.- and NATO- origin antiair and antitank missile systems and drones, but also to  step up our training efforts. Through additional training, we will be  able to provide more and more advanced equipment.   The administration already has the authority to lend and lease  equipment to allies and partners to support the United States' national  security interests, and it has already been using all the funds that  Congress has given it previously. This bill will allow the  administration to cut through the red tape in existing lend-lease  authorities to facilitate another channel by which all this vital  support can be provided.   Specifically, this bill streamlines the processes to facilitate the  administration's provisioning of lent or leased defense articles to  Ukraine or Eastern European countries impacted by Russia's invasion for  fiscal year 2022 and fiscal year 2023. It does so by exempting the  administration from provisions of law that limit the duration of loaned  equipment to 5 years only, as well as exempting such loaned and leased  equipment from repayment of costs incurred by doing so.   In short, it does not create a new program, as lend-lease authority  is already enshrined in law, but it gives the administration added  flexibility in using an existing program to get vital support to  Ukraine.   I strongly support this bill, and I urge all of my colleagues to show  the same unity that our allies have shown as we fight off this vicious  invasion by Putin and Russia in Ukraine.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the distinguished majority leader of this body.    Madam Speaker, first, let me thank Representative Spartz.  She traveled with me when we visited Poland, and I know she was  recently over there. She has relatives, and I think we saw her with--I  think it was her grandparent, who is in her nineties, on Easter Sunday,  celebrating and standing with the Ukrainian people. I thank the  gentlewoman for her support even though she isn't a member of the  Foreign Affairs Committee, particularly for standing up for justice. I  thank her personally for that.   I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Green), my friend  and leader.     Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New  Jersey (Mr. Pascrell), a member of the House Ways and Means Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  the great State of Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee), a dynamic Member of  Congress.    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentlewoman.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from the  great State of Tennessee (Mr. Cohen).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the very distinguished  gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Ryan).    Madam Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 1  minute.  [[Page H4599]]         Madam Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute.   Madam Speaker, I think it is important to note that S. 3522 is a  smart and critical step to give another piece of artillery to the  administration so that it has flexibility as it needs to provide  Ukraine the support that it needs so that it has the ability to win.   It is also important to show, and that is why it is important for us  to be on the floor today, as Mr. Wilson has indicated, the unity that  we have here in the United States House of Representatives.   Madam Speaker, I will tell you that working with Mr. McCaul and Mr.  Wilson and Mrs. Spartz on the other side of the aisle, as well as with  all of my colleagues on the committee on the Democratic side of the  aisle, and working with the Speaker and the majority leader, it is that  unity that is going to win this war.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Pelosi), the great Speaker of the United States House  of Representatives.    Madam Speaker, I have no further requests for time at this  time, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume  for the purpose of closing.   Madam Speaker, as we stand here right now, in the House Foreign  Affairs Committee, Secretary Antony Blinken is testifying and talking  about his recent visit to Kyiv, asking--well, replying to questions  that Members on both sides are asking.   And the sense of unity that has been talked about here today, about  us being united against Putin's aggression, about us standing together  and trying to make sure that we do all that we can to help the  Ukrainian people, and that unity, that unity, is what is going to make  sure that we preserve democracies around the world.                                time  1545    It is the unity that we have seen with the United States in the lead,  keeping 30 NATO countries together, which no one thought would happen  before this incursion.   It is the unity of bringing our Asian allies together. It is the  unity bringing our Western Hemisphere allies together. It is the unity  bringing our African allies together.   It is that unity right here in the United States Congress. Working  together is what is going to prevail.   There was a question asked before I left the hearing. One Member said  he was at a townhall meeting, and someone asked the question: Well,  what does this mean to me? That was the question.   Secretary Blinken said, with which I agree: What does it mean? Well,  when you look at what is at stake, number one, the world is asking:  What happens? Are there any consequences for a country that decides  just to go invade someone else's sovereign property? If we allow that  to happen, if it could happen there, it could happen anywhere.   The questions of what we do, what we stand for, who we are, and what  our values are, are on the line right now, not only in Ukraine but for  all of us who believe in democracy.   When you look at the consequences and the lack of care of the rest of  the world by this invasion by Mr. Putin--we are going to have to do  hearings  [[Page H4601]]  now to talk about starvation. People around the world will starve  because of the lack of wheat.   We are looking at what he tried to utilize with reference to energy  resources. It has a reverberation back here in the United States as we  are looking at what is taking place with rising oil costs, with rising  food costs.   This is about us around the world, some, yes, making sacrifices so  that we can show the world that unity. And together, we will prevent  evil from occurring.   We have seen it once in the 1940s. I never thought I would have to  see and fight it again in 2022. This is a trying time for the camera of  history, which is rolling.   I, again, thank Mr. McCaul because I have been working very closely  with my ranking member to make sure that we have one voice on this. We  have talked often and made sure that we are working in a bipartisan  manner. I thank Mr. Wilson for managing this bill on the floor and  working collectively together in that regard. I thank the leadership on  both sides of the aisle because with that, Ukraine will win.   When Ukraine wins, the American people win; the world wins; democracy  wins.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
