 Madam Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Oklahoma  (Mr. Cole), my good friend, pending which I yield myself such time as I  may consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded  is for the purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  on H. Res. 8.    Madam Speaker, a rules package is one of the most  consequential things we will consider in this entire Congress.   As we stand here in the opening days of this Congress, I am proud  that the reforms before us represent a collaborative process that began  many months ago. We asked Members on both sides of the aisle for ideas;  we listened to our many caucuses and coalitions; we spent hours in the  Rules Committee listening to input during our Member Day hearing; and  we spoke with the outside groups that study these issues.   Weeks and weeks of thoughtful discussion got us to this point. That  process made the final product an even stronger one--not for one party  or the other, but for this institution and for all those Americans  counting on us to represent them; not the special interests or the  monied interests, but our workers and those struggling to get ahead.   This is a rules package that encourages us to tackle the most  pressing issues facing our Nation today, like climate change, through  the continued work of the Select Committee on the Climate Crisis.   I want to thank Chairwoman Castor for her leadership, along with  Chairman Pallone and Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez, who have encouraged  us to think big when confronting the threat of climate change.   We are confronting the pandemic without any waste or fraud. That is  through the ongoing work of the Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus  Crisis, under the stewardship of Chairman Clyburn.   It makes reforms to our budget rules so we can deal with these dual  challenges through an all-hands-on-deck approach, while maintaining  fiscal responsibility.   I want to recognize the many Members, especially the Blue Dogs, the  Progressives, and the New Democrats, who worked together to make this  compromise happen.   We are also focusing on those who have traditionally been left behind  through the creation of a new Select Committee on Economic Disparity  and Fairness in Growth.   I want to thank Speaker Pelosi for her commitment to making sure that  our policies lift up every single American.   This new select committee will sharpen our focus on the income and  wealth disparity crisis that plagues our Nation today.   This package honors all gender identities by changing pronouns in the  House rules so they are gender neutral.   Look, we made this change for the sake of inclusion, not exclusion.  But I have got to be honest with you. I heard the distinguished  minority leader say that this rules package was canceling Mother's Day.  I mean, are you kidding me?   He also claimed that these rules make it so Members can no longer say  ``father,'' ``mother,'' ``son,'' or ``daughter.'' Madam Speaker, has he  even read these rules? That is just not accurate. That is not how this  works.   And, by the way, our Founding Fathers are still our Founding Fathers.   Madam Speaker, maybe this is meant as a distraction. Maybe if we can  create a controversy, then we are not talking about the ongoing  pandemic, from which over 350,000 people have already died due to  mismanagement and incompetence, or maybe we are not talking about the  attempted coup being planned down at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. But the  bottom line is what has been said is just not accurate.   I love this. Someone just handed me this. A Member on the other side  from, I think, Arizona, for instance, tweeted:         If I stand up and I say that I am a proud husband of my       wife of almost 40 years now, then they would say that I       violated the rules because you can no longer use any version       of husband or father or gender reference between man and       woman.    I don't know what the hell he is talking about, Madam Speaker. Oh, my  God; that is my response to this.   I mean, Madam Speaker, this is why people really are frustrated with  Congress and with Washington. I think we, in this Chamber, need to hold  ourselves to a higher standard when it comes to facts and reality.  Unlike the White House, this should not be a fact-free zone; we ought  to focus on facts.   If my Republican friends want to disagree on policy, we can disagree  on policy. There are lots of issues that separate us, and we should  debate those issues. That shouldn't be a radical idea. But people  shouldn't make things up just to create a controversy. Accuracy  matters, and it should come before saying whatever helps you get  another hit on FOX News.   Anyway, Madam Speaker, for those who insist on trying to disparage  what we have done in the written rules, I want you to bring the bill to  the floor and show me where it says, in writing, that we are canceling  Mother's Day or that you can't refer to yourself as a husband or father  or mother or grandmother.   Give me a break. Enough is enough. We have to stop this. We have to  focus in on solving the problems that face the American people.    This rules package also requires that oversight plans from committees  include how they intend to combat race, gender, and other inequities.  It makes the Office of Diversity and Inclusion permanent. This will  commit our institution to creating a diverse workforce for many years  to come.   As we tackle these issues, Madam Speaker, this rules package creates  a more transparent process for ideas to be considered. It makes  permanent the requirement that all bills that come before the Rules  Committee get a hearing and a markup first. It preserves the motion to  recommit, while making reforms so that it can no longer be used to  hijack the legislative process for political gamesmanship.  [[Page H21]]    We are also continuing temporary rules changes that have ensured we  completed the people's work as safely as possible during this  coronavirus pandemic. I am impressed with how this Congress was able to  adapt and find a way to function in the midst of this worldwide health  emergency. During the pandemic in 1918, Congress was not able to adapt,  but we did.   I would just say to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle that we  need to listen to the Speaker's recommendation that we all continue to  follow the best and most current health and medical guidance.   Madam Speaker, we acted. While we can and we should do much more for  Americans struggling today, I am proud of what we were able to  accomplish in the last year. It is no small part due to the  implementation of remote voting by proxy and the development of virtual  committee proceedings.   Admittedly, Congress isn't always known for being on the cutting edge  of the digital world. This rules package, however, seeks to change that  even further. It contains many reforms designed to help us better  embrace technology so that we can get our work done as efficiently and  as transparently as possible.   Congresswoman Eshoo and the Select Committee on the Modernization of  Congress, under the leadership of Chairman Kilmer, were instrumental in  these new changes.   Madam Speaker, now, I just want to speak candidly for a moment.   As important as these reforms are and as proud of them as I am, I  know there is something even more important, and that is the foundation  that they are built upon.   Ethical leadership must be the bedrock principle of this and every  Congress. If the American people do not begin to trust their  fundamental institutions again, then division, conspiracies, and  mistruths will continue to fester.                                time  1230    This body, each of us, must do our part. No matter what side of the  aisle you are on or who you vote for, we must hold ourselves to the  highest standard of leadership. People can and should question our  positions on the issues, but we should never act in a way that invites  anyone to question our motivation. That is why this rules package  doesn't just tinker at the edges, it breaks new ground through  transformative reforms.   It removes floor privileges for formers Members convicted of crimes  related to their House service or election. This will ensure that we  can do our work here without the undue influence of law breakers. We  task the Ethics Committee to come up with a bipartisan plan to handle  ``deepfakes,'' because we need to stop the spread, intentional or  unintentional, of manipulated media that is created to mislead the  public.   I will note that we initially plan to go even further, amending our  Code of Conduct with this rules package, but we heard some of our  colleagues' concerns. We agreed to take a little bit more time to get  the language just right, and we will do that through our bipartisan  Ethics Committee.   Thanks to the leadership of Congresswoman Porter of California, we  strengthen Truth in Testimony disclosures for witnesses that testify  before Congress. Now the public and all Members will have more  information about those who appear before congressional committees.   Our rules will further protect whistleblowers. This package prevents  retaliation. It also makes permanent an office dedicated to ensuring  congressional offices know how to handle whistleblower complaints in a  responsible and secure way.   I want to recognize the tremendous work of many people, from Majority  Leader Hoyer and Congresswoman Speier to members of the Progressive  Caucus that made these reforms a reality. In short, we are holding  ourselves to a higher standard, Madam Speaker, not by changes developed  in a vacuum just among ourselves. We also spoke with outside groups and  experts and included their feedback. This is how the package was  developed, through conversation, collaboration, and consultation.   My Rules Committee colleagues, including Ranking Member Cole, offered  input that was invaluable. Our committee chairs and their excellent  staffs worked with us early in the morning and late at night as this  package took shape. I am deeply grateful for the work of all of our  caucuses, including the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, the  Congressional Black Caucus, the New Democrat Coalition, the LGBTQ+  Equality Caucus, the Congressional Asia Pacific American Caucus, and  the Blue Dog Coalition.   The Problem Solvers Caucus was, once again, involved with crafting  this package. I always appreciate the chance to work with Congressman  Gottheimer and Congressman Reed. We even got to work with a new member  of the Problem Solvers this Congress, Representative Van Taylor. And I  could go on and on.   Input from the nonpartisan staffs across this institution made this  package stronger. That includes those with the offices of the  Parliamentarian, the Congressional Budget Office, the Clerk, the  General Counsel, the Congressional Research Service, the Sergeant at  Arms, and the Chief Administrative Officer, just to name a few. Many  staffers worked through the holidays on this, and I am deeply grateful  for their efforts, especially the incredible staff on the Rules  Committee.   Democrats have been entrusted by the American people to lead this  institution, but the rules package is about more than party. It is  about making this Chamber work at its best for the people we represent.  These reforms will do that. They will hold us to a higher standard so  we can get it done for them and in a way that makes the public proud.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to  support in passing this package, and let's implement real reforms so we  can quickly get to work on behalf of the American people.   Before I reserve the balance of my time, I just want to take one  second, Madam Speaker, to thank my Republican colleagues on the Rules  Committee. We don't always agree on everything, but they are up in the  Rules Committee diligently at every meeting making the case for their  side of the aisle.   I especially want to thank my ranking member, Mr. Cole, who cares  deeply about this institution. And while we probably will not agree on  this rules package, we agree that we need to make this a better place,  and we need to hold it to the highest standards in terms of integrity,  and to make sure the American people have trust in what we do here.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his comments, I will put him  down as undecided on this package.   I am sure we will hear more about the motion to recommit throughout  this debate, but I do just want to point out for the record, to be  historically accurate, that the motion to recommit has had many  different forms since its first inception. In fact, it was very, very  different when I first ran for Congress.   But having said all that, I would tell the gentleman that if those  who initiated the motion to recommit way back when saw how it was being  used today, I think they would object very strongly to it. They didn't  see it as a tool to play political gotcha games to undermine  legislation.   Madam Speaker, I would also remind the gentleman that, you know,  quite frankly, most of the motions to recommit that passed, all the  Republicans voted against final passage of whatever bill it was. So the  issue is not one of being a constructive legislator. It has turned into  a political gotcha game.   I think that we all talk about reading the bill. The problem with the  motion to recommit is you don't get to see what it is you are proposing  until a few minutes beforehand. I just want the Record to reflect that.   On the issue of paygo, I would just remind the gentleman that when  the Republicans were in charge, they had this thing called CutGo, and  they exempted all kinds of things from CutGo. They exempted efforts to  gut the Affordable Care Act. They exempted tax cuts for billionaires  and corporations.   So I think what we are talking about is a modest exemption for two  international emergencies, the COVID pandemic and the climate crisis.  Most people, except for a few in Washington, actually believe that it  is not only a national emergency, but an international emergency.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Crist).  [[Page H23]]                                     time  1245     Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a section by  section of the changes H. Res. 8 will make to the standing rules of the  116th Congress and the separate orders taking effect for the 117th  Congress.                                 H. Res. 8                 Adopting the Rules for the 117th Congress                         SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS       Section 1. Adoption of the Rules of the One Hundred Sixteenth           Congress.        This section provides that the Rules of the 116th Congress       are the Rules of the 117th Congress, except for the       amendments contained in section 2 of the resolution and       orders contained in the resolution.      Section 2. Changes to the Standing Rules.        Conforming Change. Subsection (a) strikes outdated language       that no longer exists in statute authorizing the Clerk to       maintain on the House payroll the staff of a former Speaker.       This authority, established through 2 U.S.C. Sec. 5128, was       repealed by Public Law 115-244 in the 115th Congress.         Office of Diversity and Inclusion and Office of the       Whistleblower Ombuds. Subsection (b) codifies the Office of       Diversity and Inclusion, established in the 116th Congress in       House Resolution 6, into the standing rules of the House. The       subsection instructs the Speaker, in consultation with the       Minority Leader, to appoint a Director of the Office from       recommendations provided by the chair of the Committee on       House Administration in consultation with the ranking       minority member. The Office is subject to the policy       direction and oversight of the Committee on House       Administration and will direct and guide House employing       offices to recruit, hire, train, develop, advance, promote,       and retain a diverse workforce; survey and evaluate diversity       in House employing offices; submit a House of Representatives       diversity report each session; and provide consultation and       guidance in furtherance of increasing diversity and inclusion       in the House.        Subsection (b) also codifies the Office of the       Whistleblower Ombudsman, established in the 116th Congress in       House Resolution 6, and changes its name to the gender-      neutral Office of the Whistleblower Ombuds. The subsection       instructs the Speaker, in consultation with the chairs and       ranking minority members of the Committee on House       Administration and the Committee on Oversight and Reform, to       appoint a Director of the Office. The subsection instructs       the Office, under the direction of the Committee on House       Administration, and in consultation with other committees at       the request of their chairs or ranking members, to develop       best practices for whistleblower intake for House offices and       provide training to House offices on how to safely receive       information from whistleblowers.        Continuing Authority to Act in Litigation Matters.       Subsection (c) clarifies existing practice that the       continuing authority to act in litigation matters provided by       clause 8(c) of rule II includes, but is not limited to, the       authority for committee chairs to immediately reissue       subpoenas, prior to the organization of their committees, to       ensure litigation can continue uninterrupted.        Admittance to the Hall of the House. Subsection (d) adds       the Mayor of the District of Columbia to the list of persons       who are permitted in the Hall of the House. The subsection       also adds a new restriction on who may access the Hall of the       House, barring former Members, Delegates, Resident       Commissioners, Parliamentarians, elected officers of the       House, or minority employees nominated as an elected officer       of the House if they have been convicted of a crime related       to their election, or service to, the House.        Gender-Inclusive Language. Subsection (e) modernizes the       use of pronouns, familial relationship terminology, and other       references to gender in order to be inclusive of all Members,       Delegates, Resident Commissioners, employees of the House,       and their families. This also obviates the need for the       former clause 2 of rule XXIX, which provided that ``words       importing one gender include the other as well.''        Committee on Armed Services. Subsection (f) adds the Marine       Corps and the Space Force to the list of U.S. military       service branches covered under the jurisdiction of the       Committee on Armed Services. Neither addition substantively       alters the committee's current  [[Page H24]]       jurisdiction, and both are clarifying and technical in       nature.        Committee Oversight Plans. Subsection (g) requires       committees to include in their oversight plan a discussion of       how the committee's work will address issues of inequities on       the basis of race, color, ethnicity, religion, sex, sexual       orientation, gender identity, disability, age, or national       origin.        Printing and Availability Requirements. Subsection (h)       modifies two requirements related to the method by which       specific types of legislative texts must be made available.       First, instead of requiring that primary expense resolutions       reported by the Committee on House Administration be       physically printed and available on the calendar day prior to       their consideration, this subsection now allows this       availability period to begin when the text is made available       electronically or in printed form. Second, this subsection       modifies the requirement that reports on Senate amendments in       disagreement by a conference committee, and any accompanying       statements, be available for 72 hours in the Congressional       Record. This 72-hour period now begins when the relevant text       is either made available in the Congressional Record or made       publicly available at an electronic document repository       operated by the Clerk.        Committee Vote Availability. Subsection (i) modernizes the       requirement for committees to make the results of record       votes publicly available by removing the requirement that       they be made available to the public for in-person inspection       in committee offices. Committees will still be required to       make the results of record votes publicly available       electronically within 48 hours of the vote.        Amendment Availability. Subsection (j) builds on the       requirement for committee chairs to make amendments adopted       by their committees publicly available within 24 hours by       requiring all other amendments--which includes failed or       withdrawn amendments--to be posted within 48 hours of their       disposition or withdrawal. This requirement does not apply to       amendments not offered.        Truth-In-Testimony Reform. Subsection (k) amends the       disclosure requirements for witnesses appearing in       nongovernmental capacities by: (1) adding grants to the       reporting requirement for foreign payments; (2) expanding the       lookback period for reporting to 36 months; (3) requiring       witnesses to disclose whether they are the fiduciary of any       organization or entity with an interest in the subject matter       of the hearing; and (4) requiring, to the extent practicable,       the disclosures be made publicly available 24-hours prior to       the witness's appearance at a hearing. The subsection also       updates the text of clause 2(g)(5) of rule XI for clarity.        Electronic Filing of Reports and Electronic Signatures.       Subsection (l) authorizes electronic filing of committee       reports, which was temporarily allowed by House Resolution       965 of the 116th Congress, and allows electronic signatures       to be used for signed views in committee reports and for       select forms received by the Committee on Ethics. Reports       received electronically will be processed as otherwise       provided in rule XIII, and committees filing electronic       reports should continue to consult with the Clerk regarding       proper format and other administrative requirements.        Subpoena Authority. Subsection (m) affirms that committees       and subcommittees, pursuant to the longstanding subpoena       authority granted by clause 2(m) of rule XI, may authorize       and issue subpoenas for documents or testimony to any person       or entity, whether governmental, public, or private, within       the United States. The language makes clear that the rule       expressly authorizes the issuance of subpoenas to any current       or former President and Vice President, either in their       personal or official capacity, as well as the White House,       the Office of the President, the Executive Office of the       President, and any individual currently or formerly employed       by those entities. This is not a change to, but rather a       clearer affirmation of, existing authorities.        Committee on Ethics. Subsection (n) provides that a Member       may serve on the Committee on Ethics during a fifth Congress       in a period of five successive Congresses if they are the       chair or ranking member of the committee. It also clarifies       that various provisions within clause 3 of rule XI apply to       Delegates and Resident Commissioners.        Audio and Video Recordings. Subsection (o) modifies the       description of committee proceedings that may not be used or       made available for any partisan political campaign purpose to       clarify the provision's application to all such audio and       video coverage regardless of the specific technological       device recording medium used.        Cosponsorship Withdrawal. Subsection (p) eliminates the       requirement that a Member, Delegate, or Resident Commissioner       obtain unanimous consent to remove their name as a cosponsor       of a bill or resolution, instead allowing the Member,       Delegate, or Resident Commissioner to remove their own name       by making a demand from the floor. The sponsor of a bill,       however, must still make a unanimous-consent request in order       to remove a cosponsor, and cosponsors may still only be       removed until the last committee of referral reports the bill       to the House or is discharged from its consideration.        Comparative Prints. Subsection (q) removes the requirement,       added in the 115th Congress, that prior to the consideration       of bills, joint resolutions, and amendments in the nature of       a substitute, comparative prints must be made available.       However, section 3(j) of this resolution directs the relevant       committees and offices of the House to continue efforts to       further the institutional priority of enabling all House       staff to produce such comparative prints.        Requiring Committee Hearing and Markup on Bills and Joint       Resolutions. Subsection (r) codifies in the standing rules of       the House a separate order from the 116th Congress requiring       a committee hearing and markup in order for most bills and       joint resolutions to be considered pursuant to a special       order of business reported by the Committee on Rules. The       subsection provides a point of order against consideration if       such a measure has not been reported by at least one       committee, effective March 1st of an odd-numbered year. A       point of order also lies against any bill or joint resolution       reported by a committee if the report does not contain a list       of relevant committee and subcommittee hearings which       includes the designation of at least one such hearing that       was used to develop or consider the underlying measure.       Finally, the provision provides exceptions to the points of       order for resolutions continuing appropriations for a fiscal       year, measures that contain specified emergency designations       pursuant to the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control       Act, measures considered pursuant to the Consensus Calendar,       and measures not referred to committee. Pursuant to section       3(u), because of the challenges facing committees operating       during a pandemic, this rule will not take effect in the       117th Congress until April 1, 2021.        Motion to Recommit. Subsection (s) provides that a motion       to recommit (or commit) a bill or joint resolution to a       standing or select committee may only be made without       instructions and is not debatable. It also provides that the       previous question is considered as ordered on any such       motion. The subsection makes a conforming change to the       prohibition on the Committee on Rules from reporting a rule       preventing a motion to recommit in order to remove the       specification that instructions must be permitted. The       subsection also removes the now extraneous mandates that       motions to recommit with instructions must be in the form of       a direction to be reported back to the House forthwith and       that instructions in a motion to recommit to conference may       not include argument. The rule continues to prioritize       recognition of an opponent of the underlying measure, but the       Chair will address contested opposition when challenged on       the floor rather than continuing the practice of querying       for opposition at the time the motion is made.        District of Columbia Business. Subsection (t) removes a no-      longer-used provision setting aside the second and fourth       Mondays of a month for District of Columbia business called       up by the Committee on Oversight and Reform.        Title Amendments. Subsection (u) limits the offering of       amendments to the titles of bills and resolutions to the       Majority Leader or a designee.        Reconciliation Directives. Subsection (v) strikes the       contents of clause 7 of rule XXI, which created a point of       order against a concurrent resolution on the budget,       amendments to a budget resolution, or a conference report on       a budget resolution, containing reconciliation directives       that would have the effect of increasing net direct spending.       Clause 10 of rule XXI, the PAYGO rule, continues to apply to       any reconciliation measure reported pursuant to such       directives.        Availability of Measures. Subsection (w) modifies the text       availability requirement for unreported bills and joint       resolutions by specifying that the 72-hour availability       period may begin when the text of the measure is made       electronically available prior to its introduction. Although       the introduced measure must consist of the exact text of the       language made electronically available prior to introduction       in order to qualify under this updated rule, changes to a       measure's text made after its introduction by a self-      executing special rule do not impact this availability       period.        Prohibited Service. Subsection (x) modifies a provision in       the Code of Official Conduct added in the 116th Congress       prohibiting Members, Delegates, the Resident Commissioner,       officers, and employees of the House from serving as an       officer or director of any public company by replacing a       direction to the Committee on Ethics to develop regulations       with a requirement for compliance with such regulations as       the Committee has since promulgated these regulations.        Code of Official Conduct. Subsection (y) adds two new       clauses to the Code of Official Conduct. First, the new       clause 20 of rule XXIII protects Congressional whistleblowers       by preventing a Member, Delegate, Resident Commissioner,       officer, or employee of the House from taking any actions to       prevent an individual from, or to retaliate against an       individual for, providing truthful information to the       Committee on Ethics, the Office of Congressional Ethics, the       Office of Congressional Workplace Rights, or any law       enforcement official, provided that the disclosure of such       information is not otherwise prohibited by law or House       rules.        Second, the new clause 21 of rule XXIII further protects       the identities of whistleblowers by prohibiting a Member,       Delegate, Resident Commissioner, officer, or employee of the       House from knowingly and willfully publicly disclosing the       identity or personally identifiable information of an       individual who is granted protections under federal whistle       blower laws. Exempted from this prohibition  [[Page H25]]       are cases in which: (1) the individual has provided express       written consent prior to such disclosure; (2) the individual       has already voluntarily and publicly disclosed their       identity; or (3) the disclosure is by the chair of a       committee after an affirmative vote by two-thirds of the       committee members that such disclosure is in the public       interest. Additionally, nothing in this new whistleblower       protection will inhibit the investigation of any allegation       of wrongdoing disclosed by any individual or prevent the       public disclosure of substantive information shared that is       not personally identifiable. Disclosures by the chair of a       committee are subject to appropriate safeguards, including       advance notice to the individual including a written       explanation of the reasons for the disclosure.        Communications Standards Commission. Subsection (z) renames       the House Commission on Congressional Mailing Standards to       the House Communications Standards Commission, conforming to       a change made in H.R. 133 of the 116th Congress. The new name       reflects the Commission's jurisdiction over all mass       communications.      Section 3. Separate Orders.        Member Day Hearing Requirement. Subsection (a) requires       each standing committee (except for the Committee on Ethics)       to hold a Member Day Hearing during the first session of the       117th Congress to hear testimony from Members, Delegates, and       the Resident Commissioner--whether or not they are a member       of the committee--on proposed legislation within its       jurisdiction. The subsection permits the Committee on Rules       to hold its Member Day Hearing during the second session, in       order to receive testimony on proposed changes to the       standing rules for the next Congress.        Deposition Authority. Subsection (b) provides the Permanent       Select Committee on Intelligence and each standing committee       of the 117th Congress (except for the Committee on Rules) the       authority to order the taking of a deposition by a member or       counsel of such committee. Members, Delegates, and the       Resident Commissioner may participate in all such       depositions, but their presence is not required. Depositions       taken under this authority are subject to regulations issued       by the chair of the Committee on Rules and printed in the       Congressional Record, and such authority continues to include       potential supplemental regulations.        War Powers Resolution. Subsection (c) expressly provides       that any motion to discharge a measure introduced pursuant to       section 6 or section 7 of the War Powers Resolution would not       be subject to a motion to table.        Exercise Facilities for Former Members. Subsection (d)       continues the prohibition on access to any exercise facility       that is made available exclusively to Members, Delegates, the       Resident Commissioner, former Members, former Delegates,       former Resident Commissioners, officers, and former officers       of the House and their spouses to any former Member, former       Delegate, former Resident Commissioner, former officer, or       spouse who is a lobbyist registered under the Lobbying       Disclosure Act of 1995 or any successor statute, or who is an       agent of a foreign principal as defined in clause 5 of rule       XXV.        Empaneling Investigative Subcommittee of the Committee on       Ethics. Subsection (e) carries forward House Resolution 451       from the 110th Congress, directing the Committee on Ethics to       empanel an investigative subcommittee or issue a report       within 30 days of the date a Member, Delegate, or the       Resident Commissioner is indicted or criminal charges are       filed. The subsection updates any references in House       Resolution 451 to the Committee on Standards of Official       Conduct to be references tot e Committee on Ethics.        Non-Disclosure Agreements. Subsection (f) continues a       provision from the 116th Congress which provides that Non-      Disclosure Agreements required by offices as a condition of       employment for paid or unpaid staff or contractors cannot       require notice or approval for employees to communicate with       the Committee on Ethics, the Office of Congressional       Workplace Rights, or any other office or entity designated by       the Committee on House Administration; and that Non-      Disclosure Agreements must also provide clear guidance to       that effect.        Requiring Members to Pay for Discrimination Settlements.       Subsection (g) continues from the 116th Congress a       requirement for a Member, Delegate, or the Resident       Commissioner to reimburse the Treasury for any settlement of       a complaint related to a claim alleging a violation by the       Member of sections 201(a), 206(a), or 207 of the       Congressional Accountability Act of 1995, which cover       discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex (which the       Equal Employment Opportunity Commission recognizes as       including sexual orientation and gender identity), national       origin, age, disability, or an employee's service in the       uniformed services, and retaliation for claims alleging such       discrimination.        Mandatory Anti-Harassment and Anti-Discrimination Policies       for House Offices. Subsection (h) continues from the 116th       Congress a requirement that each House office adopt an anti-      harassment and anti-discrimination policy and requires the       Committee on House Administration to issue regulations to       carry out the subsection by April 1, 2021.        Displaying Statement of Rights and Protections Provided to       House Employees. Subsection (i) continues from the 116th       Congress a requirement that the Committee on House       Administration issue regulations requiring each House office       to prominently display a statement of the rights and       protections provided to House employees under the       Congressional Accountability Act of 1995, including       procedures available to employees for responding to and       adjudicating allegations of workplace rights violations.        Broadening Availability and Utility of Legislative       Documents in Machine-Readable Formats. Subsection (j)       instructs the Committee on House Administration, the Clerk,       and other officers and officials to continue to advance       government transparency by taking further steps to publish       documents of the House in machine-readable formats and       broaden their utility by enabling all House staff to create       comparative prints.        Improving the Committee Electronic Document Repository.       Subsection (k) directs the Clerk, the Committee on House       Administration, and other officers and officials to improve       the existing electronic document repository operated by the       Clerk for use by committees. Such improvements are intended       to increase public availability and identification of       legislative information produced by House committees,       including votes, amendments, and witness disclosure forms.        Inclusion of Citations for Proposed Repeals and Amendment.       Subsection (I) continues a requirement for parallel       citations, to the maximum extent practicable, for amendatory       instructions to Public Laws and Statutes at Large that are       not classified in the U.S. Code.        Providing for Transparency with Respect to Memorials       Submitted Pursuant to Article V of the Constitution of the       United States. Subsection (m) carries forward provisions that       clarify the procedures of the House regarding the receipt of       Article V memorials from the States by directing the Clerk to       make each memorial, designated by the chair of the Committee       on the Judiciary, electronically available, organized by       State of origin and year of receipt, and indicate whether the       memorial was designated as an application or rescission.        In carrying out this subsection, it is expected that the       chair of the Committee on the Judiciary will be solely       charged with determining whether a memorial purports to be an       application of the legislature of a state calling for a       constitutional convention or rescission of prior       applications. The Clerk's role will be entirely       administrative. The chair of the Committee on the Judiciary       will only designate memorials from state legislatures (and       not petitions from individuals or other parties), as it is       only state legislatures that are contemplated under Article V       of the Constitution.        In submitting each memorial to the Clerk, the chair of the       Committee on the Judiciary will include a transmission letter       that indicates it has been designated under this subsection       of House Resolution 5. The Clerk will make publicly available       the memorial and the transmission letter from the chair.       Ancillary documentation from the state or other parties is       not expected to be publicized.        Subcommittees. Subsection (n) waives clause 5(d) of rule X       to allow the Committee on Agriculture up to six       subcommittees, which is consistent with authorities in the       114th, 115th, and 116th Congresses.        Congressional Member Organization Transparency Reform.       Subsection (o) continues to allow participating Members to       enter into agreements with eligible Congressional Member       Organizations for the purpose of payment of salaries and       expenses. The subsection requires that for the organization       to be eligible during the 117th Congress, the organization       must register with the Committee on House Administration,       designate a single Member to be responsible for the       administration of the organization, have at least 3       employees assigned to perform some work for the       organization, and had at least 15 Members during the 116th       Congress using a portion of their Members'       Representational Allowance (MRA) to pay for the salaries       and expenses of the organization.        Budget Matters. Subsection (p) reestablishes that the       allocations, aggregates, and other appropriate levels as       contained in the statement of the chair of the Committee on       the Budget of May 1, 2020, as adjusted in the 116th Congress,       are effective pending the adoption of a fiscal year 2021       budget resolution.        Reissuance of Subpoenas Prior to Committee Organization.       Subsection (q) authorizes the chair of the Committee on       Oversight and Reform to issue subpoenas related to the       Committee's investigation, initiated during the 116th       Congress, into the accuracy and timing of the 2020 decennial       census. The subsection also authorizes the chair of the       Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis to issue       subpoenas related to the Select Subcommittee's investigation,       likewise initiated during the 116th Congress, into political       interference in the response to the coronavirus pandemic at       the Department of Health and Human Services and Centers for       Disease Control and Prevention.        Numbering of Bills. Subsection (r) reserves the first 10       numbers for bills (H.R. 1 through H.R. 10) for assignment by       the Speaker and the second 10 numbers (H.R. 11 through H.R.       20) for assignment by the Minority Leader.        Remote Voting by Proxy and Remote Committee Activity.       Subsection (s) carries forward House Resolution 965 from the       116th Congress with the following changes: 1) notification       and availability requirements do not apply to proxy       revocation letters submitted to the Clerk after a Member has       automatically revoked their proxy by voting in person; 2)       committees may hold official business meetings without       submitting a letter regarding  [[Page H26]]       requirements formerly contained in the remote committee       regulations; and 3) the chair of the Committee on House       Administration is required, in consultation with the ranking       member, to identify and submit to the Speaker and to the       chair and ranking member of the Committee on Rules specific       operable and secure technology that may be used to conduct       remote voting in the House--certification of that submission       replaces a previous requirement in section 5(a) of H. Res.       965.        Witness Diversity. Subsection (t) requires the Office of       Diversity and Inclusion to provide a report to the Committee       on House Administration and the Committee on Rules       recommending a method to survey the diversity of witness       panels at committee hearings by July 1, 2021. It requires the       Committees on House Administration and Rules to take any       necessary steps to ensure its implementation by July 31,       2021.        Requirements for Committee Hearing and Markup. Subsection       (u) provides that during the 117th Congress, the requirement       that committees hold a hearing and a markup for most bills       and joint resolutions considered pursuant to a rule (added to       the standing rules by section 2(r) of this resolution) shall       not apply before April 1, 2021. This delay in implementation       is due to the increased difficulty of organizing committees       and holding committee proceedings during the COVID-19       pandemic.        Exemptions. Subsection (v) provides that the Chair of the       Committee on Budget may adjust an estimate to exempt the       budgetary effects of measures to prevent, prepare for, or       respond to economic or public health consequences resulting       from the COVID-19 pandemic; and measures to prevent, prepare       for, or respond to economic, environmental, or public health       consequences resulting from climate change.        Further Expenses for Resolving Contested Election.       Subsection (w) authorizes such sums as may be necessary for       the Committee on House Administration to resolve contested       elections. Funds shall be available for expenses incurred       between January 3, 2021, and January 3, 2022. Amounts made       available under this subsection shall be expended in       accordance with regulations prescribed by the Committee on       House Administration.        Support for Senate Measures. Subsection (x) requires the       Clerk to submit to the chair of the Committee on Rules by       February 1, 2021, regulations establishing a process for       House Members to indicate their support for Senate-passed       measures that have been received by the House, including       maintaining a publicly available list of Members supporting       each measure. The chair of the Committee on Rules is directed       to print the regulations in the Congressional Record, at       which point Members will be permitted to use the process to       indicate their support for Senate measures.        Dissemination of Manipulated Media. Subsection (y) directs       the Committee on Ethics to report by December 31, 2021, any       recommended amendments to the Code of Official Conduct and       any accompanying regulations addressing the dissemination by       electronic means of any image, video, or audio file that has       been distorted or manipulated with the intent to mislead the       public.      Section 4. Committees, Commissions, and House Offices        House Democracy Partnership. Subsection (a) reauthorizes       the House Democracy Assistance Commission, now known as the       House Democracy Partnership.        Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission. Subsection (b)       reauthorizes the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission. The       subsection carries forward and makes minor modifications to       provisions from the 116th Congress to reaffirm that the       commission's budget is in addition to and separate from the       amounts authorized for salaries and expenses of the Committee       on Foreign Affairs, and to ensure equal distribution of       funding between the commission's co-chairs to reflect the       bipartisan structure of the commission.        Office of Congressional Ethics. Subsection (c) reauthorizes       the Office of Congressional Ethics (OCE) and carries forward       provisions from the 116th Congress without substantive       revision except that members may be reappointed for a fourth       additional term.        Select Committee on the Climate Crisis. Subsection (d)       reauthorizes the Select Committee on the Climate Crisis. The       subsection carries forward and makes modest modifications to       provisions from the 116th Congress. The investigative       jurisdiction of the Select Committee shall consist of       policies, strategies, and innovations to achieve substantial       and permanent reductions in pollution and other activities       that contribute to the climate crisis which will honor our       responsibility to be good stewards of the planet for future       generations and advance environmental justice. The Select       Committee shall coordinate with and advise standing       committees with relevant jurisdiction with respect to such       policies, strategies, and innovations. Additionally, the       Select Committee is authorized to receive any records       transferred to it by a standing committee if obtained       pursuant to a subpoena or deposition recommended by the       Select Committee. The subsection requires that all policy       recommendations be submitted to committees by December 31,       2021, and that all reports be submitted to the House by       December 31, 2022.        Select Committee on the Modernization of Congress.       Subsection (e) reauthorizes the Select Committee on the       Modernization of Congress and carries forward provisions from       the 116th Congress without substantive revision except that       the final report shall be submitted by December 31, 2022. All       references to the 116th Congress shall apply to the 117th       Congress.        Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis. Subsection       (f) reauthorizes the Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus       Crisis of the Committee on Oversight and Reform and carries       forward the authorizing provisions from the 116th Congress       without revision.        Select Committee on Economic Disparity and Fairness in       Growth. Subsection (g) establishes a Select Committee on       Economic Disparity and Fairness in Growth to investigate,       study, make findings, and develop recommendations on       policies, strategies, and innovations to make our economy       work for everyone, empowering American economic growth while       ensuring that no one is left out or behind in the 21st       Century Economy. The Select Committee shall coordinate with       and advise standing committees with relevant jurisdiction       with respect to policy related to economic fairness, access       to education, and workforce development. The Select Committee       is authorized to hold hearings and may report to the House or       any committee the results of its investigations and studies,       together with any detailed findings and policy       recommendations it deems advisable. The subsection requires       that all policy recommendations be submitted to committees by       December 31, 2021, and that all reports be submitted to the       House by December 31, 2022. The Speaker is directed to       appoint 15 Members, Delegates, or the Resident Commissioner       to serve on the Select Committee and to designate one of its       members to serve as the chair. Six of the 15 members must be       appointed on the recommendation of the Minority Leader. The       Select Committee will be governed by Rules X and XI, except       as provided in the subsection. The subsection does not extend       subpoena and deposition authority to the Select Committee,       but authorizes the Select Committee to submit subpoena and       deposition recommendations to the relevant standing       committees. Additionally, the Select Committee is authorized       to receive any records transferred to it by a standing       committee if obtained pursuant to a subpoena or deposition       recommended by the Select Committee. $500,000 is authorized       for the expenses of the Select Committee through March 31,       2021.      Section 5. Orders of Business.        The orders of business contained in section 5 are necessary       due to the COVID-19 pandemic.        Subsection (a) provides that on any legislative day from       January 3, 2021, through January 28, 2021: the Journal shall       be approved; the Chair may declare the House adjourned to       meet within Constitutional limits; the Speaker may appoint       Members to perform the duties of the Chair; and each day       during this period shall not constitute a day for purposes of       section 7 of the War Powers Resolution, clause 7 of rule XIII       (resolutions of inquiry), clause 7(c)(1) of rule XXII       (motions to instruct conferees), and clause 7 of XV       (Consensus Calendar).        Subsection (b) grants the Speaker authority to consider       bills under suspension of the rules through the legislative       day of January 28, 2021.        Subsection (c) grants the House authority, through the       legislative day of January 28, to adopt a report from the       Committee on Rules through a majority vote on the same day it       is filed.     Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  the Virgin Islands (Ms. Plaskett).    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands.  [[Page H27]]         Madam Speaker, if the gentleman is interested in honest  debate, I hope he will inform us where in the rules package it says  that you can't refer to yourself as a father, a son, a grandfather, a  wife, I mean, whatever. There is nothing in the rules package that says  that. This is not reality.   I would also remind the gentleman that when he was in charge, this  was the most closed Congress in the history of the United States  Congress.   And if we are worried about protecting our democracy, I hope the  gentleman and others will join with us in protecting the will of the  American people, the millions and millions of voters who cast their  votes for President-elect Joe Biden and Vice-President-elect Kamala  Harris, and vote to make sure we have a smooth transition to the next  administration.   I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. Scanlon),  a distinguished member of the Rules Committee.     Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Castor).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Madam Speaker, I don't even know where to begin.   Look, let me repeat, what we are doing is building in an exemption to  deal with two worldwide emergencies: one is the coronavirus pandemic,  which, unfortunately, this White House mismanaged terribly; the second  is to deal with the issue of the climate crisis, which everybody but a  few Members in this Chamber believe is a crisis.   Madam Speaker, I will remind the gentleman that he has voted for  exemptions when it comes to tax cuts for billionaires and corporations;  he has voted for exemptions when it comes to taking people's healthcare  away from them. So, obviously, we don't share the same values here, but  I am very proud of what is in this package.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/4\ minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida  (Ms. Wasserman Schultz).    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from Florida.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I appreciate the admonition here, and I wish the distinguished  minority leader would have remained because he talked a lot about  debate, and then he gave a speech and ran off the floor.   But I would be careful, I would say to my friends on the other side  of the aisle, about using words like ``hypocrisy'' because I was here  when you were in the majority. You presided over the most closed  Congress in the history of our country, more closed rules than any  other Congress.   The motion to recommit, arguably, is a procedural motion, but when  you closed rule after rule after rule after rule, any substantive  amendment, you blocked. But my friends had no problem with that at the  time, and now, all of a sudden, they do.   Again, I would just say to the distinguished minority leader, who  keeps talking about mind control and people banning him from being able  to say that he is a father or a son, I don't know what he is talking  about. Please show me in the rules package where he can't say all of  those things. There is nothing--nothing--in the rules package.   I would just urge my colleagues--as I said at the beginning, I get  it. The White House is a fact-free zone, but we have to aspire to be  different. We can have our policy disagreements, but we shouldn't be  making things up. I mean, I would like to think we are better than  that, no matter how much we disagree on substantive issues.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), who is the majority leader.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, let me just refer the gentleman to the  Office of the Attending Physician to get the most up-to-date medical  guidance.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I think this is a good rules package. As I said at the beginning, it  reflects consultation with Democrats and Republicans; almost every  caucus that you can think of was consulted on this. I think the end  product is a quality product.    I am particularly proud of the ethics reforms banning Members who  have been convicted of corruption, protecting whistleblowers and making  sure that their identities can't be revealed.   I am proud of the creation of the Select Committee on Economic  Disparity and Fairness in Growth. One of the things this pandemic has  demonstrated is that there are great disparities in this country, and  those disparities existed even before the pandemic. We need to address  that issue.   In terms of the exemptions for paygo, I mean, we are talking about  two international, worldwide emergencies: the coronavirus pandemic and  the climate crisis. I think every country in the world has recognized  that they are emergencies, that we need to think big and boldly in how  we deal with these issues.   The unfortunate thing is we have had an administration that has not  handled the pandemic appropriately, and as we gather today, well over  350,000 people, fellow citizens, have perished.   Let me just say, also, Madam Speaker, that I was also inspired by the  remarks of our Republican colleague   Don Young, yesterday, when he  talked about the need to work together. I was dismayed by the tone of  the minority leader's comments on the opening day. In all of my years  here, I have never heard anything quite so negative and combative.   But here is the deal: We need to figure out a way to work together to  get things done. You don't have to agree on everything to agree on  something. The something we agree on, we ought to move forward. We can  fight about the other stuff.   If we are going to get things done, facts have to matter.   I have got to be honest with you: In listening to the critiques of  this rules package, one of the things that I found particularly  disheartening was the distortions and, quite frankly, the falsehoods  with regard to getting our rules language to be more inclusive. I don't  understand why it was necessary for some to try to make things up. It  does not entice the kind of collaboration and the kind of cooperation  to get that something done.   I am a great fan of my ranking member, Mr. Cole. This will probably  get him in trouble, but I think he is one of the finest Members of this  institution. We work together very well in the Rules Committee,  notwithstanding some very, very difficult debates. But at the end of  the day, I know he cares deeply about this institution. I know people  like   Don Young care about this institution, and there are good  Members on the other side who care about this institution.   We have a slim majority here. If we are going to get anything done,  if you are going to get anything done, we are going to have to find a  way to work things out. But we have to all agree that we want to get  things done.   So it is in that spirit that I hope that this rules package will  cultivate the kind of atmosphere in which we can get some important  things done. Whether it is on the climate crisis, whether it is on  economic disparity, whether it is fighting to end hunger in this  country, whether it is to make sure we can expand healthcare  protections for people, whether it is about justice and fairness in  this country, we have a lot of work to do.   I hope, with the new administration coming in, that maybe there will  be a different tone. Maybe it will be less combative. Maybe the  discussions will be based more on fact. I hope and I pray that that is  the case. But we have to come together, and we have to get things done  for the American people.
