 Mr. President, the National Defense Authorization  Act is the most important bill we pass every year--and especially the  most important bill we pass for our troops. This year is no different.   Some may disagree with me, but let me point you to an old document  not too many people read anymore, called the Constitution; it tells us  what we are supposed to be doing here: defending America.   This is a responsibility I do not take lightly, and I know my  colleagues share in my desire to get this bill passed. I am  particularly eager to get this bill passed because, as you all know, it  is my last NDAA to shepherd through the Senate, and there has been a  lot of them at this point.   Specifically, I want to take a moment to recognize my good friend,  Jack Reed. We are both Army veterans and understand that the most  important thing we do all year is the NDAA, where we work to get the  troops what they need to do their jobs and make sure they are taken  care of. I don't think there are two closer friends than Jack Reed and  myself here in the Senate, and I am proud to have worked on my last  defense bill alongside him.  [[Page S6467]]    This bill is truly a bipartisan, comprehensive product. We have  already agreed to more than 70 bipartisan amendments in the manager's  package of amendments, and those numbers don't include the hundreds of  provisions written by Members that are already in the bill.   It is easy to forget what brings us together around here, but the  National Defense Authorization Act is a bill we must put aside our  differences and pass every year. We are about to enter the 62nd year of  passing the NDAA with far-reaching, bipartisan support.   Senator Reed, the Armed Services Committee, and I, we worked hard to  make this a bipartisan bill--in the base text, in the committee mark,  and now with this manager's package of amendments authored by many  Members of the Senate.   We are one step closer to getting this product to the finish line and  making sure our military is provided for in the coming years.   I can't think of one thing we have come together to pass for over 60  years straight other than the NDAA. It truly is remarkable.   I thank my colleagues for their contributions, I look forward to our  continued debate on this important bill--the most important bill we  will do all year.                            ____________________
