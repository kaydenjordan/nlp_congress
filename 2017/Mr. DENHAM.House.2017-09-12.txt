 Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this bloc, which  includes my amendment to prevent homeless youth and young mothers from  seeing a lapse in service from their runaway youth programs and  maternity group homes.                                time  1700    Specifically, this amendment allows HHS to offer transitional living  programs and maternity group home grants for centers that would  otherwise see a lapse in funding in fiscal year 2018.   This amendment does not increase funding for the program. This  amendment simply prevents centers from facing a gap in grant  eligibility due to a fiscal year which commenced off cycle. Failure to  act will cause runaway and homeless youth and maternity group home  centers across the county to downgrade, discontinue, or eventually  close.   These important centers provide a temporary shelter to youth in  crisis who are experiencing homelessness. These centers teach life  skills and provide counseling and transitional services to homeless,  pregnant, and parenting youth to promote long-term economic  independence to ensure their well-being.   This issue was first brought to my attention by the Modesto Center  for Human Services, which supports individuals and families in  Stanislaus County, California. The Modesto center provides youth  services, mental health services, substance abuse treatment, family  resource centers, shelter services, and community projects. The center  relies on an existing Transitional Living Program grant. The TLP grants  are critical to helping homeless youth find employment and transition  back into the community.   Unfortunately, the Modesto center and more than 100 other centers and  shelters across the country are in jeopardy of losing eligibility for  funding due to circumstances outside of their control. These grants  account for a significant portion of their annual budgets, and a gap of  this length will drastically reduce the services or force programs to  shut down completely.   My amendment implores the administration to authorize bridge funding  to close this gap in grant eligibility, allowing services to continue  until the grant is realigned with the appropriations process. For the  area I represent, losing these grants would have much wider  ramifications for the overall homeless population and collaborative  efforts to improve homeless care and services.   TLP and MGH grants help break the crippling cycle of homelessness. I  call on my colleagues to support this amendment and allow homeless  youth and parenting young people access to life-changing services.
