 Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member Engel and  Chairman Royce for all of their help on this piece of legislation.   I would also like to thank my colleague from New York, Elise  Stefanik, for introducing this resolution with me, which honors the  U.S.-Australia space cooperation.   This year marks 100 years of close cooperation between the United  States and Australia. Dating back to World War I, our nations have  cooperated diplomatically, culturally, militarily, and economically.  Just as we come together on other concrete issues, we must also come  together to better understand what lies beyond our own universe.   This July, Australia set up its national space agency. With this  creation, Australia joined a chorus of nations seeking to understand  our place in the universe.   This isn't the first time our nations have cooperated on space. The  first images of Neil Armstrong on the surface of the Moon were  transmitted to the world through radio stations in Australia.   We have also cooperated on securing our people's futures through  defense cooperation in space. The establishment of Australia's first  space agency is an opportunity to expand on this cooperation towards a  more complete understanding of all of these issues. This includes  manned and unmanned exploration, research across our universities on  astrophysics and other issues, and the development of commercial  options to access space.   This resolution recognizes the importance of this new space agency  and the value of U.S. cooperation with Australia on space exploration.  It also encourages our State Department to facilitate international  cooperation on this issue through diplomatic channels. In doing so, we  will strengthen our partnerships in the region and internationally.
