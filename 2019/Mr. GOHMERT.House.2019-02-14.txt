 Madam Speaker, I, too, miss my friend Walter Jones. I  just greatly treasured the hour each week we spent together visiting.  It was a fitting tribute today at his funeral.   I do want to address this bill we just passed. I had hoped to vote  for it after I was hearing, well, it is not much money; it is less than  $2 billion. But the trouble is there are provisions in here that are  going to make it difficult to remove anybody who is here if they have  got a child in there.   And, yes, I know, there is language that says if it is based on  information shared by HHS, so that means they are going to be covered  up with discovery requests, FOIA requests, probably people will find  Obama judges who let people out.   This was not a good bill in the end. That is why I had to vote  ``no.''                            ____________________
