 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to call for the support of the  Hmong Veterans' Service Recognition Act.   This bipartisan legislation extends veterans' burial benefits to  Hmong and Laotian-American veterans who fought in the United States  Armed Forces during the Vietnam war. These brave men and women risked  their lives fighting alongside American servicemen and -women as  soldiers in the Special Guerilla Units, otherwise known as SGUs.   The SGUs were covertly trained by the CIA during the Vietnam war and  then led into direct combat support for American forces, yet they have  never been recognized for their service, which is why I introduced the  legislation with Congressman Paul Cook, himself a decorated Vietnam  veteran, who was a colonel in the United States Army and knows their  story well.   There are only an estimated 5,000 Hmong veterans still alive today,  with thousands of them in the San Joaquin Valley that I represent.   We extended this honor to Filipino soldiers years ago. I ask that we  honor these courageous individuals with their choice of being laid to  rest next to their brothers in arms. It is the right thing to do.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, the gentleman from Florida  (Mr. Hastings), for yielding me this time.   Mr. Speaker, the United States, as we know, is a nation of  immigrants, past and present. For hundreds of years, people have come  to our shores  [[Page H1455]]  in search of a better life for themselves and for their children.   Immigrants from across the world have made incredible contributions  to our country. We know that as fact. From starting businesses to  healing the sick, to harvesting our fields and putting food on  America's dinner table, to ensuring safety and pursuing justice,  immigrants have made America a great nation because of their  contributions. Yet there have been times when our Nation has struggled  to live up to our own ideals, and right now, I think, is one of those  times.   This week, the President's deadline, March 5, 2 days past, to end the  DACA program took effect, threatening hundreds of thousands of lives of  Dreamers. Now, let us remember, this is because of President Trump's  unilateral action last September to repeal DACA that we are in the  position that we are in today.   Mr. Speaker, I am standing here with the Dreamers, with over 80  percent of Americans, and with many of my colleagues who believe we  ought to fix this problem. I ask Speaker Ryan and I call upon this  Chamber to vote now on the bipartisan, bicameral Dream Act.   This bill would provide permanent legislative protections for our  Dreamers, immigrants who were brought to the United States' shores as  children at the average age of 6 years. For them, America is the only  country they have ever known. The Dream Act will provide these young  people with legal status and, ultimately, a path to citizenship.   In my district, there are thousands of DACA recipients, thousands of  Dreamers, currently, over 600 at the University of California, Merced,  and more than that at my alma mater, Fresno State.   President Castro at Fresno State and I had a meeting with a group of  Dreamers recently. Let me tell you about one student whom I met, who  would be helped by the Dream Act, Rodolfo. What a story he had to tell,  along with the other students.   Rodolfo came to the United States with his mother and siblings when  he was 4 years old, at great risk. He is set to graduate from Fresno  State with a degree in chemistry this year.   DACA gave him the ability to work through school and help his family.  And after all, isn't that the immigrant way?   Just last week, Rodolfo got some great news. He learned that he was  admitted to the University of California, San Francisco's School of  Pharmacy, one of the best schools in the Nation. His dream as a Dreamer  is to use his education and skills to give back to our communities by  providing healthcare to underserved communities.   Rodolfo, we want Dreamers like you here in the United States. There  are over 800,000 of you, all contributing and giving. Many of you serve  in our armed services today.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to bring the Dream Act to the floor  for a vote. Support this legislation. They should not be held hostage  for other agendas that are out there, and clearly this is the case.   This is common sense. I ask my colleagues to do the right thing.  Let's bring the Dream Act to the floor as soon as we can.
