 Mr. Speaker, today I want to take a moment to recognize  the Lake Travis Fire Department and the Bee Cave Police Department that  are in the great 25th District of Texas.   As we all know, yesterday marked 17 years since our country was  attacked on September 11, 2001. We lost thousands of lives when  terrorists wreaked havoc on the United States.   While we can never forget the anger and heartbreak we all felt, we  must also never forget the heroic actions by our first responders.  While people were running down the stairs to escape, men and women were  running up 110 flights of stairs toward danger to save lives.   That day, we lost 343 New York firefighters, 37 Port Authority  officers, and 23 New York P.D. officers.   While we can never truly thank them for their sacrifice, we can honor  them for their courage and valor.   Yesterday, the Lake Travis Fire Department and the Bee Cave Police  Department put on full gear and climbed 110 flights of stairs to  commemorate those who never made it out while climbing those steps.   Mr. Speaker, our first responders are vital to the safety of  Americans, and we must never forget to thank them for all they do. We  must continue to pray for all those affected, and thank those who  selflessly gave their lives for our Nation.   God bless our first responders, and God bless America.                            ____________________
