 Madam Speaker, I appreciate the gentlewoman from Texas,  the esteemed Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee, for her yielding and her  leadership in anchoring this Special Order hour along with our  colleague, Congressman Torres.   I commend both of them for the leadership that they provide in  bringing our voice as the Congressional Black Caucus to the floor of  the House of Representatives during this Special Order hour.   Madam Speaker, I thank our Chairwoman Joyce Beatty for recognizing  just how important it is for the Congressional Black Caucus to speak on  so many important issues.   Today is the commemoration for the Juneteenth holiday that we now  recognize and to commemorate June 19th, 1865, when some of the last  enslaved people in the United States learned that they were free.   But as my colleagues have spoken about here tonight, more than 2  years before the first Juneteenth, President Lincoln issued the  Emancipation Proclamation, freeing enslaved people in Confederate  States.   Instead, though, slave owners hid the news of emancipation and kept  free people in captivity, but on Juneteenth the truth set them free.  And Juneteenth is now a celebration, a commemoration of the power of  that truth.   A lot of people want to hide our history, they want to not speak  about the truth of our history, but there are truths, like  emancipation, that merit us speaking and celebrating and commemorating,  as we are doing. But we also must reckon with the horrors of this past  that is also part of the United States history.  [[Page H2732]]                                     time  2015    As we honor Juneteenth, we must remember the decades of Jim Crow laws  and white supremacist terror that followed even after the freeing of  enslaved Black peoples. We must remember the Tulsa race massacre and  the destruction of Black Wall Street as we do other race massacres that  have occurred during our history. And we must commit to understanding  how systemic racism has shaped our Nation's past and, sadly, its  present.   I am the first African-American Congressman from the State of Nevada,  so I feel uniquely honored to bring the voices of my community and my  constituents to the floor of this House. I am also proud that in my  district and across the Silver State, Juneteenth celebrations have  multiplied in recent years with the help of scholars and leaders,  including Diane Pollard, who literally was one of my educators in high  school; Al Gourrier, Sr.; Deborah Evans; and many other luminaries who  have carried on the spirit of Juneteenth.   This week, throughout my district, we are celebrating the 20th  anniversary of the Las Vegas Juneteenth Festival, which supports  educational programming for underserved youth through the Rainbow  Dreams Education Foundation and the Rainbow Dreams Academy Charter  School.   I also want to recognize the Save Our Sons Juneteenth Festival, which  brings our community together to celebrate Juneteenth and to support  mentoring for underserved youth.   You see, Madam Speaker, Juneteenth isn't just about what happened in  the past. It is what is continuing to happen right now, today, in the  present.   As Juneteenth celebrations grow, so does our collective understanding  about the vibrant Black culture and history that have shaped our Nation  since its founding.   So let us embrace Juneteenth 2021 as a day of truth. Let us remember  the joys and sorrows of our history. And let us build from them toward  a more perfect Union, with true liberty, true justice, and true  equality for all.   Madam Speaker, I thank the anchor for yielding, and I thank my  colleagues for coming to the floor to bring commemoration for  Juneteenth 2021.
