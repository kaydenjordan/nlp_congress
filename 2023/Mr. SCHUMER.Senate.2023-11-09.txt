 Mr. President, today's elections were another horrible  defeat--sorry--Tuesday's elections--maybe today's, too, who knows--but  Tuesday's elections were another horrible defeat for MAGA extremism and  another affirmation for the democratic agenda of jobs, infrastructure,  and lowering costs for the middle class.   By now, Republicans need to admit there is a pretty clear pattern at  play: Ever since Donald Trump was elected President, the MAGA agenda  has led to failure in big elections, in small elections, in red State  elections, in blue State elections, and everything in between. And it  shouldn't be any big mystery why MAGA candidates and MAGA issues keep  turning out to be duds. Americans don't want hard-right extremists and  the chaos they bring to govern this country. Americans don't support a  MAGA agenda that has, at its bedrock, radical attacks on women's  healthcare.   Americans want their elected leaders to choose bipartisanship, to  focus on people's lives instead of cable news shows. Sadly, Republicans  seem mightily impervious to the obvious truth that MAGA equals disaster  for America and for their party.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to legislative session.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to Calendar No. 30,  H.R. 815.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory quorum call  for the cloture motion filed today, November 9, be waived.    I yield the floor.
