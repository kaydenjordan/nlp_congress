 Mr. President, I want to thank Senator Blumenthal,  Senator Murphy, and everybody who has been brought together by this  tragedy that we witnessed in our country--first a few days ago in  Atlanta and then Boulder.   The tragedy is that these are not isolated events; these are the  kinds of tragedies we see all too often and, indeed, every day in  neighborhoods and streets around our country. So it is important that  we come together to talk about the horror of the daily toll of gun  violence and also highlight the horror of the fact that this body and  the Federal Government have not taken action to stop those daily  horrors.   Mr. President, I want to begin by joining my colleagues in reading  out loud the names of 20 of our fellow Americans who have perished from  gun violence just this year, 15 from across the country and 5 from my  home State of Maryland. This is just this year, and this is just a few  of those who have been shot down through gun violence: Caleb Day of  Ohio, age 19; Cody Nichols Campbell of Indiana, age 27; Alex Jackson of  New Mexico, age 15; Gregory Dewayne Lynn Chandler of Texas, age 32;  Debra Derrick of New Jersey, age 63; Jason B. West, of North Carolina,  age 36; Jeremiah Lowery of Louisiana, age 17; Caleb Martin of South  Carolina, age 18; Lavontae Sharron Johnson of Virginia, age 23; Holly  Elizabeth Beard Montana of Alabama, March 11, 2021, age 51; Jessica  Ruiz of Texas, age 20; Najeebat Sule of Pennsylvania, age 24; Ricardo  M. Lopez of New York, age 37; Richard Douglas Sloane of Kentucky, age  33; and Tyree Riley of Indiana, age 18.   In Maryland, my State of Maryland, just this year: April Renee  Lawson, age  [[Page S1757]]  18; Genesis Garrett, age 22; Terry Williams, age 18; Ken Gerstley, age  50; and Guy Thomas, age 52.   We read these names tonight and remember these lives because it is  important to pay tribute to those whom we have lost, but it is also to  make sure that tonight is not the end of their story and that we  dedicate ourselves to turning words into action here in the Senate.   Our country is now experiencing an upswing in gun violence, the  largest increase in gun violence since 1960. Between the years 2019 and  2020, we have seen that big jump, and it should horrify everyone and  give us pause and cause us to reflect.   I have been texting back and forth in the last few days after the  shootings in Atlanta and Boulder with a friend of mine whom I first met  two decades ago. Her name is Carole Price. I met her under the most  tragic of circumstances. Carole and her husband John lost their beloved  13-year-old son John to gun violence. Their beautiful 13-year-old boy  John went next door to play at a neighbor's house. There was a loose  gun, and it was an accidental shooting. John died. He was 13 years old.   Like so many other parents or loved ones of victims of shooting  deaths, Carole had the courage to take her pain, take her tragedy and  work to try to make sure that kind of pain and tragedy didn't happen to  another family in the State of Maryland or in the country. She did what  was within her power.    At the time, I was in the Maryland Legislature, and she came and  implored the Maryland Legislature to do something--something to prevent  this kind of horrible tragedy from being experienced by other Maryland  families, and the legislature acted. Maryland became the first State in  the country at that time to require that guns sold in our State have  embedded trigger locks, safety locks, so that if they were left lying  around, it would be less likely that some 13-year-old boy or girl would  pick it up and shoot their friend. That bill saved lives in Maryland,  and that is because of Carole Price.   Think of what is happening today in our country. The pandemic hit.  What did we do? We worked to follow the advice of public health  experts--social distance, wear masks--and we went into overdrive. We  went into overdrive to develop a vaccine to stop the deaths. When it  comes to the epidemic of gun violence, we see no such actions being  taken here at the Federal level. The normal thing to do would be to do  what the Maryland State Legislature did in response to that tragedy  Carole Price went through--try to take some action to prevent other  families from experiencing that tragedy.   When Carole texted me the other day, it was just another reminder  that the pain of losing a loved one to gun violence never goes away. In  fact, that pain comes back again and again when we see these mass  shootings, and it comes back and again when Carole Price reads about  another boy or girl or another person who died from gun violence in  their home. Again, we see it on a daily basis.   The reason it is so important that we come together and focus on this  is that there are some, I think, in our country who have lost the  capacity to be surprised. I know we were all shocked and surprised  after Columbine, after Sandy Hook, after the Pulse nightclub and the  Mother Emanuel AME shootings, maybe the shooting in Las Vegas. We were  shocked at some point in the past that people would indiscriminately  take the lives of others. We were shocked at the daily toll of gun  violence. Even if it was in a place like Baltimore or another city in  Maryland and it didn't make the national news, it still was a shocking  thing that somebody would just gun down a fellow human being. But now  when we see it happen time and again, mass shootings and the daily  toll, nobody can claim surprise. What is surprising is that, as a  nation, we haven't summoned the will to do something about it the same  way we have worked to summon the will to defeat the coronavirus  pandemic.   In 2019, 757 Marylanders died from gun violence. In fact, it has  become so routine that by this time tomorrow, on the current  trajectory, 2 more--2 more Marylanders will have died from gun  violence. That is 1 State out of our 50 States. This is something that  tears at the fabric of communities in our country. It has had a  disproportionate impact and pain on communities of color.   I want to tell my colleagues about Denise Reid, who knows what it is  like to carry the burden and pain of losing loved ones to gun violence.  Denise grew up in Baltimore. She lost her uncle to gun violence. She  lost her cousin to gun violence. She lost her cousin's girlfriend to  gun violence. Her mother was shot standing in the doorway of their  Baltimore home. Thankfully, she survived. In October 2006, Denise's son  Tavon was shot and gravely wounded, paralyzed from the neck down. He  survived his injury for 3 years but passed away after that.   So tonight, I ask all of us to pay tribute to Denise and to her son  Tavon Terrell Water, Sr., who was gone too soon, but I want to tell you  about Denise because she is an inspiration to us all. She still lives  in Baltimore. She works as the chaplain with the Baltimore City Police,  working every day to serve her community and give back to the city she  loves but wants to make better and safer.   My State of Maryland has thankfully joined Denise and Carole Price  and all those who have lost someone to gun violence by passing  commonsense measures in our State of Maryland. But the State of  Maryland, like every other State, is not an island. We can't do it  alone. We need for the Congress to take action.   If you look at guns that were used in Maryland in crimes, 54 percent  of them come from outside of the State of Maryland, from States that do  not have those kinds of commonsense gun laws that make people safe.   So, Maryland, like so many other States, is calling upon our brothers  and sisters from across the Union to help us take action, and we know  that the public believes and understands that too. Some of my  colleagues have said 90 percent of the American public supports basic  background checks for people purchasing guns.   I want to tell my colleagues about Michael Derrick Baughan, who was  born March 18, 1983, excelled in school throughout his life. He went to  college in Maryland, and then he moved to Delaware. His mother Cheryl  remembers picking up the phone one day and hearing her son at other end  of the line saying: Mom, I went to Walmart and got a gun in 15 minutes.  I can't get a driver's license that fast, but I got a gun because I am  feeling pain, and I have a gun to my head.   Cheryl and Michael spoke on the phone for 2 hours before Michael  agreed to take the bullets out of his gun. But that wasn't the last  time he made an attempt, and Michael died of suicide, gunshot, February  2014.   Whether it is the ease of getting a gun to commit suicide or the ease  of getting a gun to shoot down others, what we have in the country  today is simply unacceptable. As Daniel Webster, who is a public health  researcher at Johns Hopkins University of Maryland, said: Gun violence  is not inevitable. It is very preventable.   We know that. We know there are things we can do to prevent gun  violence. I am not going to go into a litany of legislation that we  could pass to make things better. I do want to point out, though, that  we have an organization, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and  Explosives--the ATF, as it is commonly referred to--whose job it is,  who is charged with protecting the public from the illegal use of  trafficking of firearms. And yet, while we give them that charge, we  give them that responsibility, the House and the Senate, over the  years, have tied their hands. We have handcuffed them. We made it very  difficult for them to do their job. We prevent them from sharing trace  crime gun data on firearms with the public and on people doing research  into the gun violence epidemic. We bar the ATF from legally requiring  gun dealers to keep accurate inventories of their guns and report lost  or stolen firearms. Simple things like that that we say they can't do.   I want to end by talking about an initiative of the mayor of  Baltimore City, Mayor Brandon Scott, who has worked with Everytown, the  organization, to create a cutting-edge internal system to help law  enforcement track and understand and disrupt the stream of firearms  entering the city of Baltimore. They have worked hard to try to  [[Page S1758]]  overcome these obstacles that we put in the way of ATF. But that is a  challenge, and it shouldn't be so hard.   We had a program in the city of Baltimore--still do. It is called  Safe Streets. It is headed by a person called Dante Barksdale. He went  by the name of ``Tater.'' He was known throughout Baltimore as the  smiling face of Safe Streets, which was a gun violence prevention  program.   Dante was committed to the mission. He helped others learn to put  down their guns. Dante was shot to death on January 17 of this year. In  that moment, Maryland lost a son, a mentor, a hero, and as Mayor Scott  called him, a man who saved thousands of lives in our city, thousands  of lives, and yet his was taken by gun violence--gun violence that is  preventable.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I rise today to honor the life  and legacy of Alexander Fuld Frazier, a remarkable constituent who  tirelessly advocated for disability rights for himself and on behalf of  others.   Alec emerged as a leader and powerful advocate for disability rights  and inclusion early in life. When he was 13, he spoke before sessions  of Colorado's House and Senate Education Committees about the  importance of special education funding. Thanks to his efforts,  Colorado ultimately lifted the cap on funds for special education  through a State constitutional amendment. At an early age, Alec was  successful in pushing for change that meaningfully improved the lives  of others.   I first met Alec in 2017 through his advocacy on Capitol Hill. He  shared firsthand how Medicaid made it possible for him to lead a  complete, fulfilling life. Alec was diagnosed with autism at a young  age, and some professionals suggested institutionalization as he grew  up. With the help of Medicaid, he benefitted from many services  including therapy and an emergency brain surgery that saved his life.  Through his advocacy, he stood up for the millions of people who would  have been severely harmed by past legislative proposals to slash  Medicaid.   Alec was a man of many talents and pursuits. He attained his  bachelor's degree in political science and master's degree in  disability studies. In 2014, he founded his own advocacy firm called  Autistic Reality and served as a powerful peer advocate, mentor, and  advisor to others. Alec also published two books, ``Without Fear: The  First Autistic Superhero'' and ``Veni! Vidi! Autism!,'' that shape how  we think about the representation of people with autism and  disabilities in the arts. Through his written and spoken words, Alec  sought to deepen others' understanding and appreciation of the varied  experiences of people living with autism and disabilities.   Alec believed in and exemplified the motto, ``nothing about us  without us.'' Any individual or group of people deserve to shape the  decisions made about them. Alec shaped his own path and destiny, and he  empowered others to do the same along the way.   I ask my colleagues to join me in sending our gratitude for Alec  Frazier's life, as well as our condolences to his father Donald  Frazier, his mother Danielle Fuld, and his brother Nicholas Fuld  Frazier. May we carry on his work to build a more inclusive society  where all Americans can thrive and reach their highest potential.                            ____________________
