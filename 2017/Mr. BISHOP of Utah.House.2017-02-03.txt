 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 74, I  call up the joint resolution (H.J. Res. 36) providing for congressional  disapproval under chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, of the  final rule of the Bureau of Land Management relating to ``Waste  Prevention, Production Subject to Royalties, and Resource  Conservation'', and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the joint resolution.   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Hultgren). Pursuant to House Resolution  74, the joint resolution is considered read.   The text of the joint resolution is as follows:                                H.J. Res. 36         Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the       United States of America in Congress assembled, That Congress       disapproves the rule submitted by the Bureau of Land       Management relating to ``Waste Prevention, Production Subject       to Royalties, and Resource Conservation'' (published at 81       Fed. Reg. 83008 (November 18, 2016)), and such rule shall       have no force or effect.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Utah (Mr. Bishop) and the  gentleman from California (Mr. Lowenthal) each will control 30 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Utah.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks on  H.J. Res. 36.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Utah?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks on  H.J. Res. 36.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Utah?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   For the last decade, there has been an ongoing renaissance in the  United States in energy production. It has changed our geopolitics; our  economy has been strengthened; our security has been enhanced; and  there have been thousands of new, good-paying jobs that have been  created from it. This energy boom, according to a 2015 survey, has  saved the American family around $1,000 a year, and this growth of the  last decade has come in spite of consistent anti-energy policies of the  previous administration's. It has especially hit those of us in the  West very hard--those who are public land States in the West--who use  our resources to fund our infrastructure and to pay for our schools and  our essential government services.   This rule, which is allegedly to help the environment, actually is  designed to stop production; therefore, it becomes a prime candidate  for a repeal under the Congressional Review Act, which was passed into  law in 1996 and signed by President Clinton. At that time, Clinton said  that this was a great way for Congress to be held accountable, and it  truly is in that any rule is subject to this rule if it has one of  three criteria: one, excessive costs; two, it was done beyond the  particular agency's statutory authority; or, three, it is duplicative  or unnecessary or redundant. With this particular rule, we have the  trifecta because it is not just one of those criteria--it offends all  of those criteria.   The Clean Air Act gives the Environmental Protection Agency, in its  working with States, the authority to develop issues and regulations  that address air quality. The Bureau of Land Management does not, and  they are the ones who instituted this particular rule. In fact, the  contortions the BLM went through to say they have the legal authority  is almost embarrassing. The contortions they went through would qualify  for an opening act on the Las Vegas Strip. Instead, it reminds us of  when the BLM came up with the hydraulic fracturing rule only for them  to  [[Page H952]]  be rebuked by the courts for simply doing what they did outside their  delegated authority.   This is the same thing. This is an illegal rule, and it is a costly  one. Our effort to educate our children, to build infrastructure, to  provide essential government services--in other words, to make people's  lives better--depends on our ability to deal with our resources. This  is a costly rule. On Friday, it was estimated by one source that it  could cost the industry up to $20 billion; it was estimated to cost  States up to $6 billion; and it was estimated to cost the Federal  Government in lost royalties up to $600 million a year. It is a costly  rule and is a totally unnecessary rule.   Without this rule, the American energy industry will continue to do  what they have done for well over a decade--reduce methane emissions on  their own by investing in technology that not only helps the  environment, but that helps them grow their business, which will lead  to more jobs for Americans and more funding for State education  programs and infrastructure. Since 2005, methane emissions have  actually decreased even as production has increased, and there is  absolutely no reason to believe that this progress will suddenly stop  because we strike this unnecessary rule, this illegal rule, this  totally redundant rule.   There are some who will say: Well, we need this rule to protect the  taxpayers because we are burning up the royalty payments.   Oh, really? If one looks at the BLM's actions--their management on  sage-grouse, their lease cancellations, pulling acreage out of lease  sales at the last minute, their constant barrage of revenue-reducing  agency actions--you will realize that saving taxpayers money is not the  real goal here.   Look, there are only three things you can do with the methane. You  can build pipelines to capture it and take it away where it can be used  for the benefit of mankind. Unfortunately, the agencies in the last  administration refused to do that. Even though, legally, they had to  make decisions on pipelines within 60 days, there is not a single BLM  office anywhere in the Nation that was meeting that legal deadline.  Instead, it was open for months afterwards when nothing was happening.  If you can't have the pipelines to move it away, you have to burn it.  So, if they won't give the pipelines and if now they are trying to stop  the burning of it, the only other option is not to drill at all.   Our policy should be to fund and make sure those pipelines and those  rights of ways are approved so that we can actually capture the methane  and use it for productive purposes. Unfortunately, this rule's real  goal is to do the third element--simply stop the production. That is  counterproductive.   I urge my colleagues to support this resolution because it will help  people and it will support people. This rule's repeal is a vote for  people and making sure that their lives are better, not worse.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman  from New Mexico (Mr. Pearce), who knows exactly what this means to his  State and his State's economy.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman  from New Mexico (Mr. Pearce), who knows exactly what this means to his  State and his State's economy.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to  the gentleman from New Mexico.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Colorado (Mr. Lamborn).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Colorado (Mr. Tipton), who also understands this issue because it  is part of the livelihood of his constituency.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman  from California (Mr. LaMalfa).   Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the measure for  congressional disapproval of the BLM's methane rule under this  Congressional Review Act. This egregious rule passed in the last few  days of the previous administration is yet another regulatory blow to  responsible energy development on lands held by the Federal Government  for the American people.   I think the American people have a right to expect that their Federal  Government is not only holding these lands, but that it is utilizing  this asset, an asset that can gain income to the Federal Government on  their behalf to maintain more lands, and also to utilize the energy at  low cost from domestically produced energy that comes from their lands,  instead of importing it from somewhere else, et cetera. It goes without  question that producing it here in this country is a giant benefit to  the U.S. and its economy.   As a strong proponent of an all-of-the-above energy approach, I  believe natural gas will continue to significantly transform and  modernize our Nation's energy infrastructure. Domestically produced  energy has so many positive effects it should be a no-brainer.   The BLM claims that this rule helps capture methane waste, resulting  in a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Let's face some facts.  According to a report by the EPA, methane emissions from natural gas  production have decreased by 38 percent in the last 10 years, while gas  production on Federal lands has increased by 33 percent. Believe it or  not, this reduction was done through voluntary action on behalf of  industry, without changes to Federal regulations, in capturing and  utilizing this asset.   Even in my home State of California, the oil and gas industry has  created  [[Page H955]]  tremendous opportunity for our workforce. A recent report shows that  total economic contribution of oil and gas in California, in 2013,  resulted in the creation of 455,000 jobs and $72 billion in value added  to the State economy, approximately 3.4 percent of State GDP; indeed,  no small numbers when the State of California is in big trouble  fiscally, as it pursues more things like high speed rail and other  nonsense.    Stifling this vibrant and booming economic driver in my State and  others would be detrimental to the U.S. economy as a whole, while  making us more reliant upon energy from unstable regions of the globe  and the higher costs to consumers at home and in their workplace.   Furthermore, the BLM falsely claims it has authority under existing  law to regulate oil and gas emissions. Such authority already belongs  to the EPA and the States under the Clean Air Act, not the BLM.   Indeed, the BLM needs to get its priorities and its jurisdiction in  order. The agency spends valuable taxpayer resources developing a rule  to prevent methane flaring, yet denies rights-of-way permitting for  pipelines, which would help eliminate these kinds of releases  altogether. That is one of the important benefits of the Congressional  Review Act is accountability by an elected Congress over a bureaucracy.   Failure to reverse this rule would result in a net loss in royalties  that would negatively impact not just the Federal Government but Indian  tribes as well which rely on energy revenue to meet their health care,  housing, and other needs of their members on their lands.   The abuses and overreach by a previous Obama administration have gone  long enough. It is time we put an end to the senseless,  counterproductive regulations, and restore commonsense solutions to  energy development on the people's Federal lands.   The administration taking credit for increased gas production is  disingenuous, as most of it occurred on private lands, leaving our  public assets and potential unused.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.    I yield the gentleman an additional 30 seconds.   Mr. LaMALFA. Indeed, it would be a loss for the American public to  continue along that path.   Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the efforts in bringing this forward and  the opportunity to have a Congressional Review Act for the  accountability.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from North Dakota (Mr. Cramer), who lives in an area where he clearly  understands what this issue is about.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from North Dakota (Mr. Cramer), who lives in an area where he clearly  understands what this issue is about.    I yield the gentleman an additional 30 seconds.    I yield the gentleman an additional 30 seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Westerman).  [[Page H956]]         Mr. Speaker, I reserve the right to close, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the right to close, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   Much has been said about what Colorado has been able to do as a State  on this particular issue, and that's good because Colorado, as a State,  has the legal responsibility and legal authorization to work with the  EPA on this particular issue. Naturally, industry would be liking that  because the States are far more effective in dealing with industry than  the BLM ever is, which still does not have statutory authority in this  particular area.   In fact, even Colorado has its limits. When they were cut out of the  process on the stream buffer rule that we talked about earlier, they  also joined the lawsuit against the EPA and against the Federal  Government for that particular issue. It is simply hypocritical for BLM  to pretend that this is about waste when they refuse to actually solve  the problem by pipeline approval and rights-of-way approval, which is  the total solution.   So what we come down to is that simply this is a rule that violates  all three of the criteria set forth in the Congressional Review Act. It  is a rule that is terribly expensive; it is a rule that is redundant;  and it is a rule that exceeds the statutory authority of the entity  that is making that particular rule, a prime candidate for use of the  Congressional Review Act, which is our responsibility. It's a  congressional responsibility to establish these standards, not the  executive branch agencies.   If someone has decided not to vote for this resolution, to actually  support this rule, I could ask: What is the deciding factor that pushed  them over into accepting that position? Was it simply because this rule  is redundant and unnecessary? That without this rule, emissions were  being lowered and they were lowered before this rule was implemented  and they will be lowered after this rule is decimated at the same time?  Is it because of the redundancy? Did they decide to vote against this  particular rule because, well, of the cost increase that it will bring?   The idea that affordable energy is being harmed by this particular  rule is real, and that means that any person is going to feel an  increased cost in their energy consumption. Whether it is trying to  heat his or her home or every time they turn on a lightbulb, this rule  raises that cost. Once again, it hurts the people who are at the bottom  of our economic level who are the most vulnerable to these kinds of  increases.   Is that what decided you to vote against this resolution or tipped  you in the balance of trying to support the rule? Or is it simply the  fact that it is an illegal rule? Is that the defining issue, that it  simply is an illegal rule where they have no statutory authority to do  what they did?   If those criteria are not good enough, then I ask you and urge you to  do something that actually helps people and helps reduce the cost of  energy and make sure that we have affordable energy so this economic  and energy renaissance that we have had in the last decade can continue  not just on State and private lands, but it can continue on Federal  lands as well, which it has not done.   We need to do this to support people. We need to do this so that  States can fund their infrastructure and States can actually fund their  education system and people can turn on the lightbulb without having to  take out a loan at the local bank to do so.   This rule repeal is the right thing to do. You should vote ``yes'' on  this resolution because it helps people.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong  opposition to H.J. Res 36, expressing disapproval of the Methane Waste  Rule submitted by the Department of the Interior, Bureau of Land  Management.   The Methane Waste Rule is a critical update to decades old regulation  that provides clear and established requirements for the responsible  extraction of methane gas ensuring that public health is not put at  risk from these harmful emissions.   The rule, crafted in an extensive and transparent public process in  line with the Bureau of Land Management's mandate to capture wasted  methane, includes reasonable reforms to avoid and minimize waste of  natural gas from flaring, venting and leaking from oil and gas  production operations. Grounded in peer-reviewed, scientific evidence,  the rule updates 37-year old regulations to keep pace with modern  technological advancements. It promotes the replacement of older  technology, with new, modern equipment that is cost effective, and,  when combined with a broader scientific understanding of the  deleterious effects caused by these activities both to public health  and the environment, works to better protect the American people from  these harmful emissions.   With methane emissions increasing by 45 percent since 1990 and a 319  percent increase in flaring from 2009, the United States must act  swiftly to not only protect public health, but the environment too.  When these natural gases are released, they emit ozone-destroying  volatile organic compounds (VOCs) which are 86 times more destructive  to the protective ozone in our atmosphere than carbon emissions.   During the development of this critical rule, the Department of  Interior received over 200,000 public comments, hosted public meetings,  and engaged in broad outreach to stake  [[Page H958]]  holders nationwide over a 3-year period. This rule was carefully  developed and thoroughly considered.   Furthermore, it is important that tax payers understand that this is  also a cost-savings rule, mitigating the over $330 million worth of  natural gas wasted every year as a result of flaring, venting, and  leaking.   Ultimately, repealing the Methane Waste Rule would undermine the  health, well-being, and economic prosperity of the American public and  do nothing to combat the growing concern of climate change. I strongly  urge my colleagues to reject H.J. Res 36. Any effort to undermine this  important health, economic, and environmental protection results in a  lose-lose situation for the American public and I oppose it.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired.   Pursuant to the rule, the previous question is ordered on the joint  resolution.   The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the joint  resolution.   The joint resolution was ordered to be engrossed and read a third  time, and was read the third time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the passage of the joint  resolution.   The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that  the ayes appeared to have it.
