 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the proceedings  during the former Members program be printed in the Congressional  Record and that all Members and former Members who spoke during the  proceedings have the privilege of revising and extending their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, today I introduced a resolution designating  this week as National Infrastructure Week.   With every day that passes, the need for Federal infrastructure  investment grows more and more urgent. Our roads, our bridges, our  canals, our tunnels, our drinking water, our sewage facilities--they  are all suffering because the Federal Government has not invested in  rebuilding America's infrastructure.   Lives are on the line because our infrastructure is crumbling, and  our drinking water is not safe. Our constituents are begging us to  rebuild America's infrastructure.   Instead of that, the President is still obsessed with building his  wall. Well, Mr. Speaker, that is not going to work for the American  people.   Americans want water infrastructure that is not tainted with lead.  They want roads that aren't full of potholes. They want bridges that  aren't falling down. They want airports and schools that are safe.   They deserve nothing less. Let's go to work for the American people.                            ____________________
