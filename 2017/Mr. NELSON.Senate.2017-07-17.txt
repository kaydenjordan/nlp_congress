 Mr. President, I came to speak on a different subject and  will not speak at length about the healthcare bill because this Senator  has spoken on a number of occasions about the healthcare bill. Suffice  it to say, in light of what the majority whip has just said; that if we  really did want to seek a bipartisan solution to the healthcare  situation in expanding healthcare for as many people as we possibly  can, then what we do, in a bipartisan way, is start saying: We have a  current law. Let's fix what needs fixing.   This Senator can say there are a number of discussions going on  between Democratic Senators and Republican Senators about doing just  that--about such items as a reinsurance fund to ensure companies  against catastrophe, the likes of which, in a proposal this Senator has  filed, has been costed out. In my State of Florida, it would reduce  insurance premiums for health insurance 13 percent. Ideas like that--in  a bipartisan way--will solve and bring stability to the marketplace.  That is why insurance companies, in fact, are being vigorous in their  opposition to the Senator Cruz part of the bill that basically  destabilizes the market by taking all of the older and sicker people  and putting them in one pot and putting the younger and healthier  people in another pot, which is exactly the opposite of what the  principle of insurance is. The principle of insurance is, you spread  the risk over as many people as you can and thereby can bring down the  per-unit cost.   If we really wanted to fix it in a bipartisan way, we would be able  to, but still, as you can see, there is not the appetite for that in  this highly polarized, highly ideological, and highly partisan  atmosphere we find ourselves in on this particular topic.
