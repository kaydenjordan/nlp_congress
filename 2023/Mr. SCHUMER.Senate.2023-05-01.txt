 Madam President, for months, Democrats have been clear:  The full faith and credit of the United States cannot be held hostage.  For months, we asked Speaker McCarthy and Republicans to present a  plan--a real plan--to avoid default with no brinksmanship, no hostage- taking.   But instead of presenting a viable plan, last week Speaker McCarthy  and House Republicans passed the ``Default on America Act''--a hard- right ransom note--to the American people.   Republicans' ``Default on America Act'' poses two terrible choices:  either default on the debt or default on our country, with severe cuts  to law enforcement, veterans, families, teachers, kids--even cancer  research.   Let me be clear: The Republicans' ``Default on America Act'' has no  future in the Senate, and it does nothing to resolve the looming  default crisis. If anything, MAGA Republicans have made default more  likely by locking the House into an unacceptable and very extreme  position and pulling us even further apart.   According to one report by the Washington Post--and I commend  everybody, Democrat and Republican to read it--but, according to this  one report by  [[Page S1430]]  the Washington Post, many hard-right House Members say their DOA bill  represents the bare minimum they are willing to accept--the bare  minimum.   One Freedom Caucus Member said this bill is ``not a negotiating  piece. It is the deal'' and further added that ``[Speaker McCarthy]  cannot get to 218 with changes to this deal.''   Let me read that again, because it so perfectly captures the  extremist thinking on the hard right, which we all know has tremendous  leverage in the House.   Speaker McCarthy ``cannot get to 218 with changes to this deal.''   Let me just read it again. ``Cannot get to 218 with changes to this  deal.''   Respectfully, that is not negotiation. That is a ransom note. That is  a hostage-taking tactic. It is another sign that Speaker McCarthy has  surrendered to the extremists in his conference, who are ready to let  the United States default unless they get everything--everything--they  want.   Senate Democrats cannot--and will not--allow Republicans' ``Default  on America Act'' to become law, because the consequences of these cuts  for American families would be severe. For generations, Congress has  made spending and revenue decisions as part of the annual budget  process. That is the appropriate place to debate, not here as a  bargaining chip--a take-it-or-leave-it bargaining chip--for the hard  right.   So beginning this week, our Senate committees will do what House  Republicans would not do: hold hearings to expose the damage that the  cuts contained in the ``Default on America Act'' would cause to  everyday American families.   We will show the American people how the ``Default Act'' would rip  away SNAP benefits for over a million recipients and eliminate Pell  grants for tens of thousands of student loan borrowers.   We will show the American people how the ``Default on America Act''  would raise taxes by over $500 billion over the next decade, crippling  job creation, stifling economic growth, and squandering our future  prosperity to the benefit of the Chinese Communist Party.   And we will show the American people how the ``Default on America  Act'' would cut critical funding to nearly all sectors of American  life, leading to fewer jobs, higher costs, and leaving policemen, first  responders, border patrol, and our brave veterans all hanging out to  dry.   We cannot move forward so long as hard-right MAGA Republicans, which  we all know have tremendous, enormous leverage in the House, insist on  their bill--a bill that is unacceptable to the Senate and the vast  majority of the American people.   Sadly, if the hard right continues running the show in the House, the  dangers of a first-ever default will keep growing day by day. And as we  expose this terrible bill for what it is, Senate Democrats' position  remains the same: The only real solution is for both parties to pass a  clean bill to avoid default, with no brinksmanship, no hostage-taking.
