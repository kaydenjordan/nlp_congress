 Mr. Speaker, tax day is a frustrating day for most  Americans because filing taxes is hard. The Tax Code is extremely long  and complex, and filing taxes is a complicated mess of forms and  paperwork.   American families spend $378 billion a year on tax preparation. That  is enough money to send every U.S. family to Disney World. As a  Floridian, I think that would be fantastic.   The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will make things easier next year. This  simple system will allow American families to see rising income and  more economic opportunity. It will allow businesses to grow and expand  and achieve even greater economic potential.   I am proud that the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was passed, and I look  forward to the continuing progress of the American people.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New York for  yielding, and also for leading on the great question of whether or not  we should have a second special counsel to evaluate the misconduct of  the FBI and the Department of Justice in pursuing unfounded and  inappropriate warrants to spy on a member of the Trump transition team  without due process and without proper protocol.   One of the reasons I join the gentleman from New York in this call is  that, currently, the person making critical decisions regarding Hillary  Clinton and Donald Trump and this narrative regarding Russia is Rod  Rosenstein; and I believe Mr. Rosenstein has a series of conflicts of  interest, each of which would independently disqualify him from  overseeing this review; and yet, he continues. That is troubling to me,  and it is one of the reasons why we need to have a second special  counsel.   In fact, it was Mr. Rosenstein who signed a FISA warrant renewal to  spy on Carter Page. He did this, even though the FBI and Department of  Justice knew that Christopher Steele, the author of the dossier that  was the principal basis for that warrant had been deemed uncredible and  had said things that were not true to the FBI.   Mr. Rosenstein also signed pleadings seeking to silence a witness who  may have had information regarding the sale of uranium to Russians. Mr.  Rosenstein took no real action against Bruce Ohr, a senior official at  the Department of Justice, even though Mr. Ohr failed to report the  facts that his wife was moonlighting as a researcher to dig up dirt on  Donald Trump and then commingle that dirt with lies told by Russians  and folks from Hillary Clinton's campaign and the DNC.    Mr. Rosenstein allowed Bob Mueller to pick a biased team, people who  had gone to Hillary Clinton's election night party, people who had  represented the Clinton Foundation when they had been accused of not  producing public documents. Mr. Rosenstein could have stepped in. He  could have demanded a higher standard in the assembly of that team, but  he didn't.   Mr. Rosenstein wrote a secret memo to expand the scope of the Russia  investigation. He approved the raid on  [[Page H3333]]  Mr. Trump's personal lawyer. He took no action on criminal referrals  well laid out by Senators Grassley and Graham, Mr. DeSantis and others,  indicating that Christopher Steele and Glenn Simpson had lied to the  FBI and potentially had failed to register as agents of a foreign  government as they were seeking to lobby for changes to the Magnitsky  Act.   But when Mr. Rosenstein's own action was questioned, when his own  propriety, when his own integrity was called to bear as a consequence  of his participation in the illegal spying by our government on  American citizens, well, he didn't go seek the same special counsel  remedy that he sought to go after Mr. Trump. He went and picked his own  employees to investigate himself.   I agree with the gentleman from New York (Mr. Zeldin), that that is a  standard that erodes our trust in the rule of law. When you have got  one set of rules for the Clintons and the FBI and the deep state and  another set of rules for anyone that has had anything to do with Mr.  Trump, we deprive ourselves of the ability to find the facts, and to  ensure that people who have truly broken the law are held accountable.   I support Mr. Zeldin's call for a second special counsel. I would  note that this is an organic call from the membership of this body. It  began with several members of the Judiciary Committee in July. Under  Mr. Zeldin's leadership, we have had a number of Republican colleagues  sign on, including the majority leader of the House and the whip of the  House. So we invite and encourage our leadership to continue to support  these efforts so that we can restore the rule of law in this country.
