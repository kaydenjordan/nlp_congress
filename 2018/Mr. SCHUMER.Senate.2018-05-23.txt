 Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, first, some good news. As the majority  leader noted, Senators Klobuchar and Blunt have agreed on legislation  to overhaul the way Congress handles workplace claims to protect staff  and others from harassment. It certainly needed an overhaul.  Shamefully, the current system--soon, hopefully, the old system--didn't  do enough to protect victims and hold perpetrators of workplace  harassment accountable.   Among the other crucial reforms, the Blunt-Klobuchar legislation  would do away with mandatory waiting periods that too often discouraged  complaints and let them languish. It would also make important changes  to ensure that Members of the House and Senate are held personally  accountable and  [[Page S2845]]  liable if they have committed harassment.   So I want to commend Senators Klobuchar and Blunt, who worked with  many Members, including Senators Gillibrand, Murray, McCaskill,  Feinstein, Harris, and Cortez Masto, for putting this together. I also  thank my colleague, the majority leader. He and I were involved and are  both cosponsors of this legislation. It is an example, again, of the  growing sprouts of bipartisanship coming forward in this body. I hope  we can pass it quickly, with overwhelming, if not unanimous, support.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on another matter, this morning, with  increasing desperation, President Trump tweeted several inaccuracies  about the special counsel's investigation. No one should take the bait.  I doubt very few who are looking at this in a nonpartisan way will.   The recent demands from President Trump and his allies are just  another part of a shameful campaign of harassment, intimidation, and  obstruction of the Russia probe. It is all too clear that President  Trump and his allies want to change the subject away from the duly  constituted investigation into Russia meddling in the 2016 election and  toward another fabricated scandal.   It began with conspiracies cooked up by Representative Nunes from  ``deep state'' leaks to unmasking requests, claims of phone taps at  Trump Tower, Uranium One, Nunes's midnight run to the White House, and  the infamous Nunes memo. Now House conservatives, with the aid of the  White House, seem to have successfully badgered DOJ officials into  giving them a briefing on sources and methods of an FBI investigation.  That is unprecedented and so very wrong.   Everyone knows what they are doing. They are hunting desperately for  any scrap of information or innuendo that might help them sully the  investigation or provide them a sneak peek at any evidence the FBI may  have against the Trump campaign. If they have to distort and spread  falsehoods about what is revealed in any meeting, they will, and for  the President of the United States to pressure the Justice Department  to reveal details and documents pertaining to an active investigation  of the President's campaign for the purpose of denigrating it is a  gross and unprecedented abuse of power, unlike any we have seen in a  very long time. That is why so many people don't trust this President.   The only thing more outrageous than this meeting occurring at all is  the fact that it is partisan. It is crystal clear that Representative  Nunes intends to interfere with the investigation. He is not a down- the-middle investigator looking for truth. Everyone has seen that.  Nunes gave up any pretense of objectivity long ago in that ridiculous,  late-night charade to the White House. Shamefully, someone I respect  and someone I like, Speaker Ryan, is allowing this to happen. It will  forever be a blot on his record. He can't be so afraid of the hard  right and the President that he would allow this kind of ``banana  republic'' behavior to go forward, and that is what Nunes is doing.   Regrettably, a few of my Senate colleagues seem to be allowing it to  happen as well. Yesterday, I saw that a few of my friends on the other  side sent a letter requesting to attend the meeting and supporting it  but making no mention of the fact that not a single Democrat was  invited.   My Republican friends know we have a process for dealing with the  highly sensitive information of this type. It is called the Gang of 8.  It is bipartisan. It has worked well. Any meeting between the Justice  Department and Capitol Hill about such information should only be  attended by Members of the Gang of 8.    So this morning, Leader Pelosi and I are sending a letter to Attorney  General Rosenstein and Director Wray to request they reconsider holding  the meeting at all and, if they move forward, to do so in a bipartisan  fashion with the Gang of 8. If the meeting goes forward as planned  right now--only partisan, only the worst actors on the House side in  the room--no one should trust anything they say coming out of that  meeting. It will be a sham. It will be a sham.   In our letter, we remind Attorney General Rosenstein and Director  Wray they have a higher responsibility. I know they are being pushed  around by the White House and by the White House's puppets like  Congressman Nunes, but they must resist for the grand tradition of  impartial justice under the law that has been in the veins of this  country, in the bones of this country since 1789. To let this happen is  disgraceful, and the blame really falls on the President and his  puppets like, unfortunately, Chairman Nunes and some of the others who  seem to be going along with him.   One other thing I might say though that I think should give Americans  some solace is, I do not believe for one second that Special Counsel  Mueller will be deterred. All this sideshow, all this attempt to  discredit him and his investigation with all kinds of frivolous, silly,  and often false statements and activities will not deter Mueller. The  American people have the utmost confidence in him. He is a strong man.  He is a quiet man. He happens to be a Republican appointed by the  President's own appointees--hardly some nefarious representative who  came out of nowhere from the deep state.   Mueller is going to go right ahead and see this investigation through  to its natural conclusion. He will follow the facts where they lead.  Americans will have confidence that if he finds something, it is real  and, if he doesn't, he is not whitewashing a thing. That is how he has  gone about the investigation so far. It has resulted in dozens of  indictments, several guilty pleas of top Trump campaign officials. When  the President derogates Mueller and the investigation, he doesn't speak  of any facts or knowledge; it is just wild allegations of something  thrashing about, maybe because he realizes there might be something  there. Who knows?   Special Counsel Mueller is a serious, quiet, diligent man, a lifelong  Republican, a dedicated marine, universally respected. The American  people can be assured that his investigation will not be blown off  course by this hurricane of rightwing lies and intimidation coming from  the President and his minions.   One final point on this topic, with several of his recent claims, it  is clear President Trump lacks self-awareness. President Trump  continues to peddle the myth that a deep state bias against his  Presidency is driving the Russia probe, despite the fact that an active  FBI investigation into his campaign was kept secret during his election  while his opponent's was made public. If there was a deep state trying  to hurt someone, they did a lot more to hurt Hillary Clinton than  Donald Trump during the campaign. Everyone knows that. If the deep  state were truly out to get President Trump, they would have made the  active FBI investigation into his campaign's shady dealings with Russia  a matter for the public record while he was running. This same lack of  awareness--maybe hypocrisy--is apparent when the President reportedly  uses an unsecured cell phone for some of his communications. Can you  believe that after all the hay Donald Trump and his allies made about  Secretary Clinton's handling of sensitive information, that the  President--once in office--uses an unsecured cell phone, despite the  fact that so many around him have told him that might be dangerous? It  is bad for our national security, and his double standard is nothing  short of outrageous.                            ____________________     Finally, Mr. President, gas prices. Few things matter  more to the average consumer than the price of a gallon of gasoline.  When gas prices go through the roof, it eats away at a family's income,  leaving less to cover the cost of anything else--groceries, medicine,  tuition, a nice summer vacation, which families cherish. Recent data  suggests that gas prices are about to climb even higher this summer,  and experts suggest that actions and inactions on the part of the Trump  administration are a major piece of that story.   According to energy analysts and experts, President Trump's decision  to pull out of the Iran deal led to higher oil prices. OPEC has decided  to cut production, also raising prices. Even though President Trump  tweeted that OPEC's decision ``will not be accepted,'' the American  people are still  [[Page S2846]]  awaiting action from the President that will help America's motorists.  He is good pals with the Crown Prince, who is running Saudi Arabia with  the heads of the United Arab Emirates. He seems to have a good  relationship with Putin. Why doesn't he jawbone them to at least stop  constricting production so prices can come down? He isn't. He will talk  to them about other things but not about something so vital to the  middle class.   As a result, gas prices are headed toward $3 a gallon, and the U.S.  Energy Information Administration estimates that the average American  family can expect to pay $200 more this driving season than last  driving season and $250 more than the 2016 driving season. Prices are  up more than 60 cents, on average, from the last day Obama was in  office until today. Where is President Trump?   The rising gas prices will, as one Goldman Sachs economist put it,  roughly cancel out the 2018 consumption boost from tax cuts. Big  touting of the tax cuts, but when gasoline prices take it all away,  where is our President? Whatever benefit working families might have  seen from the Trump tax scam for the rich, if they got any benefit at  all, is being wiped out by gas prices, and what about our Big Oil  executives and oil companies? They got huge tax breaks--huge tax  breaks. Why isn't the consumer seeing any of that at the pump? At the  same time our oil companies get huge tax breaks, they raise prices on  everybody. How is that helping the middle class? Why isn't President  Trump jawboning them like he does on other issues? Where is he?   It is time for the President to stand up to OPEC, to stand up to Big  Oil, and do what is necessary to lower gas prices. Remember, once  again, the hypocrisy of this President. This is the same President who  tweeted multiple times that President Obama was to blame for rising gas  prices. So I would remind the President that the final price of gas  under President Obama was an average of $2.36 a gallon, and the current  price under President Trump is $2.92 a gallon and going up.   I hope, for the sake of the middle class and those struggling to get  there--the folks for whom gas prices really make a difference--that  President Trump takes immediate action to bring down the cost of gas.  He has the power. He can force OPEC to do things by jawboning them. He  can force the Big Oil companies to consider lowering their prices,  given all the profits they got from his big tax bill. Where is he?   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
