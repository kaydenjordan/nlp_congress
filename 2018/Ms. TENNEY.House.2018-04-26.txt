 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize, along with my  colleague Congressman  John Faso, an outstanding group of young women  from Delaware Academy in Delhi, New York. The Delaware Academy Girls'  Varsity Basketball team won this year's New York State Class D  Basketball Championship. It was an intense game with a last 3-point  shot from Logan Bruce that carried the team into overtime.   The game finally ended in the first overtime with Delaware defeating  Franklinville with a score of 54-51. This is Delaware Academy's first  basketball State title and the first State title in any of the women's  and girls' sports. The Delaware team, known as the Bulldogs, has 14  superior talented athletes:   First, the three-point shot, which was made by Logan Bruce, Olivia  Wakin, Kaitlyn Finch, Brenna Gioffe, Julia Burns, Aileen Nealis, Hannah  Baxter, Anna Post, Reagan Bracchy, Meredith Mable, Caroline Grace,  Cella Schnabel, Sophia Wakin, and eighth grader Sylvia Liddle.   Mr. Speaker, I just wanted to have my colleagues join me in  congratulating this outstanding, talented group of women and their  coaches: Todd Bruce, A.J. Mucciaro, and Tom Gliddon, on becoming New  York State champions for the first time.   As a former starting center for my high school girls' basketball  team, I am just so proud to say: Go, Bulldogs.                            ____________________
