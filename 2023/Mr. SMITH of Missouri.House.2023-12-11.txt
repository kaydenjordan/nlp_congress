 Mr. Speaker, the Lower Costs, More  Transparency Act empowers patients and will lower healthcare costs for  millions of Americans.   This bipartisan bill has been a collaborative effort, and I thank my  colleagues on the Energy and Commerce Committee and the Education and  the Workforce Committee for their partnership.   American families have struggled for far too long to afford the cost  of their healthcare. What is worse is they have been unable to  anticipate those costs because our current system makes it nearly  impossible to figure out the actual price for almost any type of  treatment, medicine, drug, or procedure.   The legislation before us would ensure timely and accurate details  about the cost of care, treatments, and services are available and  accessible before a patient goes into the doctor's office or hospital.   Hospitals, insurance companies, labs, imaging providers, and others  would be required to publicly disclose their prices, creating  incentives to lower prices across the board. This bill would increase  access to care by combating healthcare consolidation, which reduces  options and drives up costs.   It also would take an important step to address the soaring costs of  prescription drugs by requiring health insurers and PBM middlemen to  disclose negotiated drug rebates and discounts. It would ease the  financial burden on our seniors, widen access to more affordable  generic drugs, and arm employers with vital drug price information.   This bill would make important investments in training programs for  new doctors to help address the healthcare workforce shortage and  further invest in hospitals that serve high Medicaid populations.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill to deliver a  healthcare system that is more accessible and affordable for the  American people.
