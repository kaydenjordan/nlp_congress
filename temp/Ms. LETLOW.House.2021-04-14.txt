 Madam Speaker, it is an honor and a privilege to stand  here today as the first Republican woman elected to Congress from  Louisiana.   Representing the people of the Fifth Congressional District is a  great responsibility, and I pledge to work hard for you in Congress.   My district is blessed with some of the best resources in the Nation,  and no one knew that better than my husband, Luke, who was elected to  this very seat but who we lost to COVID just days before he was set to  take office.   Luke and I were a team with a goal to better our State and our  country. I want to thank him for paving the way for me. I am here today  to carry that torch forward, to be a voice for our farmers, to champion  education, to help bring broadband to our rural communities, and to  ensure our economy is thriving again.   The last year has not been easy for our country. Too many families,  like mine, have experienced tragedy because of this pandemic. To those  families, I see you, I hear you, and most importantly, I pray with you.   I want to thank my family, both the Letlows and the Barnhills, for  being the rock-solid, godly people you are in my life.   I also cannot thank my staff, the Louisiana delegation, and my  congressional colleagues enough for guiding me and welcoming me so  fully. And I thank everyone who has reached out and prayed for my  family these past few months.   Today, as I start my journey in Congress, I choose hope. I want to be  part of a revival of honesty, integrity, and hard work within these  hallowed Halls. I will stand up for what is right and true, bringing  hope of a better tomorrow for my children and for yours.                            ____________________
