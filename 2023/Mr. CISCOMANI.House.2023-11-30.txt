 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Sabino High  School football team, who recently won the Arizona's 3A Division State  Championship defeating their opponent 68-46.   This win holds special significance in my district because this is  the first time in 8 years that a Tucson-area high school clenched the  football State title.   I also recognize Head Coach Ryan McBrayer and his staff. Coach  McBrayer has a record of 57 wins and only 19 losses throughout his  coaching career. This title is a testament to the dedication of the  players and the coaches, an incredible accomplishment they won't soon  forget.   I am confident that the lessons of determination, teamwork, and  perseverance will stay with these young players for a lifetime.   Congratulations again to the Sabino Sabercats for their successful  2023 season. This victory is a true reflection that hard work does pay  off.    Honoring Debi and Mark Hall for Advocating Against Alzheimer's Disease     Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor the remarkable  efforts of Debi and Mark Hall for their activism and their fight  against Alzheimer's disease.   Earlier this year, I had the privilege of sitting down and speaking  with the Halls, as well as participating in this year's Walk to End  Alzheimer's.   Debi, who spent 40 years as a nurse, was diagnosed with this  devastating disease at the age of 65 in 2020. Her diagnosis spurred the  couple's mission to raise money and support efforts to find a cure for  Alzheimer's.   Now, they are known as tireless advocates in the fight to raise  awareness, find a cure, and support those who suffer from Alzheimer's  and their loved ones.   I have to tell you, I have been around Debi and Mark a few times, and  their love and support for each other is unmatchable. It is lovely to  see the way they look at each other, support each other, and, yes, even  dance with each other. It is something amazing to see.   Our community and the fight against Alzheimer's are stronger because  of the work of the Halls in Southern Arizona.   As we conclude Alzheimer's Awareness Month, I extend my heartfelt  gratitude to them for the dedication and compassion that they bring to  Arizona's Sixth Congressional District.              Remembering and Honoring the Life of Freddy Ortiz     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember and honor the  life of Freddy Ortiz, a devoted CBP agent who tragically lost his life  in the line of duty.   On November 13, Agent Ortiz was responding to reports of illegal  border activity when he was involved in a fatal ATV crash in Douglas,  Arizona.   Agent Ortiz dedicated his life to service to our country, serving in  the U.S. Navy before spending the last 13 years in CBP.   The loss of Freddy Ortiz underscores a harsh reality: Our law  enforcement and Border Patrol put their lives on the line every day  when they wake up and put on their uniforms.   As we gather with family and friends this holiday season, I encourage  you all to remember families like the Ortizes who will be missing a  loved one at their table because he made the ultimate sacrifice.   Freddy's service, sacrifice, and legacy will never be forgotten. It  will never be forgotten.                            ____________________
