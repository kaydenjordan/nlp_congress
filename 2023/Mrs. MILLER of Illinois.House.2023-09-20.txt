 Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Jackson for  [[Page H4423]]  working tirelessly to stop Joe Biden from using our military to fund  abortions and his woke agenda. Throughout this year, we fought to  incorporate an amendment into the Defense bill to protect the religious  liberty of our servicemembers and prevent the Biden Pentagon from  funding abortions.   The American people do not want the military paying for abortions.  Biden's radical leftwing transformation of our military has created a  recruitment and retention crisis which puts our military readiness in  crisis.   I thank my colleagues in the House who have fought to keep our  military from funding abortions. No taxpayer funds should ever be used  to fund abortions, and I will continue to advocate for innocent life.   As the saying goes: ``America is great because America is good.''  Abortion is evil, and we can never become advocates for killing  innocent babies in the womb.
