 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and, more  importantly, for this resolution.    ========================= END NOTE =========================     This is real simple. It is about our branch of government, the  legislative branch, getting the information we are entitled to get as a  separate and coequal branch of government to do our constitutional duty  of oversight.   We have requested information from DOJ. They haven't given it to us.  We have issued subpoenas. They haven't complied with subpoenas.   We have caught them hiding information. They redacted the fact, tried  to hide the fact that Peter Strzok, a key player in both the Clinton  investigation and Russian investigation, was friends with one of the  FISA court judges. That was redacted for no other reason than it was  embarrassing.   And, of course, we know that the deputy attorney general threatened  staff members on the House Intelligence Committee.  [[Page H5828]]    So this is real simple. Enough is enough. Give us the documents we  are entitled to have. Let's have the full weight of the House behind a  resolution saying you have got 7 days to get your act together.   Let me just say one other thing. When have you ever seen an agency  where the top people who ran the Clinton investigation and the Russian  investigation have had this happen to them: James Comey has been fired;  Deputy Director Andy McCabe fired, lied three times under oath, faces a  criminal referral; Chief of Staff Jim Rybicki has resigned; General  Counsel Jim Baker demoted, then left the FBI; Lisa Page, FBI counsel,  demoted, then left the FBI; Peter Strzok, deputy head of  counterintelligence, demoted, and was escorted out of the FBI just days  ago.   When have you ever seen that happen? And they won't give us the  information we are asking for.   Something is going on over there. This is a resolution that is  needed, because it, again, will be the full House of Representatives  saying enough is enough. Give us the information so we can do our job  and get answers for the American people.   That is why I applaud the gentleman's efforts and support this  resolution, and encourage every single Member of this body, as an  institution, to vote for this resolution.
