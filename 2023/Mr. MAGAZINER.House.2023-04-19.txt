 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and remember State  Senator Maryellen Goodwin, a dear friend and public servant, who  tragically passed away this week following a long battle with cancer.   For almost 40 years in the State senate, Maryellen championed the  needs of working Rhode Islanders. She was the lead sponsor of  successful legislation to guarantee paid sick leave for workers across  our State. She spoke up for survivors of domestic violence. She worked  to expand quality childcare and home care.   A devout Catholic, Senator Goodwin delivered a brave and heartfelt  speech on the floor of the State senate explaining her ability to  reconcile her faith with her support of marriage equality.   Senator Goodwin's legacy will live on through the recently passed  Maryellen Goodwin Colorectal Cancer Screening Act, which will ensure  that all Rhode Islanders can receive life-saving cancer screenings.   Senator Goodwin made a difference, and her efforts have made life  better for countless Rhode Islanders.   Mr. Speaker, I join Maryellen's friends, family, and the entire State  of Rhode Island in thanking her and mourning her loss.                            ____________________
