 Mr. Speaker, on this National Miners Day, I rise to  recognize all miners across Montana who work tirelessly to keep our  lights on and our country safe.   It is truly an honor and a privilege to represent the State of  Montana in Congress--a State whose founding history lies in the  hardworking hands of miners.   It is no coincidence that Montana is nicknamed the ``Treasure  State.'' As seen on our State's great seal and State flag: a pick, a  shovel, and a plow along with the words ``Oro y Plata,'' ``Gold and  Silver,'' in Spanish, are depicted front and center, symbolizing our  State's diverse natural resources and our rich history of farming and  mining.   Earlier this year, I led an energy tour and brought several Members  of Congress to Montana to visit the Stillwater Mine in Columbus and the  Rosebud Mine in Colstrip so they could see firsthand the work our  miners do and how critical they are to our national security and  powering America.   On this day and every day, I thank Montana miners for their  indispensable role in the production of domestic energy that keeps  America safe, thriving, and powered.                            ____________________
