 Mr. President, on Sunday, the President appeared on ``60  minutes,'' where he was asked what he was going to do to help alleviate  inflation in light of August's continued grim inflation news and the  resulting stock market nosedive.   The President's response?         Well, first of all, let's put this in perspective.       Inflation rate month to month was just--just an inch, hardly       at all.    ``Let's put this in perspective''? That might be something to say if  the inflation rate had ticked up from, say, 2 percent--the target  inflation rate--to 2.1 percent, but I am pretty sure that that is not  the appropriate thing to say when you are talking about the sixth  straight month of inflation above 8 percent and the ninth straight  month of inflation at or above 7 percent and the 11th straight month of  inflation above 6 percent.   Even more concerning than August's consumer price index rising 8.3  percent from the same month a year ago was the increase in core  inflation--a measure of inflation minus the volatile categories of food  and energy. This measure increased to 6.3 percent in August, up from  5.9 percent in both June and July, suggesting that inflation is sinking  its roots even deeper into various sectors of our economy--or in the  words of a CNBC headline from last week:         Inflation isn't just about fuel costs anymore, as price       increases broaden across the economy.    But, of course, you don't have to take my word for it about the mess  that we are in. Here is what one of President Obama's top economic  advisers had to say last week after August's inflation numbers came  out:         Today's CPI report confirms that the US has a serious       inflation problem. Core inflation is higher this month than       for the quarter, higher this quarter than last quarter,       higher this half of the year than the previous one, and       higher last year than the previous one.    ``Let's put this in perspective.'' That is what President Biden had  to say? Here is the American people's perspective: Fifty-seven percent  of Americans disapprove of President Biden's handling of the economy,  and 37 percent of voters say that President Biden's policies have hurt  them personally, versus just 15 percent of voters who say his policies  have helped them.   These numbers are no surprise. The President may somehow still  believe that he is creating an economy that will ``work for working  families,'' but the reality is that, in the Biden economy, working  Americans are suffering. Americans' utility bills are soaring; their  grocery bills have ballooned; and they are paying $1.30 more per gallon  every time they fill up their car than they were when President Biden  was elected. Real wages have dropped every single month since Democrats  passed their $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan spending spree--the  bill, I would add, that helped plunged our economy into our current  crisis. And 40 percent of Americans report having difficulty paying for  their normal household expenses. Americans are dipping into their  savings or working side jobs to make ends meet. They are charging more  day-to-day expenses on their credit cards. In too many cases, they are  having to visit food banks, which are seeing huge lines thanks to  continued high inflation. What are Democrats and the President doing  about this? Nothing.   Of course, last month, Democrats did pass a bill they called the  Inflation Reduction Act. The problem? The bill will do nothing to  reduce inflation--nothing. Again, you don't have to take my word for  it. The nonpartisan Penn Wharton Budget Model said this about the  bill's impact on inflation:         The impact on inflation is statistically indistinguishable       from zero.    ``[S]tatistically indistinguishable from zero.''   Or you could take the word of the Democrat chairman of the Budget  Committee, who admitted right here on the Senate floor that the so- called Inflation Reduction Act would not reduce inflation.   But it is not just that Democrats have done nothing to help solve our  inflation crisis; they are also on track to make Americans' economic  situation significantly worse.   In August, President Biden announced a massive student loan giveaway  that could cost anywhere from an estimated $500 billion to more than $1  trillion and that the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget notes  would ``meaningfully boost inflation.'' This is a statement from the  Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget talking about the  President's massive student loan giveaway, and they say it will  ``meaningfully boost inflation'' or, as the president of the Committee  for a Responsible Federal Budget recently put it, ``Amid 40-year-high  inflation and despite the administration constantly touting its `fiscal  responsibility,' these changes will recklessly add to the debt and make  the Federal Reserve's job in fighting inflation even harder, which will  amplify our risk of entering a recession.''   Many of us would argue we are already in a recession--two consecutive  quarters of negative GDP growth.   Inflation has spent 8 straight months at 40-year highs, and the  President has decided that now is a good time to implement a policy  that will ``meaningfully boost inflation.''   The economy continues to show signs of weakening, driven in large  part by the inflation crisis Democrats helped create. Major companies  have recently announced job cuts. Sixty-three percent of small  businesses are putting a hold on hiring, and 10 percent of those are  cutting jobs. We have had negative economic growth, as I mentioned, for  the past two quarters. So naturally--naturally--Democrats decided this  was  [[Page S4883]]  a good time to raise taxes on businesses. Yes, Democrats' so-called  Inflation Reduction Act imposes new taxes on businesses to help pay for  their Green New Deal spending.    I say ``taxes on businesses,'' but, of course, taxes on businesses  largely fall on workers and consumers in the form of fewer jobs and  opportunities, lower wages, and higher prices--in other words, pretty  much the exact opposite of what we need right now, with prices soaring  and wages failing to keep pace with inflation.   The Inflation Reduction Act also imposes new taxes on energy that  will drive up energy prices for both American families and American  businesses, imposing further pain on family budgets and likely  prolonging our inflation crisis even further.   The President may have wanted to build an economy ``from the bottom  up and the middle out,'' as he has described it; instead, he and his  fellow Democrats have helped create an economy in which working  families are struggling to make it from one paycheck to the next. And  thanks to the additional tax-and-spend policies the Democrats have  recently implemented, working families are likely to be struggling for  some time to come.   I yield the floor.
