 Mr. Speaker, today is the first anniversary of  complete Republican control of our government--the President, the  Senate, the House.   When they wanted to deliver their tax plan, the largest transfer of  wealth to the richest Americans, they could move with lightning speed.  Bipartisanship? Democrats were completely shut out. Although, to be  fair, Republicans didn't even know what they were voting on.   DREAMers weren't here illegally until Donald Trump ended the DACA  program. If the Republicans had the courage to allow bipartisan  legislation on the floor to fix this problem, it would pass  overwhelmingly.   The Republicans had known for months that the important and popular  CHIP program would end this fall. If they would allow the  reauthorization on the floor, it would pass with 400 votes and save us  $6 billion over the next 10 years.   Republicans should use their complete control of government to  govern. And if they can't agree amongst themselves and want our help,  then work with us, but don't hold the American public and their  government hostage to your most extreme Members and their radical  ideas.                            ____________________
