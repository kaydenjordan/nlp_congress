 Madam Speaker, in a political  environment where even Democrats have cited the Biden agenda as fiscal  insanity, it is reassuring sanity may be returning with the Democrat  Washington Post last Tuesday and Thursday being remarkably sane.   On Tuesday, the lead editorial correctly reviewed, ``President Biden  is facing mounting criticism for inflation's rise to its highest level  since 1982. Unfortunately, the White House's latest response is to  blame greedy businesses. Economists across the political spectrum are  rightly calling out the White House for this foolishness.''   On Thursday, front-page headlines were shocking: Inflation for 2021  highest in 40 years. Trend expected to last for months. Prices become  potent political threat to Biden.   The Democrat elite think they are smarter than everyone and think  Democrat voters and Democrat media are ignorant to believe that  trillion-dollar spending costs zero dollars.   In conclusion, God bless our troops who successfully protected  America for 20 years, as the global war on terrorism continues, moving  from the Afghanistan safe haven to America, as sadly we saw with the  suicide bomber who attacked the synagogue in Texas on Saturday.                            ____________________
