 Mr. Speaker, it is a distinct honor to rise today to  recognize National Police Week, honoring our heroes of the thin blue  line. During this week each year, our Nation joins together to honor  our brave men and women in blue.   In their mission to serve and protect, our law enforcement officers  put their lives on the line each day, keeping our families and our  communities safe from harm. Day in and day out, we witness the  countless sacrifices made by the men and women who serve as our front  line of defense here at home.   We stand to recognize their service this week. We also pay tribute to  those who have tragically lost their lives in the line of duty. Their  bravery and sacrifice will never be forgotten.   I would like to specifically thank the dedicated officers serving  throughout the State of New York. From the New York State troopers to  the county sheriffs and to our local law enforcement, the heroism and  bravery of the  [[Page H4381]]  men and women in blue continues to inspire us all.                            ____________________
