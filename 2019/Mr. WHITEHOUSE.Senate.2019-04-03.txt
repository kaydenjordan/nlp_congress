 Mr. President, in 2002, as Rhode Island's  attorney general, I launched an organization aimed at helping Rhode  Island's healthcare system reduce waste and improve care for our  patients. The first hire at the new Rhode Island Quality Institute was  Laura Adams. Convincing her to join us as president and CEO was our  extremely good fortune. As Laura steps aside from those duties, I come  to the floor today to recognize her many contributions to our  healthcare system, in Rhode Island and nationwide, and to wish her well  in her next adventure.   Lowering costs and improving quality in our healthcare system is, to  say the least, a vital purpose. The Rhode Island Quality Institute was  established to tackle some of the main drivers of America's healthcare  problems, to improve health and advance the quality and value of care  in Rhode Island. Under the leadership of Laura Adams, that mission  achieved national recognition. As Laura prepares to leave, the  institute's innovation and expertise is helping improve care around the  country.   Laura got off to a very strong start. In 2002, the RIQI collaborated  with Surescripts to pioneer a first in the Nation, end-to-end  electronic prescribing system. Today, Surescripts has scaled up to  every state in the country, with virtually every prescriber using it.  In 2007, Child Magazine pointed to the State's uptake in e-prescribing  as a key reason for ranking Rhode Island first overall on its list of  the ``Safest Places in the Nation to Raise a Child.''   Laura then turned to another big challenge for our healthcare system:  hospital-acquired infections. In 2005, with Laura as Principal  Investigator, RIQI launched the Rhode Island Intensive Care Unit  Collaborative to identify ways to reduce the incidence of infections  among ICU patients. By 2012, Rhode Island ICUs had shown significant  improvement on several key types of infections.   In 2004, Laura and RIQI joined the Rhode Department of Health to  apply for Federal funding to build an ambitious, innovative statewide  health information exchange. RIQI took the lead building and  maintaining the resulting system, CurrentCare. It took tremendous  technical expertise to confront the complex governance, business,  privacy, and security challenges involved. Laura, with the assistance  of a talented lawyer, Linn Freedman, proved more than equal to the  task. A 2017 analysis shows that CurrentCare returns millions of  dollars in savings to our healthcare system.   Over the course of the development of CurrentCare, RIQI became the  only organization in the country to win all three major health  information technology grants under the American Recovery and  Reinvestment Act, bringing in a total of $27 million to Rhode Island.  Federal agencies like the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services  and Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information  Technology awarded RIQI substantial Federal grants to tackle difficult  specialized challenges. RIQI has been recognized by government and  healthcare leaders, chambers of commerce, and leading business  publications for its numerous innovations. It has also been  consistently recognized as one of the best places to work in Rhode  Island.   In the process, Laura has won national acclaim. This year, a leading  national hospital publication placed her on their list of ``Female  Health IT Leaders to Know'' for her ``significant contributions to  health IT advancements, leading large teams, initiatives and companies  focused on improving patient care.'' She has delivered hundreds of  keynotes and presentations in 48 States and a dozen foreign countries.  She has been named a cochair of the National Academy of Medicine Health  Data Trust Initiative Steering Committee, and she has been appointed to  numerous professional and corporate boards.   Laura Adams has poured her considerable talent, experience, and  dedication into making the Rhode Island Quality Institute a national  leader in health innovation and transformation. I thank her for years  of service to Rhode Island and to our healthcare system  nationwide.                            ____________________
