 Mr. President, as we work in these remaining days of the       117th Congress, I rise today to ask the Chamber to take needed action       on a critical priority before we close out this Congress.        For all that we have achieved this session, much of it on a       bipartisan basis, I would argue that our inability to move or our       failure to move on this critical issue is a moral failure on our watch,       the failure to get done that which is most basic to who we are, a       democracy, to vigorously defend the right to vote.        Yesterday, our colleagues in the House of Representatives presented       their final findings regarding the tragic attack on our U.S. Capitol on       January 6, 2021. I commend their work and their dedication on this       issue to help ensure that something like January 6--a day that almost       broke our democracy--never happens again.        I believe in democracy. In fact, as a man of faith, I believe that       democracy is the political enactment of a spiritual idea, this notion       that each of us has within us a spark of the divine, and therefore we       ought to have a voice, a vote in the direction of our country and our       destiny within it.        In this government funding legislation we are working to pass, the       Senate is preparing to take action toward the same aim of protecting       our democracy--to prevent future subversion in our Presidential       elections--by passing the Electoral Count Reform Act.        I commend my colleagues for their bipartisan work that will clarify       the role of the Vice President in certifying our Presidential elections       and strengthen our ability to ensure a peaceful transfer of power. It       is part of what makes us America. And I look forward to voting in favor       of the legislation, along with the rest of the government funding bill,       which will send critical Federal investments--investments I fought       for--that will help people in every corner of my home State of Georgia.        But we must be very clear that there is more than one way to subvert       an election and to silence the voices of the people. While the Senate       takes action to protect Presidential elections and the integrity of the       electoral college, in Georgia right now, during our most recent       election, we had to sue officials of the State of Georgia just to allow       people to vote on the Saturday that began the runoff period.        Voters waited in long lines--lines that would have been even longer       had I not sued the officials of the State of Georgia. People stood in       line for hours and hours and hours in the cold and in the rain to cast       their ballots. Now, some folks might be fine with that, but I am not.       You can have a right to the vote and yet be denied access.        Georgia voters decided that their voices would not be silenced. They       did show up in record numbers, thank God. But that does not mean that       voter suppression does not exist; it just means that the people refused       to have their voices silenced.        We cannot in good conscience abhor election subversion in our       Presidential elections while at the same time turning a blind eye when       the voices of voters are suppressed and subverted on a local and State       level. It is a contradiction that I cannot abide.        So while we do the important work today of passing the Electoral       Count Reform Act, we must also pass the Freedom to Vote: John R. Lewis       Act, which will, one, restore bedrock voting protections established by       the Voting Rights Act of 1965; two, set a Federal baseline for voting       standards to ensure every eligible voter has access to the ballot no       matter where they live, no matter their ZIP Code; and three, we have to       protect our elections from subversion by craven politicians. Voters       should pick their representatives, not the other way around. It doesn't       matter if your votes are properly counted if you can barely cast your       vote in the first place.        The Electoral Count Reform Act, while important to pass, will not       protect voters from long lines; it will not prevent efforts to sow       confusion through mass challenges of voter registration; and it will       not stop State politicians from trying to take over local election       administrations.        I would encourage my colleagues to Google a county in Georgia, and       see what has happened in recent history. Just Google Quitman County,       GA. See what happened there just a few years ago, and you will see that       our struggle continues.        So as we prepare now to celebrate Dr. King next month, we must       remember his words, which are as true now as they were back then:       ``Justice delayed is justice denied.'' And I will never stop fighting       to protect our democracy and the sacred right to vote.        I ask unanimous consent that the Chair lay before the Senate the       message to accompany H.R. 5746; that the motion to concur in the House       amendment to the Senate amendment to the bill be considered and agreed       to and the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the       table.         Mr. President, I would yield some of my time to the       gentlewoman from the great State of Minnesota.         Mr. President, my distinguished colleague Senator       Fischer is no longer here, and what I would want to ask her is whether       she thinks the 1965 voting rights law was a Federal takeover of State       elections and local elections. I submit, without the 1965 voting rights       law, I would not be standing here. So I think we should have a       principled conversation about that. More recently, I had to sue the       State of Georgia so we could vote on Saturday.        I would call on the Senate to live up to its obligation, as in       article I. The Senate must pass substantive voting rights legislation.       And know this: I will not rest until we live up to that moral       obligation and do what the people of America have sent us here to do.        I yield the floor.
