 Mr. Speaker, I rise today so proud to stand with my  colleagues and to stand with those who will be marching in 2 days to  remove the scourge, the stain, on American history.   Our Louisiana delegation, as you have heard, has a strong presence  here. We have a strong presence from Louisiana that will march on  Friday: a very young people that get what abortion is. Our great whip  leader, Steve Scalise, would be here, too, were he not recovering from  a surgery. So we wish him the best.   Mr. Speaker, as a Christian, I know that life is a precious gift, and  I believe that life begins at conception. As a physician, my oath is to  protect all lives, including that unborn child. And, certainly, as an  American, I think abortion violates our Constitution's unalienable  rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.   Mr. Speaker, you have heard, tonight, that over 60 million babies  have been aborted. Think what they could have become: mothers, fathers,  sisters, brothers, nieces, and nephews--vital parts of our community.   As you heard from my great friend, Garret Graves, who listed some of  the bills that we have introduced this Congress, we will continue to do  this.   Mr. Speaker, we don't have to continue to put up with this stain on  American history. We can do better. We know how to do it. We must end  this practice as soon as possible and we must prevent this horror from  continuing.
