 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be able  to make my full statement prior to the vote.    Madam President, I come to the floor today to urge my  colleagues to vote for cloture for Elizabeth Allen, the President's  nominee for Under Secretary of State for Public Diplomacy and Public  Affairs.   When we think about Russia's illegal, unprovoked invasion of Ukraine  or China's coercive economic practices, we have to realize we are in  competition with more than just conventional militaries or economic  prowess. We are in a battle over what kind of world we want to live  in. And we want to live in a world where people are free to speak their  minds, free to start a business, free to worship as they choose and  marry the person they love. These are  [[Page S2045]]  the fundamental freedoms that shape the United States and the values  that drive our foreign policy.    When it comes to explaining American values and our foreign policy to  the world, one of the best tools we have is our public diplomacy  programs.   At a time when our adversaries are pouring billions of dollars into  propaganda, targeted disinformation and misinformation campaigns--often  about the United States--we need an empowered Bureau of Global Public  Affairs to tell the truth about U.S. foreign policy. We need to  highlight the millions of dollars Americans invest in public health,  infrastructure projects, and humanitarian relief around the world.   We need programs like the International Leadership Visitor Program  that exposes rising leaders from across the world to America's systems  of governance and democracy, leaders who share our vision of a free and  open world.   We need programs that bring foreign students to American  universities, not only affirming the excellence of our higher education  system but bringing billions of dollars into the U.S. economy.   I could go on.   Our public diplomacy tools are simply the best bang for our buck when  it comes to making sure we expose people around the world to American  values, culture, and the truth about our foreign policy efforts.   We need capable, qualified leadership at the Department of State to  lead these efforts. That is why we must confirm Ms. Allen as Under  Secretary of State for Public Diplomacy without delay. As the current  senior official for public diplomacy and public affairs at the  Department of State, she has already advanced numerous objectives.   As a highly quality professional with a distinguished career and  extensive experience in both public and private sectors, Ms. Allen is a  nominee who will hit the ground running.   She began her career at the Department of State at the Office of  Global Issues and the Bureau of International Narcotics and Law  Enforcement. She served with distinction in the Obama-Biden  administration for 8 years, including as White House Deputy  Communications Director and Deputy Assistant to the President.   As she talked about during her confirmation hearing, she comes from a  family who knows what it means to serve the American people--the  granddaughter of two veterans--two veterans--of World War II, the  daughter of parents who value public service regardless of party.   Ms. Allen understands the importance of making institutional changes  to better educate our diplomats and integrate public diplomacy tools  into policymaking.   I urge this body to support cloture on Ms. Allen's nomination so we  can get her confirmed without delay and spread the good word of  American foreign policy throughout the world.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute.

The total estimated program       cost is $110 million.        This proposed sale will support the foreign policy and       national security objectives of the United States by       improving the security of a NATO ally that is an important       force for political stability and economic progress in       Europe. It is vital to the U.S. national interest to assist       the Netherlands in developing and maintaining a strong and       ready self-defense capability.        The proposed sale will provide a defensive capability for       the Netherlands while enhancing interoperability with U.S.       and other allied forces. The Royal Netherlands Navy intends       to use the MK 41 VLS BIL VII strike length launcher modules       for their new ship class. These modules are intended for ESSM       BLK1 and SM-2 capabilities in support of ongoing and emergent       operational needs. The Netherlands, has previously purchased       MK 41 VLS capability and actively uses it on their current       ship classes. The Netherlands will have no difficulty       absorbing this equipment and support into its armed forces.        The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not       alter the basic military balance in the region.        The prime contractor will be Lockheed Martin Corporation,       Bethesda, MD. There are no known offset agreements proposed       in connection with this potential sale.        Implementation of the proposed sale will not require the       assignment of any additional U.S. Government or contractor       representatives to the Netherlands. However, U.S. Government       or contractor personnel in-country visits will be required on       a temporary basis in conjunction with program technical       oversight and support requirements.        There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness       as a result of this proposed sale.                            Transmittal No. 23-27       Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to           Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act                             Annex Item No. vii         (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:        1. The MK 41 Vertical Launch System (VLS) is a fixed,       vertical, multi-missile launching system with the capability       to store and launch multiple missile variants depending on       the warfighting mission, including the Evolved Sea Sparrow       Missile (ESSM), Standard Missile (SM), and Tomahawk Cruise       Missiles. This proposed sale would provide tactical VLS       capability for the ESSM and SM. The MK 41 VLS is a modular       below-deck configuration with each module consisting of 8       missile cells with an associated gas management and deluge       system.        2. The highest level of classification of defense articles,       components, and services included in this potential sale, is       CONFIDENTIAL.        3.
