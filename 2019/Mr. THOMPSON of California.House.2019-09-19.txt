 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3589, my legislation to  award American cyclist Greg LeMond with a Congressional Gold Medal. I  thank Mr. Graves from Georgia, the coauthor and lead Republican on this  bill. This is a bipartisan measure.   It is clear by the number of coauthors that Greg LeMond has  tremendous respect in this Chamber.   It was pointed out that he was born in California, Madam Speaker, but  he is your favorite son as well, having grown up in Nevada.   Madam Speaker, Greg LeMond stands atop the list of the greatest  American cyclists in our history. His accomplishments speak for  themselves: the only American in history to officially win the Tour de  France, a three-time Tour de France champion, the youngest American  ever selected for the U.S. Olympic team, the first American in history  to win a major cycling tournament in Europe, and the winner of 22 races  overall.   These achievements alone would place Greg firmly among the greatest  of American athletes, but they don't tell the full story.    Greg's career has embodied many of our most cherished and fundamental  values: sportsmanship, sacrifice, and being a good teammate.   Greg won the Tour de France three times, but he could have won even  more. In 1984 and 1985, Greg LeMond was in a position to win the tour,  in position to win another title for himself, but instead, both times,  Greg LeMond chose to deputize himself to his teammates, sacrificing a  chance at the title himself to ensure that one of his teammates would  emerge victorious.   Greg would continue to demonstrate that selflessness for the rest of  his life. In addition, Greg personified the ideals of perseverance and  commitment, never more so than during the 1989 Tour de France, because,  in 1987, as you heard, while recovering from a broken wrist and  collarbone, Greg LeMond was shot during a hunting accident.   Doctors removed over 40 shotgun pellets from his abdomen. He was told  that he would never ride a bike again.   Eighteen months later, Greg LeMond mounted one of the greatest  comebacks in American sports history, winning the 1989 Tour de France  by 8 seconds, the closest margin of victory in the history of that  event.   That victory, on the heels of his gunshot wounds, an appendectomy, a  broken wrist, and a fractured collarbone, was the last time an American  won the Tour de France.   In the years since, Greg LeMond has devoted himself to helping  others. He and his wife, Kathy, are active in numerous community  causes: helping victims of sexual abuse and supporting research into  various childhood illnesses.   Greg LeMond has worked to promote clean and healthy sporting habits  and to encourage young people to live healthy, active, engaged  lifestyles.   More than any other cyclist in our history, Greg LeMond was the  epitome of the ``Breaking Away'' culture: a young kid on a bike, trying  to do things no American had ever done.                                time  1745    Madam Speaker, Greg LeMond is one of our Nation's greatest athletes,  a tremendous role model, and a force for  [[Page H7816]]  good in his community. It is fitting and proper that we honor him with  the Congressional Gold Medal. I encourage my colleagues to vote for  this bill.
