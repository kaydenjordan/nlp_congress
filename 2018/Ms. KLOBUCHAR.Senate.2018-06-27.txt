 Mr. President, today I wish to discuss votes on final  passage of H.R. 5895 and the motion to invoke cloture on the motion to  proceed to H.R. 2.   I was not in Washington on Monday because I was visiting Senator John  McCain at his ranch in Arizona.   The Energy and Water, Legislative Branch, and Military Construction  and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Act of 2019, H.R. 5895, is the  result of a commendable bipartisan negotiation process led by Chairman  Shelby and Ranking Member Leahy of the Appropriations Committee. The  bill includes strong funding for ongoing work on Bureau of Reclamation  rural water projects like the Lewis & Clark Regional Water System that  will benefit approximately 300,000 people in the southwest Minnesota,  southeast South Dakota, and northwest Iowa regions. The bill also  includes legislation I led with Senator Tillis to create a center of  excellence within the Department of Veterans Affairs to address the  health conditions relating to exposure to burn pits. Had I been in  Washington, I would have voted in favor of its passage.   The Agriculture and Nutrition Act, H.R. 2, passed the Senate  Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry Committee by a vote of 20 to 1.  The bill will provide critical investments in communities in Minnesota  and will provide much-needed certainty for our farmers and ranchers.  The bill includes provisions I championed to continue investments in  renewable energy programs, create an animal disease and disaster  program, and provide support for our dairy farmers. Had I been in  Washington, I would have voted in favor of the motion to invoke cloture  on the motion to proceed to the bill.   Thank you.                            ____________________
