 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to convey my strong  concerns about President Trump's nominee for the Supreme Court, Judge  Brett Kavanaugh.   If confirmed, Judge Kavanaugh will be in a crucial position to  reshape the laws around a woman's right to make her own medical  decisions, but also he will be in a position to affect the right to  access quality and affordable healthcare for millions of Americans, and  legal protections for LGBTQ citizens.   I am disturbed by Judge Kavanaugh's record on these issues and many  others.   Millions of Americans rely on the Supreme Court to uphold these hard- won rights, and they are increasingly imperiled.   My colleagues in the Senate must be sure that Judge Kavanaugh  continues to do what the Supreme Court has done for years: preserve,  protect, and uphold these constitutional rights for all Americans.   If they cannot be sure that Judge Kavanaugh will do so, they must  reject his nomination.                            ____________________
