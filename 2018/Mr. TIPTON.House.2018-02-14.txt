 Mr. Speaker, it is interesting being able to listen to  this debate. The common ground is we want to be able to have consumers  have access to capital, and we also want responsible lending. We now  need to reset this debate to the reality that is being faced on the  ground.   In an already challenging loan environment for many banks nationwide,  the Madden v. Midland decision has further limited the ability of  national banks to be able to issue credit. Because of the court's  decision not to apply the valid-when-made doctrine to its decision,  which would have preserved lawful interest rates originated by a bank  for nonbanks and third parties, access to credit and risk mitigation  tools have been placed into jeopardy.    The legal uncertainty resulting from the Madden decision has led to a  reduction in responsible and affordable lending, and has limited  consumers' access to better and cheaper choices.   Fortunately, the vice chairman's legislation, the Protecting  Consumers' Access to Credit Act of 2017, would reassert the valid-when- made principle, to ensure that a loan that is valid at its inception  cannot become invalid or unenforceable upon a subsequent transfer to  another person or party.   This legislation promotes healthy financial markets and would help  improve the often-limiting loan environment facing banks nationwide.  This  [[Page H1152]]  measure is important for our families and small businesses, for whom  access to credit is critical to success.   Further, this legislation ensures that innovative marketplace lending  remains intact while simultaneously providing safe consumer  protections.   I would like to thank Mr. McHenry for supporting and developing this  bipartisan legislation to be able to help preserve access to credit for  those who need it most, and I encourage my colleagues to support the  measure here today.
