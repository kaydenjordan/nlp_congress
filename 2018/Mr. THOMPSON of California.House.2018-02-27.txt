 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding, and I ask my good friend from Massachusetts, in the revision  of his remarks, if he wouldn't just clear up one point. He had  mentioned that this Congress has not done anything in regard to gun  violence prevention, and while true, it is not completely accurate.    The fact of the matter is, this Congress is controlled by the  Republican Party. The Republican Party determines what bills go for a  hearing, what bills come up for a vote. So the fact is, this is a  Republican problem. They are the ones that are stopping commonsense gun  violence prevention legislation from coming up for a vote to make the  American people more safe.   Mr. Speaker, there are many important bills that this House could be  considering, but none more important than legislation that would save  lives  [[Page H1284]]  and prevent gun violence. There is no single bill, nor policy, that  will end gun violence in America, but we do know that background checks  work. Every day, background checks stop more than 170 felons, some 50  domestic abusers, and nearly 20 fugitives from buying a gun.   Unfortunately, those folks who were blocked from buying a gun from a  licensed dealer can go around the block, around the corner, or down the  street to a gun show or to an online site and get a gun, oftentimes the  same gun, without having to go through a background check.   There is a reason that 97 percent of Americans want to expand and  strengthen our background check system. Even the President has come out  and said that he is in support of this. I can't think of many things  that Americans agree on 90 percent of the time, but they do so on  background checks.   We have a bipartisan bill ready to go. H.R. 4240, both Democrats and  Republicans coauthoring that bill, the Public Safety and Second  Amendment Rights Protection Act, would help get more records into the  NICS system and would expand background checks to all commercial sales.                                time  1215    We shouldn't have to wait for another mass shooting, and we shouldn't  have to wait for the 44th moment of silence. Let's act now. Oppose the  previous question and give us a vote on H.R. 4240.   How many more people have to die before Members of this body will  muster the courage to bring background check legislation that will help  to the floor of this House for a vote?    Mr. Speaker, I have a privileged  resolution at the desk, which I have previously noticed.    Mr. Speaker, yes, I do.    Mr. Speaker, it is our duty as lawmakers  and Representatives to pass laws that will make our communities safer.  So far, Mr. Speaker, Congress has done nothing in regard to gun  violence prevention, and that is shameful.   Every Member here knows that something must be done about gun  violence. We may not all agree on what that is, but everyone, from the  President of the United States of America to the inspiring young  leaders who are leading a movement today out of Florida, agrees we must  expand background checks. That is why we need this resolution and why  we must take up the bipartisan background bill immediately. You cannot  table the 30 people a day who are killed by someone using a gun.   Let us have this vote, Mr. Speaker. We have had too many moments of  silence. We have got a bill that is ready to come to the floor. It is  bipartisan, Democrats and Republicans supporting the bill, coauthoring  the bill.   Ninety-seven percent of the American people believe that we should  take up and vote for a measure regarding background checks. This is a  good bill. It should be brought to the floor.   The Republicans should not be silencing the wishes of the American  people. The Republican majority should not disallow hearings and votes  on this bill.   Mr. Speaker, it is past time.    Mr. Speaker, I appeal the ruling of the  Chair.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas  and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
