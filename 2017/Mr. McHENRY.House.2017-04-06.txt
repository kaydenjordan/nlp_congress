 Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to be here today, the day  after the fifth anniversary of the JOBS Act.   Five years ago, yesterday, in a bipartisan way, this divided House,  this divided government that got next to nothing done, in a bipartisan  way, was able to achieve a huge bipartisan victory to help small  businesses raise capital. In light of that and in that history, in that  spirit, we have reached across the aisle, and Representative Velazquez  and Ranking Member Waters worked with me to craft a very good bill here  today.   This bill is targeted at small businesses across the rest of the  country. We know that 78 percent of venture capital goes to just three  States. If you are in Austin, Boston, or the Silicon Valley, you have  capital flowing to you; you have funds for your idea. The rest of the  country, whether you are in an urban area or rural area, is starved for  capital.   In light of that problem, we are trying to work for a solution for  those small businesses, those innovators with good ideas that maybe  don't have the best access to capital. We raised the cap on angel  investing, thereby allowing more people to participate at a lower  threshold dollar amount while still including important investor  protection.   Today is a great victory for small-business folks that need access,  that need capital to take their idea to market. Mr. Speaker, I urge my  colleagues to support this measure.
