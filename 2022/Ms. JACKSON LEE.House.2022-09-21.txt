 Madam Speaker, I rise today to support the  Presidential Election Reform Act which is long overdue.   As I stand in the well, I can still see the images of January 6,  2021. I can hear the gunfire. I can hear and see the directions of our  very able Capitol Police to tell Members to hit the ground. I can see  the banging on the doors.   Thank goodness this act will reform the electoral count to ensure  that Congress counts the votes as required by the Constitution,  including by ensuring that Congress receive a single accurate electoral  count certificate from each State--no phony electors as evidenced by  President Trump's attempt to bring down this Nation.   Requiring that the States select electors to accomplish this in  accordance with State law existing as of the last election, it will  reaffirm that the Vice President's role at the count is ministerial,  raise the objection threshold to one-third instead of one person, one  Member, and limit the explicit constitutional grounds upon which  Members may object to a State electoral vote. They will list the  explicit constitutional grounds. There will be order to the process.   This is a democracy admired around the world. We must defend this  democracy, and we are defending it by voting today on the Presidential  Election Reform Act. This is what we should do, the Presidential  Election Reform Act.                            ____________________
