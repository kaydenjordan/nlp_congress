 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, last night, the Air Force announced some  historic news for South Dakota, and today I am proud to share that  Ellsworth Air Force Base in Western South Dakota has been officially  named Main Operating Base 1 for the future B-21 Bomber, home of the  Raider. This designation not only means that Ellsworth will be the  first base to host the B-21 Raider, but it will also host the formal  training unit and the first operational squadron.   Those who have heard me talk about the importance of this decision  likely know the outlook for the base wasn't so rosy 16 years ago. I had  just arrived here in the Senate in 2005 when Ellsworth was placed on  the base realignment and closure, or BRAC, list that May. It was an  all-hands effort by the congressional delegation and Ellsworth and  State and community leaders to make the case to the Bush administration  and to the BRAC Commission to remove Ellsworth from the closure list.   Many thought South Dakota might not have the clout to make this  stand; that we didn't wield enough influence. We were only given about  a 12-percent odds of pulling through, but we were determined that we  weren't going to lose Ellsworth.   We started by challenging the cost-savings assumptions of the BRAC  Commission, which began to unravel under  [[Page S4025]]  scrutiny, and we proved it would actually cost money to close  Ellsworth. We also pressed the Commissioners not to put all of our eggs  in one basket when it comes to our Nation's security interests,  highlighting the organizational risk of consolidating all of our B-1s  at one location. The outlook was grim, but we stood our ground and we  won the day and we were removed from the BRAC list that August.   But we didn't stop there. We got right to work on building up the  base so that we would never again find ourselves in the same position.  In 2007, we saw the Air Force Financial Services Center open at  Ellsworth; 2011, saw the arrival of the 89th Attack Squadron and its  command and control stations for MQ-9 Reapers. In 2015, a decade-long  mission paid off with the quadrupling of the training airspace for the  base. The Powder River Training Complex is now the largest training  airspace in the continental United States and can be used for large- force exercises that draw combat aircraft from across the country, and  it is well suited for B-21 training. This is just one of the efforts  that we undertook to put Ellsworth in the best position possible to  secure this new mission, and it is wonderful to see it pay off with  yesterday's announcement.   I know that while South Dakota is celebrating today, others are  disappointed in this decision. For those who were seeking to have the  Main Operating Base 1 in their State but will now follow Ellsworth in  the sequencing and wait a little longer for the B-21 mission to arrive,  know this: My support for the B-21 enterprise will not lessen because  we are at this milestone.   As I said, we argued 15 years ago that the United States should not  put all its eggs in one basket when it comes to strategic assets. I  stand by that reasoning to this day. Under the current bomber roadmap,  every bomber base will keep a bomber mission well into the future. The  Stealth B-21 will eventually replace our B-1s and Stealth B-2s at bases  around the country. Meanwhile, our fleet of B-52s will be given new  modern engines through a service life extension program. All of our  bomber bases which have played and continue to play an essential role  in our national security will continue to do so. Long-range strike will  remain a team effort.   The core of our military strength is our men and women in uniform.  They volunteer to lay down their lives, if necessary, in the service of  our Nation, and it is incumbent on us here in Congress to do our part  to ensure that they have the tools they need to succeed in their  missions.   The B-21 is an essential part of that equation. I remind my  colleagues that the United States is one of only three countries in the  world that operate a strategic bomber. The other two countries are  Russia and China, and they are both working to develop their own next- generation bombers. We cannot afford to cede any ground.   The B-21 is scheduled to take its first flight in 2022 and should  enter service around 2027. It will replace our aging B-1s, which have  proven a workhorse over the last several decades, as well as two  squadrons of B-2s.   But our small bomber fleet is growing smaller. Seventeen of the most  structurally fatigued B-1s are being retired this year, which has  actually permitted maintainers to concentrate resources on the  remaining aircraft. Flight hours are up, and the B-1 has been a key  component of the new Bomber Task Force missions.   But that doesn't mean a smaller bomber force is sustainable in the  long run without reinvestment and modernization. Our national security  requires that the B-21 Program move full-speed ahead. Fortunately,  public reports indicate the B-21 Program is on-budget and on-time. ``B- 21 speeds to IOC,'' or initial operating capacity, reads a headline  recently from June 3.   In an interview, the Air Force Global Strike Commander, Gen. Timothy  Ray, detailed the agile and adaptive B-21 process. He noted that adding  certain capabilities to the bombers could take one-tenth of the time it  has for previous airframes.   The ability to incrementally add new capabilities and upgrades,  instead of being forced to make wholesale block upgrades, should keep  B-21 development moving quickly. And Congress--Congress can do its part  by providing stable funding for the B-21.   Now, with the record of decision for Main Operating Base 1 signed, we  also need to restart in earnest on the investments necessary to prepare  Ellsworth for the B-21. We can now get to work building the high-end  maintenance facilities for the B-21's stealth coating, training, and  operations buildings for the new missions and a secure weapons facility  for the nuclear mission.   Ellsworth has come a long way since it was placed on the chopping  block 16 years ago.   I am grateful to the Air Force for this decision and the hard work by  so many to get us here today. From BRAC to B-21, I am humbled to have  been a small part of this effort, and I remain steadfast in my support  for the mission and the men and women of the 28th Bomb Wing. I can't  wait to get to work on this new chapter of Ellsworth's story.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator  from Kansas (Mr. Moran).    The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator  from North Carolina (Mr. Burr) and the Senator from Kansas (Mr. Moran).

[[Page S4048]]            SEC. 3. REQUIREMENT TO ALLOW USERS TO SEE UNMANIPULATED                     CONTENT ON INTERNET PLATFORMS.         (a) In General.--Beginning on the date that is 1 year after       the date of enactment of this Act, it shall be unlawful--        (1) for any person to operate a covered internet platform       that uses an opaque algorithm unless the person complies with       the requirements of subsection (b); or        (2) for any upstream provider to grant access to an index       of web pages on the internet under a search syndication       contract that does not comply with the requirements of       subsection (c).        (b) Opaque Algorithm Requirements.--        (1) In general.--The requirements of this subsection with       respect to a person that operates a covered internet platform       that uses an opaque algorithm are the following:        (A) The person provides notice to users of the platform       that the platform uses an opaque algorithm that makes       inferences based on user-specific data to select the content       the user sees. Such notice shall be presented in a clear,       conspicuous manner on the platform whenever the user       interacts with an opaque algorithm for the first time, and       may be a one-time notice that can be dismissed by the user.        (B) The person makes available a version of the platform       that uses an input-transparent algorithm and enables users to       easily switch between the version of the platform that uses       an opaque algorithm and the version of the platform that uses       the input-transparent algorithm by selecting a prominently       placed icon, which shall be displayed wherever the user       interacts with an opaque algorithm.        (2) Nonapplication to certain downstream providers.--      Paragraph (1) shall not apply with respect to an internet       search engine if--        (A) the search engine is operated by a downstream provider       with fewer than 1,000 employees; and        (B) the search engine uses an index of web pages on the       internet to which such provider received access under a       search syndication contract.        (c) Search Syndication Contract Requirement.--The       requirements of this subsection with respect to a search       syndication contract are that--        (1) as part of the contract, the upstream provider makes       available to the downstream provider the same input-      transparent algorithm used by the upstream provider for       purposes of complying with subsection (b)(1)(B); and        (2) the upstream provider does not impose any additional       costs, degraded quality, reduced speed, or other constraint       on the functioning of such algorithm when used by the       downstream provider to operate an internet search engine       relative to the performance of such algorithm when used by       the upstream provider to operate an internet search engine.       SEC. 4. ENFORCEMENT BY FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION.         (a) Unfair or Deceptive Acts or Practices.--A violation of       this Act by an operator of a covered internet platform shall       be treated as a violation of a rule defining an unfair or       deceptive act or practice prescribed under section       18(a)(1)(B) of the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C.       57a(a)(1)(B)).        (b) Powers of Commission.--        (1) In general.--Except as provided in paragraph (3), the       Federal Trade Commission shall enforce this Act in the same       manner, by the same means, and with the same jurisdiction,       powers, and duties as though all applicable terms and       provisions of the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 41       et seq.) were incorporated into and made a part of this Act.        (2) Privileges and immunities.--Except as provided in       paragraph (3), any person who violates this Act shall be       subject to the penalties and entitled to the privileges and       immunities provided in the Federal Trade Commission Act (15       U.S.C. 41 et seq.).        (3) Common carriers and nonprofit organizations.--      Notwithstanding section 4, 5(a)(2), or 6 of the Federal Trade       Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 44, 45(a)(2), 46) or any       jurisdictional limitation of the Commission, the Commission       shall also enforce this Act, in the same manner provided in       paragraphs (1) and (2) of this paragraph, with respect to--        (A) common carriers subject to the Communications Act of       1934 (47 U.S.C. 151 et seq.) and Acts amendatory thereof and       supplementary thereto; and        (B) organizations not organized to carry on business for       their own profit or that of their members.        (4) Authority preserved.--Nothing in this Act shall be       construed to limit the authority of the Commission under any       other provision of law.                            ____________________
