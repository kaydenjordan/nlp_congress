 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to complete my  remarks.    Mr. President, I want to echo what my colleague from  New Mexico said about our friend and colleague Senator Heitkamp. I can  say that everything he just said--there is strong bipartisan agreement  on that front. I want to emphasize a couple of points he mentioned  about Senator Heitkamp. Certainly, she is one of the most well-liked  Senators, optimistic and upbeat.   As Senator Udall just mentioned, I think there is a certain element  in the Senate--whether you are a Democrat or a Republican, if you are a  former attorney general, you come to this job with a little bit of the  same viewpoint, the same experiences.   I want to emphasize what Senator Heitkamp mentioned in her remarks  and Senator Udall mentioned in his remarks, which is her strong  dedication to two issues that I think really matter--certainly, they  matter to my constituents, and they matter to most Americans--and that  is her relentless advocacy and fight with regard to combating the big  problem we have in America with sexual assault and domestic violence-- it is a very big, difficult problem in my State, and I know it is a  problem in many other States--  [[Page S7405]]  and her commitment to the Native peoples of our country.   One example is a bill that Senator Heitkamp and I worked on together  called the POWER Act. The whole focus is to get more legal  representation for survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault.  When we were working on this bill together, she was obviously a huge  advocate, but she came back to me and said: We need to make this  especially focused on the Native communities. That was her idea. That  was in the bill. The bill was passed in the Congress and signed into  law 2 months ago. I have no doubt that bill, for which she was the  strongest advocate, is going to make lives better for women throughout  our country who have gone through horrible experiences, particularly in  the Native communities, whether in North Dakota or Alaska or New  Mexico, and that was because of her hard work.   So I want to echo what so many others have said. In those areas and  so many others, it has been my honor to serve with Senator Heitkamp. I  know she is going to continue to serve her community, State, and  country in important ways. My best to her.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
