 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   I rise today in support of hundreds of thousands of students across  the Nation who are victims of predatory for-profit colleges. Over 4,000  borrowers in Maryland and 227,000 nationally are paying the price  because the department, led by Betsy DeVos, appears to have  intentionally decided not to process the claims.   Before coming to Congress, I led a business of over 7,000 employees.  At the end of the day, the buck stopped with me to make sure we had the  staff that we needed to serve our customers. Not only did Secretary  DeVos not have the staff she needed to follow the law, but through the  new rule, this administration is proposing she is making it harder for  students to get the relief they deserve.  [[Page H311]]    This is not how we should treat America's students who are looking to  make a better future for themselves. I urge my colleagues to stand with  the students and reverse this Trump administration rule.
