 Mr. President, I come to the floor to thank my  colleagues for all of their hard work on this legislation and to urge  my colleagues to move forward today because the State of Washington  desperately needs this help.   When I think about this package that has been crafted literally since  Saturday starting at about 10 o'clock and when I think about the people  who had run to collaborate--yes, there were many challenges to that  collaboration--I also think about the people who are on the frontlines  in the State of Washington who have paid such a heavy price--from the  factory worker we just lost in Everett, WA, to the COVID-19 disease; to  the grocer at the Leschi Market, who was just trying to help deliver  groceries to a needing public; to the pathologist at the University of  Washington who was a leader in this field but who also lost his life.  Real sacrifice and real, crushing blows have been dealt snce December.   But today we are responding with more help for our States. We are  giving them more money for hospitals, more money for the frontline with  protective gear, more money for testing, and more money to support them  as they continue the effort to try to stop this disease.   It is so important that we give State and local governments and  Tribes the resources they need to be on the frontlines in fighting this  disease, and I thank our Governor, Governor Inslee, for leading that  charge every single day in trying to focus our response on this  disease.   Because we were the site of the first COVID-19 case, we have been at  this since January 21, and the sadness we have all felt over the  Kirkland nursing home, where we lost so many patients, we hope will be  a lesson for the rest of the Nation to pay attention to the seriousness  of this virus.   We are also here today, though--besides giving that frontline support  to States, to cities, to counties, and to our healthcare delivery  system--to say that we want to try to lessen the economic impacts of a  shelter-in-place or social distancing.   Our businesses, small businesses, have been hit hard. Our  restaurants, our other businesses that have shut down, that don't have  the same resources to come to Washington, DC, and to lobby for aid and  support, are counting on us to create a program that small businesses  can get both grants and loans. So the $360 billion in this program I  hope SBA will help dispatch with urgency to those businesses that have  complied and have done their best to keep their employees while also  shutting down their business.   We also know that the unemployment benefits in this package, which  will be for an additional 4 months, will be a boost for people who are  unemployed, and the expansion of that definition to cover those who are  part of a gig economy who may not have been covered in the past is  important to give people the safety net to make it through this  process.   I wish we would have come to terms on even allowing for COBRA  enhancements, particularly for the aerospace sector. I will be filing a  bill today to make sure that as we continue to move through this  crisis, we think about those who are going to have a shift--are laid  off, as we have seen in recent days in Everett, WA--so that they, too,  could have healthcare beyond just 1 month of a COBRA health plan. It is  so important in fighting this disease that we not only take care of  unemployment benefits, but we also make sure people in unemployment  have access to healthcare. We can't be in the midst of a pandemic and  not give people affordable access to healthcare.   I also thank my colleagues for other provisions of this package that  are helping in giving individual taxpayers relief in the sense of a  rebate check. Not only will individuals get a rebate check of $1,200,  but families will get a rebate check of $2,400 that should help those  who have been hit hardest by this disease in these days in which we are  sheltering in place in the State of Washington.   There are so many more things we need to do, and while I support the  elements of supporting the aviation industry in this package, I wish we  would have gotten more requirements on the airline industries for the  grant section of this bill. I personally believe that in the future in  a healthier airline industry, they should pay money back to the Federal  Government.   We certainly should be protecting the workforce during this time  period, and that is what is most important--to make sure that an  airline doesn't take money from the Federal Government or go into  bankruptcy and shortchange the workers and the workforce, as has been  done in previous packages for them.   I fully support, though, the loan guarantee program and the loan  guarantees that are so important and so qualified in this package to  have very specific requirements to them.   I also want to thank my colleagues from the Banking Committee who  worked hard on provisions in this legislation to make sure there was  more transparency in the process for who got access to the loans in  this package.   While we think of the processes we have been through before on TARP  and the processes we have been through before on other lending, our  colleagues here on this side of the aisle made sure that there were  better requirements for oversight, inspector generals' accounting of  the resources, and to make sure that we knew exactly where these  dollars were being spent.   I know Treasury will have its hands full, but because of Democrats,  we will have more transparency in exactly how those dollars go out the  door.   So I want to thank Leader Schumer and his staff for working so  diligently on this package. It has been a very hectic couple of days.   And I would say a special thanks to the Commerce Committee staff, to  David Strickland, Melissa Porter, David Martin, Ronce Almond, who  literally have been camped out for--probably since last Saturday,  working and perfecting the language in these sections related to  aviation.   As I said, there is more work to do, and we all know there is more  work to do. I know I want to continue the fight for the aviation supply  chain, to make sure that when we come out of this crisis after an  economic downturn around the globe, the United States is well  positioned to return the supply chain workforce to building one of  America's best products--airplanes. One of America's greatest-- actually, America's single largest export is airplanes. But to do that,  we are going to have to get through this crisis and protect what we  think needs to be continued healthcare access for those laid-off  workers.   So let's get these dollars to the frontline, to our hospitals, to our  States, for better equipment, for more supplies. Let's support them in  doing what they do best, helping to fight this disease and seeing this  through to the other side of America's challenge.
