 ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 6168, the Veterans'  Compensation Cost-of-Living Adjustment Act of 2020. The bill was  introduced by Disability Assistance and Memorial Affairs Subcommittee  Chair Elaine Luria and Ranking Member   Mike Bost. I appreciate their  leadership on this important issue.   The Department of Veterans Affairs provides compensation benefits to  help fulfill our obligation to take care of the brave men and women who  have been injured during their service to this great Nation.   H.R. 6168 would authorize a cost-of-living increase for veterans and  their families next year, if Social Security recipients receive an  increase. The annual COLA is necessary to help veterans and families  afford their living expenses when prices go up.   Currently, many of our Nation's veterans may have been affected by  this pandemic and are worried about how they are going to pay their  bills. The last thing that should be on their minds is whether the  value of their VA benefits will keep pace with inflation.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage all Members to support H.R. 6168.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close. I  appreciate the Members, Mrs. Luria and Mr. Bost, bringing this  important bill up. We pass it every year. I encourage all of my  colleagues to support this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 3414, the VA Major Medical  Facility Authorization Act. This bill is sponsored by my good friends  on the other side of the Capitol, Chairman Jerry Moran and Ranking  Member Jon Tester of the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs.   This bill would authorize the construction of the Department of  Veterans Affairs major medical facility projects in Kentucky,  California, New York, and Puerto Rico. The COVID-19 pandemic has shown  us the value of the VA healthcare system in serving not just our  Nation's veterans, which is the Department's foremost responsibility,  but also in supporting all Americans during times of crisis.   The seven projects that would be authorized in this legislation have  been requested by the administration in VA's most recent budget  submission. They would increase access to high-quality care and  services to veterans of all ages and eras. It would also ensure that VA  is better able to fulfill the Department's important service training,  research, and emergency response missions.   Mr. Speaker, to associate myself with the chairman's remarks, Abraham  Lincoln would recognize the VA medical center in my hometown, which was  authorized right after the Civil War and opened in 1903 as an Old  Soldiers' Home and now is a first-class VA medical center.   I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill. Mr.  Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I have no further  speakers. I urge all of my colleagues to join in supporting this bill,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 3084, as amended. This  bill is sponsored by Chairman Jerry Moran and Ranking Member Jon Tester  of the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, and I am grateful for  them for introducing it.  [[Page H2330]]    S. 3084, as amended, would correct an error in existing law that  impedes employees serving in Senior Executive Service-equivalent  positions in the Department of Veterans Health Administration from  receiving their full salaries. Congress passed legislation in 2010 to  ensure that the individuals in those positions would be appropriately  compensated for their work.   However, VA discovered a technical error in that legislation just  last year that, unless corrected, would result in those hardworking men  and women instead having their salaries significantly reduced. It would  also result in VA having to issue and collect debts for current and  former employees who served in these high-level positions over the last  decade. That is certainly not what Congress intended.   The VA employees who are impacted by this issue are serving in  mission-critical positions across the VA healthcare system. Many of  them have been working around the clock, leading VA's response to the  COVID-19 pandemic. They are responsible for ensuring that veterans and  VA employees are safe and well cared for and that VA is able to fulfill  the Department's fourth mission obligation to support the national  response to this crisis.   They and their colleagues have performed incredibly lifesaving work  during the pandemic. I commend them for their efforts, which I know  will continue to be critical in the weeks and months ahead. Making them  whole by passing this bill today is the least we can do for them in  return.   I am glad to be back at work in our Nation's Capitol, as our  constituents always intended for us to be, and to support this bill  today as a small token of appreciation to the VA leaders who are  steering the Department through the crisis on behalf of our Nation's  veterans and families.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the  balance of my time. I have no further speakers, and I am prepared to  close.   I would like to start, since Monday was Memorial Day, to associate  myself with the remarks of Mr. LaMalfa from California about Sam  Johnson, one of our colleagues.   Sam Johnson is one of the reasons I am so proud to have served in  this body. Sam was one of the most incredible human beings I have ever  met. He spent over 40 months in solitary confinement, chained to a  concrete floor. This man came back to this country as a Wounded  Warrior, but he did not let that stop him. He went ahead and had a very  fulfilling life and really affected many of us in ways Sam will never  know.   I can remember seeing Sam on this floor. Sam was so beat up in his  captivity that he would take his voting card and have to step up, raise  up on his toes to put his card--I would get tears in my eyes watching  him--put his card in that voting machine over there to cast his vote.    We owe Sam and many veterans like him who have given the ultimate  sacrifice to this great country a debt that we can never pay back.   I served at the same time that Sam did. I was in the 2nd Infantry  Division in Korea but I did not serve in Vietnam, and I can't thank  those men and women enough.   To my colleagues, my brothers and sisters, welcome home.   Mr. Speaker, before I yield back, I would like to take a moment to  thank Chairman Takano and the leadership on both sides of the aisle for  bringing these three important bills to the floor today. Our actions  show that, like many other Americans, we can continue to do our jobs  and our part to reopen the country and our economy in a safe and  productive way.   While I am pleased that we are debating these bills today, I am  disappointed that H.R. 3504, the Ryan Kules and Paul Benne Specially  Adaptive Housing Improvement Act of 2019, was not included on today's  agenda. H.R. 3504 is a bipartisan bill introduced by Representatives  Gus Bilirakis and   Mike Levin that would make important improvements  to the specially adaptive housing program that helps severely injured  veterans adapt their homes.   The bill would also require important changes to the administration  of VA work-study benefits and make improvements to the GI Bill.   The bill has already passed the House and has now come back over from  the Senate. It represents a four corners bicameral agreement, and the  bill is strongly supported by our veterans service organizations.   I hope in the coming days we can pass the bill and send it to  President Trump's desk as soon as possible. During this difficult time,  we should be doing all we can to help support severely disabled  veterans and student veterans.   I thank the chairman. During this time that we have been at home with  our constituents and with our families and really confined, we tried to  continue to work, and I want to commend the chairman on being able to  do this.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this bill, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    ROE of Tennessee (for himself and Mr.               Correa):        H.R. 7059.
