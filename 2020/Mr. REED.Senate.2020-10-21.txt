 Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the Ensuring  Access to COVID-19 Vaccines for Seniors Act with Senator Shelley Moore  Capito of West Virginia. It is critical that a future COVID-19 vaccine  be made available to Medicare beneficiaries with no cost sharing, which  is the goal of our legislation.   The CARES Act, which Congress passed overwhelmingly and was signed  into law at the end of March, included provisions requiring Medicare to  cover FDA-approved COVID-19 vaccines with no-cost sharing. These  provisions are designed to ensure that as soon as there is an approved  and available COVID-19 vaccine, seniors across the Nation would be able  to get the vaccine for free under Medicare. Vaccines are one of the  best public health interventions in our lifetime and we must do  everything we can to encourage everyone to get the vaccines recommended  by their doctors. One of the most effective ways to improve vaccination  rates is to remove barriers such as cost. In fact, working with my  colleagues, I was able to include provisions in the Affordable Care Act  to ensure that vaccines are covered by insurance with no cost-sharing.  This not only makes our population healthier, but it also saves money  in the long-term.   While the COVID-19 vaccine development and testing protocols are  ongoing, it is very likely that the first vaccines will be made  available under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) by FDA. An EUA may  be granted to one or more COVID-19 vaccines in order to get vaccines to  those who need them the most, while the pharmaceutical companies  continue testing and evaluating vaccine candidates and pursuing full  FDA approval. While I have concerns that the Trump Administration may  attempt to interfere in the vaccine approval process, most public  health experts believe that the first vaccine candidates will be made  available under an EUA. In this case, the CARES Act provisions  requiring Medicare to cover COVID-19 vaccines would not apply, as  vaccines made available under an EUA would not yet be considered FDA- approved. Our bipartisan legislation would address this oversight and  ensure that COVID-19 vaccines would also be covered by Medicare if made  available by an EUA.   I am pleased that the House of Representatives has already passed  this provision as a part of the much broader Heroes Act. It is my hope  that the Senate will follow suit immediately. It has been more than six  months since the CARES Act was signed into law, and the need to provide  additional relief to combat the health and economic impacts of the  COVID-19 pandemic has only increased. We are far overdue for another  robust relief package, and it is shameful that the Senate has not yet  acted to pass such a measure. It is critical that the Ensuring Access  to COVID-19 Vaccines for Seniors Act be considered swiftly in the  Senate, along with a number of other critical efforts to help the  American people during this difficult time.                                  ______                                         By Ms. HIRONO (for herself, Mr. Booker, Mr. Van Hollen, Mr.          Casey, and Ms. Baldwin):   S. 4831. A bill to provide resources for States, State educational  agencies, local educational agencies, educators, school leaders, and  others to measure and address instructional loss in students in  kindergarten through grade 12; to the Committee on Health, Education,  Labor, and Pensions.
