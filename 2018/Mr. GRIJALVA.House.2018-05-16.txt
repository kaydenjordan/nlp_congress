 Mr. Chair, I oppose the farm bill. It would hurt low-  and middle-income families, take breakfast and lunch from children  across this country, and fail hardworking farmers.   It also undermines one of the Nation's most successful and popular  conservation laws, the Endangered Species Act, by removing the  requirement for EPA to consult with expert wildlife agencies on the  impact of pesticides to imperiled wildlife.   Pesticides are known to have been the cause of the dramatic decline  of many species and a threat to public health. It should not be  dispensed with in this legislation.   The provisions in this legislation that are anti-environment, anti- public health, anti-nutrition, and anti-working families are cause for  opposition. I urge a ``no'' vote.
