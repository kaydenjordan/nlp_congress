 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, Mr. Floyd's horrific murder at the hands of  a man sworn to uphold the law, our Nation has seen justified anger. As  I said here 2 weeks ago, it is a moment that calls for not just police  reform, it calls for a full reckoning with racial inequities that still  plague our Nation.   There is, in my mind, nothing more un-American than racial  discrimination. Our Nation was founded on the revolutionary truth that  every human being is created equal and that our rights do not come from  our government or from our leaders or even our laws; our rights come  from our Creator.   It is true that the man who authored these words and gave birth to  the young Nation did not fully live up to these principles, but it is  also true that every single great fight for equality in this country's  history has come from a direct appeal to those powerful principles.  Slavery, segregation, discriminatory impediments to voting--all of  these came to an end, not from efforts to overthrow our values but from  demands that we fulfill them, for these evils could not exist in a  country, in a nation, built upon the idea that all people are created  equal with rights granted to them by God.   Slavery and racial discrimination are, indeed, a tragic part of our  history, but the long and the steady and  [[Page S3154]]  the perpetual march toward equality, that is part of our heritage as  well.   Today, a new generation of Americans is reminding us that while we  have traveled far on the quest for a more perfect Union, the final  miles of that journey still lie ahead. The overwhelming and vast  majority of these Americans on our streets are peacefully reminding us  that, yes, Black lives matter. They are not asking that we destroy  America; they are demanding that we be more American; that we more  fully become a nation with liberty and justice for all. But it is now  also clear that there are others with a different agenda who have taken  to our streets as well.   They are the ones who argue that because the men who wrote our  Declaration of Independence and our Constitution were imperfect and, in  some cases, racists, that the Nation their words gave birth to is  beyond redemption; that America cannot be improved or saved; and that  therefore it must come to an end.   These radical views are not new. From the crazy professor whom no one  took seriously to the nut job running for office with no chance of  winning, they have operated on the fringes of our politics for decades.  The difference is that, in recent years, they have begun to move out  from the fringes, and now these radicals are capitalizing on a  legitimate movement to force their madness even further into the  mainstream. Now their violence, their vandalism, their anarchy are  excused, tolerated, sometimes even celebrated by some, and their  radical agenda is shielded, increasingly, from scrutiny by an emerging  speech code that condemns as hate speech and as racism any criticism of  these anti-lynching American radicals.   The self-proclaimed guardians of free speech in media now apologize  for printing the opinions of a U.S. Senator and actively cajoled tech  companies to censor conservative voices. Social media companies, which  owe their very existence to freedom of expression, now threaten to  block the accounts of American politicians in publications here at  home, while eagerly complying with the demands of totalitarian racist  regimes abroad.   Online mobs not only decide what is acceptable speech but are  empowered to destroy the reputation and career of anyone they believe  has violated their standards. Celebrities and large corporations are so  eager to proactively shield themselves from being canceled that they  raise money to bail out arsonists, but they do not raise a single cent  to help the small business owners, oftentimes minorities themselves,  whose life work was looted and burned to the ground by the radicals   This radicalism, this anarchy, isn't just annoying; it is  destructive, and it is dangerous. It is destructive to bedrock  institutions in our country and their legitimacy in the eyes of our  people.   Why would people trust public health experts who told them they had  to lose their job or their business, that their kids couldn't have a  graduation, that their grandmother couldn't have a funeral but are  afraid to say anything about crowds of people setting fires and looting  businesses?   Why would people trust local leaders who will close your business for  having too many customers or threaten to arrest you for going to a park  or to a church but who stand by and do nothing when a mob vandalizes a  monument, tears down a statue, or takes over an entire section of a  city?   Why would people trust the media that will shame them for going to  the beach, for not wearing a mask in public but portrays a mob of White  anarchists attacking African-American police officers as just  frustrated racial justice activists?   This radicalism is also dangerous because, if it is OK for a violent  mob to tear down a statue, then what is to stop another violent mob  from showing up to defend it? If it is OK to set a police car on fire,  what is going to stop someone upset at activist judges from burning  down a courtroom? Where does it end? It will not end because there is  no way to satisfy radicals who only seek destruction.   Just ask a clergy at the historical St. John's Episcopal Church.  Three weeks ago, they expressed their support for and solidarity with  the protesters, even after some agitator tried to burn down the church.  Last night, radicals vandalized their church, calling for an autonomous  zone here in Washington.   Just ask the mayor of Seattle. Just a few days ago on national TV,  she was saying that the so-called autonomous zone in her city would  lead to a ``summer of love.'' Now they have announced that they are  going to move in and retake the area after multiple people were shot  over the weekend.   The anti-American radicals don't care about racial equality, and they  will not stop as long as everyone is afraid to call them out for who  and for what they are. As long as we fail to point out that those  seeking racial equality and these radicals are not the same people;  that the people committing this violence and carrying out this anarchy  and this chaos are not the same people as the people who are rightfully  asking for us to address racial inequality, as long as we fail to point  that out, they will continue to hide behind this important and  legitimate movement.   It is time we stop--we stop being afraid to express the common sense  of Americans of every race, of every background. Yes, we must address  racial inequality. Yes, Black lives must matter. But the vandalism, the  arson, and the anarchy on our streets have nothing to do with this  important cause.   Yes, some police departments need to be reformed, and bad police  officers need to be fired. And if they committed crimes, they need to  be arrested, and they need to be prosecuted. But, no, we are not going  to abolish or defund police departments.   Yes, racial disparities must be acknowledged, and they must be  addressed but not by giving in to a bunch of crazy radicals who hate  and want to destroy this country of ours. This is what the overwhelming  majority of Americans of every race and background believe, and this is  what so many are afraid to say for fear of being destroyed by an online  mob and their accomplices.   For over 200 years, each generation of America has moved us ever  closer to fulfilling the powerful truths upon which this Nation was  founded. Now it is our turn to do the same, not by destroying America  but by becoming more fully American, not by abandoning our founding  principles but by moving us closer to becoming the one Nation under God  with liberty and justice for all that we have pledged our allegiance  to.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
