 Madam Speaker, I rise today to highlight how the  bipartisan infrastructure law will accelerate last year's record job  growth.   In Cleveland and Akron, more than 50 percent of roads have pavement  in poor condition. The infrastructure law will help to repave these  roads and reduce commute times. The law allows public transit agencies  like the RTA and Akron Metro in my district to replace outdated  vehicles, build new garages, and expand services.   Ohio has more lead pipes than almost every other State in the  country. The infrastructure law will help to ensure every child and  family in our region has access to safe drinking water. The law will  expand access to safe drinking water, and the law will expand access to  high-speed internet to the roughly 30 percent of Cleveland households  that currently lack it.   These projects will create thousands of jobs across our State, jobs  that come on the heels of last year's record economic job growth. In  2021, we had the greatest year of job creation in history. Unemployment  is down, and wages are rising.   Make no mistake, the Biden agenda is creating jobs and delivering  results, real results, for the people.                            ____________________     Thank you to the co-leaders, Barbara Lee and  Sheila Jackson Lee, my sisters and colleagues.   Madam Speaker, as we celebrate Black History Month, I rise today to  join my CBC colleagues and my CBC sisters in honoring the life and  trailblazing legacy of Congresswoman Shirley Chisholm.   Before me, it was her. Before my predecessor, HUD Secretary Marcia  Fudge, it was her. Before the record-setting number of 27 Black women  in Congress today, it was her.   My career in public service rests on the shoulders and the  contributions of the iconic Shirley Chisholm. In 1969 she became a  political pioneer and shattered racial and gender barriers by becoming  the first Black woman elected to Congress.   Her signature slogan, ``unbought and unbossed,'' spoke to her  audacity, her sheer sense of will, and her fearlessness in the face of  established norms and institutions. And it spoke to her rise as the  people's politician, someone willing to speak up and speak out for  those embattled by poverty, discrimination, and injustice.  [[Page H1002]]    In Congress, she fought for low-income families, for hungry  schoolchildren, and for single moms. She was critical to the creation  of the national school lunch program. She was critical to the growth of  the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP, and she  was critical to the creation of the Women, Infants, and Children's  program, known as WIC. Then, as now, these programs reduce the hunger  facing American children and families. Today I am proud to carry forth  her legacy by fighting for their expansion.   Fifty years ago, Shirley Chisholm made history once again by becoming  the first African American and the first woman to run for President.  But more than being a mere political first, Shirley Chisholm is best  remembered for her grit, her willingness to push on the pedal of  progress, and her ability to not just see America for what it is, but  for what it could be.   Chisholm understood the challenges women, particularly Black women,  were facing in America, and she created a path for women like me. She  passed the baton, and now it is up to us to continue the race.
