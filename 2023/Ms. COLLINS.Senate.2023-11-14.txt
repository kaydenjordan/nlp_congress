 Madam President, I rise today to introduce the Medical  Nutrition Therapy Act of 2023, along with my colleague from Michigan,  Senator Peters. Our bill would expand Medicare beneficiaries' access to  medical nutrition therapy, or MNT, which is a cost-effective component  of treatment for obesity, diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and  other chronic conditions.   At a time when the increased prevalence of diet-related chronic  conditions is contributing to poor health outcomes and growing  healthcare expenditures, increasing access to MNT should be part of the  strategy to improve disease management and prevention for America's  seniors. The Medical Nutrition Therapy Act would make two important  changes to support patients, improve health outcomes, and reduce  unnecessary healthcare costs.   First, it would expand Medicare Part B coverage of outpatient medical  nutrition therapy services to a number of currently uncovered diseases  or conditions--including prediabetes, obesity, high blood pressure,  high cholesterol, malnutrition, eating disorders, cancer, HIV/AIDS,  gastrointestinal diseases including celiac disease, and cardiovascular  disease. Currently, Medicare Part B only covers outpatient MNT for  diabetes, renal disease, and post-kidney transplant.   Second, the bill would allow more types of providers--including nurse  practitioners, physician assistants, clinical nurse specialists, and  psychologists--to refer patients to MNT. This is especially critical  for a rural State like Maine, where a NP or PA may be one's trusted  primary care provider.   MNT counseling is provided by registered dietician nutritionists,  RDNs, as part of a collaborative healthcare team. It is evidenced-based  and proven to positively affect weight, blood pressure, blood lipids,  and blood sugar control. Nutritional counseling by RDNs is recommended  by the National Lipid Association to promote long-term adherence to an  individualized, heart-healthy diet. Through MNT, individuals benefit  from in-depth, individualized nutrition assessments. Follow up visits  help reinforce important behavior and lifestyle changes and increase  compliance.   Older Americans deserve improved access to this cost-effective  medical treatment, but many older adults are missing out under the  current Medicare policy. Marcy Kyle, a RDN from Rockport, ME, has seen  many patients denied access to medically necessary MNT. One of her  patients with prediabetes was referred by his primary care physician  for MNT at age 64. At that time, his private insurance covered the  service, and he booked the first available appointment the following  week. That same week, this patient turned 65 and transitioned onto  Medicare. You can imagine his surprise upon arriving for his  appointment and learning that MNT would not be covered.   Another unfortunate example from Maine was a patient with a new  celiac disease diagnosis complicated by severe weight loss. His private  insurance covered MNT as celiac disease is a controllable disease with  proper nutrition. But when transitioning from private insurance to  Medicare, this patient, too, lost his access to MNT. The saddest  situation this RDN has confronted is when an older cancer patient  experiences such side effects from cancer treatment as severe weight  loss or nausea, which could be prevented with MNT. As with prediabetes  and celiac disease, however, Medicare does not cover MNT for cancer  patients. This truly is a lost opportunity since we know early  treatment with MNT can prevent future and more serious health  complications and chronic conditions in older adults. These conditions  should be covered.   In addition to leading to confusion and potential delays in care for  patients seeking needed healthcare services, we must also consider the  staggering economic impact of chronic diseases. According to the U.S.  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 90 percent of the $3.8  trillion that the United States spends annually on healthcare goes to  the treatment of people with chronic diseases and mental health  conditions. Preventing chronic diseases or managing symptoms when  prevention is not possible is one way to reduce these costs. This is  particularly important for the Medicare Program, as more than two- thirds of seniors on Medicare live with multiple chronic conditions. As  one registered dietitian nutritionist in Maine told me, ``We all know a  dollar spent on prevention saves many health care dollars in the long  run and is the right thing to do for our seniors at a time when they  have limited budgets.''  [[Page S5510]]    MNT can help prevent chronic disease, such as type 2 diabetes. It can  better control celiac and other gastrointestinal ailments. It can  improve outcomes and the quality of life for those with cancer and  other devastating diagnoses. The current Medicare restrictions on  medical nutrtition therapy coverage can be detrimental for older adults  at a critical juncture in their journey to better health and should be  changed.   The Medical Nutrition Therapy Act of 2023 is supported by more than  40 expert national organizations, including the Academy of Nutrition  and Dietetics, the American Diabetes Association, the Endocrine  Society, and UsAgainstAlzheimer's.   I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation to improve  access to cost-effective medical treatment for Medicare patients with  chronic diseases.                            ____________________     Madam President, I rise today to introduce the Medical  Nutrition Therapy Act of 2023, along with my colleague from Michigan,  Senator Peters.
