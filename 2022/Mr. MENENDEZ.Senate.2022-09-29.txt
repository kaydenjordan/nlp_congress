The addition of the new       items will cause an increase in the total net cost of MDE by       $0.06 billion to $2.45 billion. The estimated total case       value will increase to $4.27 billion.        (iv) Significance: This notification is being provided to       correctly identify the designation of F110-GE-129D engines to       be included in this sale; furthermore, the additional MDE       items were not enumerated in the original notification. The       inclusion of this MDE represents an increase in capability       over what was previously notified. The proposed articles and       services will continue modernization of the Jordanian fighter       aircraft fleet and support operational requirements       associated with regional U.S.-coalition goals such as       countering violent extremist organizations, countering malign       state and non-state actors, and border defense, while       ensuring continued interoperability with U.S. and coalition       forces.        (v) Justification: This proposed sale will support the       foreign policy and national security objectives of the United       States by helping to improve the security of a Major Non-NATO       Ally that is an important force for political stability and       economic progress in the Middle East.        (vi) Sensitivity of Technology:        The AN/USQ-190 Multifunctional Information Distribution       System with Joint Tactical Radio System (MIDS JTRS) is an       advanced Link-16 command, control, communications, and       intelligence (C3l) system incorporating high-capacity, jam-      resistant digital communications links for exchange of near-      real-time tactical information, including both data and       voice, among air, ground, and sea elements.        The AIM-9X Block II Sidewinder Missile is a short-range,       air-to-air missile providing a high off-boresight seeker,       enhanced countermeasure rejection capability, low drag/high       angle of attack airframe, and the ability to integrate a       Helmet Mounted Cueing System.        This potential sale will include tactical guidance units,       Captive Air Training Missiles (CATMs), and CATM guidance       units.        The highest level of classification of defense articles,       components, and services included in this potential sale is       SECRET.        (vii) Date Report Delivered to Congress: September 27,       2022.                            ____________________     Mr. President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute.

This       sale will provide an effective ability to deter and defend       against land-based threats, enhancing Kuwait's ability to       protect border regions and key land-based infrastructure.       Kuwait will have no difficulty absorbing this equipment into       its armed forces.

The total value of added MDE items is $1.8 million but will       not result in a net increase in the MDE value notified. The       total estimated MDE value will remain $11.5 billion. The       total value of added non-MDE items is $130 million but will       not result in an increase in the total estimated non-MDE       value. The total estimated case value will remain $21.1       billion.        (iv) Significance: The proposed sale will significantly       improve Qatar's defense capabilities to meet current and       future threats and deter regional aggression. The inclusion       of these items represents an increase in capability over what       was originally notified.        (v) Justification: This proposed sale will support the       foreign policy and national security objectives of the United       States by helping to improve the security of a friendly       country that continues to be an important force for political       stability and economic progress in the Middle East.        (vi) Sensitivity of Technology:        The GBU-39(T-1)/B SDB GTV is an inert, full-scale       configuration of the SDB used to demonstrate safe-separation       from the SDB carriage system and parent aircraft, free       flight, maneuverability and target accuracy.        The TacSAR system is a non-program of record reconnaissance       pod designed for carriage on fighter aircraft that features       Active Electronic Scanned Array (AESA) radar technology.       TacSAR capabilities include providing long range, day/night,       all-weather imagery and Ground Moving Target Indication. The       pod can also transmit imagery via a datalink to Ground       Stations for near-real time analysis and exploitation. The       pod integrates a synthetic aperture radar into the same       outer-shell as the DB-110 and MS-110 pods.        The highest level of classification of defense articles,       components, and services included in this potential sale is       UNCLASSIFIED.        (vii) Date Report Delivered to Congress: September 27,       2022.                            ____________________     Mr. President, democracy is a precious concept,  serving as the foundation of our freedoms, which we must not take for  granted. Democracy's success is dependent on the active participation  of our communities--people of all different backgrounds and beliefs.   I am proud to recognize an organization that inspires members of our  diverse communities to take an active role in our democratic process,  BoricuActivatEd.   Five years ago, BoricuActivatEd was created amid a crisis: the  aftermath of Hurricanes Irma and Maria's destruction of Puerto Rico. In  a matter of days, the island was on the brink of total disaster, and  the former administration that held the keys to alleviating the  suffering dragged their heels and closed their eyes.   Like many within the Puerto Rican diaspora that watched the U.S.  Government's response in disbelief, a group of former congressional  staffers--led by Jennice Fuentes--knew action had to be taken and  mobilized. Much remains to be done as Puerto Rico continues to rebuild  and recover, especially now after Hurricane Fiona, but it is undeniable  that BoricuActivatEd has had an outsized impact in bringing attention  to the island's crisis.   BoricuActivatEd operates on the idea that each individual should  decide and advocate on the issues that resonate most with them. And  that is the ingenuity of this organization, keeping true to its  commitment to promoting participatory democracy.   BoricuActivatEd gives individuals across the country the tools they  need to stand up and speak out, teaching them the value of civic  engagement and the techniques needed to succeed.   They believe that it is never too early to teach people no matter who  they are or where they were born that they, too, can play a role in  shaping our country. I am especially proud that, when BoricuActivatEd  introduced a school-based curriculum on participatory democracy, they  chose the students of Camden, NJ, as their first student participants.   It is undeniable that learning best practices in civic engagement is  valuable to people of all ages and backgrounds. But we, as the elected  representatives of the United States, stand to gain as we navigate our  roles as public servants, guided by the priorities of our civically  engaged constituents.   I extend my congratulations to BoricuActivatEd for 5 impactful years,  showing us that their success is a success for our Nation, and I cannot  wait to see all they accomplish in the years ahead.                            ____________________
