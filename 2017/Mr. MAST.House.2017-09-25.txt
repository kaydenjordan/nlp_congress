 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague from Florida for  the time.   Without action from Congress, the authority for the VA Secretary to  carry out many essential activities that are critical to helping our  veterans will expire.   I get my healthcare from the VA. I get it alongside a great number of  my best friends in life, and I can tell you, my favorite part about  going to the VA in West Palm Beach, Florida, is when I meet one of my  fellow veterans in the lobby. It might be a veteran from World War II,  Korea, Vietnam, the Gulf war, Iraq, or Afghanistan, and the first thing  that we do with one another is we jab at one another about the  different branch that the other person served in: Army, Navy, Marines,  Air Force, Coast Guard. But after that, it gets back to the very  serious work that we are all at the VA to have completed.   The heroic men and women that I have had the honor of fighting  alongside have earned--they have earned; that is the most important  word, they have earned--the very best care that our country has to  offer. But without this immediate action from Congress, veterans could  lose those benefits--healthcare, support for the homeless, and many  other provisions--and this is absolutely unacceptable.   This bill, the Department of Veterans Affairs Expiring Authorities  Act of 2017, does everything that was already mentioned, which is  extremely important. It extends the number of expiring authorities to  include nursing home support, support for our caregivers, support for  transportation, childcare assistance, adaptive sports programs, housing  and home loan services.   This legislation also makes some important technical changes that  will aid the VA's implementation of the Forever GI Bill, a critical  priority for ensuring that as many veterans as possible can use that  important program.   This is the definition of must-pass legislation. I urge my colleagues  to pass this commonsense legislation.
