 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to continue to raise  awareness to the destruction that Hurricane Fiona has brought about to  the Caribbean--namely, to Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic.   Let me start, Mr. Speaker, by saying that yesterday marked the fifth  anniversary of Hurricane Maria, a natural disaster that left 3.5  million Americans without power and killed over 3,000 lives.   While hurricanes in the islands are not new, Hurricane Maria exposed  the vulnerability of Puerto Rico, and 5 years later, uncertainty  remains in the wake of Hurricane Fiona, which occurred this past  weekend.   There was a 100 percent blackout on the island when the hurricane  landed. As of 10 a.m. yesterday, 73 percent of the island had no power  and 60 percent of the island had no water.   I commend the Biden administration for its swift actions to declare a  state of emergency for the region, and I am hopeful that they will  approve Governor Pierluisi's request for a major disaster declaration  soon, which will follow additional lifesaving resources for Puerto  Rico.   For this reason, I join Senator Schumer and Congresswoman Velazquez  in speaking with FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell, urging the  administration to reimburse 100 percent of the costs, allow document  flexibility for accessing aid, and advance funding to Puerto Rico in  this critical moment.   We must do all it takes to ensure relief assistance to help residents  recover. We cannot turn our backs on our brothers and sisters in Puerto  Rico.   Yesterday, I held a strategy planning call with leaders from New  York, Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, and emergency services  organizations in response to Hurricane Fiona.   We have witnessed catastrophic devastation across Puerto Rico and the  Dominican Republic, and it will require a multilevel government  approach to ensure vital resources to the region in a timely manner.                                time  1045    As of today, more than 1 million people in the Dominican Republic are  without access to utilities and shelter.   At least 1 million people in the Dominican Republic have no access to  running water.   More than 700,000 homes and businesses have been left in the dark as  they suffered loss of power.   Additionally, at least 3,000 homes were damaged or destroyed, and  four bridges collapsed.   The situation is dire. We must do all we can to help the people of  the Dominican Republic during this moment of crisis.   For this reason, I am urging the United States Agency For  International Development to deploy a Disaster Assistance Response Team  and coordinate with other U.S. Government agencies and partners to  advance relief efforts.   The Federal response must be swift, robust, and continue for as long  as is needed.   The impact of this devastating natural disaster hits close to home,  as a multitude of my district--we have many folks in Washington  Heights, in the Bronx, in El Barrio, and Harlem--have family members in  Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic who are in need of supplies and  other disaster relief.   Mr. Speaker, my heart is with the people of the Caribbean, and we  will continue to monitor this situation closely.                            ____________________
