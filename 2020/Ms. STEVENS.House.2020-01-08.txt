 Mr. Speaker, I rise this evening to recognize a new year  and a new decade in which we find ourselves, the second half of this  session of the 116th Congress, an incredible delegation of individuals  who have come together on behalf of the American people, for the  American people, to usher in an agenda of renewal, of standing up for  everyday hardworking Americans: to protect their healthcare; to  advocate for infrastructure and good, sound infrastructure spending; as  well as to stand up for hardworking Americans who have always played by  the rules and have worked for their retirement savings, my pensioners  back home in Michigan.   It was a delight to close out the end of the decade back home in my  district with so many of my beloved constituents and the community  members who make us so strong.   Mr. Speaker, it is a fact that on January 3, 2020, this new year,  this new decade, 1 year from when this Congress was sworn in, this  session of Congress was sworn in, the headline became pronounced that  industrial activity has come down to its lowest point since 2009, since  the heart of the recession, with production, inventories, and new  orders falling.   These are real headlines. These are headlines that affect the heart  of America. And while so much hums in our national media and in our  national news, this is a reality for so many. This is a reality for  Michigan's 11th District.   We were delighted, we were pleased to see us pass the USMCA  overwhelmingly bipartisan for the manufacturers, for the manufacturing  economy, for the hardworking union members who will get a better deal  because we are advocating for buy American content.   We know the road to implementation will be long, but it is an  implementation that the suppliers in my district, from Auburn Hills  down to Plymouth, an implementation they are planning for. Yet the  reality is such that a manufacturing recession hangs before us, a  manufacturing recession as marked by low levels of productivity.                                time  1900    Over the last 6 months of 2019, manufacturers lost a net of 23,000  jobs and average hours worked fell to its lowest levels in 8 years. Who  is talking about this? Your Congresswoman from Michigan's 11th District  is talking about this here tonight.   The reality of tariffs has cost us. Tariffs imposed have cost U.S.  corporations $34 billion as of October 2019, as marked by that day  since they were implemented.   Also, as October 2019 has marked, manufacturing taxpayers have paid  $1.8 billion in 2019 in additional tariffs, in additional money. I talk  to these employers. I talk to these small businesses. I talk to the  lifeblood of the American economy, and they are paying more. They are  squeezed. Their margins are tight. Can this continue? No, it cannot.   So that agenda that we are ushering in here the first month of 2020,  is that we do not forget that we need to address the problem of tariffs  for our manufacturers. We have given certainty with USMCA. We knew we  needed to give that certainty, in part, because the jobs were going to  go elsewhere. The investment was going to be made elsewhere. It wasn't  going to be made in the American workforce.   We are in a global race to compete. We have got to compete as  Americans. We have got to compete as manufacturers in small  communities, in suburban communities like the ones that I have the  privilege and honor of representing. Comprised within that are the  people who are going to work every single day: in snowstorms, in  rainstorms, on sunny days, in the middle of summer, putting food on the  table.   We look at wages and we ask ourselves as we are now in this third  decade of this millennium of this century: What has transpired with  wages? The alarming headline as we were closing out 2019 was that the  richest, the wealthiest 500 individuals increased their wealth in 2019  by $1 trillion, by over $1 trillion, when wages for our middle class  have remained stagnant; where wages for the lowest earners in our  economy--we are still advocating to raise the minimum wage from $7,  just about. It is the year 2020.   Who is working those jobs, by the way? Single mothers; people who  have played by the rules and who have children, who aren't just working  temporary jobs. This is the promise of America. This is the dream of  America, Mr. Speaker, that we are representing, and that I am fighting  for all of you, where my sleeves are rolled up. The things that I am  eyeing here.   Because if we don't start addressing this, we stop winning. We stop  having  [[Page H59]]  an American-first agenda. So we have got to put the manufacturing  economy at the forefront. We have got to look at the plight of exports.  We saw that with the USMCA, the passage of the USMCA.   Over 95 percent of the world's consumers are outside of American  borders. We want to sell the best-in-class, American-made product from  Michigan by the best-in-class Michigan workforce to the world. We want  to get it into these markets.   So we look at how we can be smart. We can look at the things that we  did during the big recession, right, the big recession of 2008-2009,  and what got us out of that, the strategies and the policies that we  put forward in export agenda, Mr. Speaker.   The Speaker knows this from where the gentleman sits. I acknowledge  my friend from South Carolina who is in a port destination.   We got smart about how we sold American product. We invested in small  business, awards--the States Small Business Act is what I am talking  about. It awarded money through the Small Business Administration to  States like Michigan. We qualify for these dollars. This was $200,000  that the State of Michigan got and made awards to companies who  applied, who met the qualifications, the small businesses, and gave  them seed money that they matched with their own money to go sell their  products in Europe and overseas and to different consumers. The results  were exponential. That money paid for itself.   Then the political tides changed and we got rid of it, and we are  still here 10 years later trying to figure out how we are going to make  those investments.   Well, let's go back and look at the States Small Business Jobs Act of  2010. Let's figure out how we can get in front of a manufacturing  recession. It is technical. Look at auto sales. They are down. They are  down in 2019. Not as dramatic as it was in 2008 when we had the largest  drop in automotive sales in the history the automobile.   Auto sales are down because hardworking men and women put things on  the line. They went on strike. They asked for better healthcare. They  asked for fair wages. They asked for retirement packages. When we talk  about middle-class job growth, when we talk about growing our middle  class, what are we talking about? We are talking about lifting people  out of poverty.   The facts are clear: productivity is not at its highest level.  Productivity is at some of its lowest level, and inequality is at some  of its highest level; inequality matched by wage disparity, Mr.  Speaker.   Then we have this interesting reality with our skills gap in this  country, and this is something I hear all over my district. Every time  I am talking to a manufacturer, or an educator, or a champion in my  community, it is: Where are we going to find the workers?   Just today, I was talking with folks from the coding organization,  Hour of Code, and they gave me a few minutes. And I had the opportunity  to be reminded that we have tens of thousands of open computer science  jobs in this country, and we are not graduating the level of computer  scientists that we need to graduate to fill those jobs.   We have got to invest in our own. This is something in Michigan we  know very well. We have got great universities. Our students stick  around. We want them to stick around. That is part of my charge here.  It is what I am trying to represent as your Member of Congress, the  attraction agenda, the boomerangs, those who maybe took a job or an  educational opportunity elsewhere but have come back to invest in our  community. We see that all over. We see that in the rich innovation  transpiring throughout the district: two-to-one patents in autonomous  vehicle technology; 75 percent of the R&D taking place here.    And then we remind ourselves, in the previous Congress, in the 115th  Congress, there was a big tax bill that got passed into law. It was so  partisan in certain respects. And now, the effects of this tax bill are  playing out. Who has benefited and who hasn't? The wealthiest  individuals, Americans, have seen their wealth increase by over $1  trillion. Our middle class is still paying. They are not seeing the  growth that they have expected to see.   Many large, multinational corporations are paying nothing in taxes,  while we all pay, and, yet, our deficit has ballooned yet again. In  this case, it ballooned astronomically, Mr. Speaker. It ballooned by  $1.5 trillion as projected from this tax scam.   When are we going to start investing in the middle class? That is  what we are up to here. That is what the second part of this session of  Congress is about, the infrastructure guarantee. When we say, guess  what? Every single American has got the right to clean and safe  drinking water, to fresh air to breathe, to safe and maintained  roadways and bridges so we can continue to create jobs.   This is why I created the Congressional Plastic Solutions Task Force  in partnership with our Congressional Recycling Caucus. We have a  plastics problem globally and in this country. Why? Because of a  fallacious trade war, tariff war, that has been started.   China stopped taking our recycled goods. They stopped taking our  plastics. So you talk to your municipalities, and who is paying? They  are. Who is paying? You are; our taxpayers, yet again; our communities,  yet again. If you didn't know that, your municipality of residence pays  to do the recycling.   Now, let's think about this really clearly, because I believe we have  the greatest opportunity to create and awaken an incredible supply  chain in recycling technology in this country.   As the chair of the Research and Technology Subcommittee of the  Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, I had a hearing about  this. It was absolutely brilliant: industry, research, academia, and my  municipality--Paul Sincock, the Plymouth City manager--all saying the  same thing: Give us standards. Mark the goods. Tell us what to do with  them. And then let's think about how we can invest, and pilot, and  inspire; more so, get strategic about how we actually want to do  recycling in this country to create jobs.   Because if we think about the sorting and the materials and what goes  into it, the onus is on all of us. It is on us as a Federal Government  and as a partner with local government, State government, and  individual consumers, and the companies who want to see the reuse of  these materials.   So we are quite enthusiastic about these opportunities, but it begins  with investing in R&D, research and development. And this is what kind  of gets my goat with the tax bill that was passed before I got here.  Because according to the International Monetary Fund, only one-fifth of  the tax gains to businesses were directed toward capital and R&D  expenditures, so we are not seeing that investment going to the new  technologies that will create the new jobs, that will employ more  people.   We know it is exciting. We know it is there. We know if we gave every  municipality in this country the opportunity to recycle to their full  potential, to reduce, reuse, reuse those materials, we would not only  gain back those materials that we have sourced, but we would have new  jobs as a result of that.   Mr. Speaker, as we talk about the jobs and as we look at the skills  that our employers are looking for, that we are training for in this  year 2020, in this new decade, some reference that we are in this  fourth industrial revolution of which I am a champion.   This is where I came out of before I was in this body. I was working  in the industrial Internet of Things space, collaborating with  nonprofits and universities and community colleges and local school  districts, like my good friends in Novi Community School District.   We had a lot of fun and we are identifying those skills. We have  identified them. We codified the job roles: technology and computer  skills; digital skills; an understanding of the ones and zeros;  programming skills for robots and automation.                                time  1915    These are things that have great meaning to those of us in Michigan's  11th District because I am home to the company that has the largest  robot, with FANUC in the world in Rochester Hills/Auburn Hills.   It is really quite exciting, working with tools and different  techniques, different technical skills and critical thinking.  [[Page H60]]    These are things that don't know partisan lines, by the way. These  are things that make you stand up and say: I am going to be a champion  for this, addressing the root pain that is seeping into our economy.   These are realities. Last year, Michigan lost 6,200 factory jobs, yet  we are creating and innovating at exponential rates. We decided to go  it alone with tariffs, and we are paying the price. We are being  squeezed.   I believe we can all work together to solve this. I am not being a  naysayer because we all know we need to hold China accountable. This is  something that has been a project of mine throughout my career, which  is how to take on the bad actors with the illegal dumping, the currency  manipulation, the stealing of our patents, and the unfair playing field  that affects our workforce.   We still know that we value American work and that we value the  craftsmanship and what goes into making a regional economy like mine  hum in really exciting and exponential ways. We understand that, and we  recognize that we can come together in meaningful ways.   We also continue to call on the Senate to pass the bills that we have  sent forward, the many bipartisan bills, the very bipartisan Butch  Lewis Act, to protect the pensions of our hardworking Americans, those  who did everything right and are still waiting.   I have not forgotten in 2020 that we are still working to get that  deal done. We are still working to increase the wage. This is something  in Michigan that we voted on, to increase the minimum wage, to raise  the wage. One job should be enough. Your valued work should be enough.   We are not seeking to overregulate and get rid of good deals, but  what we are looking to do, Mr. Speaker, is to stand up for individual,  hardworking Americans, those who are counting on us. It is incumbent  upon us.   We sit in this body of 435 individuals. They increased that number  the last time in 1913. Many, many years later, the population has  grown.   History is important, my friends. I encourage you to read your  history. I encourage you to learn the facts and figures of our past and  embrace how that has changed our future. We are in some trying times.   We closed out 2019 in this session of Congress with some things that  I was very proud of. I got my first bill signed into law, the Building  Blocks of STEM Act--bipartisan and bicameral--signed by the President  on December 24, I believe it was, a bill that will support investments  in early childhood education. I want all of my Michiganders lining up  for this. It is the National Science Foundation. We get a lot of NSF  dollars, millions, in Michigan.   The investment in early childhood education, Mr. Speaker, is  priceless. That continuity for those jobs in the future is how we get  in front of the skills gap. That is how we start addressing some of the  rumblings in our regional economy.   We also, though, recognize that the headlines that we have embraced  in this new year and in this new session of Congress have many  Americans concerned. Many individuals are asking: What is going to  happen? What is taking place in the Middle East? What does this mean  for my family?   Constituents say to me: ``I have teenage sons. Are they going to be  drafted?'' We take that responsibility that the Congress is charged  with very seriously.   Mr. Speaker, I look to this, which is that President Barack Obama  gave us the words that change will not come if we wait for some other  person or some other time. He said: ``We are the ones we have been  waiting for. We are the change we seek.''   That is what our House majority is about. That is what our For the  People agenda is representing. That is what we are taking up this week  when we say no to war, Mr. Speaker.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
