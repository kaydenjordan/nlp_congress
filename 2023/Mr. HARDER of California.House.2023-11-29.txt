 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate Sikh  Awareness and Appreciation Month.   Sikhism is the fifth largest religion in the world, with over 250,000  Sikhs calling California home. The Sikh community has given so much to  California and, in particular, to my district in San Joaquin County. In  fact, the Sikh community helped build Stockton and San Joaquin County  into what they are today. The very first gurdwara in the United States  was founded in Stockton over 100 years ago.   Sikh farmers, truck drivers, doctors, and business leaders have  contributed so much to making our community what it is today. My wife,  Pam, and our daughter, Lillian, are proud of their Indian heritage.   The Sikh community has opened their arms to my family, sharing their  traditions, warmth, and hospitality. I am eternally grateful.   As November comes to an end, I hope we can all take some time to  celebrate our Sikh loved ones and recommit to our shared values of  equality, justice, and religious freedom.                            ____________________
