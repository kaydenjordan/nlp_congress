 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, the Democratic leader and I worked into  the evening alongside the Speaker of the House and the House Republican  leader. We made major headway toward hammering out a targeted pandemic  relief package that would be able to pass both Chambers with bipartisan  majorities. We committed to continuing these urgent discussions until  we have an agreement, and we agreed we will not leave town until we  have made law.   The American people need more help. It is that simple. Further  targeted relief is now months overdue. We need vaccine distribution  money. We need to re-up the Paycheck Protection Program to save jobs.  We need to continue to provide for laid-off Americans. Congressional  leaders on both sides are going to keep working until we get this done.                            ____________________     Mr. President, now on a completely different matter,  it is both my honor and unhappy duty to offer one more parting tribute  to a distinguished Senator who will leave us at the end of the 116th  Congress.   My good friend the senior Senator from Kansas, Pat Roberts, is  preparing to close out the longest congressional tenure the Sunflower  State has ever seen.   When Pat arrived in Washington as a freshman House Member, he was a  young man among giants--Byrd, Stevens, Dole. But over the past four  decades, the name ``Roberts'' has come to define its own iconic brand  of heartland statesmanship.   Pat is the first to admit he didn't establish that name all on his  own. He inherited it from another great Kansan. Charles Wesley Roberts  was a marine, a journalist, and a leader in Republican politics.   So get ready to experience some deja vu, because at age 16, our  future colleague got to attend the 1952 convention that nominated  Kansas's own General Eisenhower. That early taste of politics planted a  seed.   Pat earned his own Marine Corps commission. In fact, he served with  the first contingent to return to Iwo Jima, where his father had fought  15 years earlier.  [[Page S7512]]    Then he decided to ply another family trade. Like generations of  Roberts men, including an abolitionist newspaperman three generations  back, he took up journalism.   Only then did Pat bring his talents here to Washington, to Senator  Frank Carlson's office. He impressed, and by the next time his next  boss, Keith Sebelius, announced his retirement, Pat was running out of  excuses not to go on and run himself.   Campaigning in Kansas's ``Big First'' district required countless  road trips across nearly half the State. But listening to neighbors,  building relationships, and earning trust came naturally. Pat's  district elected him no fewer than eight times, and the whole State  sent him here to the Senate another four.   Before long, every small-time diner in Western Kansas was filled with  people who saw Pat not just as an elected official but as a trusted  friend. The way I hear it, you walk into a restaurant or a coffee shop  with Pat, and you budget about 15 minutes of conversation before you  even make it to your table. Many of those conversations revolve around  one particular line of work. There is a reason why no less an authority  than Bob Dole would later dub this man ``Mr. Agriculture.''   When Republicans retook the House majority in 1994, they knew who had  to chair the Ag Committee. The rest is history for our colleague, for  his State, and for farmers and growers all across America.   The 1996 farm bill that Pat shepherded included ``Freedom to Farm,''  landmark legislation that set a new tone for the way American farmers  would compete in a global market.   Now, today, we know that Pat would later become the only American  ever to chair the Ag Committee in both the Senate and the House. But on  this side of the dome, he tackled a few other assignments first.   Pat had already helped clean up some ethics messes in the House, and  so his discretion and integrity landed him on the Senate Ethics  Committee. In short order, he was chairing it.   Then came the Intelligence Committee gavel and, with it, more  sensitive challenges. Our trusted marine had to conduct oversight and  ask hard questions in the wake of September 11 and the Iraq invasion.  He oversaw essential reports and helped shape reform.   But we couldn't keep the Kansan away from his top passion for long.  So it wasn't long before Mr. Agriculture was chairing the committee  with the most importance of all to his constituents back in Kansas.   Chairman Roberts has been a constant voice and a consistent champion  for the men and women of this country who get their hands dirty, grow  crops, raise livestock, and, as our colleague likes to say, ``feed a  troubled and hungry world.''   Even in polarized times, the Ag Committee has largely remained a  haven for bipartisan work. That is partly the nature of an issue set  where divisions tend to be more regional than ideological, but it is  also because of the skilled, thoughtful, and genial consensus-builder  we have had at the center of the dais.   Two years ago, because of the chairman, the farm bill conference  report passed by an overwhelming margin of 87 to 13--87 votes for our  farm bill. By my count, that was the eighth farm bill our colleague had  a hand in. It turns out that experience actually matters, or, as our  colleague likes to say, ``it takes a long time to do big things''--``a  long time to do big things.''   That is true of multiyear farm bills. It is true of the advances Pat  has pushed forward on geopolitical issues like food security. It is  true of other important projects that our friend has taken under his  wing, like the crusade to make certain that President Eisenhower  receives the monument he deserved here in Washington. This pandemic may  have changed the unveiling ceremonies this year, but it is only fitting  that Ike persevered. That is thanks to a quarter century of work from  Pat Roberts.   There is a reason the people of Kansas have rehired our colleague  time after time, and it is not just for his entertaining wit, although  I will have more on that subject in just a moment. It is because, when  their Senator sees a way to strengthen his home State or his country,  he keeps at it until he gets it done.   In short, Pat has spent decades making sure that it is not just  places like Manhattan, NY, but also Manhattan, KS, that get the  attention and support they deserve.   In fact, thanks to Pat, Manhattan, KS, is the home for our Nation's  historic new National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility. He played the long  game and spent years getting his State ready to make the pitch. This  state-of-the-art research facility will come online at K-State, next to  another important research facility that happens to be named Pat  Roberts Hall.   He has looked out for Fort Riley and its essential missions. He has  helped devastated communities like Greensburg rebuild after disaster.  In every way imaginable, Kansas has had its champion.   Pat's voice has been a powerful presence in these halls. But in rare  moments when he hasn't been getting results, the voice has, of course,  been making us laugh. Pat is one of the best humored Senators in a long  time--not funny, humorous.   It is not just Pat's quick wit or his punch lines themselves that  take the cake. The best part is just the unpretentious fearlessness  with which he will go after a good laugh in almost any situation.   It is a daunting task to try to convey Pat's winsome humor as a third  party. It is a package deal. The words, the voice, the expression all  work together. But I will share just one example.   Several years back, Pat and I were both attending a formal dinner  honoring Bob Dole and Howard Baker. Pat had been asked to offer some  remarks in Bob's honor. Apparently, he decided a conventional toast  would just simply not cut it; the fancy evening would need shaking up.   It so happened that Pat had recently attended Kennedy Center Honors  that honored Neil Diamond. So when Pat took the podium at that dinner,  with that famous tune ``Sweet Caroline'' stuck in his head, he wound up  leading the audience in the world premiere sing-along of the new  original song ``Sweet Robert Dole . . . Bob, Bob, Bob.'' A little  unusual, sure, but somehow it was the perfect contribution. It  literally brought the house down.   So we have here a senior Senator from a State that expects greatness  from its representatives. They gave America a young man from Abilene  who led the fight against tyranny in Europe and became President. They  gave us another son from Russell who fought in that fight, came home,  became Senate majority leader, and ran for President.   But let's add one more name to that distinguished company. Historians  certainly will. There is a third Kansas statesman from Holton who  belongs on that list: Eisenhower, Dole, and Roberts.   In his own farewell speech, Pat quoted his first boss in Washington,  Senator Carlson. He said:         There are no self-made men or women in public office. It is       your friends and family who make you what you are.    Well, more than all the bills he has passed, above all the outcomes  he willed into reality, Pat says his family is his ``crowning  achievement.'' So I must conclude by thanking Pat's ``magnolia  blossom,'' Franki, for her generosity in lending Pat to us all these  years and everything she has done to make it possible. And the Senate  thanks his three kids and their eight grandchildren for making do with  less of our colleague's time than they deserve.   So Pat, we know we are going to laugh less without you. I am afraid  we are not going to get as much done without you.   But you have made us better for knowing you, the Senate better for  having you, and Kansas and your country so much better for your devoted  service.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, today I want to extend congratulations  and best wishes to a friend, a skilled attorney in the areas of  campaign finance and election law, and a devoted defender of the First  Amendment.   After more than 35 years, Jan Witold Baran is retiring from the law  firm Wiley Rein LLP at the end of the month. Throughout his  distinguished career, Jan has successfully represented thousands of  clients, including me. He has put his brilliance to work defending all  Americans' rights to participate in our democracy and express  themselves through voluntary contributions to the candidates of their  choice, so that a few elite gatekeepers cannot control the public  discourse in our country.   When you consider Jan's background, it is no surprise he is committed  to preserving freedom. Jan was born in postwar Europe to a Flemish  mother and Polish Catholic father. Before Jan was born, his father had  survived 2\1/2\ years in concentration camps including Auschwitz,  before he was liberated by American troops at Dachau. Jan's father was  incarcerated because during his tenure as mayor of a small town in  Poland, he refused to turn in his rifle to the Gestapo. Clearly a  stubborn dedication to freedom under law is in Jan's bloodline.   Next year will mark the 70th anniversary of the Baran family's  immigration to America. I am sure his parents would be extremely proud  of what their son has accomplished. A decorated scholar from Vanderbilt  Law School; general counsel for the National Republican Congressional  Committee; a trailblazing attorney at the FEC; general counsel to the  1988 campaign of President George H. W. Bush; counsel to the Republican  National Committee. President Bush appointed him to the Commission on  Federal Ethics Law Reform and as Ambassador and Chairman of the U.S.  Delegation to the World Administrative Radio Conference.   Jan Baran has been an integral part of legal teams that have defended  Americans' political speech rights before the U.S. Supreme Court. He  was part of my team when I challenged the constitutionality of the  campaign finance law known as McCain-Feingold. From McConnell v. FEC to  Citizens United and beyond, Jan was in the middle of these important  battles. Through these episodes and many more, I personally have  witnessed and appreciated Jan's candor, sharp legal mind, and strategic  thinking.   Washington can be a transient place, but Mr. Baran has stayed in the  fray for more than 40 years and given his best every day to uphold free  speech and defend the Republic. I am not sure if the people of that  small town in Poland know that the son of their wartime mayor's son  built such a distinguished career in just one generation. His talent,  perseverance, and commitment to his country are a credit to where Jan  came from and the life he has led along the way. I extend my warm  wishes to him and his wife Kathryn, their four children, sons-in-law,  and grandchildren.                            ____________________
