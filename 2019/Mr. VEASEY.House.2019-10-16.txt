 Mr. Speaker, one of my favorite pastimes is playing video  games with my 13-year-old son, just as Atatiana Jefferson was doing  with her 8-year-old nephew when she was murdered by a police officer in  front of him in Fort Worth, Texas, this past weekend.   I rise today to commemorate the legacy of Atatiana, also known as  ``Aunt Tay'' by her 8-year-old nephew, and call on our law enforcement  to stop these killings now.   It only took 3 seconds before a police officer fatally shot this  woman in front of her 8-year-old nephew while they were playing video  games. She didn't even have a chance to show her hands.   The reality for many Black and Brown people in this country is that  this is our America, this is the America that we live in every day. It  doesn't matter what neighborhood we live in or how much money we make.  This is what we face.   Until law enforcement reforms their culture of rogue policing that  has led  [[Page H8151]]  to the slaughtering of so many people in this country, justice cannot  fully be served.   Nothing is going to bring Atatiana or all of those who have been  unjustly killed back, but we have to do better. We have to hold our law  enforcement accountable and fix the systematic failures that have  brought us here today. Until then, our communities cannot have full  confidence in those who are tasked in protecting all of us.                            ____________________
