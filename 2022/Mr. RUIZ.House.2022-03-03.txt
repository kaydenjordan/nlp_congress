 Madam Speaker, Russia's unprovoked, unjustified war on  Ukraine threatens peace, democracy, and stability around the globe.  However, what it does not do is break us, and it has not broken the  people of Ukraine.   Instead, the people of Ukraine have shown the world their resilience  and the strength of democracy. As we work to hold Vladimir Putin  accountable for his aggression, we must also ensure that we provide  support for the Ukrainian people as they seek certainty and refuge.   As an emergency physician and the only trained humanitarian in  Congress, I have seen firsthand what lies ahead for those fleeing a  crisis. This is a complex humanitarian crisis and deserves a human  response. The U.S. must contribute to that response, including helping  our humanitarian partners on the ground and granting Ukrainians refuge  and temporary protected status to Ukrainian nationals here in the  country.   Madam Speaker, I stand in solidarity with the Ukrainian people to  protect their sovereignty, and my prayers are with them.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of my amendment to the Honoring our  PACT Act, which includes language from my bill, the Burn Pits Registry  Enhancement Act.   This amendment would allow veterans in the burn pits registry to  designate someone to update the registry with their cause of death. I  hope that makes common sense. This data is crucial to further identify  illnesses that are causing burn pit exposed veterans to die and will  help doctors recognize early symptoms.   I also rise in support of another amendment I submitted that was part  of an en bloc package that passed yesterday. That amendment is from my  Reducing Exposure to Burn Pits Act. It would require the DOD to  consider safer alternatives to burn pits. This amendment will get us  one step closer to ending the exposure to toxic burn pits once and for  all.   I have fought for years to bring attention to this issue and its  devastating toll on our Nation's servicemembers and their families.   I have told the story of Jennifer Kepner, an Air Force veteran from  Cathedral City in my district. She was an otherwise healthy mother of  two who lost her courageous battle with pancreatic cancer likely caused  by her exposure to burn pits during her military service.   I have told the story of Alejandro Camacho, my constituent from Palm  Desert, who developed testicular cancer from the toxic smoke and  carcinogens he breathed in every day during his service in Iraq.   It is for Jennifer, Alejandro, and the millions of other veterans  suffering from their burn pit exposure that I founded the bipartisan,  bicameral Congressional Burn Pit Caucus.   It is why I introduced the Presumptive Benefits for War Fighters  Exposed to Burn Pits and Other Toxins Act to create a presumption of  service connection for 23 illnesses related to service near burn pits.   That bill is included in the Honoring our PACT Act and highlights the  urgent need to pass it now. The Honoring our PACT Act will take urgent  and aggressive action to give the veterans the care they need and  ensure we don't repeat the Agent Orange delays that our Vietnam  veterans experienced.   Last night, I texted the widower of Jennifer Kepner, Ben Kepner, and  I said: Tomorrow is the big day, my friend. He texted back: Tomorrow is  Jennifer Kepner's birthday. So we will pass this bill on Jennifer  Kepner's birthday, which is amazing.   Madam Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to Chairman Takano.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, how much time do I have remaining?    Madam Speaker, I would like to thank Chairman Takano and  the Veterans' Affairs Committee staff for their tireless work, their  leadership, their courage and bravery to address this incredible  problem.   I would also like to thank all the veterans who spoke up when nobody  listened, like Rosie Torres from Burn Pits 360; and many others who  have lost a loved one; and all the widows who have been crying to be  recognized and pleading with us to do something so that other veterans  wouldn't suffer these atrocities.   This is a self-inflicted DOD wound that our military did to our  servicemembers, and now they are dying as delayed casualties of war due  to those exposures. We need to save lives today. This is a life-and- death situation.   If there is ever a human face to policy, it is now in this policy  because there are children wondering why, when their parents came back  healthy from the war, they died 5, 6, 7 years later. This is why we  need to pass this bill and ensure that our promise to our veterans, and  our promise to our Vietnam veterans, that we will never allow their  Agent Orange experience to translate ever again into the American  experience.   This is our time to stand up for our veterans, not just in hugging  flags, but also in pragmatic solidarity and support to give them the  care and the relief that they need right now.   Madam Speaker, I wish the Kepner family a very happy birthday  celebration in memory of Jennifer Kepner. I yield back the balance of  my time.
