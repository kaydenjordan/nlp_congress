 Madam President, today I recognize Oliver Diez, the  Miami-Dade County Teacher of the Year from Palmetto Elementary School  in Pinecrest, FL.   Oliver received this award in recognition for his dedication to  teaching children a passion for music before they leave elementary  school. He begins teaching students how to play an introductory  instrument, the recorder, at an early age. From there, they can join  one of his school's before and afterschool offerings of chorus, concert  band, jazz combo, orchestra, and drum-line. Once they join a music  program, his lessons focus on teaching them not only how to play  instruments, but also its history. He believes this builds an  appreciation for music in his young students.   Throughout his two-decade long teaching career at Palmetto Elementary  School, he has built a successful music program at south Florida's  largest elementary school. His fourth and fifth grade student were  invited to play at Carnegie Hall in New York City this March, the only  elementary school students to play. While he believes teaching is messy  at times, he knows it unites students to work together for the final  performance.   Oliver graduated from Florida International University with his  bachelor's degree in 1999 and returned for his master's degree in 2016,  both majoring in music education. He also helped launch a booster club  at his school that is a registered nonprofit for travel expenses for  performances.   I express my sincere appreciation to Oliver for all of the  accomplished work with his students and wish him continued success in  the years to come.                            ____________________     Madam President, today I honor Ian Jackson, the  Volusia County Teacher of the Year from T. Dewitt Taylor Middle-High  School in Pierson, FL.   Ian is an Advancement Via Individual Determination teacher, working  [[Page S1488]]  with students from 8th to 12th grade and considers it his job to change  the trajectories of his students for the better. After receiving this  award, Ian noted that it was not just him being recognized, but also  his students for their success.   Ian urges his students to strive for greatness in their middle school  and high school coursework in preparation for the college workload. He  focuses on ensuring his classroom feels like a second home to his  students when they struggle and are in need of support.   Many of Ian's students come from difficult circumstances, so he works  to establish strong relationships and create a positive environment for  them. He dedicates his time to listening to the needs of his students  and conveying to them that he cares about their well-being. Eighty  percent of his students are accepted into 4-year universities and many  stay in contact with him through college and beyond.   Ian has taught at T. Dewitt Taylor Middle-High School since 2005. He  previously taught English as a second language classes in Georgia. He  earned his bachelor's degree from Tocca Falls College.   I extend my sincere thanks and gratitude to Ian for his dedication to  helping his students succeed in life. I look forward to learning of his  continued success in the coming years.                            ____________________
