 Mr. Speaker, first let me thank Congressman Veasey for  yielding and for his tireless work to defend rights and justice. Also  to Congresswoman Plaskett, I thank the gentlewoman for continuing to  speak out, to organize us, and for her stellar representation of her  district.   Mr. Speaker, in his first week as President, Donald Trump advanced  dangerous conspiracy theories and enacted a Muslim ban that undermines  our Nation's standing in the world. These actions show that President  Trump will peddle his alternative facts no matter the consequences.                                time  2015    Now, let me be clear. This approach to governance threatens our  democracy and our national security. We must resist it. For starters,  we cannot allow President Trump to erode our right to vote. Access to  the ballot box is the cornerstone of American democracy, yet he spent  his first week in office peddling the baseless myth that 3 to 5 million  voted illegally in our election.   Mr. Speaker, nothing could be further from the truth. Both  Republicans and Democrats have dismissed this myth as unsubstantiated,  but the President continues to insist that millions of fraudulent  voters cost him the popular vote.   Let's call this what it is. This is a campaign by our highest elected  official to fabricate reasons why he lost the majority of popular  votes. He will use these blatant falsehoods to further undermine access  to the voting booth.   Mr. Speaker, this investigation that is being proposed really is a  sham. The real attack on America's elections come from Republicans who  make it harder for people of color, young people, and low-income people  to vote.   I include in the Record an editorial from The New York Times, ``The  Voter Fraud Fantasy.''                  [From The New York Times, Jan. 27, 2017]                          The Voter Fraud Fantasy                              (By Lilli Carre)         There are varying degrees of absurdity in the fallacies       President Trump peddled during his first week in the Oval       Office. Perhaps the most damaging was his insistence that       millions of Americans voted illegally in the election he       narrowly won.        Mr. Trump first made that false claim in late November,       tweeting that he would have won the popular vote ``if you       deduct the millions of people who voted illegally.'' On       Wednesday, he announced that he intended to launch a ``major       investigation'' into voting fraud and suggested the outcome       may justify tightening voting rules.        What once seemed like another harebrained claim by a       president with little regard for the truth must now be       recognized as a real threat to American democracy. Mr. Trump       is telegraphing his administration's intent to provide cover       for longstanding efforts by Republicans to suppress minority       voters by purging voting rolls, imposing onerous       identification requirements and curtailing early voting.        ``This is another attempt to undermine our democracy,''       said Representative Barbara Lee of California, one of the       states where Mr. Trump falsely claimed results were tainted       by large-scale fraud. ``It's about not honoring and       recognizing demographic change.''        The apparent source of Mr. Trump's original claim of mass       voter fraud was Gregg Phillips, a Texas man with a penchant       for making wild allegations about voting fraud. Days before       Mr. Trump's tweet, Mr. Phillips claimed on Twitter that he       had ``verified more than three million votes cast by non-      citizens.'' State election officials across the political       spectrum promptly rejected that assertion, noting that ballot       box fraud in the United States is exceedingly rare.        On Friday, Mr. Trump tweeted that he was looking forward to       seeing the results of an analysis of illegal votes, as       promised by Mr. Phillips. Republican officials know the voter       fraud claim is an indefensible lie. But few are challenging       Mr. Trump or raising alarms about how severely this hurts our       election system.        Voter suppression initiatives have grown increasingly       common since the Supreme  [[Page H729]]       Court invalidated a central provision of the Voting Rights       Act in 2013, making it easier for local authorities to tweak       election rules in a manner that disenfranchises particular       groups of people.        Under the Obama administration, the Justice Department       aggressively fought these efforts. Lawsuits filed by civil       rights advocates and the Justice Department led a federal       appeals court in 2013 to strike down a North Carolina voter       ID law that justices concluded had been designed to target       African-American voters with ``surgical precision.''       Litigation in a similar Texas case is now on hold, pending       guidance from the new attorney general.        If Mr. Trump's attorney general nominee, Senator Jeff       Sessions, is confirmed, the Justice Department will be likely       to all but abandon enforcement of the Voting Rights Act. Mr.       Sessions once called it a ``piece of intrusive legislation.''       That would allow state and national lawmakers to impose even       tighter voting requirements, harming minorities, the young       and the elderly, who tend to vote Democratic.        Republicans may see these measures as a means of staying in       power in the face of demographic changes. They should be       ashamed of undermining the integrity of our system of       government by trying to strip away a right Americans have       fought for and died to secure.     If the President were serious about protecting access to the  ballot, he would join members of the Congressional Black Caucus in our  call for the restoration of the Voting Rights Act.   Since it was gutted in 2013, millions of minority voters have been  prevented from casting their votes. Last year alone, hundreds of  thousands of minority voters were disenfranchised before and on  election day.   Instead of lodging investigations based on alternative facts,  President Trump should be investigating the widespread efforts to  disenfranchise voters, including the use of outdated voting machines,  the mishandling of provisional ballots, the improper purging of voting  rolls, and the widely reporting incidents of intimidation and  misinformation at the polls.   These are the truth threats to our democracy. If these threats are  not enough to occupy President Trump's attention, he should turn to the  widespread evidence of Russian interference in our elections. The facts  are available and in need of bipartisan investigation, but President  Trump has no interest in evaluating facts. He would rather focus on  falsehoods.   But the President's attacks on our democracy aren't restricted to  alternative facts. This weekend we witnessed the erosion of another  American value: our proud tradition as a refuge for immigrants of every  religion. The President issued an executive order banning immigrants  and refugees from the United States on the basis of religion.   This outrageous executive order to shut people out from several  Muslim nations runs counter to our fundamental values that we cherish  as Americans. It is morally reprehensible and will only make the United  States less safe. The order has done nothing but create chaos and fear  among refugees and immigrants who have been admitted or have been  approved to come to the United States.   This Nation is, has been, and always will be a nation of immigrants  and refugees. This is who we are. We don't turn our back to those in  need. And certainly, we do not do so on the basis of religion.   This is a watershed moment for our country, a moment that brings into  question our moral character. Thousands of Americans took to the  streets to protest the Muslim ban. Really? This is what the resistance  must look like.   Tonight, many of us joined our colleagues on the steps of the Supreme  Court to demand a reversal of this hateful policy. We will continue to  fight every attempt to erode our values to appease ideology and radical  special interests.   Our new bill, Statue of Liberty Values Act, known as the SOLVE Act,  will reverse President Trump's Muslim ban executive order and ensure  that funds or fees shall not be used to implement the order. I hope  everyone signs on to Congresswoman Lofgren's bill. The President's  order harms our families, our economy, and our national security.   Once again, this is not who we are as a nation. We are better than.  We must wake up and fight because the future of our democracy is at  stake.   My district is a district of immigrants. People are very afraid. We  are a sanctuary district. What is taking place now is totally un- American.
