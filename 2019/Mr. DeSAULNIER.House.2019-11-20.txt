 Madam Speaker, by direction of the Committee on  Rules, I call up House Resolution 713 and ask for its immediate  consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 713         Resolved, That at any time after adoption of this       resolution the Speaker may, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule       XVIII, declare the House resolved into the Committee of the       Whole House on the state of the Union for consideration of       the bill (H.R. 1309) to direct the Secretary of Labor to       issue an occupational safety and health standard that       requires covered employers within the health care and social       service industries to develop and implement a comprehensive       workplace violence prevention plan, and for other purposes.       The first reading of the bill shall be dispensed with. All       points of order against  [[Page H9069]]       consideration of the bill are waived. General debate shall be       confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on Education and Labor. After general       debate the bill shall be considered for amendment under the       five-minute rule. In lieu of the amendment in the nature of a       substitute recommended by the Committee on Education and       Labor now printed in the bill, an amendment in the nature of       a substitute consisting of the text of Rules Committee Print       116-37, modified by the amendment printed in part A of the       report of the Committee on Rules accompanying this       resolution, shall be considered as adopted in the House and       in the Committee of the Whole. The bill, as amended, shall be       considered as the original bill for the purpose of further       amendment under the five-minute rule and shall be considered       as read. All points of order against provisions in the bill,       as amended, are waived. No further amendment to the bill, as       amended, shall be in order except those printed in part B of       the report of the Committee on Rules.

At the conclusion of consideration of       the bill for amendment the Committee shall rise and report       the bill, as amended, to the House with such further       amendments as may have been adopted. The previous question       shall be considered as ordered on the bill, as amended, and       on any further amendment thereto to final passage without       intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or       without instructions.

On any legislative day during the period from       November 22, 2019, through December 2, 2019--         (a) the Journal of the proceedings of the previous day       shall be considered as approved; and        (b) the Chair may at any time declare the House adjourned       to meet at a date and time, within the limits of clause 4,       section 5, article I of the Constitution, to be announced by       the Chair in declaring the adjournment.

It shall be in order at any time on the       legislative day of November 21, 2019, for the Speaker to       entertain motions that the House suspend the rules as though       under clause 1 of rule XV. The Speaker or her designee shall       consult with the Minority Leader or his designee on the       designation of any matter for consideration pursuant to this       section.     Madam Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I  yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Burgess), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume.  During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the  purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members be given 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Madam Speaker, yesterday, the Rules Committee met and  reported a structured rule, House Resolution 713, providing for  consideration of H.R. 1309, the Workplace Violence Prevention for  Health Care and Social Service Workers Act. The rule provides 1 hour of  debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and the ranking  member of the Committee on Education and Labor, makes in order all 10  amendments submitted, and provides for a motion to recommit. It also  provides standard recess instructions for next week's district work  period.   Madam Speaker, there is an epidemic of violence against healthcare  and social workers in the United States. Last year, Department of Labor  statistics showed they were nearly five times as likely to suffer a  serious workplace violence injury than workers in other industries.   The Government Accountability Office found that rates of violence  against healthcare workers in hospitals, nursing homes, and residential  care facilities are 5 to 12 times higher than the estimated rates for  workers overall. Between 2011 and 2016, 58 hospital workers died as a  result of workplace violence.   For me, this matter strikes close to home. In 2010, a Napa State  Hospital technician in California, Donna Kay Gross, a constituent, was  killed outside the State hospital by a patient under psychiatric care.  Donna entered the profession to honor her mother, who battled mental  illness and was a patient at that very hospital. She was the mother of  three grown children and was raising her granddaughter. Her colleagues  described her by saying: First and foremost, Donna was a human service- type person and loved being with people and working with people.   Donna's life was cut short when a patient brutally murdered her to  steal jewelry and cash from her.   This story is just one of thousands of incidents that are on the  rise. Sadly, violence has become so commonplace for healthcare workers  that they think it is part of their job, resulting in only 30 percent  of violent incidents being reported.   Some States have stepped up to enact laws to require employers to  establish a plan to protect against workplace violence. Donna's story,  for example, inspired action in California that I was proud to be a  part of when I was chair of the senate labor committee. That action in  California served as the basis for the bill before us today in the rule  and tomorrow on the floor.   These workers deserve national action, and they deserve it now. At  the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, these workers are  not receiving the urgent attention they need. OSHA takes at least 7  years to put out a standard, but in some instances can take up to 20  years.   People like Donna Kay Gross cannot wait that long. To protect the  people who dedicate their lives to caring for us, we need to move now.  The longer we wait, the more people will suffer.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman  from Connecticut (Mr. Courtney), who has put so much work into this  effort.    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman from Connecticut.    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman from Connecticut.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman  from Nevada (Mrs. Lee).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Just a couple of points to my friend from Texas. He is correct on the  open process. However, we did allow for all 10 amendments that were  submitted to be accepted, and the final vote was 2-9, understanding  that that was a foregone conclusion to many of us.   I would just say that this is such an important issue in the urgency,  and I would like to join with my colleague to fix the standard and the  practice, and to add funding so that the Department can do it.   There is an urgency for problems like this to be solved. We can save  money in the long run. When I was in local government, I was on the  governing board of our county hospital. Two of our five floors were  psych wards. We spent hours and hours in closed sessions dealing with  liability issues on those wards.   So when I read this bill, I think that so much of what is in this  bill, many of us have already done, at least from California at the  local level and at the State level, and it is good business practice.   As somebody who is a former small business owner that had high  workers' compensation in the restaurant business, cost avoidance is a  good thing. My workers' compensation carrier came out at least once a  year to inspect our facilities and see where we could avoid these  incidents. So it is just a good business practice.   When I look at this, it makes so much sense. There is a cost to start  this, but there is, clearly, in my mind, a fiscal savings and an  emotional savings when you think of the lives lost. This is not new,  but the demand in the changing trend lines say to me that this is  urgent.   So I would like to agree with my friend from Texas and I would be  happy to work with him, but with incidents like this, this Department  really needs to be ramped up. It is a national embarrassment that it  takes 20 years, or 7 years for the Department to do these rules,  understanding that you have to work with stakeholders.   So I think there is an element of opportunity here for us. I do think  that it is unfortunate, as we talked about in the Rules Committee last  night, and Mr. Byrne talked about, that we couldn't get across the  finish line and come together completely as a bipartisan bill.   Having said that, as my friend from Texas alluded to, this is a  bipartisan bill. We do have supporters, including Mr. Cole.   Madam Speaker, I have no other speakers, and I understand that the  gentleman has no additional speakers, so I reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I want to thank my colleague from Texas for his  comments.   Democratic and Republican administrations have sat idly by while  healthcare and social service workers are being beaten, abused, and  killed. The problem is not going away. It is getting worse.   In the words of the ranking member of the Rules Committee, the  distinguished gentleman from Oklahoma, he will be voting for the bill  because it is better than what we have got. I certainly agree.   This bill does far better for our frontline workers who we ask to  care for us every day. I urge a ``yes'' vote on the rule and the  previous question.   The text of the material previously referred to by Mr. Burgess is as  follows:                     Amendment to House Resolution 713          At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 6. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution, the       House shall proceed to consideration in the House of the bill       (H.R. 1869) to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to       restore incentives for investments in qualified improvement       property. All points of order against consideration of the       bill are waived. The bill shall be considered as read. All       points of order against provisions in the bill are waived.       The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the       bill and on any amendment thereto to final passage without       intervening motion except:        (1) one hour of debate equally divided and controlled by       the chair and the ranking minority member of the Committee on       Ways and Means; and        (2) one motion to recommit.        Sec. 7. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 1869.     Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time,  and I move the previous question on the resolution.
