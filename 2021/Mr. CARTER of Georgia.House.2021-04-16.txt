 Madam Speaker, I rise today with a heavy heart  to remember and honor Mr. Bill Downey III of St. Simons Island,  Georgia, who passed away on February 28 at the age of 87.   Bill was a gentleman in every sense of the word, and he dedicated his  life to serving others. After proudly serving his country in the United  States Army, Bill met his wife of 58 years, Beth Newton.   Service to his community was an integral part of Bill's character.  His kindness and selflessness extended to every area of his life,  including his time as president of the Golden Isles Board of Realtors,  chairman of the St. Simons Island Chamber of Commerce, chairman of the  Airport Commission, and chairman of the Board of Frederica Academy.   He was also a member of St. Andrew's Episcopal Church, where he  served as senior warden. Everyone who knew Bill recognized his giving  heart and love for the outdoors. My thoughts and prayers are with his  family, friends, and all who knew him during this most difficult time.                            ____________________
