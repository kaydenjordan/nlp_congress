 Madam Chair, I thank the chairman and Mr. Clyburn,  who, for years, has been working on this issue.   Madam Chair, H.R. 1112, the Enhanced Background Checks Act of 2019,  is long in coming. It responds to many people, but it responds to  Dylann Roof.   In 2015, he went to a gun store to get a gun. He was not the normal  purchaser, and it did not approve in 90 seconds, as most of them do.  But in a day or two, when it had not yet been approved, Dylann Roof was  able to get a gun. And Dylann Roof's whole message was: I am going to  start a race war by going into an unlocked church on a prayer night and  kill nine worshippers praying to their God and their pastor--whose wife  was here today.   The question has to be: When are we going to stop the senseless  killings and the eons and eons of mass shootings?   My good friend from Georgia (Mr. Collins) is a man of faith. I was in  the committee room as a senior member on the Subcommittee on Crime,  Terrorism, Homeland Security, and Investigations as we were trying to  deliberate his concern, a very vital concern, one that I have, to love  people with disabilities, to love them and treat them with dignity.   The language in this legislation does that as best we could at the  time, because it puts the language adjudicated, determined by some  objective body, that you have a health problem that deals with a mental  concern.   The question has to be, if it is not workable, you pass the bill. All  of us have made a commitment to work through this process and to give  dignity to every person, including veterans.   But at the same time, would you want to have a situation that  happened with Dylann Roof, a convicted felon who grabbed a gun in 2  days and killed nine innocent people, or killed people in various other  places, from Columbine, to Aurora, to Virginia Tech?    Look at the stories of mass shootings, or look at  the violence in cities where people are getting guns.   Madam Chair, I would make the argument that, today, we must pass H.R.  1112. The mercy of all of us dealing with issues to give dignity to  those who suffer from illnesses that embrace mental illness concerns,  it was because Mr. Collins, a man of faith, offered that suggestion.  Therefore, we are going to move forward with the commitment to work it  through and provide the dignity necessary, but to save the lives and to  give tribute in death to those who lost their lives at the hands of  Dylann Roof. Vote for H.R. 1112.   Madam Chair, I rise in support of H.R. 1112, the ``Enhanced  Background Checks Act of 2019,'' legislation that would strengthen the  background check system that is already in place to purchase a firearm.   I thank the Majority Whip, Congressman Clyburn, for introducing H.R.  1112 in response to the atrocity perpetrated at Mother Emmanuel A.M.E.  Church in Charleston,  [[Page H2283]]  South Carolina, which killed nine members of one of the most  historically significant churches in African American history.   One June 17, 2015, Dylann Roof was responsible for the mass shooting  that took the lives of nine individuals at the Emanuel African  Methodist Episcopal Church.   The victims were later referred to as ``The Charleston Nine'' and  ``The Emanuel Nine''.   Under current law, after a prospective buyer completes the  appropriate form, the holder of a Federal Firearms License initiates  the background check by phone or computer.   If a determination is not obtained within three business days then  the transfer may legally be completed by default proceeding and that is  how Dylan Roof obtain the handgun he used to commit the killings, which  he purchased from a retail store in West Columbia, SC.   H.R 1112, the ``Enhanced Background Checks Act of 2019,'' would  strengthen the background check procedures that firearms licensees or  dealers follow before selling or transferring a firearm.   As under current law, firearms dealers would be required to run a  background check on prospective buyers using the National Instant  Criminal Background Check System (``NICS'').   Over 90% of NICS checks are completed within 90 seconds.   Under H.R. 1112, if the NICS system has not returned an answer to the  licensed firearms dealer within ten days, the prospective firearms  purchaser may file a petition with the Attorney General for review.   Then, after another ten-day period has expired, the licensed firearms  dealer may sell or transfer the firearm to the prospective purchaser if  it has not received a response through the NICS system and the dealer  has no reason to believe that the purchaser is prohibited from  obtaining a firearm under federal, state, or local law.   Under this measure, licensed firearms dealers could not sell or  transfer under the ``default proceed'' provision until at least 20 days  have passed since the initial background check, thus closing the so- called ``Charleston loophole.''   An internal assessment by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)  demonstrated that the National Instant Criminal Background Checks  System (``NICS'') yields results that are approximately 99.3 percent to  99.8 percent accurate, and in 90 percent of cases, are processed within  90 seconds.   We must be constructive and proactive in our response to the  countless mass shootings and gun violence in our country that continue  to claim so many innocent lives.   Newly released data from the Centers for Disease Control and  Prevention (``CDC'') found firearm-related deaths rose for the second- straight year in 2016, largely due to spikes in gun violence.   In 2016, the new CDC report on preliminary mortality data shows that  there were more than 38,000 gun-related deaths in the U.S.--4,000 more  than 2015.   An Associated Press analysis of FBI data shows there were about  11,000 gun-related homicides in 2016, up from 9,600 in 2015.   Congress must act to keep our country safe through gun safety and  violence deterrence.   There is nearly one mass shooting per day in the United State--355  mass shootings in 2015.   In December 2012, a gunman walked into Sandy Hook Elementary School  in Newtown, Connecticut, and killed 20 children, 6 adults, and himself.   Since December 2012, there have been at least 1,518 mass shootings,  with at least 1,715 people killed and 6,089 wounded.   On the night of October 1, 2017, a gunman opened fire on a large  crowd of concertgoers at the Route 91 Harvest Music Festival on the Las  Vegas Strip, leaving 58 people dead and 527 injured.   On November 5, 2017, a mass shooting occurred at the First Baptist  Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, where the gunman, 26-year-old  Devin Patrick Kelley, killed 26 and injured 20 others.   Every day, on average, 92 Americans are victims of gun violence,  resulting in more than 33,000 deaths annually.   States with higher gun ownership rates have higher gun murder rates-- as much as 114 percent higher than other states.   A recent study by the CDC looking at 30 years of homicide data found  that for every 1 percent increase in a state's gun ownership rate,  there is a nearly 1 percent increase in its firearm homicide rate.   Gun death rates are generally lower in states with restrictions such  as safe storage requirements or assault weapons bans.   Mass shootings stopped by armed civilians in the past 33 years: 0.   This is why legislation put forward to arm teachers is not the  solution.   Stronger legislation is needed to prevent guns from getting into the  wrong hands because unfortunately, more than 75 percent of the weapons  used in mass shootings between 1982 and 2012 were obtained legally.   We must look at gun violence in its totality to determine what are  the root causes of these alarming rates of lives cut short.   We are elected by our constituents to lead in resolving the issues  that plague our country, and the issue of gun violence is a definite  plague across the nation.   My good friend, Houston Police Chief Art Acevedo, gave a statement  after four of his officers were shot while on duty.   He rightfully admonished us elected officials who, so far, have  accomplished absolutely nothing about the public-health epidemic of gun  violence.   Thanks to the new Democratic majority in Congress, we had a long  overdue Gun Safety Hearing in the Judiciary Committee.   That hearing is the first step in the legislative process of  addressing the epidemic.   Chief Acevedo was a witness at that hearing, testifying that if the  proposed legislation on background checks is enacted and saves at least  one life, then it is worth it.   Back in my state, despite incident after incident of rampant gun  violence, Texas Governor Greg Abbott and Attorney General Ken Paxton,  both prominent Republican opponents of gun control, issued the usual  statements offering the usual thoughts and prayers.   Chief Acevedo said, ``I appreciate your prayers . . . but the  question is, what are policymakers willing to do, besides prayers, to  address a public-health epidemic?''   I want to answer his question--``what ARE we going to do?''   We are going to overcome the fierce opposition from House minority  members.   We are going to overcome a recalcitrant and reluctant Senate.   And finally, we are going to overcome the opposition of the President  and the gun lobby.   I am a defender and supporter of the constitution.   I appreciate the Second Amendment and the right that it provides our  citizens.   However, I am also a defender of the right to live, the greatest  divine right of all.   I want all Americans to enjoy their Second Amendment right, but not  at the expense of the lives of our children, students, communities, and  law enforcement officials.   Imagine going to grade school in this day and age and having to  undergo ``active shooter'' drills.   Imagine having children in grade school today.   Imagine the anxiety parents feel knowing that any day the precious  lives of their children may be interrupted by someone with an AK-47 or  AR-15.   Imagine a brighter future for America's children, one that does not  include active shooter drills and funerals for adolescents.   We can help make that future a reality and we can start by voting to  pass H.R. 1112, the ``Enhanced Background Checks Act of 2019,''    Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman very much, and I  thank him for his leadership on a very  [[Page H2286]]  important enhancement to the Enhanced Background Checks Act of 2019,  which requires the FBI to report on the number of petitions it was not  able to make a determination on within the 10-day period.   I think Mr. Schneider knows that why we are here on the floor is to  save lives, to be able to protect innocent people from being subjected  to what the Emanuel Nine were: worshippers in a church with their  pastor, praying, as this country allows one to do.   It is my belief that the Schneider-Jackson Lee amendment should be  passed, because with this critical data and compliance reporting we can  learn more about legislative injustices like the one that enabled  Dylann Roof to process a handgun used to murder the nine innocent  persons at Mother Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, South Carolina, and  to remind everybody he had not been approved by the NICS reporting  system, and he was able to come back. This system allows us to know how  many have not been approved, to be able to address the question, to  have better policies dealing with protecting gun violence.   It is my privilege to join my colleague in supporting the Schneider- Jackson Lee amendment.   Madam Chair, I close by saying that this tracks the Accidental  Firearms Transfer Reporting Act that I introduced in previous  Congresses in H.R. 3125 and H.R. 57.   I look forward to working with my colleague as we expand reasonable  gun safety legislation to protect our children, our families, and  Americans.   Madam Chair, I rise in strong support of this amendment which I am  proud to cosponsor with the gentleman from Illinois, Congressman Brad  Schneider.   I thank the Rules Committee for making the Schneider/Jackson Lee  Amendment in order and thank the Majority Whip for introducing the  underlying legislation, H.R. 1112, the ``Enhanced Background Checks Act  of 2019.''   H.R. 1112, the ``Enhanced Background Checks Act of 2019,'' would  strengthen the background check procedures that firearms licensees or  dealers follow before selling or transferring a firearm.   As under current law, firearms dealers would be required to run a  background check on prospective buyers using the National Instant  Criminal Background Check System (``NICS'').   Over 90% of NICS checks are completed within 90 seconds.   If the NICS system has not returned an answer to the licensed  firearms dealer within ten days, the prospective firearms purchaser may  file a petition with the Attorney General for review.   Then, after another ten-day period has expired, the licensed firearms  dealer may sell or transfer the firearm to the prospective purchaser if  it has not received a response through the NICS system and the dealer  has no reason to believe that the purchaser is prohibited from  obtaining a firearm under federal, state, or local law.   Under this measure, licensed firearms dealers could not sell or  transfer under the ``default proceed'' provision until at least 20 days  have passed since the initial background check.   The Schneider/Jackson Lee Amendment strengthens the bill by requiring  the FBI to report on the number of petitions on which it was not able  to make a determination regarding the eligibility of the transferee to  possess a firearm within the 10-day period allotted by H.R. 1112.   I urge my colleagues to support the Schneider/Jackson Lee Amendment  because, with this critical data and compliance reporting, we can learn  more about legislative interstices like the one that enabled Dylan Roof  to possess the handgun used to murder 9 innocent persons at Mother  Emanuel A.M.E. Church in Charleston, South Carolina, as well as the  numerous other cases where a firearm was handed over to an unintended  and potentially dangerous recipient.   Making sure that policy makers have the most accurate, reliable, and  current data regarding background checks is one of the main reasons I  introduced the Accidental Firearms Transfers Reporting Act in the 114th  and 115th Congress (H.R. 3125 and H.R. 57 respectively).   Madam Chair, if anything, it is gun violence that is a national  emergency, and reducing gun violence should be one of Congress's  highest priorities.   The Schneider/Jackson Lee Amendment will help to do that.   I ask my colleagues to support the Schneider/Jackson Lee Amendment in  order.   Again, I thank Majority Whip Clyburn for introducing the underlying  legislation and Congressman Schneider for his work on this salutary  amendment.   I urge all Members to support the Schneider/Jackson Lee Amendment.
