 Madam Speaker, I rise to recognize President  Biden and House Democrats' efforts to lower costs for American  families.   Because of Putin's invasion, Americans have seen higher costs  everywhere--from the gas pump to grocery stores, to goods across the  shelves at local stores. Farmers, ranchers, and consumers have been  victims of these price hikes because of Putin's invasion.   President Biden and House Democrats aren't standing for this. That is  why last month my Democratic House colleagues and I passed the Lower  Food and Fuel Costs Act.   This bill will lower costs of goods for hardworking American families  by addressing supply chain risks, lowering the cost of food and gas  prices, strengthening the food supply chain, and ensuring robust  competition in the meat and poultry sector. This will bring a much- needed drop in the prices of goods for the American people.   I am also glad to report that with President Biden's leadership, gas  prices have declined by an average of 65 cents over the last 40 days.  Yes, you heard me right, Madam Speaker, 65 cents in the last 40 days.   To bring additional savings for the American people, House Democrats  passed the Consumer Fuel Price Gouging Prevention Act to further fight  Putin's price hike.   While Democrats are determined to deliver results for Americans,  Republicans showed little support on this cost-saving bill. While sad  on their part, I was not surprised.   On the public health front, just this year, pharma companies have  raised drug prices over 1,100 times. 1,100 times. Drastic, greedy  increases like these have led to insulin in the U.S. doubling in price  since 2012. This really hurts States and congressional districts like  mine that have historically struggled with health issues like diabetes.   In Texas, more than 12.4 percent of the people--or nearly 3 million  people--have diabetes. In the Houston area where I live, almost 14  percent of the residents have diabetes.   Madam Speaker, even in my own family--and you will recall, I am one  of 10--6 of us have been struck with diabetes. I have one brother who  is already under dialysis treatment.   Shockingly, reports show that one in four diabetics have rationed  insulin in Texas due to high costs. Many residents have even died  because of needing to ration this lifesaving medicine. This is simply  appalling and unconscionable. No one in our great Nation should gamble  with their life by rationing insulin because of high costs.   That is why House Democrats passed the Affordable Insulin Now Act to  cap the price of insulin at $35 per month because no one--and I mean no  one--should have to ration insulin in America.   So, while Republicans remain focused on pleasing their political base  and stripping women of their rights, Democrats remain laser focused on  lowering costs for hardworking Americans across our Nation and standing  with families.   Democrats are the party who put people above politics. We stand with  the American people. Together we are building a better America for  generations to come and for the future of our children.                            ____________________
