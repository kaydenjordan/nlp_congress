 Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, let me start with a quote: ``I am going  to fight this nomination with everything I've got.'' Well, that was the  Democratic leader on television mere hours after Judge Brett Kavanaugh  was first nominated to the Supreme Court. Others pledged their  opposition before he was even named, before they reviewed a lick of  evidence, before they heard a minute of testimony. Democrats had  already made up their minds and chosen their tactics: delay, obstruct,  and resist. Whatever it took, whatever the truth really was, they were  going to do whatever they could to stop this qualified, experienced,  and mainstream nominee.   Democrats have signaled for months that they would put on whatever  performance the far left special interests demanded and throw all the  mud they could manufacture. Well, it is not like they didn't warn us.  But even by the far left's standards, this shameful smear campaign has  hit a new low. I will get into the specifics in just a moment, but I  want to be perfectly clear about what has taken place. Senate Democrats  and their allies are trying to destroy a man's personal and  professional life on the basis of decades-old allegations that are  unsubstantiated and uncorroborated. That is where we are. This is what  the so-called ``resistance'' has become--a smear campaign, pure and  simple, aided and abetted by Members of the Senate.   Eight weeks ago, Democrats on the Judiciary Committee received a  letter from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford with an uncorroborated allegation  of misconduct. She had requested that the matter be handled discreetly  and confidentially.   The responsible next step would have been alerting the full committee  so a confidential, bipartisan investigation could begin. Committee  staff would have followed their standard practice for investigating  background information. Senators could have questioned Judge Kavanaugh  in their meetings or in closed session, while respecting Dr. Ford's  request for confidentiality. But Democrats didn't do any of that. They  sat on Dr. Ford's letter for 7 weeks. Kept it secret. They did nothing.  They bid their time. Then they threw Professor Ford's wishes overboard  and leaked it to the press. Our colleague from Delaware has himself  indicated that either the ranking member's office or the Democratic  committee staff likely leaked the document. As I have noted, we know  the chain of custody of the letter went through the Democratic side of  the Judiciary Committee.   Does this sound like Democratic Senators take their responsibility  seriously and want to get to the truth, or does it sound like a  choreographed smear campaign that ignored Dr. Ford's request for  confidentiality in order to inflict maximum damage at the last minute  on Judge Kavanaugh and his family?   This is an allegation of misconduct which all four supposed witnesses  either flatly contradict or are unable to back up. In addition to Judge  Kavanaugh, the other three supposed witnesses have said they have ``no  knowledge,'' ``no recollection,'' and ``no memory'' of the alleged  incident. It is not just one alleged witness who disagrees with the  allegations; it is literally every person who was supposedly there. One  of those supposed witnesses says she does not even know Judge  Kavanaugh. So all the witnesses who Dr. Ford says were present at the  party have told the committee--on the record and under penalty of  felony--all confirm that they do not remember any such party, do not  know Judge Kavanaugh, or have never seen him do anything remotely like  what has been alleged.   This unsubstantiated allegation stands entirely at odds with  everything we have heard about Judge  [[Page S6266]]  Kavanaugh's character from those who have worked with him and  socialized with him, dating all the way back to high school. But  Democrats wouldn't let a few inconvenient things--like a complete lack  of evidence or an accuser's request for confidentiality--get between  them and a good smear. It is despicable.   The contrast with the completely professional conduct of Chairman  Grassley could not be starker. As soon as Chairman Grassley learned  about this allegation, he handled it through proper channels. He  immediately began gathering the facts. His office promptly conducted a  transcribed interview of Judge Kavanaugh, in which, under penalty of  felony, he unequivocally denied the last-minute allegation. The office  received statements from all the other supposed witnesses, who either  directly contradicted the story or denied knowing anything about it.   What is more, Chairman Grassley ensured that Dr. Ford could be heard  in a forum of her own choosing--either here or in California; either in  public or in private; either with the staff or with the Members. He has  gone above and beyond to accommodate her request. Thanks to him, we  have a fair and open hearing scheduled for Thursday. Dr. Ford will be  able to state her allegation under oath, and Judge Kavanaugh will be  able to respond.   But the smear campaign didn't stop there; that was just act one.  According to the reporter of this second allegation, the accuser ``came  forward because Senate Democrats began looking.'' And now they are  calling for even further delays and further obstruction over a second  decades-old allegation that is so thin and so unsupported that the New  York Times refused to even run a story about it. This claim is so  dubious that the New York Times passed on the story entirely after  having looked into it.    Here is why the New York Times declined to publish: It ``interviewed  several dozen people over the past week in an attempt to corroborate  her story and could find no one with firsthand knowledge''--not one  person ``with firsthand knowledge'' to support the allegation--but,  rather, multiple, on-the-record denials again. The Times also reported  that the claimant said she herself is uncertain of her claim. That is  the New York Times, whose credo is ``all the news that's fit to  print,'' and it found this latest last-minute allegation not even fit  to print.   Oh, but that hasn't stopped Judiciary Committee Democrats from  shoveling it into their smear campaign and demanding further delays.  They kept this one a secret from Republicans, too, by the way.  Evidently, several Democratic offices knew of this allegation for at  least a week, but as with Dr. Ford's claim, they sat on this one, too,  so the committee could not take any proper action. They just wanted it  to wind up in the press--another orchestrated, last-minute hit on the  nominee. Now they are acting like it is a legitimate reason to delay  things even further, as though they have not already announced  themselves as being completely opposed to this nomination anyway, as if  they have not already promised the far left they would lead the fight  to bring this nomination down whatever it took, whatever the cost.   Let's put aside this last-minute, unsubstantiated smear. Let's return  to the facts. Let's have a fair hearing on Thursday.   Here are the facts that we do have: Hundreds of men and women who  have known Brett Kavanaugh across his life have written or spoken out  that he is a man of strong character and tremendous integrity. Numerous  witnesses have testified before the Judiciary Committee that he is a  trusted mentor, a loyal friend, and a lifelong champion of women. More  than 75 women gathered last week to share their decades-old knowledge  of Judge Kavanaugh as a ``responsible guy who treated us with kindness  and respect'' and as a ``true gentleman in all aspects of his life.''   Separately, of course, it remains beyond reasonable dispute that  Judge Kavanaugh's legal brilliance and excellence on the bench make him  one of the very most qualified Supreme Court nominees in the history of  our country.   All of these facts are, quite clearly, on one side. Maybe that is why  the Democrats are so panicked. Maybe that is why they are so willing to  try to bring down this nominee. In the meantime, a good and honorable  man and his family are receiving death threats. They are the subject of  smears and are facing Senate Democrats who say he has no presumption of  innocence because they don't agree with his judicial philosophy.   Well, before the week is out, both Judge Kavanaugh and Dr. Ford will  testify under oath before the Judiciary Committee. Chairman Grassley  has made sure the facts will be heard, and Judge Kavanaugh and the  American people deserve nothing less. I want to make it perfectly clear  that Judge Kavanaugh will be voted on here, up or down, on the Senate  floor. This fine nominee to the Supreme Court will receive a vote in  this Senate in the near future.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on an entirely different matter, last  week, our efforts to restore regular appropriations hit another  milestone. The President signed into law our first appropriations  package. It will fund critical efforts in energy research and security,  waterways and infrastructure projects, and in improving care at the VA.   Earlier this month, the Senate passed the conference report that will  fund the Departments of Defense, Labor, Health and Human Services, and  Education. We anticipate that the House will take up the package this  week, and work continues on other important legislation.   Soon, we will act to provide long-term stability and reforms to the  Federal Aviation Administration, the Transportation Security  Administration, and the National Transportation Safety Board. We will  also take up America's Water Infrastructure Act, which will bolster the  efforts of the Army Corps of Engineers and make commitments to  improving water quality and advancing hydropower.   Most immediately, we will continue to process the President's well- qualified nominees. We are, today, considering Jackie Wolcott to serve  as U.S. Representative to the International Atomic Energy Agency and as  U.S. Representative to the United Nations in Vienna. I urge all of our  colleagues to join me in voting to confirm her.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on one final matter, over the Senate's  history, we have welcomed into our ranks many brave men and women who  have served in uniform. From the earliest days of our Republic, when  veterans of the Revolution laid down their arms to serve as  legislators, the Senate has been the home of patriots who know the true  meaning of service and sacrifice. Some of our colleagues have even  decided to pull double duty--continuing to serve in the Reserves while  suffering the slings and arrows here in the Senate.   We have, today, a unique opportunity to honor one of these  colleagues. Earlier this month, the news came that our friend, the  junior Senator from Alaska, had attained the rank of colonel in the  U.S. Marine Corps Forces Reserve. Dan Sullivan has spent the last  quarter century as a marine, earning the Defense Meritorious Service  Medal and serving on Active Duty in Afghanistan. Those of us who serve  here with Senator Sullivan are hardly surprised that someone so  ``squared away'' has risen to this milestone.   His promotion is recognized in a special ceremony today here in the  Capitol, where, I understand, Senator Sullivan's father will pin on his  new rank.   I know this body will join me in congratulating him and in thanking  both Senator Sullivan and Colonel Sullivan for all of his service to  the Nation.                            ____________________
