 Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate the country's  tremendous economic improvements.   While our economy is stronger than ever, the America COMPETES Act  will strengthen the economy even more in the near future. But one key  economic accomplishment during Biden's first year I would like to  highlight is the large budget deficit decrease he produced.   In his first year, the deficit decreased by $360 billion. That is an  average drop of $30 billion each month. That is huge.   This is a night-and-day difference from the past administration,  which only increased the budget deficit year after year during his time  in office. But even better, Biden is on track to reduce the deficit by  more than $1 trillion this year. This is truly remarkable.   We really are building a better America for generations to come.                            ____________________
