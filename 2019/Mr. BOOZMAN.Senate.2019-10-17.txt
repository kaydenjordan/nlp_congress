 Madam President, I would like to take a moment, first of  all, to thank Chaplain Black for all that he does here. The Senate is a  much better place as a result of having him around.   I would also like to take a moment to thank Dr. Robert Lewis for  delivering the opening prayer in the Senate today.   Robert and I had the opportunity to play football together at the  University of Arkansas. He was a very good football player and had the  gift of smack. He would hit you. He had a tremendous work ethic and  character, and we all knew that he would do well in whatever he decided  to do.   Robert is, today, a renowned pastor, a best-selling author, a  passionate speaker, and a Christian visionary. He has developed a  curriculum that has reached over 1 million men worldwide in churches,  on college campuses, in corporate boardrooms, and in correctional  facilities.   Robert's program, the Men's Fraternity, provides men with an  encouraging process of teaching them how to live lives of authentic  manhood, as modeled by Jesus Christ and directed by the Word of God.  The program was designed to help men come together and strengthen each  other through weekly sessions that combine biblical teaching and small  group interaction.   For 21 years, Robert served as the directional leader of the  Fellowship Bible Church of Little Rock. During that time, the church  grew from a few hundred members to over 5,000, and it was widely  recognized as being one of the most innovative and influential churches  in America.   Robert helped to bring Downline, which is a citywide discipleship  ministry, to Little Rock, where he continues to serve as a part-time  instructor. He continues to be involved in his local church and beyond,  and he ministers nationally and across the world.   Robert and Sherard, his wife, have been married for over 40 years.  They have four children and three grandchildren.   Serving as the guest chaplain is an incredible honor. I am thankful  for Robert's ministry, and I am so pleased that he could be here to  offer an invocation of asking God to guide and bless the efforts of  Congress and America's leaders.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
