 Mr. Speaker, our Nation has come to a crossroads  between two competing visions for the future that don't easily  reconcile. At such times as these, emotions run very high.   The good news is that our institutions are the best ever designed to  resolve such political disputes. And it comes down to this: In other  countries, the government is the sovereign and rights flow from it to  the people; here in America, the people are sovereign.   In America, the sovereign does not govern; it hires help to govern  during an election. In between elections, the sovereign people debate  how the hired help is doing. That is the real debate, the one that goes  on every day over backyard fences and family dinner tables wherever  Americans gather. After that family discussion, we decide whether to  fire the hired help or keep it for another cycle. As long as we are  with each other and not shouting at each other, our system works very  well.   Once in our history, we stopped talking with each other. That was the  election of 1860. That election was marked not by reconciliation, but  by rioting in those regions where the opposition dominated. The  opposition party refused to accept the legitimacy of the election  itself. Political leaders pledged resistance to the new administration  by any means necessary. They asserted the doctrine of nullification,  the notion that any dissenting State or city that opposed Federal laws  could simply refuse to obey them. Finally came the secession movement,  the ultimate rejection of our Constitution and our rule of law.   Have we not started down that road once again?   Even before the election, we saw violent mobs carrying foreign flags  physically attack Americans for the sole reason that they wanted to  attend a political rally for the candidate of their choice. The  violence in Berkeley last week warns us that this behavior is rising.   Some prominent elected officials are again asserting the doctrine of  nullification by declaring that their jurisdictions are sanctuaries  where Federal immigration laws will simply be ignored. In California,  the formal cessation movement is supported by nearly a third of the  population of my own suffering State.   Now, I held more than a hundred townhall meetings in my district  throughout the last 8 years, spanning the entire life of the Tea Party  and the Occupy Wall Street movements. Through all of these heated  debates, the police have never had to intervene, until this weekend in  Roseville, when the Roseville Police Department determined that the  size and temper of the crowd required a police escort to protect me as  I left the venue.                                time  1030    Now, the vast majority of the people attempting to attend this  meeting were peaceful, decent, law-abiding folks who sincerely opposed  Donald Trump, and they wanted to make their views known to their  elected representative. But, there was also a well-organized element  that came to disrupt, and disrupt they did.   Now, in the last four elections, our country has turned dramatically  away from the left. The Democrats have lost 67 House seats, 12 Senate  seats, 10 Governors, more than 900 State legislative seats, and now the  Presidency. That happened, in large part, because those who opposed  their policies talked with their neighbors about the future of our  country.   Instead of pursuing that successful example, the radical left seeks  not to persuade their fellow citizens by reason but rather to impose  its views by bullying, insulting, intimidating, and, as in Berkeley, by  physically attacking their fellow citizens. This is not a tactic likely  to change minds, but, if it persists, it could tear down the very  institutions of democracy that have served us so well for so long.   I would ask the many sincere citizens who have been caught up with  this disruptive element: Do you object because the President is  breaking his promises, or do you object because he is keeping them?   If your objection is because the President is keeping the promises he  made to the American people, is that not because the sovereign people,  your neighbors and fellow countrymen, directed these changes over the  last four elections?   If you love our country, and that love for our country is greater  than your hatred of our President, I implore you to engage in a civil  discussion with your fellow citizens. That is what true democracy looks  like.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, of all of the stifling, bureaucratic,  pettifogging regulations that Congress is now repealing from the  previous administration, none is more deserving of repeal than the  BLM's Planning 2.0 rule.   This rule governs the process for creating resource management plans.  If they are done wrong, they can devastate the economies of the  communities that are impacted by those lands. A new RMP can crush an  industry, and it can destroy a community, which is why States and  counties across the West have been anxiously watching this process  unfold.   Despite serious concerns being raised by State and local  governments--by farming, livestock, and energy production groups, and  even by Congress during the rulemaking process--the Bureau of Land  Management charged full steam ahead and finalized this rule. The BLM  assured stakeholders that the final rule governing this process would  not undercut State and local voices. But, when the BLM realized that  the election of President Trump endangered the environmental left's  stranglehold on this agency, the Planning 2.0 rule was hastily  finalized in contradiction of almost all of the promises that the BLM  made.   The Planning 2.0 rule is a gross expansion of BLM's power, and the  power of well-funded political groups that use the veneer of  environmentalism at the expense of local communities. Under BLM's  current RMP procedures, our Western counties already complain of having  their voices ignored and their interests disregarded.   Last year, the Federal Lands Subcommittee held a field hearing in St.  George, Utah. We heard how the city of St. George was experiencing  economic growth, pushing the limits of its infrastructure, and how the  city had tried over and over to engage the BLM in the development of a  new RMP to address the needs of the local community. The city was  desperate for the new RMP to include a transportation corridor for a  new road to meet the needs of their growing economy. In their testimony  before the subcommittee, the city relayed that they were unable to  secure regular meetings with their local BLM office, despite the BLM  office holding frequent meetings with local environmental groups.   In the end, the RMP was released and there was nothing to account for  the transportation needs of the people of St. George. In a State that  is two-thirds owned by the Federal Government, I find it hard to  believe that the BLM could not have worked with the city of St. George  to accommodate a simple road.   With these kind of results under BLM's current planning regime, it is  no wonder that counties across the West are weary of a new planning  rule.  [[Page H1034]]  BLM should be focused on improving their collaboration and coordination  with counties and local governments. Instead, this rule enshrines that  disregard into formal Federal regulation.   I urge adoption of the resolution.
