 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Aidan Miller and Kylie  Lan Tumiatti for receiving the prestigious Fulbright scholarships this  year. Aidan and Kylie are both recent graduates of Seton Hall  University's School of Diplomacy.   Aidan is a student of international relations, modern languages, and  Eastern European studies. Over the next year, he will be teaching  English at a university in Russia while learning about Russian  traditions and culture. Aidan plans to enter public service when he  returns home.   Kylie also majored in international relations and modern languages,  with a minor in economics. The Fulbright scholarship has given her the  opportunity to teach English in Malaysia. When she returns from  Malaysia, Kylie will finish her graduate degree in public affairs at  Columbia University and then enter the foreign service.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in celebrating these  bright young people who are committed to making our world a better  place.                            ____________________
