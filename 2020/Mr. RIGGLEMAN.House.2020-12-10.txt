 Mr. Speaker, I rise today, after 2 years of service,  to address this Congress for perhaps the last time. I rise today  humbled by the opportunities granted to me by this great country and  the citizens of the Fifth District. That I could go from living on food  stamps decades ago to serving in this hallowed body is a testament to  the American Dream and the opportunity provided by this land of  liberty.   I would be remiss if I did not begin this address by thanking my  beautiful wife, Christine, and my three daughters, Abby, Lauren, and  Lily, for their support throughout this journey. I married Christine  fresh out of high school at the age of 19, and she has been my rock  ever since. And to have my two new granddaughters in Washington, D.C.,  with me today is an overwhelming blessing.   I never intended to enter politics or subject my family to the  challenges and strains that accompany public life, but they have taken  on every challenge and continue to inspire me every day.   I have spent most of my life in service to this country as an  enlisted and commissioned airman in the United States Air Force and  working for and with intelligence community and Department of Defense  organizations. I served in the Balkans during Operation Allied Force,  spent time in the Middle East, and deployed immediately after 9/11 as  part of a team that mission planned the first bombing runs into  Afghanistan.   I was taken away from my family in service to the country I love. And  while my family is with me now, I know that they made countless  sacrifices to help me get to this point.   Though my time in this Chamber will be shorter than I may have hoped,  I am proud of what we have accomplished. Just 2 weeks ago, this House  passed H.R. 2466, the State Opioid Grant Authorization Act of 2020. A  bill that might seem like a footnote in the Congressional Record to  some can save countless lives. One of my priorities during my time in  Congress has been addressing the very real crisis of opioid addiction,  which has devastating consequences for families across this great  Nation.   I was sitting at my desk in Congress about 1 year ago when I got the  call that my cousin, Trey, had overdosed not far from where I was  sitting.   I talked about this with my friend and colleague, Congressman   David  Trone, the Democratic party lead on the State Opioid Response Grant  Authorization bill and the leader of the Freshman Working Group on  Addiction. He had lost a nephew, Ian, to the scourge of addiction. We  knew that something had to be done, and we came together in a  bipartisan way to accomplish something great.   A special thanks to Representatives Sherrill and Armstrong for their  incredible support on this legislation.   Trey and Ian, we worked to honor your memories and to help those who  might not be able to help themselves.   During my time in Congress, I have worked to expand access to  broadband internet in rural areas, especially in those remote areas of  the Fifth District. Our rural communities need broadband access to keep  up with the demands of the modern economy. Closing the digital divide  is critical in enhancing economic opportunity, job creation, access to  healthcare, and education in rural America.   My district carries history matched by few in this Nation. The first  representative from my district was James Madison. I have used his  legacy to guide me in my fight to protect constitutional principles,  and I believe that his example is one that can guide all  representatives in this body.   James Madison said this: ``A well instructed people alone can be a  permanently free people.''   I internalized that statement into a baseline for carrying out the  duties as a representative of the people, duly elected by the citizens  of Virginia's Fifth District. My background as a veteran and Air Force  intelligence officer employed at times by the National Security Agency  and working with other government agencies taught me the value of  honor, service, and integrity in all I do. It also taught me the  invaluable lesson of considering the source when evaluating information  from my colleagues and constituents and when fighting radicalization  and disinformation campaigns.   James Madison also stated that ``knowledge will forever govern  ignorance; and a people who mean to be their own governors must arm  themselves with the power knowledge gives.''   A well instructed people and a knowledgeable people--pillars of a  working republic. Those pillars are now being assaulted by  disinformation and outlandish theories surrounding this Presidential  election.  [[Page H7146]]    As we transition to a new administration, I implore all to consider  the sources of information you receive, to fact-check diligently and to  recognize that many bad actors who spread spurious and fantastical  conspiracy theories under banners like QAnon, Kraken, Stop the Steal,  Scamdemic, and many other emotive terms and coded language are not  disseminating information rooted in knowledge, but with questionable  motives. They are rooted in misunderstanding or fraud or, in some  cases, ignorance.                                time  1400    To all those on the end of the disinformation firehose, please know  that I am you and you are me.   Unbiased, fact-based information sustains our republic. My objective  in serving my district was never to judge others, because all of us are  only human. None of us has a special dispensation to rule over another.   We are common in our belief that the Constitution stops the  tyrannical encroachment of a man, woman, or group claiming to have some  extraordinary knowledge that allows them insights that we as  individuals cannot attain.   Disinformation hinders our free exchange of ideas and creates super- spreader digital viruses that create a fever of nonsense.   Disinformation operations can attack specific pillars of democracy at  strategic moments: from belief in democratic elections, to trust in  public health and public institutions. In technical terms,  sophisticated influence operations using combinations of bot-like- networks and synchronous mass posting behavior, termed ``coordinated  inauthentic behavior,'' is a tactic, a tactic which disinformation  peddlers such as QAnon community members use with great success to  hijack the national conversation.   My 2 decades of intelligence, warfighting, and counterintelligence  experience coupled with serving in the 116th Congress is why I will not  allow conspiracy peddlers to hijack our ability to conduct reasonable  policy discussions for the betterment of all Americans.   Just like creating a vaccine to eradicate COVID-19, we must work  together to inoculate against the social contagion of disinformation,  conspiracies, anti-Semitism, dehumanization, racism, deep state cabal  nonsense, cults, and those grifters posing as servants of the people.   Big data, machine learning, and facts-based analysis are the  ingredients for our digital vaccine. If we build that vaccine, we can  encourage facts over fantasy, people over politics, love over hate, and  unity over division.   I am now serving on the board of a nonpartisan organization that will  utilize advanced analysis, data methodologies, and network modeling to  track disinformation over social media.   If you are in the grifting and propaganda business, know that I am  not going anywhere.   As I go back to my incredible life on 50 acres in the Blue Ridge  Mountains, I can reflect on how I conducted myself in Congress.   My dear friend, Congressman Kevin Brady from Texas, told me he  appreciated that I ``called balls and strikes'' even when it was not  advantageous to me. To be clear, Kevin Brady is an example of that  service and what calling balls and strikes looks like. So let me call  three pitches right now.   First, I will always fight disinformation wherever I see it, hear it,  or watch it. For those who spread disinformation, know that I will not  stop in tracking those who push falsehoods onto decent Americans.  Radicalization through disinformation has no place in the United  States, and in this fight, I will not relent.   Second, working together for the betterment of the American people in  a bipartisan way is not a bug, it is a feature.   Third, people are more important than party. Pandering is a political  sickness.   As I reflect on the accomplishments we have made for the Fifth  District, I am moved to recognize some of the many people who have made  these accomplishments possible.   Esther Page and Denise Van Valkenburg are dedicated public servants  who served the Fifth District from before my time in office. Regardless  of the party affiliation of the Representative, they served the people  of the Fifth District of Virginia exceptionally, and they should be  lauded for their efforts.   To Jim Pomeroy, Steve Harvey, and Josiah Leonard, your service has  not gone unnoticed.   It was never my plan to be a politician, so I should thank my staff  for helping me to learn this process and do my best to serve the Fifth  District.   Dave Natonski, who served as my chief of staff through good times and  bad, was an invaluable asset and friend.   My current chief of staff, Haley Brady, is as competent as she is  great.   A big thank you to my legislative team, without whom the legislative  accomplishments could not have happened: Borden Hoskins, a financial  services savant with as devastating a wit as a pen; Eli Woerpel, my  right hand on everything broadband and agricultural; Jason Eagleburger,  my friend and confidante, who spearheaded the China Task Force and  helped with complex policy issues; Nicole Nentwich, who was my go-to  for healthcare policy; and Lexi Klein, who my Fifth District  constituents love and appreciate.   To my communications team, thank you for your sound advice and  constant guidance.   Joe Chelak has been with me since I started my run for Congress, and  his strategic leadership has been invaluable to my success.   Kate Currie has made the most of her time in my office and exhibited  incredible talent.   And to Ben Mullany, without whom I would not have gotten this far,  thank you.   Jimmy Keady, thank you for talking me into this craziness, and your  leadership and guiding me through this beautiful and treacherous  passage.   Chris Woodfin, thank you. Your counsel has been invaluable.   To the Cloakroom, thank you for putting up with me these last 2  years.   And to my congressional colleagues, where there are far too many to  name and thank, know that I am not far away. I am always available for  a snort of bourbon, a tipple of irreverence, and a nod to Bigfoot.   In January of next year, the Fifth District of Virginia will be  represented by a new Member, who I hope will heed these lessons: that  service to your district should be your priority; courage in the face  of disagreement should be lauded, not ignored; and to always remember  the strength of holding to your principles will last far longer than  any allegiance to a position or a party.    There is an incredible dart game scene in the show ``Ted Lasso''  where Ted is vastly underestimated in a darts competition and ends up  besting an arrogant opponent, a former owner of the soccer team that  Ted coaches. Please watch that scene. In that scene, Ted quotes Walt  Whitman: ``Be curious, not judgmental.''   Let's not throw hyperbolic darts at each other. Let's rely on facts  and compassion. Let's listen together and move this country forward  together.   May God bless the Commonwealth of Virginia, may God bless this  Congress, and may God bless the United States of America.   And for the last time, Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my  time.                            ____________________
