 Madam President, reserving my right to object, the  legislation that the Senator from New York proposes, particularly with  respect to the issue of crimes involving sexual misconduct, is  something that I support. But without a thorough, careful review in the  Armed Services Committee, which is the traditional means of making  these decisions, particularly when  [[Page S4530]]  they affect the entire Uniform Code of Military Justice, is something  that is necessary, in my view, and will be done--and I hope promptly-- so that we can move forward with this legislation, not only to ensure  that it passes but that it works for the benefit of the soldiers,  sailors, marines, and airmen in our Armed Forces.   Passing something that sounds good but has not been thoroughly  reviewed and thoroughly vetted and will not be implemented effectively  for the benefit of soldiers, sailors, marines, and airmen is something  I don't think we should do.   I think, rather, we should wait for the committee hearings. I am  confident that this legislation, with respect to crimes involving  sexual misconduct, will emerge from the committee. There are other  issues that we will consider.   With that, I would reaffirm my objection.    Mr. President, on behalf of myself and Mr. Inhofe, as the  chair and ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and the  cochairs of the Senate Army Caucus, it is our honor to pay tribute to a  great leader and an exceptional officer of the U.S. Army MG Brian S.  Eifler, the chief of legislative liaison for the Office of the  Secretary of the Army, as he prepares to leave this position for a new  post in the Army of even greater importance to our Nation. Major  General Eifler provides outstanding leadership, advice, and sound  professional judgment on numerous critical issues of enduring  importance to the Army, Congress, and this Nation.   Major General Eifler has served our Army and our Nation for more than  30 years. A native of Michigan, Major General Eifler was commissioned  in 1990 as an infantry officer from Central Michigan University. He has  been a true professional, dedicated soldier, leader, and officer.  Throughout his career, he has commanded our great soldiers at many  levels and deployed to  [[Page S4542]]  combat numerous times in defense of the Nation. He has served in  various command and staff positions over deployments to Haiti, Iraq,  and Afghanistan. He was a platoon leader and civil-military officer in  Operation Uphold Democracy in Haiti, served multiple combat tours to  Afghanistan as a battalion commander during Operation Enduring Freedom,  and a battalion operations and executive officer, battalion commander,  as well as a division deputy commanding general in Iraq during  Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Inherent Resolve.   Major General Eifler's other assignments include service in the 1st  Armored Division, 2d Infantry Division, 4th Infantry Division, 10th  Mountain Division, 25th Infantry Division, 38th Infantry Division, 82nd  Airborne Division, and the 75th Ranger Regiment. In addition to  Infantry training, he is a graduate of the United States Command and  General Staff College and the United States Army War College.   For the past 30 months, Major General Eifler has implemented and  enhanced strategic partnerships with Congress. Through his leadership,  the Army significantly advanced relationships with both legislative  chambers and improved and broadened congressional support for Army  priorities. Major General Eifler managed complex issues through  multiple legislative cycles, enabling the Army to receive the necessary  resources to take care of its most precious recourse, its people,  improve readiness, and accelerate modernization to support combat  operations, sustain the All-Volunteer Force, and improve the quality of  life for soldiers, Army civilians, and their families.   On behalf of Congress and the United States of America, we thank  Major General Eifler, his wife Sherry, and their entire family for  their continued commitment, sacrifice, and contributions to this great  Nation. We join our colleagues in wishing him future successes as he  continues to serve our great Army and Nation.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today, most jobs require some kind of  postsecondary credential, whether a certificate, an associate's or  bachelor's degree, an advanced or professional degree, or an  apprenticeship. Moreover, the workplace is changing with automation,  artificial intelligence, and the so-called gig economy transforming the  nature of work. These trends have only accelerated in the wake of the  pandemic and its economic fallout. That is why I am proud to be  introducing the bipartisan Partnerships for Affordability and Student  Success (PASS) Act with my colleague, Senator Collins.   The pandemic has upended educational opportunities for this  generation of students. Unlike previous economic downturns when college  enrollment climbed, the National Student Clearinghouse is reporting the  largest decline in college enrollment in over a decade, with low-income  and community college students experiencing the sharpest declines. For  too many Americans, postsecondary education seems increasingly risky or  out of reach.   The Federal government cannot solve the crisis on its own. States are  critical partners in making college accessible, affordable, equitable,  and accountable. However, State funding for higher education is lower  today than it was before the onset of the Great Recession. According to  the latest State Higher Education Finance report published by the State  Higher Education Executive Officers, public colleges and universities  have become more reliant on tuition dollars for their operations.  Today, in half of the States, tuition accounts for more than half of  all higher education revenue. Moreover, the only Federal-State  partnership program for need-based financial aid--the Leveraging  Educational Assistance Partnership (LEAP) program--has not received  appropriations since Fiscal Year 2010   It is time to renew the Federal-State partnership for higher  education, first enacted in 1972 on a bipartisan basis. The PASS Act  will revitalize the Federal-State partnership through a formula grant  to States with a focus on need-based aid, grants to institutions to  improve student outcomes and reduce college costs, and public  accountability.   In exchange for this new Federal investment, States must make a  commitment to maintain their investment in higher education and have a  comprehensive plan for higher education with measurable goals for  access, affordability, and student outcomes. At least half of the  funding must be dedicated to need-based student financial aid. States  also have the option of awarding grants to colleges and universities or  partnerships between institutions of higher education and non-profit  organizations to improve student outcomes, including enrollment,  completion, and employment, and to develop innovative methods for  reducing college costs. I am pleased to have the support of the  National Association of State Student Grant and Aid Programs, the  National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities, the  Association of Community College Trustees, and the Bipartisan Policy  Center.   This generation is facing a crisis in college affordability and  student loan debt. With the PASS Act, we seek to provide the resources  and incentives for States to take more responsibility to address  college affordability and student loan debt and improve student  outcomes. I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this legislation and look  forward to working with them to include these and other key reforms in  the upcoming reauthorization of the Higher Education Act.                                  ______                                         By Mr. THUNE (for himself and Mr. Kelly):   S. 2057. A bill to appropriately limit the size of the population  required for urban areas of metropolitan statistical areas; to the  Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.
