 Madam Speaker, on the seventh day of SALT, my  constituents have said to me that we cannot fix the SALT deduction cap  by simply slashing our State and local taxes because these taxes fund  critical community priorities like our public school system.   I am incredibly proud that New Jersey's public school system was just  ranked number one in the entire country. A number of factors go into  that achievement, including student achievement, the success of  students once they leave school, and school funding.   Madam Speaker, New Jersey ranks third in the country in the  percentage of our tax dollars allocated to education. That is because  our residents know that investment in our schools is a downpayment on a  bright future. It is why so many families make New Jersey their home.   This investment benefits not only New Jersey. Our students grow up to  work, serve, and lead in organizations across the Nation and around the  globe.   That includes four--yes, four--NASA astronauts produced by the public  schools in my congressional district alone.   We need to restore the SALT deduction cap and stop penalizing States  like New Jersey that prioritize investment in our children and the  professionals who educate the next generation, investments that benefit  the entire country.                            ____________________
