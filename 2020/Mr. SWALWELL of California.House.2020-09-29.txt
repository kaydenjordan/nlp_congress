 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules  and agree to the resolution (H. Res. 1155) reaffirming the House of  Representatives' commitment to the orderly and peaceful transfer of  power called for in the Constitution of the United States, and for  other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows:                                H. Res. 1155         Whereas the United States is founded on the principle that       our Government derives its power from the consent of the       governed and that the people have the right to change their       elected leaders through elections;        Whereas our domestic tranquility, national security,       general welfare, and civil liberties depend upon the peaceful       and orderly transfer of power; and        Whereas any disruption occasioned by the transfer of the       executive power could  [[Page H5031]]       produce results detrimental to the safety and well-being of       the United States and its people: Now, therefore, be it        Resolved, That the House of Representatives--        (1) reaffirms its commitment to the orderly and peaceful       transfer of power called for in the Constitution of the       United States; and        (2) intends that there should be no disruptions by the       President or any person in power to overturn the will of the       people of the United States.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend  their remarks and include extraneous material on the measure under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my resolution, H. Res. 1155,  reaffirming the commitment of the House of Representatives to the  peaceful transfer of power. This is identical to the resolution which  passed the Senate last week by unanimous consent.   The peaceful transition of power is not only a bedrock principle of  America's founding; it is a living ideal that we must exercise and pass  down to our children.   In the United States of America, the Federal Government has always  had a peaceful transition of power, and it is a collective  responsibility of this body to ensure that continues. I doubt anyone  here needs to be reminded of that.   Everyone in America knows this is what makes us American. Everyone,  that is, except President Trump. Last week, he was asked a simple  question: Will you commit to making sure there is a peaceful transfer  of power after the election? His answer: Well, we are going to have to  see what happens.   No, we are not going to have to see what happens.   Then he was asked again: Do you commit to making sure there is a  peaceful transfer of power?   Here was his answer, in part: Get rid of the ballots, and you will  have a very--we will have a very peaceful--there won't be a transfer,  frankly. There will be a continuation.   During his remarks, he also made bogus and unsupported claims of  election fraud. Just in case people were not listening, he said the  same thing the next day.   President Trump, like any President, wields enormous power, with  Federal law enforcement and the military at his disposal. It is beyond  unsettling to hear him suggest that the only result he will accept is  the one where he wins.   That sentiment is one of dictators and despots. Sadly, the world is  replete with examples of dictators and despots and their refusal to  leave office and the chaos it causes.   In late 2016, Gambia's President threatened to refuse to leave  office, even though he had lost the election. Thousands fled the  country fearing violence. Only when other countries' troops massed at  the border was he forced to leave office in early 2017.   Congo's President refused to leave office in 2016, even though his  term had expired. He cracked down on dissent and killed people when  they protested the election results. That election finally took place  two years late.   Last year in Bolivia, the President declared himself the winner  before the vote counting was even finished. After days of civil unrest  and protest, the President was forced to resign.   Belarus remains in crisis even now as the longtime President holds  onto power through an obviously rigged election. Mass protests have  gone on with many injured, gassed, or killed.   In America, however, it is not one person, but we, the people; we,  the people, who rule. As this resolution says, the people have the  right to change their elected leaders through elections. Fortunately,  there is no shortage of leadership in America's past to show us the  way.   I was born in November of 1980, right after Jimmy Carter lost to  Ronald Reagan. I was born the son of two Republican parents who were  excited for the peaceful transfer of power to take place. One of my  earliest memories of American politics, though, was when I was 11 years  old and President George H. W. Bush lost to President Clinton. My  parents were not as excited about the peaceful transfer of power.   But I remember, as a boy, watching the results come in and seeing the  statements from outgoing President George H. W. Bush and commentators  and anchors saying, ``This is what makes our country so special'' and  my own family moving on and accepting the results.   In a poignant recognition of this, listen to part of what former  President George Herbert Walker Bush wrote to President Bill Clinton,  the man who had defeated him, in a note that he left for him in the  Oval Office dated January 20, 1993. And it is just here to my left.   ``You will be our President when you read this note. I wish you well.  I wish your family well. Your success now is our country's success. I  am rooting hard for you.''   After the 1824 election was decided here, in this House, with Henry  Clay throwing his support to John Quincy Adams, thus defeating Andrew  Jackson who had won the popular vote, Jackson was understandably  outraged and denounced the result as a corrupt bargain. That type of  language sounds familiar. But he accepted the outcome and returned to  Tennessee.   On the evening of the day he lost the Presidency, Jackson encountered  the new President-Elect at the White House. Jackson was gracious, and  the city was filled with reports of his grace. ``You have, by your  dignity and forbearance under all of these outrages, won the people to  your love,'' a friend told Jackson, who would run again in 1828 and  win.   Historian Jon Meacham recently wrote in March of this year about  President Lincoln in 1864, the country mired in a Civil War, running  against George McClellan on the Democratic side. Lincoln had written  privately he was ready to accept defeat, the election did not look like  it was going to go his way, and even in a Civil War, there would be a  peaceful transfer of power.    This resolution states clearly to every American, not on our watch.  Not on our watch are we going to let American greatness vanish and an  authoritative state rise.   The reason we are the beacon to the world is that here, with our  elections, the people decide, not our leaders. We let the people  decide.   We shouldn't only be horrified by the President's remarks about  possibly not having a peaceful transfer of power; we should also be  concerned by who he looks up to. Unfortunately, America is ruled by  someone who admires dictators. He said as much recently to Bob Woodward  in a recording stating: ``The tougher and meaner they are, the better I  get along with them,'' referring to dictators like Putin, Erdogan, and  Kim.   And what do dictators do?   They don't let the people decide, and they certainly don't honor any  peaceful transition of power.   Why is it a problem for Americans to have a leader who admires Putin  and often sides with Putin over America? Because we know that Vladimir  Putin would love nothing better than to destroy our democracy.   In fact, our intelligence community assessed that in 2016, Vladimir  Putin had a preference for our President and interfered to help him and  that he is doing the same today. Putin wants America to be weak, second  to Russia, just another country with no moral standing in the world.   But what makes us strong is our rule of law, our democracy, a country  governed by the consent of the people. When that happens, we all do  better, and Russia hates that. Why? Because Russians and other  oppressed people then will want to look more like America.   Just think about it. The idea now that Russia could bring down  America without even firing a shot because we have one person who is  threatening to upset the fabric of our democracy. We cannot let that  happen. Too many have sacrificed too much to make sure it doesn't  happen.  [[Page H5032]]    Days after the election, we will each go back to our districts and  honor those who have served our country in honor of Veterans Day. We  will be reminded of so many heroes who have died and shed blood, just  for the principle of a peaceful transition of power. We have lost so  many for this concept.   Now, I know there are some in this country who think that these  heroes who fought for this country are suckers and losers for giving up  their lives, but I don't think that. I don't believe my Republican  colleagues think that. I know colleagues on both sides hold these folks  up to be heroes. I know each of us wants to go to our hometowns right  after election day to those Veterans Day parades, look at our hometown  heroes, look them in the eyes and tell them when our democracy was  threatened, we stood up and we spoke out.   The way we honor their sacrifice is to fight for this. And when  someone suggests that a peaceful transfer of power may not happen, we  have to push back in every way we can.   So I want to thank all of my colleagues, both Democrats and  Republicans, who over the past few days have reaffirmed the  understanding of how in America we handle transitions of power and  reject the threats from our current leader that it may not happen.   By voting for this resolution, you can go on record as supporting  these principles. By its text, it ``reaffirms the House's commitment to  the orderly and peaceful transfer of power called for in the  Constitution of the United States; and intends that there should be no  disruption by the President or any person in power to overturn the will  of the people of the United States.''   Even in this era of bitterly divided partisanship, these are basic,  philosophical tenets, bedrocks and living principles that should  receive unanimous support here in the House.   I urge all Members to support my resolution, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Neguse).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, here we are, back to Secretary Clinton. It is clear that  she has at least two homes, one in New York and one inside the heads of  my colleagues. But this is actually about President Trump.   While I appreciate my colleagues speaking for what President Trump  may do after the election, citing what his press secretary has said,  and my colleague from Texas said that he believes that the President  will peacefully accept the transfer of power, the President has never  said that.   In fact, he was asked: ``Will you commit to making sure there is a  peaceful transfer of power after the election?'' And he said: ``Well,  we are going to have to see what happens.''   He is not saying we are going to have to go to the courts, that we  are going to contest this. He is suggesting that we may have something  other than a peaceful transfer of power, which, of course, would be a  violent transfer of power, a violent holding of power.   Then, he was asked again: ``Will you commit to making sure that there  is a peaceful transfer of power?'' And he said: ``Get rid of the  ballots and we will have a very peaceful--there won't be a transfer,  frankly. There will be a continuation.''   Again, not himself saying there will be a peaceful transfer of power.  So, we really can't rely on anyone else, other than what the President  has said.                                time  1730    So we really can't rely on anyone else other than what the President  has said. And I don't disagree with my colleagues that if there are  issues in the election that both parties have a right to contest those  issues, to go to the courts through the legal channels, but that is not  what this is about.   This resolution talks about a peaceful transfer of power. In fact,  they were complaining that it is not a bipartisan resolution. Actually,  it is identical to the bipartisan, unanimously passed resolution in the  Senate.   To my colleague from Florida who is controlling time on the other  side, I understand he doesn't like that this resolution is on the  floor, and I would yield to my colleague respecting his service as a  veteran, in our country, he is voting for this resolution. I would be  shocked if I heard that my colleague is not going to vote for something  that passed unanimously in the Senate.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how many more  speakers the minority floor manager has remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time  is remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance  of my time.   This resolution simply calls for a commitment to the peaceful  transfer of power. I know my colleagues on the other side have their  own suspicions about what the motive is behind this and want to project  onto it something that is not in the language, but this was passed by  100 Senators last week. Every Republican and Democratic Senator voted  for this because it reaffirms America's commitment to having a peaceful  transfer of power.   What my colleague on the other side just brought up are process  issues in the election, but that does not relate or compare to the  suggestion that there would be violent opposition to the outcome.   Both sides have a right to use the courts and then accept the  outcome. One of my colleagues referenced the 2000 election, litigated  all the way to the top of the Supreme Court, and the loser accepted the  outcome.   This resolution is calling on us, and it is sad that we have to do  this, to reaffirm that principle. It asks the question: Are we Gambia,  where an outcome was not accepted and people died, or are we a country  that, even in the thick of the Civil War, had a President who was  willing to accept the outcome?   Are we Congo where the outcome was not accepted and people died, or  are we the country that fought the great war,  [[Page H5035]]  the Second World War, the Greatest Generation, who would build a new  economy and afford new opportunities?   Are we Bolivia, where the outcome was not accepted and there was  violence in the streets, or are we the country that sent someone to the  Moon, saw contested election after contested election, but losers left  office graciously, just as President H.W. Bush did in the letter I read  earlier.   Who do we want to look like? We are imperfect, but the ideas that we  are founded upon are perfect, that we are governed by consent, not by  leaders or violence, consent of the people. That is what this  resolution says.   Thirty-five days to go to the election. I know it is going to be  tense in this Chamber, it is going to be tense in this country, but  unity in our country during our darkest times has always been an  antidote against anything that would seek to divide us or take us away  from who we want to be, who we can be, and who we should be--a more  perfect Union.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas  and nays.
