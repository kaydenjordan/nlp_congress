 Mr. Speaker, I rise with the sweetest news from the Sixth  Congressional District of Indiana. On September 25, the famous Wick's  Pies will celebrate its 75th anniversary in business.   Hoosier families have come to know Wick's for its delicious pies and  baked goods that have been a staple in Randolph County since 1944.  Duane ``Wick'' Wickersham started this business by delivering pies from  his 1934 Buick sedan. Within 4 years, he was producing over 300 pies a  day.   Wick's is renowned for its sugar cream pie, a Hoosier specialty since  that has become the State's official State pie.   To this day, Wick's Pies remains family owned and can produce 10,000  pies in a single 8-hour shift. Wick's distributes to more than 40  States, though you can't beat a fresh slice from Mr. Wick's restaurant  on Cherry Street in Winchester, which I have enjoyed.   Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Wick's Pies.           Lack of High-Speed Internet Access Impacts All Americans     Mr. Speaker, earlier in the year, I had the privilege of  sitting in Ranking Member Graves' chair for a portion of the Committee  on Transportation and Infrastructure Members' Day Hearing. Regardless  of the diverse backgrounds or districts we represent, my Republican and  Democratic colleagues echoed familiar stories of how the lack of high- speed internet access is impacting their constituents.   To address this issue, I worked with my colleague and fellow Hoosier,  Congressman Visclosky, to introduce the Broadband Interagency  Coordination Act, legislation to close the digital divide in rural  America. Our bill directs the FCC, USDA, and NTIA to enter into an  agreement to coordinate the distribution of Federal funds for broadband  deployment.   We are working to make it easier for rural communities to access  high-speed internet. We must close the digital divide and ensure  Hoosiers and rural Americans are not left behind.                            ____________________
