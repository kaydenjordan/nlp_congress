 HORN of Oklahoma asked and was given permission to  address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)    HORN of Oklahoma. Madam Speaker, today I rise to mark a  historic moment for our democracy as the House passed the Voting Rights  Advancement Act.   Today, more than 50 years after the original Voting Rights Act was  passed into law, the right to be heard at the ballot box is under  threat.   The VRAA defends our right to vote with provisions that increase  election oversight, strengthen transparency in voting changes, and  ensure that the fundamental principle of one person, one vote is  intact.   As an Oklahoman, I am truly honored to stand here today to honor the  history of a city as well as individuals with strong civil rights  histories.   Just over 61 years ago in Oklahoma City, Clara Luper led a group of  13 children at the first sit-in in the Nation at the Katz Drugstore  that integrated the first lunch counter, to be followed by much more.   Without Clara and those 13 children and without all of those who came  before us, we wouldn't be here today recognizing the passage of the  VRAA.   We have more work to do, but as we celebrate today's legislation, we  should give thanks to the foot soldiers and those who came before who  have laid the foundation and acknowledged the work we have yet to do.                            ____________________
