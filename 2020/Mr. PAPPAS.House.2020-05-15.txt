 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the HEROES Act today  because our frontline workers, first responders, and community members  are rising to the occasion, and so must Congress.   We know we are living through an unprecedented crisis. If we fail to  redouble our efforts, the public health threat will grow, more jobs  will be permanently lost, additional small businesses will throw in the  towel, and cities and towns will go bust.   The conversations I have every day with mayors, hospital officials,  small business owners, and essential workers underscore why bold action  is immediately needed. I fought for a number of provisions in this bill  that are important to my constituents, including  [[Page H2015]]  aid to local government to sustain essential services; free coronavirus  testing, treatment, and vaccines for low-income individuals; expanded  tax credits for small businesses to keep workers on the job; and giving  our veterans a reprieve from VA debt collection.   No bill is perfect, but with bipartisan cooperation in the coming  days, we can deliver meaningful results. We can meet this moment  responsibly, ensure our communities are equipped to overcome this  virus, and allow our economy to safely get back on its feet.
