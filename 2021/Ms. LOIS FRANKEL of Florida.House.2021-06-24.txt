 Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Takano and  Ms. Brownley for their magnificent leadership advancing the health and  safety of our women veterans.   Madam Speaker, my, my, my, this bill, which passed unanimously last  session, is just mind-boggling that now some Republicans are opposing  it.   Really?   I am going to say this: As a very proud mother of a son of a United  States Marine Corps veteran, I know the risks and sacrifices of our  brave military. So I say without hesitation, after service to our  country is completed, no veteran of the United States Armed Forces  should be forced to pay out-of-pocket expenses for preventative care,  including contraception, that their civilian counterparts do not pay.   Small copays can be prohibitive for veterans struggling to make ends  meet. In fact, studies show that costs associated with contraception,  even when small, lead some people to forego it completely, to choose  less effective methods, or use it inconsistently.   Here is the thing, Madam Speaker; the decision about whether or when  or how to become a parent is one of the most important decisions a  person can make. Our veterans were willing to stand up and take bullets  for our freedom, so we need to stand up for theirs. Let's make it  clear, today we are focused on access to birth control.   The Republican position conflating abortion and contraception is part  of a broader extreme effort to block access to any type of reproductive  healthcare. So let's eliminate the barriers and get the veterans the  healthcare they need.   Madam Speaker, I call on my colleagues to demonstrate their  commitment to the patriotic people who make up our military and veteran  communities by passing this very good bill, Equal Access to  Contraception for Veterans Act.
