 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Elaine  Eigeman.   In Congress, every day we have people who come to the Nation's  Capitol to advocate for important issues facing people in every  community across our country. However, few do this as tirelessly and  with as much passion and grace as Elaine.   As the board chair of the Lymphedema Advocacy Group, Elaine has given  a strong voice to lymphedema patients all across the country.   She was the driving force behind the Lymphedema Treatment Act, which  we will introduce in the House this week, to require Medicare to cover  an essential part of lymphedema treatment.   Elaine developed lymphedema in 1999. Throughout her journey, she has  made it her mission to support others and to be a voice for all  suffering from this disease.   Thank you, Elaine, for your leadership and for creating a vibrant  community for patients in the Northwest and beyond. I am proud to be  your friend.                            ____________________
