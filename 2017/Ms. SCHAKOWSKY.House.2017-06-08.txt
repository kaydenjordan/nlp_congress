 Senior citizens, beware of the Financial CHOICE Act.  This bill repeals the best interest rule, which ensures that Americans  that are saving for retirement get financial advice in their best  interest.   Bad advice has real costs. Steven, a 69-year-old Vietnam veteran in  Illinois, lost $147,000 in retirement savings when he got advice that  handsomely profited his so-called investment adviser but devastated  him.   This bill guts the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which  prevents financial exploitation of senior citizens.   In December, the CFPB took an action against three crooked reverse  mortgage companies that deliberately failed to tell seniors that they  could lose their homes.   The Financial CHOICE Act is dangerous. It is dangerous for older  Americans, it is dangerous for all Americans, and it is dangerous for  our entire economy. It puts us all at risk. It is the wrong choice for  America, and I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''
