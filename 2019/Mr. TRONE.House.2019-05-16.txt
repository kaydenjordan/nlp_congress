 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor my nephew, Ian Jacob  Trone, who was born May 18, 1991. This Saturday, he would have been 28  years old. But on December 31, 2016, Ian died alone in a hotel room  from a fentanyl overdose.   Ian was a nice young man. He, like many of us, was destined to grow  up, find a partner, and start a family. He was a huge sports fan, and  like many young boys his age, he had a sense of humor, he was a friend  to many.   But last year, 72,000 people died of an overdose. Almost 70 percent  of those involved fentanyl. This is the most important issue in America  today.   In Congress, we must be determined to end this devastation, both  Democrats and Republicans.   Ian Jacob Trone left us too soon, and I will do everything in my  power to make sure we don't senselessly lose more lives to this  epidemic.                            ____________________
