 Mr. Speaker, it can't be overestimated the value and the  need for water in our lives, in what we consume foodwise and what it  provides in flood control, what it provides in hydroelectric power,  just water at the tap, and even environmental water.   As a Representative from California, we certainly go through a lot of  gyrations and a lot of fights over water. Mark Twain is quoted as  saying: ``Whisky is for drinking, and water is for fighting over.''  There is plenty of that in California.                                time  1115    What is going on?   Back in the 1930s and the 1960s, two major projects were built to  turn California into the blooming land that it is of so much bounty, so  much great agriculture, so much opportunity, with the Federal water  project started in the 1930s and the State water project conceived in  the 1950s and much of it built in the 1960s.  [[Page H6872]]    In my own district, we have two very large dams--Shasta Dam at 4\1/2\  million acre-feet and Lake Oroville at 3\1/2\ million acre-feet. Those  have made so much possibility for people in California, but not just  California. It has helped the whole country.   I will tell you why. Because agriculture is a key element of the  sustainability for this country. It is strategic for being able to feed  itself, defend itself. You can't overestimate how important that is as  well.   What we currently have happening in California and in the Western  States is the extreme environmental left is moving to remove more and  more dams as we speak. Right now in the Klamath River, up in the north  end of my district, there are four dams in the target sites for that.  They make hydroelectric power.   Now, as a sidebar here, what do we hear constantly in this Chamber?  Almost every conversation is filtered through climate change. When you  have sources of power that are zero CO2, such as  hydroelectric power, as well as nuclear power, and very clean efficient  power such as natural gas, which is being phased out or pushed out by  the Biden administration as we can't explore or build pipelines for it,  where are we going to get the power if you tear these dams out?   Why would you take all of these inputs for producing electricity in  this country, while at the same time, you are forcing more and more  things to be powered by electricity, vehicles, big trucks?   I see on the internet there is a major cargo carrier saying we need  to electrify our aircrafts. How heavy will an airplane be when you load  it up with batteries? Will it have any cargo capacity remaining? A big  semi-rig for the highways is 80,000 pounds GVW. By the time they  electrify it and add two 8,000-pound batteries to that, that is 16,000  more pounds of cargo you will have to take off. That means five trucks  will have to now do the job of four trucks. This is where we are going.   Hydroelectric power is extremely important to fuel whatever levels of  electricity we are going to be using. They want to ban gas stoves. They  want to ban gas heaters. If we are going to have more and more of a  reliability on the electric grid, which I hope we don't go through with  these crazy policies, we are going to continue to need this power.   Why are we tearing dams out? They want to tear them out in the State  of Washington. We just visited the Colorado River, the Western Caucus,  over the weekend. The Hoover Dam, what a mighty structure that is, with  eight great big power plant turbines in there. Above that, Lake Powell;  they are talking about maybe we don't really need Lake Powell anymore  because we are in the middle of a drought situation. We are in a tough  drought, but what if we didn't have those to begin with? We wouldn't  have stored that water that has helped us sustain through many years of  drought, actually.   Back in my own district with a full Lake Shasta and a full Lake  Oroville, under the regional conditions, that would get you through 5  years' worth of drought. Still storing water for agriculture, for  people at the tap, for hydroelectric power, and even recreation.   What is the agenda? They want to force more and more electric  vehicles and electric everything, but at the same time, they want to  rip out the means to make the power. It doesn't make a lick of sense.   I just see where Ford Motor Company lost about $4\1/2\ billion last  year electrifying. They had the original influx of people buying those  electric vehicles, but now that has fallen off because once the  incentives go away or once you can get a sticker to drive it in the  fast lanes in certain areas in California, the rest of the market  probably isn't too interested in that.   Their F-150 Lightning, they are pulling back production by at least  half, maybe more, because people aren't buying these vehicles like they  supposedly are projecting.   Stored water is an incredibly good thing. Why it matters to the rest  of the country as well is California has grown so many amazing crops  over the years with the innovation and ability to farm the lands that  we have had in the San Joaquin Valley. We would not have the food that  the whole country eats since 90 percent to 99 percent of these crops  are grown in California.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, there is a saying in the trucking business:  If you got it, a truck brought it.   We need to work to make the ability to deliver the products, the raw  materials, all the interactions of commerce that trucks bring easier  and more streamlined. The regulatory load that the Biden administration  as well as my home State wants makes it harder to buy trucks.   They have had an unnecessary Federal excise tax since World War I on  trucks to help pay for the war that costs $20,000 to $30,000 for every  new vehicle, yet we want them to replace trucks, so they are cleaner,  more efficient, and safer.   They want burdensome regulations on driver duty time, putting speed  limiters on them so that trucks can't stay with traffic. All these  burdens make it much more difficult to deliver what you want.   We need to reel in the Biden administration and have them actually  listen to the people out there on the roads, the truckers and the  people that rely on them to deliver raw materials and finished  products.   More regulations are not going to help that. Taking away the internal  combustion engine is not going to help that. Electrifying every truck  is not going to help that. Let them truck.                            ____________________
