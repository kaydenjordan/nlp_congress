 Mr. President, I want to honor a very special  North Dakota resident who is turning 100 years old on May 26. William  Godman, Jr., now resides at the Haaland Estates Assisted Living Center  in Rugby, ND, after living on the family farm north of the community of  Churchs Ferry for 98 and a half years. To say this lifelong farmer is  one of North Dakota's great stewards of the land would not be an  understatement. At his father's urging, he did not leave the farm to  fight in World War II because his brother had enlisted. He stayed  behind to raise the food to feed a hungry nation and world during those  difficult years. On his farm, William has raised crops including wheat,  barley, flax, corn, and canola.   Throughout the decades of his life across the past century, William  has experienced great moments in North Dakota's history. He and his  late wife, Elaine, raised five children and instilled in them the  necessity of hard work and self reliance. He gave back to his community  in many ways, including being a longtime 4-H leader, church volunteer,  and Men's Club member. Although his birthday will not bring together as  planned all his children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren, I  hope he will be able to celebrate this great milestone with friends and  family at other opportunities throughout the year.   North Dakota is home to more than 200 centenarians, and we consider  them among our most treasured residents. Their pioneer spirit, dignity,  and hard work have brought them through many challenges and personal  achievements. On behalf of all North Dakotans, I wish William a happy  100th birthday and hope this is the start of a year filled with  happiness and joy.                            ____________________
