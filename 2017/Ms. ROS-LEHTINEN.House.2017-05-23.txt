 Mr. Speaker, I am so grateful to Mr. Albio Sires,  my good friend from New Jersey, the ranking member of our Subcommittee  on the Western Hemisphere in the Committee on Foreign Affairs for  joining me tonight for this Special Order regarding the deteriorating  situation in Venezuela, demonstrating not only the bipartisan nature of  this issue, Mr. Speaker, but also the need for the United States, and  specifically the Congress, to be even more engaged.   As Mr. Sires knows--and we will hear from him in just a few minutes-- the situation in Venezuela, as you can see here, is becoming more  desperate by the day. The humanitarian situation is getting worse, if  one can imagine that. The Maduro regime continues its flagrant human  rights violations, and, despite the latest round of sanctions against  human rights violators imposed by our excellent Treasury Department,  the United States needs to take more decisive steps in support of the  people of Venezuela.   Mr. Speaker, at least 48 Venezuelans have been killed in almost 2  months of protests, nonstop protests, against the dictatorship  responsible for a litany of crimes. You cannot enumerate them. Horrific  human rights abuses, drug trafficking, a rapidly worsening humanitarian  situation. The list goes on and on, Mr. Speaker.   Venezuelans do not have access to even the most basic of necessities,  which means water, food, and medicine. None of that exists in  Venezuela. Venezuelan humanitarian shortages of food and medicine.  People are standing in lines to get nothing. The Venezuelan  Pharmaceutical Federation estimates that the country is running  shortages on nearly every necessary medical item. For those few  Venezuelans who could afford to purchase medicine, they are forced to  pay exorbitant prices for supplies like gauze, pain relievers, Band- Aids, and that is only if they are available in the first place, Mr.  Speaker. Hospital workers have told us that the supplies are being  raided, and they are being sold on the black market.   The situation is no better when it comes to food. Last week, a 46- year-old man was killed by soldiers as he was on his way home from  buying diapers for his baby. Killed while buying diapers for his baby.  Why? Because diapers are a scarce commodity. They have been a scarce  commodity for over a year now in Venezuela, a country that was abundant  in natural resources. Earlier this week, this very week, a 15-year-old  boy was shot and killed for the crime of buying flour.   One study reports that 75 percent of the population of Venezuela-- this is unbelievable--has lost an average of 19 pounds due to food  shortages. Even obtaining water can be an expensive proposition for  those without running water at home. The shortage of basic goods has  led to massive lines, has led to violence, has led to looting as people  have become increasingly desperate for the basic, meager means to  survive. We are just talking about basic necessities, Mr. Speaker.   This tragic humanitarian situation could have been prevented, Mr.  Speaker, and no one is more responsible than the thug who rules  Venezuela with an iron fist, Nicolas Maduro, and his despotic regime.  The Maduro dictatorship presides over the world's largest oil reserves  yet has managed to run the state oil company and the entire economy  into the ground.   Socialism does not work. Communism does not work. One need only look  at Venezuela. Instead of allowing humanitarian relief, the regime has  nationalized the food and medical supply chain and put corrupt  officials in charge. What could go wrong?   Earlier this month, I wrote a letter, along with my good friend Albio  Sires, as well as Eliot Engel, the ranking member of the Committee on  Foreign Affairs, and 12 other congressional colleagues joined Mr.  Sires, Mr. Engel, and myself, urging the administration to use its  voice, to use our vote, to use our influence at the United Nations  Security Council to demand that Venezuelan authorities allow the  delivery and the distribution of humanitarian aid. We were giving them  what they need. Maduro would have none of it.   But I applaud our U.S. Ambassador at the U.N., Nikki Haley, for  organizing a Security Council meeting on Venezuela last week. But more  needs to be done, Mr. Speaker. As Ambassador Haley bravely said,  Venezuela is on the edge of a humanitarian crisis, right here in our  hemisphere. Humanitarian agencies must be allowed to operate  independently in Venezuela, without interference from the thuggish  Maduro regime, and deliver the aid that the people so desperately need.  The world is ready to help Venezuela. Nicolas Maduro refuses this help.   Humanitarian agencies must say to Maduro, if they are hindered in any  way, then those responsible must be held to account. Before I continue,  Mr. Speaker, to address the Maduro regime's abuse of human rights in  greater detail and how the United States can be a force for good in  Venezuela, I yield to Albio Sires, my good friend from New Jersey.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Sires for such an eloquent  statement on behalf of the beleaguered and embattled Venezuelan people.   Before I yield so proudly to Mr. Castro of Texas, another member of  our Western Hemisphere Subcommittee, I would like to say just a few  words about the continuing human rights abuses and the deteriorating  situation in Venezuela.   As we have heard from Mr. Sires, we are dealing with a corrupt  dictatorship, and we are dealing with a brutal dictatorship. At least  42 are dead and 90 arrested since protests began in March of 2017, you  can see on this poster.   This is a dictatorship that will go to all lengths to maintain its  tight grip on power and silence the opposition by tear gas, by real  bullets, by jailing, and by intimidation. The people of Venezuela are  literally dying, Mr. Speaker, on the streets from the violence of the  Maduro regime. They are dying on the streets from starvation, and they  are dying from the lack of medical supplies, yet they still risk their  lives.   This goes on each and every day in Venezuela. They go out into the  streets. They demonstrate to the world that they will not be silenced,  and what they desire is freedom, and what they desire is democracy, and  what they desire is nothing less and nothing more than their God-given  human rights, the very same intangibles that many in America here take  for granted because we live in the greatest country in the world. We  take for granted that we have our freedom.   But the ideals that we proudly espouse and defend around the world  are alive and well in the streets of Venezuela. Venezuelans are  protesting against the regime's continual assaults on Venezuela's  constitutional and democratic order.   Like Chavez before him, Nicolas Maduro has a horrific human rights  record, including restrictions on freedom of expression, restrictions  on the press, widespread arbitrary detentions, extrajudicial killings,  torture, and the list goes on and on.   In its human rights reports on Venezuela last year, our own State  Department noted how the Maduro regime has misused the judiciary to  undermine the National Assembly, a body overwhelmingly manipulated by  the opposition since December of 2015. This opposition has risen to  power thanks to the vote of the people.   So what did Nicolas Maduro say? Well, his supreme court nullified  almost every action taken by the National Assembly, including refusing  to allow lawmakers to take their seats in the legislature and  overturning laws to free political prisoners and grow the economy.   I am so pleased to see that we have been joined by the chairman of  the Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere, Mr. Duncan, tonight.   But things have only gotten worse since that time. In March, the  regime controlled the Supreme Tribunal of Justice--a sad name for what  it does--and ruled that it would resume the responsibilities of the  National Assembly. It said: We are the state. Who needs the National  Assembly that is manipulated and controlled by the opposition? We  nullify its actions. We will assume the responsibility.   And although what the Tribunal said, they had to backtrack almost  immediately because the condemnation internationally was so loud. It  partially reversed its decision just a few days later, but the damage  was already done, Mr. Speaker. Venezuelans had further proof of a break  in the constitutional order.   Anti-regime protests have been going on, as we can see here, day  after day, day after day, as hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans have  taken to the streets to demand relief from the Maduro repression.  According to The New York Times, before these protests even began, Mr.  Speaker, the Maduro regime had arrested 6,893 people, jailed 433 for  political reasons just in the past few years, and there are at least  175 political prisoners behind bars today, including Leopoldo Lopez and  Daniel Ceballos.   Joshua Holt, a United States citizen, Mr. Speaker, is being unjustly  held for nearly a year. In September, I wrote a letter, joined by my  colleagues here, to the State Department about Joshua's case. Joshua  Holt's health has deteriorated over the last month. I urged the State  Department to secure his unconditional release on humanitarian grounds.  We all were humbled to meet with Joshua Holt's mom, who is so anxious  to see his release, just last month.   So, Mr. Speaker, despite all of the Maduro regime's human rights  abuses, the beatings, the violence, the murders, the repression, and  the political prisoners, despite all of this, the Venezuelan people are  refusing to be silenced. They are rising up, and they are protesting in  even greater numbers. This is just amazing.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Castro), my  good friend from the Western Hemisphere Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, we are so pleased that Mr. Castro has,  once again, joined us in this battle for human rights, for democracy,  for justice, for the rule of law, in our hemisphere. His voice is a  valiant one that needs to be heard and is always present whenever the  struggle for human rights is mentioned.   So thank you, Mr. Castro, for this stance today and for the stance  that you have taken on behalf of beleaguered people in our hemisphere  every day.   Now, Mr. Sires and I are so thankful that our subcommittee chairman  of the Western Hemisphere Subcommittee, the gentleman from South  Carolina (Mr. Duncan), has joined us.   As I mentioned, Mr. Speaker, Mr. Sires is the ranking member of that  subcommittee, and Mr. Duncan is the chairman of that subcommittee, a  valiant voice for freedom that must be heard.   I yield to the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Duncan).    I yield back the balance of my time.
