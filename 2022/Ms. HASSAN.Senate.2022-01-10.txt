 Madam President, I am honored to recognize  Caitlin McGrath-Levesque of Portsmouth as December's Granite Stater of  the Month. Following the death of her youngest brother, Caitlin and her  two siblings turned their grief into action by creating a nonprofit in  his honor to provide free, hot meals to those in need.   Caitlin's late brother--who went by ``Red''--was an avid volunteer in  the Seacoast area. After he died, Caitlin and her siblings decided that  the best way to honor their brother was by giving back to their  community.   Following a $100 donation from each of the siblings, Red's Good Vibes  was officially born.   Red's Good Vibes consists of one food truck--with a second one on the  way--that travels around the Seacoast to communities with the most  need. The nonprofit collects monetary donations, as well as utilizes  relationships with the NH Food Bank, local restaurants, and grocery  stores, which allows them to service communities 3 days a week with the  help of dedicated volunteers.   For Caitlin and her siblings, one of the most important goals of  Red's Good Vibes is to make sure that all clients are treated with the  utmost respect and dignity.   In that vein, Red's Good Vibes always works to ensure that clients  have multiple meal options, which helps make the experience feel more  like a normal food truck than a charity. The nonprofit also never asks  for suggested donations when volunteers are actively serving food to  avoid making anyone feel compelled to donate in the moment.   Red's Good Vibes is a labor of love for Caitlin and her siblings, who  found a way to honor their brother in the most authentic way that they  could. Thanks to their dedication, and the hard work of their  volunteers, Red's Good Vibes distributes 1,500 hot meals a week to  Granite Staters facing food insecurity. Soon, the nonprofit hopes to  double that number using a second food truck that they are leasing from  the city of Dover for $1 a year.   Caitlin turned a tragedy into an opportunity to give back to her  community, which exemplifies the Granite State's ingenuity and all- hands-on-deck spirit. I am proud to honor Caitlin as December's Granite  Stater of the Month, and I wish Red's Good Vibes continued success  serving their community.                            ____________________
