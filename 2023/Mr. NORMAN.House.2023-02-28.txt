 Madam Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the dedicated  service and call to the ministry of Dr. Barry Dagenhart who has served  as a pastor for over 40 years.   Dr. Dagenhart grew up in Statesville, North Carolina, and was  spiritually nurtured in the New Sterling Associate Reformed  Presbyterian (A.R.P.) Church.   Graduating in 1979, he studied economics at the University of North  Carolina in Charlotte. He also holds a master of divinity degree and a  doctor of ministry degree from Erskine Theological Seminary. While at  Erskine, he met his loving wife, Sarah Lynn Richie, of Fairfield,  Virginia, and they were married on June 26 of 1982.   Dr. Dagenhart had the honor and privilege of serving on various  boards and agencies throughout the A.R.P. denomination. He served on  the board of stewardship and A.R.P. Foundation, as well as the Erskine  College and Seminary Board of Trustees. He was also blessed to serve as  the vice moderator of the A.R.P. General Synod.   He currently serves on the Bonclarken Board of Trustees, the  conference center for the A.R.P. denomination. In addition to his  service at the Synod level, he also has served on various commissions  and committees on the Presbytery level in First Presbytery, Second  Presbytery, and, most recently, Catawba Presbytery where he served as  moderator from 2013 to 2014.   Not only has Dr. Dagenhart generously served on various boards and  committees in his community, he also enjoyed being able to use his call  to the gospel ministry to impact youth, adults, and individuals with  special needs at various week-long summer camps at Bonclarken located  in Flat Rock, North Carolina.   Throughout his decades of ministry, Dr. Dagenhart has frequently  served as camp minister for Camp Joy, a camp for those affected by  physical and mental disabilities. Dr. Dagenhart's caring and generous  heart is what makes him stand out as an honorable citizen and follower  of Jesus Christ, sacrificing his time to help those around him.   Dr. Dagenhart has an encouraging and loving family--his wife Sarah,  son Jamey, and daughter Rachel--who support him in walking his path of  placing others above himself.   Dr. Barry Dagenhart has set the gold standard for decades of  dedicated service and commitment to his congregation and to the  community. He will long be remembered for that.   Madam Speaker, we all join in saying thank you and Godspeed in his  well-deserved years of retirement.                            ____________________
