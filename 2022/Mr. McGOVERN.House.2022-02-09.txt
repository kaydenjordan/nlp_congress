 Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished majority whip  for yielding me the time and for his commitment to justice and all  necessary to make this country a better place for everybody.   Mr. Speaker, some say that time heals all wounds. In the hours right  after the January 6 attack, I was hopeful that with time America might  begin to heal, too; that in the wake of such a dastardly attack on our  democracy, Republicans would recoil in disgust at what they had  created; that after the President of the United States whipped a  violent mob into a frenzy and sent them here to attack Congress, they  might finally say enough is enough.   That didn't happen, and it is not going to. The Republican National  Committee just called January 6 ``legitimate political discourse.''  Legitimate political discourse? They had lead pipes and guns. They  destroyed property and beat cops. Give me a break.   Sadly, this is just their latest attempt to rewrite history. Last  year they called January 6, ``a normal tourist visit.'' They continue  obstructing the January 6th Select Committee.  [[Page H1093]]  They continue spreading the big lie that the election was stolen  despite overwhelming, incontrovertible evidence that it wasn't.   The former President again promised to pardon those who engaged in  violence if he assumes office again. This week we learned that he  considered using the military to seize ballot boxes. Now, there is a  sentence that sends a chill down my spine.   I credit Leader McConnell, who rebuked his party this week. He said  January 6 was ``a violent insurrection for the purpose of trying to  prevent the peaceful transfer of power.'' But he is the exception.   For a majority of Republicans, things have not changed. They have  stayed the same, stuck in a QAnon fever dream, waiting at the beck and  call of a twice-impeached ex-President who has spent his retirement  shredding evidence at Mar-a-Lago. Time has not stiffened their spines.  It hasn't jolted them into reality or brought us together like we were  in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks.    January 6 hasn't become a turning point. Instead, it has become a  talking point. This is the new Republican reality. To gain support from  the ex-President, you have to repeat a lie that the election was  stolen, and to maintain the support of the Republican Party, you have  to repeat another lie, that January 6 wasn't a violent uprising against  America.   There is a word for that, Mr. Speaker. It is called fascism, and it  is a jarring word, one I don't use lightly. So let me be clear exactly  how I mean it. Fascism isn't about a particular set of beliefs or  political ideology. It is about power and the lengths to which some  people will go to acquire and retain it.   For decades, America fought against fascism, but today a growing  movement here at home seeks to upend norms, settle disagreement with  violence, and silence the truth.   ``Free societies,'' American philosopher Jason Stanley says,  ``require truth, and so to smash freedom, you must smash truth.''   So let me say this plainly: The election was not stolen. Trump- appointed judges say it was not stolen. Republican-led investigations  say it was not stolen. Republican officials responsible for counting  votes say it wasn't stolen.   If you are an elected official and you continue smashing the truth,  even after all that we have learned about what happened on January 6,  you are supporting fascism.   What is happening is not new. Even the earliest philosopher saw that  democracies are particularly susceptible to tyranny. There is no reason  to believe it can't happen here.   What is special about America isn't the strength of our institutions  alone, it is the strength and courage of the people willing to stand up  and fight for them. And that is why I am glad the January 6th Select  Committee is doing its work. I am grateful President Biden isn't  falling for false claims of executive privilege by the ex-President  designed to cover up what went on. And I am proud of the people who  keep showing up day in and day out despite going through hell that day,  from congressional staff to the administrative staff, to cafeteria  workers, to the cleaning crews, to the Capitol Police. Each of you is  playing a vital role in defending our democracy.                                time  1230    But make no mistake, we are standing on the precipice.   When we spend hours and hours debating whether State legislatures  should be allowed to nullify ballots; when politicians call an attempt  to violently overthrow the United States Government ``legitimate  political discourse,'' we are in a dangerous spot.   The insurrection, conspiracy theories, the big lie, voter  suppression, they are all branches on the same tree.   And at the root of all of it is power.   Now, I don't have a magic wand to make it better, I have a warning:  Time won't heal our wounds or reign in fascism in America. That is why  we must demand the truth.   If we don't, the people who are trying to normalize what happened on  January 6 won't be dismissed. They will be empowered.   God help us all, and God help the United States of America if that  happens.
