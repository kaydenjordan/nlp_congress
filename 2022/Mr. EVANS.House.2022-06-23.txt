 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to mark the 50th anniversary of  the Pell Grant Program.  [[Page H5827]]    In 1972, Congress amended the Higher Education Act by creating the  Basic Educational Opportunity Grant to provide direct financial aid to  low-income students so they could have the same access to higher  education and opportunity for success as their higher income peers.   The program was later named the Pell grant for its original sponsor,  Senator Pell, Democrat from Rhode Island. The original bill was signed  into law by Republican President Richard Nixon, and the program has  maintained this original bipartisan support over the last 50 years.   To date, more than 80 million students have received a Pell grant to  go to college since the program was created. Currently, nearly 7  million students are going to college with a Pell grant, or about 40  percent of undergraduate students. In my district in the great city of  Philadelphia, nearly 22,000 students receive $90.5 million to pursue  their higher education goals.   The Federal investment in Pell grants is targeted to students with  demonstrated financial need, students whose families have incomes of  $40,000 or less. The investment pays off by increasing college  completion and economic mobility.   On the 50-year anniversary of the Pell Grant Program, I encourage the  United States to celebrate national Pell grant day by recognizing the  current students and successful graduates who have benefited from the  program by telling their student success stories and encouraging the  same access for future students, demonstrating the importance of what  the Pell grant has meant.   The Pell grant is significant to the future of this country, and it  is important that we all stand up for this program that has been  valuable to our young people for the future, no matter what side of the  aisle we are on.                            ____________________
