 Madam Speaker, I rise in favor of the rule and to highlight  two amendments that I am offering to the minibus.   In my home State of North Carolina, we lead the East Coast in  offshore wind energy generation potential, and our manufacturing  workforce stands ready to support offshore wind projects up and down  the Atlantic coastline.   Unfortunately, former President Trump issued a 10-year moratorium on  offshore wind leasing off our coast that is set to take effect in 2022.  This ill-conceived moratorium puts our State's ability to develop this  resource and capture its economic and environmental benefits at risk.   I am proud to offer an amendment to this bill, which would prohibit  the use of funds to implement the offshore wind component of this  moratorium while leaving the moratorium on offshore oil and gas leasing  in place.   This amendment, and a similar bill I introduced with Congressman  Tonko, are essential in order to meet our State and national climate  goals.   My second amendment highlights the obstacles faced by pregnant and  parenting students. Today, nearly 22 percent of undergraduate students  are parents. Pregnant and parenting students face significant barriers  in education, from difficulty accessing college, to insufficient  childcare, to lack of holistic supports.   As a result, pregnant and parenting students experience  disproportionately low graduation rates as well as a median debt that  is nearly 2\1/2\ times higher than that of students without children.  Pregnant and parenting high school students too frequently find  themselves pushed out of school entirely.   My amendment instructs the Institute of Education Sciences to conduct  a study on the obstacles pregnant and parenting students face in the  pursuit of education and provides recommendations for improving  educational outcomes, including graduation rates for these students.    Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the rule, my  amendments, and the underlying bill.
