 Mr. Speaker, I want to take a moment to salute  my sorority, Sigma Gamma Rho Sorority, Incorporated, for its centennial  celebration on November 12, 2022. We were founded in Indianapolis,  Indiana, at Butler University November 12, 1922, by seven illustrious  schoolteachers. Now we are led by the wonderful Grand Basileus Rasheeda  Liberty, and we will embark on our next 100 with greater service,  greater progress.                            ____________________
