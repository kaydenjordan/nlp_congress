 Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Three quick points here. First of all, it is interesting. You can go  back to 2008 and look at John McCain's campaign and, entertainingly,  Sarah Palin's Vice Presidential statements about how climate change was  an existential threat, and this was a bipartisan issue where we talked  about why this was a significant challenge that we needed to address.   Then, of course, Barack Obama had the audacity to get elected  President and pursue that agenda, so suddenly it became political.   I just want to make this very, very clear. The belief here is that  digging up fossil fuels from below the ground and burning them is bad  for life, it is bad for the planet, and it will eventually exterminate  the planet.   Now, if you want to disagree with that, you want to have a little  argument about whether or not that is true, we can. I mean, the  overwhelming majority of scientists seem to agree with that, but let's  hear the argument. It just kills me to sit here and listen to the other  side claim that this is a political agenda.   Now, I understand why they do that, because that skips past the messy  part of where you have to actually argue the facts and you can just  dismiss it as politics and everyone robotically goes: Oh, yes,  politics, that is bad. We can't have that.   If we can have an actual discussion about this, if you believe, as  the administration does and as, again, I don't know, 80 percent of the  scientists believe, that climate change could destroy the fricking  planet, then it is worth saying that that's a national security threat  at least equivalent to China.   Yes, there is the possibility of global nuclear war with China that  could exterminate the planet, but climate change, the argument is,  would exterminate the planet, so I think that is worth thinking about.   Please believe me when I say this is not a political agenda. It is a  heartfelt belief that we have a distinct problem here that needs to be  addressed.   Second: How to address it. Come up with alternative sources of energy  and make those investments. This is also very important, because even  if this wasn't destroying the planet, our dependency upon oil has been  problematic.   I know there is this fantasy that we are going to become energy  independent. Nobody is energy independent. Oil is a global marketplace.  Even if we generate enough energy, we sell it overseas, and Saudi  Arabia and OPEC therefore have an enormous amount of control over that  market.   As I have said over and over again, the true answer to this problem  is, when gas prices go up, wouldn't it be great to say: That is  wonderful, but we don't need that, we have other sources of energy to  go to. Nothing is more important in the military than energy and access  to it. Wars are started over having access to the energy that you need.  To say that this doesn't involve national security literally hurts my  brain. You need these alternatives.   The last argument is on the market: We will let the market decide.  The market subsidized the living hell out of the oil industry for 175  years. They have an enormous advantage. The pipelines, the system, the  entire thing that was built, was built on our taxpayer dollars. Now,  what we are saying is if we are going to develop an alternative to  that, then we are going to have to help that, as we helped nuclear  energy, and a whole of bunch other different things.   I don't think I hear the other side complaining about the government  subsidizing nuclear energy because that fits within their politics.   If I ask nothing else, could we please just have a rational  discussion that understands that this is a legitimate policy issue? It  isn't a fetish. It isn't a political debate. It is the fate of the  planet and how we manage energy policy, both of which--I am going to  take a real bold step here--actually impact national security. I  believe that they do, and I believe that anybody would agree with that  statement.   Please, defeat this amendment.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I would just note that we  actually are making investments in nuclear power. It is really  expensive and difficult to develop, but the investments are being made.  That is part of the agenda.   Mr. Chair, I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Garamendi).    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Stanton).    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself 2 minutes.   Mr. Chair, I will have remarks in a moment while, regrettably, I am  not supporting this particular bill. That doesn't change how much  respect I have for the process and for all the people who participated  in that process. I want to make sure we understand that.   One of the things I always say, I believe in democracy more than I  believe in my own opinion, which means that the process is important  and the way we put that process together and that we move through it.   In particular, I definitely thank the staff, certainly our staff on  the House Armed Services Committee that has done an outstanding job,  the Rules Committee staff, as well, but also the floor staff and the  parliamentarians and the folks who have to put the amendments together  and put the legislation together.   Throughout this process from the very start, when the original bill  was introduced, to all of the amendments, we have to run through these  numbers, it is in the thousands, basically, of amendments and ideas  that are submitted.   From the moment we put together the initial bill, we amend it in  committee, they deal with Rules, they amend it on the floor--we are  talking literally thousands of different pieces of legislation and  ideas that have to be brought together. Members don't do any of that.   We spout out ideas, and a whole bunch of staff work really hard to  get that done. I thank them very, very much for all of that work to  make this process go forward.   Mr. Chair, it is a good, robust bipartisan approach. We have the  amendments, we have the debates, and we resolve it. One thing I will  make clear, I am not thrilled with the outcome of the Rules Committee,  but that is the nature of being in the minority.   When you are in the majority, the Rules Committee does what the Rules  Committee does, and the minority complains about it. That is the way  this place works. That is fine. I might have done it differently in  terms of trying to figure out how to pass the bill.   At the end of the day, I don't have any process objection here. The  amendments were put on the floor, and they passed. I am not concerned  about that. I am concerned about the outcome, and I will explain that  later.   Mr. Chair, I will take a moment to really make it clear how much I  thank all the people who put this process together, in particular, I  thank Chairman Rogers for his work.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself an additional 30  seconds.   Mr. Chair, it is not as easy as it looks. Let me just sum that up.  There are a whole lot of things you have to manage, including the  minority part. Chairman Rogers has done an outstanding job of doing  that in his first year as chair, and I appreciate that and I respect  that. I thank everybody for the process they put together.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1000     Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. Houlahan), who is a member of the  committee.    Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 30 seconds  to the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   Mr. Chair, I thank the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania, who summed it  up reasonably well, but I really want to make sure people understand  why we are opposed to this bill.   We are opposed to this bill because it is our firm belief that this  will undermine our ability to meet the national security objectives of  this country.   I want to explain why. We can start with the issue of access to  reproductive healthcare for women.   Because of the Dobbs decision, there are many States now across this  country where you cannot get access to that care. The Department of  Defense, faced with that and having a large number of women and family  members of servicemembers in those States, set up a situation to allow  those women to get access to that reproductive care. This bill takes  that away.   Mr. Chair, if you are a woman concerned about your ability to get an  abortion, first of all, or concerned about if you are a servicemember  who has a family member who might be concerned about that, you are  going to be less likely to join the military.   I really do want to emphasize one point that came up during this. I  understand a lot of people oppose abortion. They want to ban it  outright, and that is why they feel this way. However, do understand  the negative impact that that will have on a lot of women's willingness  to join the military.    It goes beyond abortion, as we have sadly seen. The worst case of  this is a woman who miscarries midway through her pregnancy cannot get  treated for that. There was one particular case that was cited during  the debate of a woman who wound up in the emergency room fighting for  her life because of an infection because she could not get that care.   If you are a woman, Mr. Chair, or if you are a man who is  considering, ``What about my spouse, and what about my children?'' then  you will be less likely to join the military knowing that you have that  challenge. So, we are going to have fewer qualified people willing to  join the military because of what was passed. That will not make our  military stronger.   We have also now said, and the debate seems to imply, that trans  people don't exist so they are not welcome in the military either. Now,  I am not a doctor and, therefore, don't want to presume what treatment  someone should have who is in a transgender situation, but what this  bill says is: Nope, we are not even going to consider it.   Again, Mr. Chair, if you are a trans person, you are going to be less  likely to join the military, or, Mr. Chair, if you are someone who  thinks, ``What if I have a child who is a trans person?'' The military  is not going to accept them. So, now, Mr. Chair, you can take trans  people off the table. They are not going to join the military either.   Then, we have the most difficult aspect of this, and that is the  diversity, equity, and inclusion piece. This is a very widely  misunderstood thing, and I tried to explain it throughout the debate.   Believe it or not, we have a history of discrimination in this  country. We have a history of bigotry. You can go through slavery, Jim  Crow, the Ku Klux Klan, and a whole bunch of different things, Mr.  Chair. We also have a history of incredible discrimination against  women.   I cited this before, but as it came out during debate, women who join  the military, I think, have a very strong understanding that they are  going to have to work twice as hard, basically, to get the same  opportunities that a man gets in the military. That is sort of  understood.   Because of that historical discrimination, Mr. Chair, you also have  to wonder, if you are a person of color, whether you are going to get a  fair shake in the military.   Now, I will admit there are a lot of people who, even faced with  those odds, even knowing that they are going to have to work twice as  hard and face that discrimination, will join, but some will not. So,  again, there is another group of people who we have now taken off the  table.   I want to take a special moment to recognize, on that last point, the  willingness of people to join the military even if they are facing  discrimination.   Where I live in the Seattle-Bellevue area, we have a lot of Nisei  veterans and family of Nisei veterans, and it is a particularly  compelling story. These are Japanese Americans who fought and died, in  many cases, for our country during World War II while their family  members were unfairly incarcerated back home.   I know that there are people who will step up and take on that  challenge anyway, but there will be fewer of them.   Basically, Mr. Chair, you have this huge group of people now who are  going to be less likely to join the military because of what this bill  does.   I will slightly paraphrase a line from ``A Few Good Men.'' Basically,  all this bill does is weakens our country. It weakens our ability to  respect all the people who should be allowed not just to serve but to  serve with an equal chance of advancement. Whether you  [[Page H3597]]  are talking about women, whether you are talking about trans people,  whether you are talking about people of color, Mr. Chair, this bill  says that we are going to make it more difficult for you to get a fair  shake in the military.   I do understand the DEI argument, but let me just say two things  about that as I bring this to a close.   First of all, there were a lot of very disturbing arguments made. I  think the base renaming commission argument, even though technically it  really didn't matter, was the most disturbing of all as we, once again,  heard all these speeches about how we need to honor our history and  honor our heritage.   These are the exact same arguments that were made over 100 years ago  when this country went through a very concerted effort to make sure  that we could establish white supremacy as the law of the land. The  very same arguments that erected these monuments and named these bases  and gave us the Ku Klux Klan and Jim Crow were made on the floor of  this House.   It is shocking that those arguments were made. It is appalling that  those arguments carried the day and actually won on all of these  amendments and found themselves inserted in the bill. All of that is  very concerning.   I do understand that there is a different set of arguments and a very  respectable set of arguments that says that the way we are attempting  to address the historical discrimination of this country is  problematic, and that is primarily critical race theory.   There are certainly some in this country who have a view of this that  our country is nothing but racist and that basically we have heard--I  think  Mike Waltz actually read this out in committee, and it is very  accurate: There are some who believe that all White people are racist,  that if you are a White person, you are by definition an oppressor, and  you need to think about that.   I have seen that, and I have witnessed that, and it is wrong. In my  opinion, it is not the correct way to approach that. How should we  handle that? The way we have chosen to handle that is to get rid of  diversity, equity, and inclusion completely and totally, and that is  the problem.   Mr. Chair, if you wanted to say that we are not going to do that part  of it, fine. That is not what we did.    To the argument of, ``Well, gee, all that does is makes it fair. We  shouldn't consider race. We shouldn't consider any of these things in  determining excellence,'' the problem is that for 400 years we did, and  at the end of that, one particular group of people got all the  advantages.    Mr. Chair, I urge opposition to this bill,  but I do thank the people for the process that was put in place.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
