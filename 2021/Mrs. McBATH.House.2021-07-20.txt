 Mr. Speaker, there is a special place in every parent's  heart for summer with our children. My son, Jordan, used to put on his  little cleats and a big hat and run out onto the field to play tee-ball  with his friends on Saturday mornings. After that, we would go to the  pool to cool off; eat lunch under a shady tree; play in the backyard as  the day turned to dusk; and read a story together as he drifted off to  sleep.   Truly, summer is for hardworking parents to spend time with the  little ones that they love most. It is for our children to grow and  live and learn and play.   That is why I am so proud that we just passed the child tax credit  into law. It means more money in the pockets of middle-class families.  Now, over 680,000 families in my home State of Georgia will receive a  tax cut, and these credits will raise over 160,000 children in Georgia  out of poverty.   This is more funding for Georgia families to protect our children and  to lift up our communities.                            ____________________
