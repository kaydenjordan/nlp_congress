 Mr. President, reserving the right to object, this is an  issue on which Congress needs to act. Congress does, in fact, have  authority to pass laws governing immigration and naturalization within  our system, but this particular unanimous consent request represents an  attempt to pass a major piece of legislation without any opportunity  for debate, any opportunity for input from the American people, or any  opportunity for amendments by individual Members. If we pass it this  way, we will be cutting the American people out of the debate.   Moreover, we also need to address the draws for illegal immigration.  If we are going to address the needs of those who have been brought  here unlawfully by no fault of their own while they were infants or  minors, we need to make sure that we are not going to continue to draw  people in unlawfully and that we are not going to continue to have  people in various parts of the world sending their children here  unlawfully, unaccompanied on many occasions and being subjected to  sexual assault and all other kinds of abuse in the process. We do need  to fix the underlying problem.   For that reason, I object.
