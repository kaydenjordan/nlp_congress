 Mr. President, I rise to formally express my gratitude for  the heroic actions of my fellow Hoosier, Eli Dicken, at the Greenwood  Park Mall.   On Sunday, July 17, 2022, in the midst of unimaginable tragedy, Eli  boldly stepped forward into danger to save the lives of others. As a  murderer committed a heinous act of violence at the Greenwood Park  Mall, Eli, after directing others around him to get to safety, drew his  own firearm, and fired upon the attacker, ultimately taking his life  and saving the lives of countless innocent bystanders. Within 15  seconds, Eli was able to stop an even greater tragedy. As Chief James  Ison of the Greenwood, IN, Police Department noted, Eli's actions  ``were nothing short of heroic'' and ``many more people would have died  . . . if it was not for his heroism.'' Eli's actions were possible due  to this own bravery and because of actions taken by the State of  Indiana to ensure that law-abiding citizens are freely able to exercise  their constitutional right to keep and bear arms.   I mourn the three innocent lives that were taken and pray for the  families and communities that this senseless tragedy has affected. I  also pray for the continued recovery of those wounded in the attack,  who were in part saved by Eli's decisive actions and also by the  exceptional response and care of first responders. So today, I add my  own voice to those honoring Eli and express my gratitude for his  selfless courage.                            ____________________
