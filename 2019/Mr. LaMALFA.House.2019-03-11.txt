 Mr. Speaker, it is with great sadness I rise today to  mourn the tragic loss of life on Sunday morning as an Ethiopian  Airlines jet carrying 157 people crashed only 6 minutes after takeoff.  On board that flight were people from 35 different countries, including  8 U.S. citizens, with no survivors.   This tragedy hits close to home for those of us from northern  California. Two of the eight Americans were from my own district in  Shasta County.   Melvin and Bennett Riffel, two brothers from Redding, California,  were embarking upon an adventure that had already taken them through  Australia and Mogadishu before they arrived in Ethiopia. It has been  said that this was their last trip together before Melvin was set to  become a father, together with his wife Brittney, who had only recently  returned home.   Our friends and neighbors in northern California share in the sadness  and grief that we all feel for their families, and for all of the  families who lost loved ones that day on that plane.  [[Page H2631]]    As we await more information on exactly what went wrong, please join  me in praying for Melvin and Bennett, their families, and all the  others who boarded that fateful flight that day.                            ____________________
