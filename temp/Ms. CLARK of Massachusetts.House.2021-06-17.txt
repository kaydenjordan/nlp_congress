 Madam Speaker, 19 years ago, this body  passed the 2002 Authorization for Use of Military Force based on lies  and misinformation about Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction.   This authorization has entangled us in a decades-long war, costing  billions of dollars and tens of thousands of lives.   Millions of young people in this country, including my three  children, have never known an America that wasn't at war.   This repeal is long overdue and absolutely vital to protecting the  integrity of our system of checks and balances and the security of our  Nation and servicemembers.   Today we stand up for Congress' constitutional war powers and the  right to say ``no'' to conflicts abroad and ``yes'' to peace.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.''
