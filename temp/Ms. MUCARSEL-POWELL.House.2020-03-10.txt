 Madam Speaker, today is National Women and Girls  HIV/AIDS Awareness Day.   In the United States, 235,000 women and girls are living with HIV,  and they make up one in four new diagnoses, with Hispanic and African- American women disproportionately impacted.   Although, nationwide, new HIV cases are declining, in Miami-Dade  County they are, sadly, on the rise, making today so important for my  district.   Let's remember, also, that this disease yet has no cure. Awareness is  critical to reduce transmission. Knowing your status is crucial.   But the reality is that one in nine women with HIV are unaware that  they have it. That is why testing and preventive medication like PrEP  need to be accessible and affordable. We must also be aware that some  women living with HIV postpone care because of fears of rejection by  loved ones or violence from a partner.   It is on us to do our part to spread awareness, reduce stigma, and  support women and girls living with HIV and AIDS.                            ____________________
