 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman very much for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, while the Fiscal Responsibility Act is not perfect and  God knows we need serious corrections, but there are at least ten  conservative American provisions in this bill that will benefit our  economy and advance a higher level of fiscal responsibility.   Let's be honest, this is the most conservative bill that can pass  with a Biden White House and a Schumer Senate. The Fiscal  Responsibility Act stops the excessive spending, stops the bleeding,  and adds to our workforce with work requirements. It includes the most  important Federal and environmental permitting reforms in 40 years.   Don't take my word for it. This is coming from the Associated General  Contractors of America, the American Petroleum Institute, the Marcellus  Shale Coalition, and the National Association of Manufacturers.    Virtually every small business association, every group committed to  sound, fiscal policy, such as Americans for Tax Reform and Americans  for Prosperity have endorsed this legislation. This bill reins in the  Biden administration's executive order spending which accounted for  over $1 trillion in spending over the last 2 years.   There is also a reduction of the IRS for $20 billion, it protects  Social Security, and all the while we will avoid a catastrophic  default. I urge support of this bill.
