 Mr. Chairman, this bill contains 12 measures that have  wide Democratic support. Unfortunately, they have been held hostage and  added to a bill that contains a pharmacy of poison pills.   The gentleman from New Mexico points out that we need to do something  with manufactured housing. I support that bill. Liberate that bill.  Don't put it in a bill that is going to die in the Senate.   The gentleman from Wisconsin talks about too big to fail. Please  cosponsor the Sanders-Sherman bill to break up the too big to fail  rather than this bill that lets them stay too big and takes away the  regulation.   I look forward to working in a bipartisan way to support the  Financial Accounting Foundation's efforts to have independently funded  standards for government-issued debt. This bill takes that away.   I look forward to working in a bipartisan way to have different and  lesser standards for community financial institutions like credit  unions and local banks. Instead, this highly partisan bill takes us  down the wrong highway. It is a highway to a bill that will go nowhere  in the Senate, and then we will resume our efforts to improve financial  regulation in this country.
