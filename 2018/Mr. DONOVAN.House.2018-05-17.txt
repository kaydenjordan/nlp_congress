 Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the memory and sacrifice of  New York police officers killed in the line of duty.   Every day, women and men don blue uniforms and head out to the  streets, unsure of what danger they may encounter. They protect my  family and the 8 million people who live in New York City. I thank them  for risking everything to keep us safe.   The following men and women, New York's finest, have met their end of  watch while carrying out their duties since I came to office in  Congress in May of 2015. I would like to honor them by reading their  names here in the House Chamber:   Lieutenant Jeffrey Francis, 9/11-related illness   Detective Miosotis Familia, gunfire   Officer Michael Hance, 9/11-related illness   Sergeant Terrence Scott O'Hara, 9/11-related illness   Deputy Chief James Molloy, 9/11-related illness   Detective Steven McDonald, gunfire   Detective Stephen Kubinski, 9/11-related illness   Sergeant Paul Tuozzolo, gunfire   Assistant Chief Michael Quinn, 9/11-related illness   Detective Michael Glazer, 9/11-related illness   Lieutenant Kenneth Rosello, 9/11-related illness   Officer Kenneth Wolf, 9/11-related illness   Officer Deborah Garbutt-Jeff, 9/11-related illness   Detective Andrew Siroka, 9/11-related illness   Officer Juan Feliciano, heart attack   Sergeant Donald Scott Conniff, vehicular assault   Sergeant Michael Galvin, 9/11-related illness   Sergeant Wayne Jackson, 9/11-related illness   Lieutenant Marci Simms, 9/11-related illness   Officer Charles Karen, 9/11-related illness   Sergeant Louis Pioli, 9/11-related illness   Detective Randolph Holder, gunfire   Sergeant Gerard Beyrodt, 9/11-related illness   Detective Ronald Richards, 9/11-related illness   Sergeant Edmund Murray, 9/11-related illness   Lieutenant Rebecca Buck, 9/11-related illness   Officer Alexander Figueroa, 9/11-related illness   Lieutenant Luis Lopez, 9/11-related illness   Officer Matthew Gay, 9/11-related illness   Officer James Betso, 9/11-related illness   Detective Leroy Dixon, 9/11-related illness   Detective Michael Kenneth Davis,  9/11-related illness   Sergeant Charles Gunzelman, 9/11-related illness.
