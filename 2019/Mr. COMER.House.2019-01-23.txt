 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in solidarity with the Marshall  County community to honor and remember the precious lives of Preston  Cope and Bailey Holt. Preston and Bailey were victims of a tragic  shooting at Marshall County High School in Benton, Kentucky, on this  day last year.   Marshall County High School is comprised of a truly compassionate  group of students, parents, and alumni who have demonstrated the  resiliency of this community in the wake of such devastation.   Preston Cope and Bailey Holt remain in our hearts as we remember and  honor all that these young, bright individuals brought to their  families, friends, school, and community.                            ____________________
