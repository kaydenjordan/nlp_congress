 Mr. Chair, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   I am honored to stand to propose an amendment to the National Defense  Authorization Act, which is an opportunity to improve the security of  the American people and modernize defense policy to meet the demands of  emerging security threats.   For the first time in years, House Democrats finally have the chance  to voice our priorities for national defense. That is why I am happy to  introduce this amendment, which will increase by $5 million the Air  Force University Research Initiatives.   This program provides Department of Defense grants to competing  universities, including those in Nevada like the University of Nevada,  Las Vegas, and the Desert Research Institute, and gives our best and  brightest minds the opportunity to do the research necessary to develop  advanced defense technology.   Throughout U.S. history, it has been our continued research and  innovation that has secured America as the world's greatest power. My  amendment transfers money from Special Operations Command theater  forces, which is already robustly funded, and, instead, invests in the  wars of the future.   As security threats advance and change with weapons of modern war, we  must remember that innovation and development made us number one. We  must invest in programs that prepare our servicemembers to respond to  the threats of the 21st century.
