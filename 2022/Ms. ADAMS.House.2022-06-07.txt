 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and for  his work on this bill. I rise in support of the Improving Access to  Workers' Compensation for Injured Federal Workers Act of 2022, a bill  that I am proud to have cosponsored.   North Carolina is home to over 45,000 Federal employees who are  restricted from having a nurse practitioner or physician assistant  diagnose or oversee the patient's treatment and care for their workers'  compensation claim. North Carolina is one of many States that currently  authorize nurse practitioners to provide this care for non-Federal  employees.   H.R. 6087 will increase patient choice for the tens of thousands of  Federal employees in my State by making the Federal Employees'  Compensation Act consistent with State law.   As chairwoman of the Workforce Protections Subcommittee, I am  disheartened to hear that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle  argue that we are rushing this bill.   H.R. 6087 has gone through the normal legislative order. My  subcommittee held a hearing on this bill in December 2021, and the  Education and Labor Committee held a markup on the bill in March just a  few months ago.   Of note, the bill passed out of committee with a bipartisan,  unanimous voice vote.   This is a commonsense bill, and I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes''  on H.R. 6087.
