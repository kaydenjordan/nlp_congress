 Madam Speaker, you have squandered the inheritance of a  generation today. You have governed with abandon and exchanged  financial assurance for instant gratification.   Today, you didn't pass a budget plan. You passed a death wish for  America. It is easy for you to sit up there and authorize $68 trillion  over the next 10 years because you will never have to shoulder the  financial burden of your actions.   Your road map for our future is a highway to hell. You have exchanged  the American Dream for a socialist nightmare.   To the American people: You have been lied to. Your taxes will be  raised because of the actions of Democrats today.   I shudder to think of what our country, our city on a hill, our  beacon of freedom, will look like in a generation when we deliver a  Nation devoid of treasure to our children.   We will give account one day for our actions in this Congress. Madam  Speaker, if we hand over a bankrupt legacy to our children, your  actions today will be indicted, and you will be without excuse. Madam  Speaker, you are walking around with my generation's checkbook, and we  want it back.                            ____________________
