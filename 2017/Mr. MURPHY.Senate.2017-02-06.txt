 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, let me just express my thanks to all of  those who have facilitated the floor staying open through the evening.  We still have a ways to go. I know that puts a lot of pressure on staff  here and on all of the folks who make this place operate. We thank you  for that. These are, in the minds of many of my constituents, very  exceptional times and they call for exceptional tactics and probably a  few more exceptional moments on the floor of the Senate. I appreciate  everyone here staying through this long evening.   When I was a kid, I took an art class at a little one-room  schoolhouse on Wells Road in my hometown, where I grew up, of  Wethersfield, CT. That little one-room schoolhouse is still there. It  is iconic. It is a part of Wethersfield's history. The town is really  proud of it. There is not a lot that happens in that one-room  schoolhouse any longer.   But once upon a time there was a lot that happened in that one-room  schoolhouse. That is where the kids of Wethersfield, CT, the oldest  town in the State of Connecticut, got their education. You know,  wrapped up in the  [[Page S782]]  identity of this country is this association with those little one-room  schoolhouses that were peppered throughout the landscape of New England  and, indeed, across the country, as our new Nation progressed west.   It symbolizes the deep connection that this country has had with this  very unique idea of public education. I say that as a means of trying  to explain to folks why we are here at 4:20 in the morning, why this  nomination--the nomination of Betsy DeVos for Secretary of Education-- has commanded this kind of exceptional attention, why the switchboards  here at the Capitol have been experiencing a volume never before seen  in the history of this place.   There is a special connection between our constituents and the idea  of public education, because it is rooted in some of the founding  ideals of this country. This country stands for the notion that you can  come from anywhere, you can be of any background, and you will have a  chance to make it here in the United States.   We did not just say that; we lived that value. We built a society in  which people could actually take that idea of succeeding, despite any  built-in impediments they may have faced, and we turned it into a  reality. Public education from the very beginning of this country has  been at the root of that uniquely American idea--the idea that you can  succeed despite any barriers that may have been presented in front of  you by circumstance or by birth.   Public education at the outset was in those one-room schoolhouses.  Everybody packed into one place, all sorts of ages and learning  abilities, and one teacher, normally a female, at the front of the  classroom. But over time, this country adapted. We learned from others.  It was Horace Mann, the famous Massachusetts educator, who borrowed  from ideas that he had found in Prussia and brought to the United  States, the idea of the professionalization of public education, the  professionalization of teachers, the sorting of students into grades,  the idea that it wasn't just enough to put a whole bunch of kids into  one classroom, that we needed to actually think through pedagogy. We  needed to put some time into making sure there were high-quality  teachers and instruction in all of our classrooms.   You can go around the country and find a lot of schools named after  Horace Mann because what we have today springs forth from many of his  ideas, from his commitment to high-quality public education.   The system that he helped create is the one in which many of us grew  up in. I went to public schools in Wethersfield, CT. My mother went to  public schools in Wethersfield, CT. My father went to public schools in  Wethersfield, CT. They met in public schools in Wethersfield, CT. My  wife went to public schools in Fairfield, CT. My kids go to public  school today. So when I try to figure out why my office got 13,000  phone calls and emails with regard to this nomination, I think it is  because public education is so deeply connected to who we feel we are  as a country. We feel we are the most powerful, the most affluent  Nation on Earth because of our unique commitment to public education;  this idea that in order to succeed, you need first to have access to  learning, to the ability to read and write, to do arithmetic, to be  able to think creatively about science and the history of your country  and your people, but also because public education is personal.   When we talk about who we are, when we all think about our own  personal biographies, it starts with where we went to school. Not  everybody went to public school, but the vast majority of people in  this country went to public school.   When you think about who you are today, almost everybody's story runs  through a great public school teacher. The things that you learn that  make you who you are today, they probably come first and foremost from  your parents or from whoever raised you, but, boy, you learn an awful  lot about how to relate to people, about values. You make mistakes; you  correct those mistakes in school, whether it be in the classroom or out  on the playground.   For me, it was my fifth grade teacher Ms. Evanisky, who instilled in  me a love of learning but also a discipline about how to learn. I don't  know that teachers would do this today, but Ms. Evanisky had a list of  all the assignments each week on the chalkboard and had our initials  next to each one we had completed. There were 20 or 30 each week, and  she would erase your initials and move it to the next one. It probably  was a little bit too much of an exercise in public shaming for the kids  who fell behind, but, boy, there was accountability because every day  you walked in, you saw whether you were keeping up with the assignments  that week or you were falling behind. There was a rigor to it that  attracted me and made me a better learner.   There were two male teachers I had in high school and middle school:  Mr. Hansen, my eighth grade social studies teacher, and Mr. Peters, my  junior-year American history teacher, who got me thinking about  government and the effect it has on my life and the life of people  around me.   My family did not have a history of politics or public service. My  love of public service, my interest in government comes from teachers  who inspired me to care about the role people played in our common  history.   So when I think about why I am here today, I think about teachers. I  think first and foremost about my parents, but I think about teachers,  and so do millions of other people around the country.   Our common experiences are rooted in our public schools, and, of  course, it is still personal today for millions and millions of folks  in my State and across the country because they have their kids, as I  do, in public school, and they are seeing the great benefit that comes  to their kids, the growth that happens in our public schools, and the  continued learning that happens for our educators.   Public education is different today than it was when I went. We  learned things, that we can't just focus on teaching basic skills, like  reading, writing, and arithmetic, but today we have to teach other  skills, like social and emotional skills. We are getting better all the  time in public education, and that is why people are so proud of it.   So when presented with a nominee for the Department of Education who  says that public education is a ``dead end'' for students in this  country, people take it personally. It feels different than when they  listen to the nominee for Secretary of the Treasury talk about banks or  when they hear the nominee for Secretary of Health and Human Services  talking about health insurance.   When you say that public schools are a dead end and then, as Mrs.  DeVos has, spend your entire career trying to empty out public schools  and put kids into private schools, it hurts. It hurts because, well, we  all know public schools can be better. We all have our critiques of the  public education we got or the public education our kids have gotten.  We know it is not a dead end.   Public education wasn't a dead end for me. I get to be a U.S. Senator  because of the public education I got. It wasn't a dead end for my  mother, who grew up in the housing projects of New Britain, CT. Because  of the public schools that challenged her as a very poor little girl  growing up in New Britain, she got to be the first woman in her family  to go to college. It wasn't a dead end for my father, who went to  public schools and ended up running one of the biggest companies in  Hartford, CT. And I hope it won't be a dead end for my kids, who are  getting smarter and smarter every single day they go to public schools.   Public schools aren't a dead end. They can always get better. But to  have someone in the Department of Education who doesn't believe in the  way that most public school parents, most public school products  believe in public education, it is offensive, and that is why our  offices have received this unprecedented volume of correspondence.   I represent a pretty small State. Connecticut isn't that big. But I  got 13,000 letters and emails opposing Mrs. DeVos's nomination in a  short period of time. She was only nominated a couple months ago. I  don't know that there is any other subject in the entire time that I  have been in government in which I received more correspondence over a  short period of time like that. I received 13,000 pieces of  correspondence, and almost all of them are in opposition to it.  [[Page S783]]    That is the other thing. There were a few people who called who  support her nomination, but almost without exception, people are  calling in to my office and to Republican offices telling us that she  is not the right fit.         I am writing to you as the mother of two children in       kindergarten and first grade. My son is 5 and is autistic. I       watched the recent nomination hearing on Betsy DeVos, and I       am left sick to my stomach. I implore you to not support this       woman for Secretary of Education.        I am beyond worried at what this might mean for our school       systems, and particularly what this would mean for the       education and development of my son. We fight every single       day for my son. We work for the services he needs. I spent 2       hours on the phone yesterday with health insurance companies       trying to get his occupational therapy covered. With Betsy       DeVos in charge of the public schools, I can't even imagine       the roadblocks we would face.        As a parent, all I want is for my son to grow and develop       and thrive like any other child. It is hard enough doing this       with his disabilities, knowing our President openly mocks       those who are disabled. Please, please, please do not support       his nominee. I fear for my son.    Another piece of correspondence from a college student from Old Lyme,  CT:         I strongly urge you to oppose the Secretary of Education       nominee Betsy DeVos, whose confirmation hearing proved that       she lacks both the experience and qualifications to lead the       Department of Education.        Mrs. DeVos has had no experience in public schools, not as       a student, an educator, an administrator, or even as a       parent. Further, she admittedly has no experience with higher       education or student loans.        I am a student about to earn my undergrad college degree       this spring. I highly suspect that Mrs. DeVos has no interest       in repairing or mending my or my fellow students' colossal       debt problems, nor does she have the intent to alleviate the       strain of other costs on parents and guardians.    I might read some more of these letters, but they are sort of  endless, and they speak to a real worry people in my State have about  Mrs. DeVos's commitment to public education. So let me talk a little  bit about why they are concerned.   They are right to point out that this nominee has really no personal  experience in our public school system. She didn't go to public  schools. Her kids didn't go to public schools. She wasn't a public  school educator. But that is not disqualifying in and of itself. I  mean, all of us work on policy in which we don't have personal  experience. It is the fact that she has spent her entire career and  much of her family's enormous fortune trying to undermine public  education that is so concerning.   Mrs. DeVos, as it has been repeated over and over on this floor, is a  big fan--perhaps the biggest fan in the country--of vouchers, which is  a means of giving students a handful of money so that they can go to a  private school or a nonpublic school.   In theory, there is an attraction to this idea that you should be  able to take that amount of money that we generally allocate to your  education and bring it to a school of your choice. But in practice,  vouchers are a disaster for our kids. Why? Well, first and foremost, it  is because, contrary to what Betsy DeVos and her family believe, the  free market doesn't work the same for education as it does for the  breakfast cereal industry, right? Kids are not free actors in the way  that other consumers are. So what happens is that the parents and the  families who have the means and the income to go find and afford  private school do so. They take that voucher and then they bring it  into the private sector, and the kids and the families who don't have  the means to do that get left behind in underperforming schools, and  the imperative to fix those underperforming schools gradually  disappears.   Well, vouchers are never going to equal the amount of money that it  costs to send a student to most private schools. It may cover the cost  of the cheapest private schools, but families of means take those  vouchers and supplement it with money that they already have and send  their kids to private schools. So vouchers just end up taking wealthier  families and moving those kids into private schools, while leaving  behind kids who don't have parents who can supplement the amount of  money in the voucher to allow those kids to go to private schools. So  vouchers become a means of both economic and racial segregation. White  families or families of higher economic means take the vouchers and  they send their kids to private schools and families with kids of lower  economic means get left behind in lower performing public schools.   Vouchers are a wonderful way to guarantee that you have very little  mixing of kids of different backgrounds or races and incomes, and that  is what the evidence bears out. But vouchers have been used in even  more insidious ways over the years. Think about what has happened to  disabled kids.   In many States, kids with disabilities will be offered a voucher to  go to a private school that may have a basket of services that is more  appropriate for them, but they have to make a deal with the school  district in order to get that voucher. They have to renounce their  legal rights to contest an appropriate education in order to get that  voucher. For many families, that voucher is a very shiny object that  looks like their salvation, but then, when they get to that voucher  school and find out they are in fact not getting the services they  thought they were going to get for their child--maybe because that  school is being run by a for-profit company and they don't have that  child's education in their best interests, and they have profit motives  as their driving imperative--the parent can't exercise their rights  under Federal law because they signed them away in order to get the  voucher.   In States like Florida, this happens tens of thousands of times over,  where low-income, disabled kids sign away their right to contest  services that are guaranteed to them in order to get a voucher, only to  find that when they get to that school, the services they were promised  aren't there and now they have no legal ability to try to get those  services. The rug is pulled out from under them. They are left with no  protection. So vouchers have been used in terribly insidious ways to  take from students and families rights that wealthier families that  don't need to rely on the voucher would never sign away.   So it is not that Democrats oppose Mrs. DeVos's nomination because we  don't like charter schools. Frankly, it is not because many of us don't  support school choice. I don't have any problem with public school  choice done right. I don't have any problem with charter schools. In  fact, I have a long history of supporting high quality charter schools.  What we oppose is a voucher system that dramatically underfunds  education and that requires students to lose or sign away their right  to get a quality education.   Further, we oppose voucher systems that just end up taking public  dollars and putting them in the hands of Wall Street. What is  exceptional about Mrs. DeVos's experience in Michigan, what makes it  different, frankly, from the experience of charter schools in  Connecticut, is that in Michigan charter schools are by and large run  by for-profit companies. Let me tell you, the operators of for-profit  charters, I am sure, have the best interests of those kids in mind, but  the investors in those for-profit charter schools have profit as their  primary motivation. The people telling those administrators what to do  have investor returns first on their mind and educational returns for  the kids second, because if they didn't, they would be a nonprofit  charter school. If your primary mission was to run schools for the  benefit of kids, you would be a nonprofit. The reason you set yourself  up as a for-profit is so you could make money. I don't know why any  school is operated on a for-profit basis. But in Michigan, 80 percent  of charters are owned by for-profit operators. We have seen what has  happened in the higher education States. We have seen the fraud that is  perpetuated on students because for-profit colleges have as their  primary motivation making as much money as possible, not the education  of kids. So vouchers, underfunded, tied to the denial of rights for  disabled kids, and established as a means of enrichment for investors  in for-profit companies are a terrible idea.   But students, parents, and teachers in Connecticut are concerned  about Mrs. DeVos's nomination for other reasons as well. I wish that  every minority kid and every disabled kid and every poor kid in this  country got a fair shot, but that is not how education is played out.  The Federal Government is involved in education for one primary reason  and that is civil rights.  [[Page S784]]  The whole reason that the Federal Government got into the business of  education is because children--primarily minority children, primarily  black children--were being denied an equal education. So in Brown v.  Board of Education, it was held that separate education is unequal  education, and in a series of civil rights acts following that  decision, the Federal Government established laws to protect children  and their parents from that kind of unjustifiable racist  discrimination.   It happened in schools all over this country. Black kids were not  given an equal education. Even after the schools were desegregated,  States and municipalities found ways around the legal requirements to  give an unequal education to minority kids.   Here is a news flash for you. Racism hasn't vanished in this country.  Discrimination has not been defeated. We are watching the President  today pry on people's prejudices as a means of dividing this country to  his benefit. All across this country you can see examples of sometimes  intentional discrimination and other times unintentional subconscious  discrimination that continues to happen all over the United States,  like what happens in school discipline. If you are an African-American  boy in this country and you goof off at school, you are twice as  likely, right now as we speak, to be suspended or expelled than if a  White student engages in the exact same behavior. Disabled students all  across this country are discriminated against.    I will give you an example from not so long ago in Texas. In Texas,  an investigation by the Houston Chronicle discovered that the Texas  Education Agency had arbitrarily decided that only 8.5 percent of  students would get special education services. No matter if the school  district had a higher percentage of kids with disabilities, the Texas  Education Agency said that only 8.5 percent of students in any  particular school district can get special education services. What  happened? Kids all across the State who were disabled were denied the  services that they needed.   In Kentucky, just 2 years ago, an autistic 16-year-old named Brennen  was severely injured, with both his legs broken when he was restrained  at school. An investigation found that he suffered two broken femurs, a  partially collapsed lung, and blood loss. He spent 8 days in an  intensive care unit. An investigation found out that over the past 2  years, nearly 8,000 students in one county in Kentucky had been  physically restrained, and 150 of them in this one county had been  badly injured. That is just one example of what happens to disabled  students all across this country. They get secluded and locked into  chains and ropes, literally, as a means of trying to control their  behavior. That doesn't work. That is by and large illegal, but it  happens because still today minority kids, disabled kids, and poor kids  don't have the political power that other school children have. Their  parents might not be as loud as other parents are, and so they get  intentionally or unintentionally discriminatory treatment.   That is why, at the Federal level, we have a history of requiring  that States provide equal education to minority kids, disabled kids,  and poor kids. That was a bipartisan commitment in the No Child Left  Behind law. It continues to be a bipartisan commitment in the new  education law we passed. Republicans and Democrats voted for a bill  that holds schools accountable for equal outcomes, equal opportunity  for every kid.   Now we dramatically amended that accountability requirement in the  new law. We recognized that it probably didn't make sense for  Washington to decide how you measure accountability and how you  intervene in schools where you are not getting results for those  vulnerable populations, but we still require that every State have an  accountability regime. Republicans and Democrats both voted for that. I  sponsored the amendment with Senator Portman that put that  accountability section into the bill.   Another reason that parents and students in Connecticut are deeply  worried about Mrs. DeVos's nomination is because she has a history of  fighting accountability. In Michigan, she fought a State law that would  have made all schools in that State--whether they be public, private,  charter, or traditional--accountable for their results. When questioned  before the Education Committee about her position on accountability by  Senator Kaine, who just finished speaking, her answers were bizarre.   Senator Kaine: ``Will you insist upon equal accountability in any K- 12 school or educational program that receives Federal funding whether  public, public charter, or private?''   Here is the easy answer to that question: Yes.   That is not a gotcha question. I know folks have said that the  Democrats were trying to embarrass Mrs. DeVos in the hearing, but that  is an easy question.   Will you support equal accountability in any K-12 school that  receives Federal funding--public, public charter, or private? The  answer to that question is yes. But she says: ``I support  accountability.''   OK. That is not as good, but maybe it is heading in the right  direction.   ``Equal accountability for all schools that receive Federal  funding?'' asks Senator Kaine.   ``I support accountability,'' she says.   Senator Kaine is sort of figuring out that this might be an evasion  rather than an answer. He says: ``Is that a yes or no?''   ``I support accountability.''   Senator Kaine: ``Do you not want to answer my question?''   ``I support accountability.''   ``OK, let me ask you this. I think all schools that receive taxpayer  funding should be equally accountable. Do you agree with me or not?''   ``Well, they're not today.''   ``But I think they should. Do you agree with me or not?''   ``Well, no.''   So at the end of that line of questioning, Senator Kaine finally gets  his answer--that Betsy DeVos does not support equal accountability for  public, public charter, or private schools. That isn't surprising  because she didn't support equal accountability when she was pushing  for private charter schools in Michigan.   (Mr. JOHNSON assumed the Chair.)   Mr. President, that has devastating consequences for our children, to  have a Secretary of Education who is not going to require  accountability for results in schools, regardless of how they are  established. It has devastating consequences for poor kids, Black kids,  Hispanic kids, and disabled kids who need in a Secretary of Education a  champion for them, not someone who advertises in her committee meeting  who is not going to fight for accountability in our schools.   Frankly, I am friends with some of the operators of charter schools  in and around Connecticut. In my experience, the supporters of charter  schools have tended to be the loudest champions of accountability  because for many charter school proponents, they go hand in hand.  Accountability gives you sort of a clearer sense of the outcomes in  public schools, which for charter school advocates tends to be an  advertisement for an alternative way of education.    So charter schools, even those that are regularly critical of the  public schools, like Mrs. DeVos, normally argue for accountability, but  not Betsy DeVos. She has a long career of opposing accountability. And  if you look at an examination of the charter schools that she has  supported, you can figure out why. Her charter schools aren't very  good. If they had to be measured on equal footing with public schools  in Michigan, the results would not be an advertisement for her or for  her nomination to be Secretary of Education.   In Michigan, they have set up a Byzantine system in which there are  like 30 different regulators of charter schools, all with a confusing  array of different ways that they measure performance. There is no way  in Michigan to pull out data about how disabled students are doing on a  school-by-school basis. They intentionally obfuscate the results of  charter schools. Why? Because many of them--many of those associated  with Mrs. DeVos--are not getting good results for their kids. That  doesn't mean charter schools can't get good results; many of them can.  But if you don't have accountability, if you don't require charter  schools to prove they are doing good for kids, then many of the bad  ones will continue to provide low-quality results without any  accountability.   So many of the parents in my State are very concerned about Betsy  DeVos  [[Page S785]]  when it comes to whether she is going to stick up for disabled students  and low-income students.   I asked her specifically whether she would keep on the books a  regulation that was passed at the end of last year which gives guidance  for States on how they develop these accountability regimes for  vulnerable populations. Again, this was an easy answer because  everybody in the educational space supports this regulation-- superintendents, principals, teachers, parent groups, civil rights  groups, groups representing the disabled. Frankly, it was a Herculean  task for then-Secretary John King to come up with an accountability  framework that all those groups would support, but they all support it.   So I asked Mrs. DeVos in the hearing would she work to implement that  regulation or would she work to undermine it, and she gave me no  answer. She certainly refused to commit to implement that regulation  which, by the way, is supported by everybody in the educational space.  Undoing it would be a giant headache for everybody who works in  education. Nobody wants it undone. Yet she would not commit to keeping  it in place.   Then I asked her another super simple no-brainer when we submitted  written questions. I just said: Would you support the maintenance of  the civil rights data collection system? This is like once every 2  years, you have to report data on the performance of your minority kids  in your State's schools. Once every 2 years, you have to submit this  report, and it is very important because it is one of the only ways the  Federal Office of Civil Rights and the Department of Education can  figure out if minority kids--Black kids, Hispanic kids, Native  Americans--are getting a raw deal. She wouldn't even commit to  maintaining the data collection, never mind do anything with it.   So at some point, you have to figure out that where there is smoke,  there is fire. She has been given all of these opportunities to say: I  am going to be a champion for disabled kids. I am going to stand up for  minority kids. I am going to make sure that every child, no matter  their race, no matter their religion, no matter their learning ability,  gets an equal education. Every time she was given an opportunity to set  the record straight, she obfuscated, she fudged, she clouded.   When she got a question about the Individuals With Disabilities  Education Act, she didn't seem to know what it was. So maybe that is  why the answers were fuzzy when it came to protecting students with  disabilities--she didn't know what the law was. Maybe if she was asked  specific questions about the accountability framework that demands  results for minority kids, she would have given a similar answer  because she might not have known what that was, either.   If you are going to be Secretary of Education, you need to have a  moral commitment to protect these kids, but at the very least you have  to know what the Federal laws are that provide those protections. Over  and over again, she was given the chance to show that moral commitment;  she did not. And in that hearing, she showed a troubling lack of  knowledge about the statutes that protect those children. The Secretary  of Education, more than anybody else in this country, is responsible  for delivering results for our kids. The Federal Government is not in  education, except for the cause of civil rights.    Finally, I wish to speak about what was, to me, maybe the most  troubling answer she gave in that hearing. We had 5 minutes to question  this witness. We had 5 minutes. I worked pretty hard to become a U.S.  Senator. My constituents think this is a pretty important job. I was  given 5 minutes to ask questions of the next Secretary of the  Department of Education--the person who is going to be in charge of the  thousands upon thousands of public schools in this country. There is no  precedent in this committee--the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions  Committee--for Senators being cut off, being denied questions when they  have them.   We spent a lot of time in the committee hearing arguing over how much  time we were going to get to question Mrs. DeVos, and it became pretty  apparent why Senator Alexander was restricting questioning as the  hearing went on. This was a nominee who was simply not qualified. This  was a nominee who was not ready for this hearing, who is not ready to  be Secretary of Education. I had a wonderful meeting with Mrs. DeVos.  She is a nice person, but she is not qualified to be Secretary of  Education. Senator Alexander knew that. What I gather is that Senator  Alexander sat down with her, figured out that she was not qualified,  knew that she was not going to perform well, and came into that hearing  with the specific intention of limiting our questions, because as the  hearing went on, it got worse and worse.   I really wanted to ask questions about protecting disabled kids and  low-income kids, so I had planned to ask all of my questions about  whether she was prepared to stick up for those kids. She gave very  short answers to my questions that, as I said, didn't give me any  confidence that she is going to stand up for those children.   When I looked down at my clock, I still had 30 seconds left. I only  had 5 minutes, so I better use all of my time. So I asked her what I  thought was a no-brainer. I asked her whether she thought guns should  be in schools. She probably should have known that question was coming  from me. I wasn't intending on asking it, but my public service is  defined by what happened in Sandy Hook, CT, in December of 2012. And  she knows she is going to work for a President who has promised to ban  States' and local districts' ability to keep guns out of schools. And  so her answer, which has now been replayed on the Internet a million  times, was shocking.   First, her inability just to plug in to the emotion of this issue.  The first thing you should say in response to that question is, our No.  1 obligation as education policy professionals is to keep kids safe.  Start there. Start with a commonality about our obligation to keep kids  safe. But that is not where she started. She started by saying: Well,  that is really up to the States and the local school districts.   The reason she gave for that is now infamous--that some schools in  this country need to be protected against grizzly bear attacks. It is  probably unfair how much attention that response was given; she sort of  came up with it on the spur of the moment. I don't suggest that it  reflects her full thinking on the subject of guns in schools. But she  then immediately contradicted her answer. Her first answer was that  really should be up to States and local school districts, so I asked  her the next logical question: Well, if President Trump asked you to  implement his proposal to ban local school districts' and States'  ability to decide for themselves as to whether they want guns in  schools, would you support it? She said: I would support whatever he  did, whatever he asked me to do.   So on the one hand, she says it should be up to States and local  school districts whether they have guns in the classroom, and then on  the other hand, she says that she would support a Federal prohibition  on gun-free school zones. You can't have it both ways.   Much of the outpouring of opposition from Connecticut is due to the  answer she gave to that question.   Parents in Sandy Hook, CT, can't understand--can't understand--how a  Secretary of Education could think that putting guns in our schools  would make our schools safer. This idea the right has--and the folks  the DeVos family hang around with--that if you just load up our  communities with guns, it will guarantee that the good guys will  eventually shoot the bad guys has no basis in evidence. Routinely, guns  that the good guys have to protect against the bad guys get used to  shoot the good guys, and even when guns are around when bad stuff goes  down, they don't get used to shoot the bad guys. Parents and teachers  in this country are freaked out that we would have a Secretary of  Education who would promote arming our schools.   Although at the end of that short back-and-forth between Mrs. DeVos  and me, she did admit that kids getting killed in schools was a bad  thing, suggesting that schools need to be armed in order to protect  against wild animal attacks doesn't suggest that is on the top of your  mind.   How deeply offensive that answer was to families like those in Sandy  Hook who have gone through these tragedies and who know that the answer  is not to  [[Page S786]]  arm principals and administrators and teachers with high-powered  weapons so they can engage in a shootout inside a school.   Even that school in Wyoming that she referenced noted within 24 hours  that they didn't feel like they needed a gun to protect against grizzly  bears. They had a fence and they had bear spray and that was good  enough.   I admit, she has gotten probably a little bit too much grief for that  particular answer, but it capped off her performance in that hearing  that was disqualifying; that showed a lack of interest in protecting  vulnerable kids--poor kids, Black kids, Hispanic kids, disabled kids;  showed a stunning unfamiliarity with the laws that govern education;  demonstrated an enthusiasm for market-based principles in public  education that simply don't work; showed a disregard for the danger of  profit motivation driving decisions in education; and uncovered some  incredibly dangerous positions that we had not previously known about,  like her enthusiasm for putting guns in schools. That is why 13,000  people in my little State of Connecticut sent letters and emails and  made phone calls in opposition to her nomination.   I had a really nice meeting with Mrs. DeVos in my office. I concede  that she could have spent her money and her time--she has a lot of  money--on something other than trying to make schools better.   So I give her credit. I give her a lot of credit for the fact that  she spent much of her fortune and put a lot of time into making kids'  education better. But that is not a qualification alone. Being rich and  spending your money for a good cause doesn't automatically qualify you  to be in the Cabinet.   Despite those good intentions, over and over again, Mrs. DeVos has  shown she is willing, with her time and money and with her advocacy, to  make good on her belief that public schools are a dead end, to empty  out our public schools of money and students, to use taxpayer funds to  enrich for-profit investors, and to leave behind millions and millions  of vulnerable kids who need a champion in the Department of Education.   Public schools were not a dead end for me. Public schools were not a  dead end for my parents. Public schools were not a dead end for my  wife. I am sure, having only watched my kids progress through second  grade and pre-K, that public schools will not be a dead end for my  children. But to have a Secretary of Education who doesn't believe the  public schools that are going to be under her charge can lead to  results for our kids like they have for generations is unacceptable. It  is why this body in a bipartisan way should rise up and say no to her  nomination and ask this President to appoint someone who is going to be  a daily champion of our public schools and not use the Department of  Education to undermine them.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, as I began last night at 4 in the  morning--  [[Page S899]]  now 5:30--I thank the staff, both the nonpartisan staff and those in  the majority and minority for enduring another late night. These are  exceptional times. Thus we are here again in the early, early morning  to talk about a nomination to the President's Cabinet.   This is my first time on the floor since Senator Warren was gaveled  down last evening. Let me just speak for a moment about my deep, deep  disappointment at the events of early last evening. I want to put this  in the context of the political moment that we are living in.   We have a President of the United States today who is a bully, who is  using his office to try to stifle and quell debate. If you dare oppose  him--frankly, whether you are a Republican or a Democrat--you are going  to be called names, you are going to be mocked in an effort to try to  silence you.   In the last week, we have seen President Trump attempt this tactic on  members of the judiciary. When he got a ruling he didn't like from a  judge in Washington that temporarily halted his ban on Muslims entering  the country, he started personally attacking this judge, sending a  signal to those in the judicial branch that, if you dare oppose him,  you are going to be singled out for ridicule.   The President of the United States is going to try to destroy your  reputation and your career as a judge, as a jurist, as an impartial  arbiter of the law if you rule against his political interests. It is  an exceptional moment. It is an exceptional moment in which the  President of the United States is trying to bully judges into ruling in  his favor. It is an exceptional moment, though we have been watching it  for the last 2 years, in which the President is trying to bully Members  of Congress to cow to his interests.   I want to be very careful about how I talk about this because I have  great respect for the parliamentary rulings of this body. But I don't  understand why our majority leader chose to gavel down Senator Warren  when she was simply reading a letter from Coretta Scott King.   We celebrate the legacy of Martin Luther King with a holiday every  year in this country. In the pantheon of individual greatness in the  United States of America, it doesn't get any higher than Martin Luther  King. His widow wrote us a letter expressing her objections to the  nomination of Jeff Sessions based upon the belief that he would not  live up to the legacy of her husband and his work in civil rights.   Nothing could be more relevant to this discussion than the opinion of  a member of Martin Luther King's family on whether or not this nominee  was going to enforce appropriately, vigorously the civil rights laws of  this Nation, and Senator Warren was silenced.   Now, I don't know what the motive was, and it certainly would be  inappropriate for me to guess at it. But the effect of the majority  leader's action is to stifle debate, to make it less likely that  Members of the Democratic minority will raise objections to Senator  Sessions' nomination and record objections as to his conduct.   I am not trying to equate what happened here last night with what our  President has done, but there is a practice now. There is a pattern of  behavior among Republicans, trying to stifle and quell opposition to  this President. The President uses the bullying power of Twitter, and  the majority leader now is twisting the rules of the Senate.   I say that because, while it may be true that technically the rules  of the Senate don't allow you to talk about the conduct of a fellow  Senator, how on Earth can you debate a nominee from this body to the  Cabinet without questioning their conduct?   So technically, the rule may say that you cannot talk about the  conduct of a fellow Senator, but how on Earth can this body operate  when Members of it are nominated to important positions if we cannot  talk about the conduct of fellow Members and we cannot criticize the  conduct of fellow Members?   Now, I appreciate the fact that Senator Merkley was able to come down  to the floor and read the full letter into the Record overnight. I  appreciate the fact that Senator Booker was able to read into the  Record testimony from another civil rights hero, John Lewis, without  being similarly gaveled down for his conduct.   But this effort, this continued effort to try to stop people who  oppose President Trump and his agenda from speaking truth to power is  not right. It is not right. And it will, frankly, have the opposite  effect.   You have seen what happened overnight on our side. We are not going  to stop talking about Senator Sessions' record and how we believe it is  disqualifying for his nomination for Attorney General. The protests and  the numbers of people gathering around the country to object to the  policies of President Trump are getting bigger and bigger the more that  he bullies and bullies. This isn't going to work.   So I am going to speak to Senator Sessions' record. I am going to  speak to how I believe it does not qualify him to be Attorney General,  and that doesn't mean that I don't have great respect for him. I have  worked with Senator Sessions on a number of issues. But if I can't talk  about Senator Sessions' record, if I can't talk about his conduct as a  Senator, as it relates to whether or not he can be the chief law  enforcement official in this country, then there is no use in having  this debate at all.   Senator Sessions has publicly called the Voting Rights Act intrusive.  In response to the Supreme Court's 2013 decision in Shelby County, AL,  v. Holder, which gutted section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, Senator  Sessions called it a good thing for the South.   That decision made it vastly more difficult for the Federal  Government to protect individuals from racial discrimination in voting.  The Supreme Court effectively substituted their political judgment on  the status of racism in America for the judgment of this Congress.  Effectively, the Supreme Court was saying in that decision that in our  belief, racism is no longer a problem in the way that it was when the  Voting Rights Act was passed, and, thus, there is no longer an  imperative for section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, which allows for the  Federal Government to oversee the voting laws of a select number of  counties with patterns of racial discrimination.   That was an absurd ruling.   I have great respect for the members of the Supreme Court, but they  live inside the ivory-ensconced marble of the Supreme Court chamber.  They don't have experience on the ground, like the elected Members of  this body do, to understand the reality of racism in America today. I  wish it were gone, but it is not. Blacks and Hispanics are still  discriminated against.   You just have to look to see what happened in North Carolina to  understand the truth of that. North Carolina passed a number of laws  which, on their face, they argued were not discriminatory. They were  just, in their words, voter protections, buffers against voter  fraud. And then, when we read the correspondence of the members of the  State legislature to pass that law, what we learned is that they were  specifically intended to try to stop African Americans from voting. The  people who were passing those laws were talking to each other trying to  figure out how they could most effectively target laws to stop African  Americans from voting. That was their clear intent, even though they  argue that there was no racial bias implicit in the passage of that  law.    Racism is not dead in America. You don't wash away discrimination in  just one generation--a generation and a half, maybe--after laws that  separated the races with respect to public accommodations and  restaurants and drinking fountains and bathrooms. That doesn't just  vanish in one generation later. Everybody understands that.   Poll after poll will show you that there are still people in this  country who believe that African Americans and Hispanics are inferior.  I wish it weren't the case, but it still is. So we still need the  Voting Rights Act. We still need the Civil Rights Act. And we are about  to vote on a nominee to be Attorney General who calls the Voting Rights  Act intrusive, who says that a Supreme Court decision that guts the  Voting Rights Act is ``a good thing for the South.'' It is not a good  thing for African Americans in the South. It is not a good thing for  Hispanics in the South. It may be a good thing for the people who wrote  those discriminatory laws, but it is not a good thing for those who are  trying to vote who have  [[Page S900]]  witnessed and lived through decades of discrimination.   Let me talk about Senator Sessions' record on immigration. In 2007,  Senator Sessions referred to a comprehensive immigration reform bill as  ``terrorist assistance.'' He has been a leading voice in Congress in  arguing against immigration reform. In two decades in the Senate,  Senator Sessions has opposed every single immigration bill that has  included a pathway to citizenship. He has favored, similar to President  Trump, an ideological test for admission to the United States. He said  this:         Immigration policy must be guided by our understanding that       western society is unique and special. Our values, our rules,       our traditions are what make our society succeed where others       fail. It is necessary and proper to choose who among the       world's 7 billion people will be granted the high honor of       immigration to the United States on the basis of confidence       that they share our values.    That is a radical idea. Why don't we think about that for a second.  The Attorney General of the United States will make important decisions  about the enforcement of immigration law in this country. Much of what  happens in immigration policy happens in the Department of Homeland  Security, but the Attorney General makes important decisions about  upholding the law on immigration policy, and we are about to vote to  confirm a Member of this body who has said that there should be an  ideological test for admission to the United States and that you have  to share our values. I don't know what that means, but the greatness of  the United States is based on the fact that we have been able to bring  people from a variety of different backgrounds, a variety of different  value sets, a variety of different religions--bring them into this  country and allow them to keep part of their heritage, part of their  belief system from the places they came from, whether they be Ireland  or England or China or Mexico, and then also assimilate into the whole  and adopt part of this country's short history of tradition over the  last 240 years. What makes America great is that we allow people to  bring values different from ours into this country, which in turn  strengthens our collective set of values. We are constantly challenging  ourselves with new ideas, with new perspectives.   Senator Sessions has been an opponent of Delayed Action for Childhood  Arrivals policy. This is commonly referred to as DACA--the idea that if  you are a child who came to this country when you were very young,  knowing nothing other than the United States, an American in name if  not legal status, then you should be able to stay in this country. It  is cruel and inhumane to take a young man or woman who came to this  country when they were 3 or 4 years old and send them back to their  country of birth, and I think Democrats and Republicans of goodwill  generally agree, if not on the broad aspects of the pathway to  citizenship, that for these kids, these DREAMers as they call them,  they should be able to stay in the United States. Senator Sessions has  vigorously opposed this policy and many DACA-protected immigrants now  fear deportation under a Department of Justice that is led by Senator  Sessions.   His conduct tells us that he opposes protections for young men and  women who know nothing other than the United States and want simply to  have a shot with the American dream. That conduct is relevant to  whether he is qualified to be Attorney General.   On criminal justice reform, Senator Sessions has personally blocked  the Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act, which is a bipartisan effort  spearheaded by Senators Grassley, Lee, Cornyn, and Speaker of the House  Paul Ryan. As Attorney General, Senator Sessions will have the power to  direct Federal prosecutors throughout the country to pursue the  harshest penalties possible for even low-level drug offenses, a step  that would further exacerbate our national record of incarcerating  nonviolent offenders, the vast majority of whom can be successfully  treated at far lower cost to society with appropriate health care  treatment for their addiction or mental illness. Senator Sessions'  conduct in this body has been to oppose efforts to try to treat with  more compassion and commonsense offenders in this country who would be  better served through treatment than through incarceration, so it is  relevant to his nomination to be Attorney General where he will have  broad discretion to lock up people for low-level offenses.   In Connecticut, we made the decision to divert people who are  convicted of crimes but have serious mental illness or addiction into  treatment. We have made the decision to reserve our prison system for  the worst of the worst, mainly for violent offenders, for those who are  convicted of serious crimes.   Connecticut has seen its prison population fall to a 20-year low. On  September 3, 2016, the prison population in Connecticut dropped below  15,000 for the first time since January of 1997. At the same time,  rates of reported violent crimes have plummeted in Connecticut. So the  proof is in the pudding in my State. My State has reduced its prison  population and at the same time has reduced its level of violent crime  and many States can tell the same story. Yet we can predict through his  record on the floor of the U.S. Senate that Senator Sessions may use  his power as Attorney General to reverse that trend line and lock up  more of my constituents, which I would argue will have an upward effect  on the rates of violent crime. Why? Because those individuals, having  gone through the process of incarceration and coming out unreformed,  untreated, will be no less of a danger to society.   Finally, I want to talk about the issue of gun violence in this  country. Obviously this is very personal to me, still watching the  community of Newtown spiral through ripples of grief associated with  the trauma of December of 2012. Senator Sessions and I clearly have  differences about the way in which the Federal Government should  restrict the flow of firearms in this country.   You know, it has to be relevant to the decision that I make. This is  the chief law enforcement official of this country, so the views on  firearms are relevant. Whether or not the Attorney General has the  discretion to make policy on the issue of what firearms are legal and  what aren't or what sales are subject to background checks and what  aren't, there is a bully pulpit associated with the chief law  enforcement official that carries weight, so Senator Sessions' beliefs  on firearms policy are relevant. His record and his conduct in the U.S.  Senate on the question of gun violence is relevant as to whether he  should be our next Attorney General. Senator Sessions has lined up with  the gun lobby over and over again against commonsense reform of our gun  laws that are supported by 90 percent of Americans.   He has voted against expanding background checks to cover sales at  gun shows or online. He has voted against a bipartisan effort in the  Senate to make sure that if you are on the terrorist watch list that  you cannot purchase a weapon. He has voted against efforts to try to  restrict sales of high capacity magazines and assault weapons, the  kinds of magazines and the kinds of weapons that were used in the  horrific crime in Sandy Hook. What Senator Sessions has said is that,  if he were confirmed, he would take on the rising homicide rates in  some American cities by working against illegal firearms use. He has  pledged that he will enforce the law. Yet, again, coming back to his  conduct and his record in this body, he has been part of an effort to  try to strip from the Department of Justice and its appendages the  tools they need in order to enforce the law. Every year we have on our  appropriations bills riders that specifically stop the ATF from  enforcing existing law. We restrict their ability to do inventories of  gun dealers. We prohibit them from keeping modern databases on gun  sales across the country.   The policy that Senator Sessions has backed and voted for in this  body runs contrary to the statements that he has made. He has supported  efforts to rob from the Department of Justice the ability to enforce  the existing law on guns, yet he says when he gets there that he is  going to use all efforts to enforce the law. Further, he has opposed  efforts to give new tools to the Department of Justice to try to keep  our streets safer. Shortly after Sandy Hook, he specifically debated on  this floor legislation that would make it a Federal crime to traffic in  illegal guns. I don't know how much less controversial you can get when  it comes to gun policy. We all agree that you shouldn't  [[Page S901]]  be able to walk into a store, buy guns, say they are for you, and then  go out on to the streets and sell them to criminals. It happens all the  time in our cities.   Somebody goes and buys a mess of guns at a gun store or gun show and  then goes into a city and sells them out of a trunk of a car to  criminals who couldn't otherwise go buy these guns because of their  criminal background.   So we proposed a simple Federal law that would make it a Federal  crime to do that, and you need that, because States can't enforce that  on a State by State basis because these guns are often trafficked  across State lines. Senator Sessions voted against that. He is not  going to be a champion for enforcing the gun laws of this Nation. His  record is not going to magically transform when he becomes Attorney  General. I have great respect for Senator Sessions, but he has been a  chief opponent of making the gun laws of this country more amenable to  proper and appropriate and efficient enforcement, and that is not going  to change when he becomes Attorney General.   So I am going to vote against his nomination later today, and I  encourage my colleagues to do so as well. His record on civil rights,  on criminal justice, on immigration, and on gun policy do not qualify  him to be Attorney General.   I am deeply sad about what happened here last night with respect to  the letter read into the Record by Senator Warren. I understand that  things seem to be breaking down a little bit in this Chamber, that  nerves are frayed and people are acting in ways that maybe they  wouldn't have acted a few years ago. These are exceptional times. I  have never seen a President like this, trying to divide us from each  other, using his position to bully and intimidate his political  opponents. Raving about a brutal dictator in Moscow who murders people.  We have never seen a moment like this. We should be really careful that  we don't model that behavior here in the Senate.   What makes me sad is that it looked to me like that is what  happened--that in this body the majority party tried to use the rules  of the Senate in order to bully Members of the minority into silence.  It is not going to work. If we want to get back to being able to  function as a body, then we better be OK with being able to have some  open, honest conversations about the future of this country and the  future of this body.   I am going to vote against Senator Sessions today. That doesn't mean  that I haven't enjoyed working with him on a number of subjects, but he  is not the right person to be Attorney General--not close, frankly--and  I hope that over the course of the day my colleagues continue to talk  about his conduct, continue to talk about his record, and continue to  explain why it does not qualify him in any way, shape, or form to be  the chief law enforcement official in this country.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
