 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in response to Biden's State of  the Union Address.   As a reminder, I do not wish failure upon any sitting President.  Whether it is a Republican or Democrat, their success is our success,  and when we wish for their failure, then the Nation fails.   We have had 2 years of one-party rule in the White House, in the  Senate, and in the House. In those 2 very short years, we watched our  thriving economy steer in the opposite direction.   American households cannot afford food and gas. Our wages are failing  to keep up with inflation that continues to increase.   Since the President took office, we as a Nation watched the average  gas price go from $2.39 to our current average of $3.45. However, on  day one of Biden's Presidency, he killed the Keystone XL pipeline,  which could have been supplying 830,000 barrels per day from Canada to  U.S. refineries, and depleted our Strategic Petroleum Reserve to its  lowest level since 1984.   Another item that President Biden failed to address was the  catastrophic withdrawal from Afghanistan. As a result, 13 brave  servicemembers lost their lives, and the Taliban have now taken back  control of Afghanistan.                            ____________________
