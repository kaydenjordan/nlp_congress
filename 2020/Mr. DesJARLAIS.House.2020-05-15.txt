 Madam Speaker, as a result of my physician's  recommendation to avoid travel as a result of recent knee replacement  surgery, I was unable to be in the chamber for votes today. Had I been  present, I would have voted ``nay'' on rollcall No. 105: Previous  Question H. Res. 967, ``nay'' on rollcall No. 106: Passage H. Res. 967,  ``nay'' on rollcall No. 107: Passage H. Res. 965, ``yea'' on rollcall  No. 108: Motion to Recommit H.R. 6800, and ``nay'' on rollcall No. 109:  Passage H.R. 6800.                            ____________________
