 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, Ralph Waldo Emerson once wrote: The  purpose of life is . . . to be useful, to be honorable, to be  compassionate, to have it make some difference that you lived and lived  well. It is not the length of life, but the depth of life that matters.   In that spirit, I rise today to bid farewell to a member of my team,  Matt  [[Page S5103]]  Squeri, who is one of the most useful, honorable, compassionate people  I have ever worked with, and his public service has made a difference  in the lives of so many, including the lives some of the most  vulnerable people around the world.   Not only do I want to thank him for the length of his service in the  Senate, I want to thank him for the depth of his service. Matt joined  my team in 2019 after several years working for our former colleague  Senator Heidi Heitkamp and, before that, the Department of Defense and  the Center For Strategic and International Studies.   His legislative skill and his policy expertise were immediately  evident. What took a little longer to emerge was his encyclopedic  knowledge of college football--especially for our shared alma mater,  Stanford--not to mention his love for watching boxing.   For those of you who know Matt, that might sound surprising. But if  you have worked with him, it makes perfect sense because, if the cause  is worthwhile, if it is for democracy, if it is for justice, if it is  for human rights, then Matt loves a good fight. He doesn't crash in,  like a brawler. He works methodically, like a boxer.    A great example of that was early on, when negotiations on a bill had  been stuck in a stalemate with the House for months and months. We had  gone round and round with the House, and then Matt went to work. He  floated over conflicts, he parried the problems, and, within 2 months,  he knocked it out and passed it into law.   He has taken on much bigger fights since then. After joining my team  he set out to cultivate working relationships with the staff of Members  on both sides of the aisle of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee  and the Congressional-Executive Commission on China. His goal was  simple: to turn the CECC's--Congressional-Executive Commission on  China--research, advocacy, and awareness-raising into bipartisan  legislation and new laws that would make a real difference for real  people.   In 2019, as the Chinese Government began its brutal crackdown on Hong  Kong, Matt led our successful efforts to protect Hong Kong's people by  banning the export of crowd control equipment to the Hong Kong police.   Soon, he took on an even more ambitious project: tackling the problem  of the genocide of the Uighur people and their forced labor in Xinjiang  Province.   He helped coordinate with the CECC the release of a landmark report  in March 2020. That report became the launching point for passing some  of the most ambitious human rights legislation the United States has  ever considered, the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act.   The premise of the bill was quite simple: The American consumers have  the right to know if their products are made with forced labor in  China, and they have the right to choose not to do business with those  companies.   Matt officially joined the CECC staff in 2021, and he was central to  the negotiations that began in committee in January and continued all  the way to final passage in December.   And he didn't stop there. He pushed the Olympics and the NBA to stop  using uniforms made by--or made from materials made by--forced labor in  China.   China, multinational corporations, the Olympics, the NBA--you see  what I mean about him not shying away from a fight. And, since then, he  has helped us hold hearings, introduce legislation, and improve  policies to protect the people of Hong Kong, the people of Tibet, the  Uighur people, and to stand up to the Chinese Government's  transnational repression.   There is a lot more I could say about Matt's work on legislation.  What stands out to me though and to everyone who knows Matt is just how  wonderful he is to work with. As one of my senior staff said about  starting in our office, ``Matt was the person I looked up to, the  person I wanted to emulate.''   He is fun, he is unflappable, he is morally clear, and he is  legislatively masterful. And he is generous with his time, whether he  is helpful to those new to our team in learning their way around or  helping them understand complex human rights issues in far corners of  the world. We will miss having him as part of our team.   I quoted Emerson at the start of these remarks. Later, in the same  piece, Emerson wrote:         [T]o leave the world a bit better, whether by a healthy       child, a garden patch, or a redeemed social condition; to       know even one life has breathed easier because you lived.       This is to have succeeded.    Countless people around the world who have never met Matt Squeri have  breathed easier because of his work.   So it is with gratitude that Team Merkley, the Congressional- Executive Commission on China, and I thank Matt Squeri for his service  to this institution, his service to this Nation, and his service to  human rights around the world. We wish him all the best as he moves on  to his next assignment.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  stand in recess until 5 p.m.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 3:05 p.m., recessed until 5  p.m. and reassembled when called to order by the Presiding Officer (Mr.  Fetterman).                            ____________________     Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that privileges  of the floor be extended to Matt Squeri, member of my team, for the  balance of the day.
