 Mr. Speaker, mandates seldom work. Markets do work.   My friends on the Democratic side of the aisle haven't pointed out  that 19 million Americans have chosen to pay the tax penalty to the  IRS, rather than be forced into one of these ObamaCare plans.   They talk about all the people who have gotten coverage. Most of them  got coverage when the bill that is now called ObamaCare expanded  Medicaid to healthy adults and paid 100 percent of the cost to cover  those individuals at a cost right now of about $70 billion a year.   Mandates don't work; markets do. I choose less government mandate,  more personal freedom.   Vote for the rule; vote for the bill. Let's restore markets and  freedom to health care in America.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Judy Chu of California.)   Ms. JUDY CHU of California. Mr. Speaker, yesterday, Kate called my  office, worried for her son who is 1-year-old and was born with  muscular dystrophy. He will need care for the rest of his life.   Without the ban on preexisting conditions, the cost of insurance for  her son will be astronomical. She is paralyzed with fear about how she  is going to be able to care for him for the rest of his life. Under  TrumpCare, the healthcare bill written for Donald Trump and not the  American people, insurance companies will be able to charge Kate's son  more because he has a preexisting condition.   Imagine that. Her son's health care will be out of reach, his  precious life endangered. That is unimaginably cruel, especially when  we have a system in place right now that gets Kate's son the treatment  he deserves.   That is why I am opposing this bill today. I cannot support a measure  that we know will cost sick people more money, will force families to  pay higher premiums and deductibles, will force 24 million people off  their insurance, and guts essential health benefits.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this horrific bill today.                                time  1015
