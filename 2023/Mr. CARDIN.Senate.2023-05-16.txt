 Mr. President, I rise to recognize the sacrifices and  dedication of our Nation's law enforcement personnel. I am proud to  cosponsor the resolution offered by Senators Durbin and Graham  recognizing May 14 through May 20 as National Police Week. This  bipartisan resolution recognizes the critical role that law enforcement  officers play in keeping our neighborhoods and communities safe. It  also calls attention to the importance of ensuring enforcement officers  have the equipment, training, and resources necessary to perform their  duties. Finally, the resolution pays tribute to fallen law enforcement  officers, including three Marylanders whom I would like to recognize in  particular. These names will be added to the National Law Enforcement  Officers Memorial, located in Judiciary Square near Capitol Hill.   Deputy First Class Kenneth ``Kenny'' Olander served the Sheriff's  Office of Frederick County, MD, for 32 years. He worked as a patrol  operations deputy, school resource officer, and most recently as a  community deputy. He had previously served in the Army for 6 years and  worked as a military police officer. He passed away in March of 2022  after contracting COVID-19 in the line of duty. He is survived by his  wife and three children.   Corporal Gregory Bednarek served with the Maryland Transportation  Authority Police for 19 years. A lifelong Marylander, Gregory was born  in Baltimore and attended the University of Maryland, College Park. He  died from complications as the result of contracting COVID-19 in the  line of duty.  [[Page S1676]]  He is survived by his wife, stepdaughter, stepson, parents, sister, two  nephews, and niece.   Wicomico County Deputy First Class Glenn Hilliard had served with the  Wicomico County Sheriff's Office for 6 years and had previously served  with the Berlin Police Department for 10 years. He was shot and killed  in July of 2022 while attempting to arrest a man wanted on multiple  felony warrants. Hilliard had bravely pursued the suspect on foot as he  attempted to flee. He is survived by his wife and three children.   The sacrifices of these Marylanders will not be forgotten, nor will  their decades of faithful service to keeping their communities safe. We  extend our heartfelt condolences to the families left behind.                            ____________________
