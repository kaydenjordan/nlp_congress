 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to  support H.R. 6369, the Expanding Contracting Opportunities for Small  Business Act of 2018.   Not only will this bill provide opportunities for women-owned,  service-disabled veteran-owned, HUBZone, and socially and economically  disadvantaged small businesses, this legislation also helps Federal  agencies achieve and exceed their small business goals.   Small business sole-source contracting can be a valuable tool for  both Federal agencies and small businesses, but our current statute is  outdated.   Federal procurement practices are rapidly changing, and the sole- source authority provided by the Small Business Act has not kept up  with the changes of today's procurement landscape. By adjusting the  statutory sole-source dollar thresholds, H.R. 6369 incentivizes  contracting officers' use of small business sole-source contracting in  order to help agencies swiftly meet their goals.   While it is critical that agencies maximize opportunities to small  businesses, it is equally important that they have procedures in place  to assure that awards are made only to eligible and qualified firms.  This bill will apply a new oversight procedure that requires agencies  to coordinate with the SBA prior to awarding a sole-source contract,  ensuring that firms receiving awards are, in fact, qualified and  eligible.   I am proud of H.R. 6369 and its mission to promote small business  growth, strengthen oversight, and incentivize Federal agencies to work  with small businesses. I encourage my colleagues to support this bill.
