 DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, today the House  will vote on the Stopping Bad Robocalls Act, legislation introduced by  Chairman Pallone, Ranking Member Walden, Ranking Member Latta, and me.  This bill addresses a problem that we all have firsthand experience  with: persistent, annoying, nonstop robocalls.   Americans received nearly 48 billion robocalls last year, a 60  percent increase from the year before. That number is expected to  increase to 60 billion this year. In June alone, in my hometown of  Pittsburgh, we received an estimated 34 million robocalls. On average,  everyone in this country receives 14 of these calls every day.   This bill is a comprehensive, bipartisan solution that I believe will  help seriously reduce the onslaught of illegal robocalls that Americans  face.   The bill before the House today is the result of bipartisan  negotiations, which included industry and public interest stakeholders.  This bill was reported unanimously out of the Communications and  Technology Subcommittee, which I chair, as well as the full Energy and  Commerce Committee.   I am also pleased that the language from the STOP Robocalls Act,  which Ranking Member Latta and I introduced, was included in this bill.  These provisions allow phone carriers to automatically enable robocall  blocking services by default on phone lines.   While these technologies have been available on an opt-in basis, too  many of our seniors and, frankly, too many people in general just don't  know about these services and how to sign up for them.   Allowing these services to be enabled by default allows all consumers  to benefit from these technologies without having to go through the  onerous signup process, particularly for seniors and those most  vulnerable to scam calls.   These provisions also include requirements that the new opt-out  robocall blocking services do not result in new consumer fees. The bill  also requires all carriers to adopt call authentication technology,  which would enable  [[Page H7299]]  people to be certain that the call they receive----    DOYLE of Pennsylvania. The call authentication  technology would enable people to be certain that the number they see  on their caller ID is really the number the call is coming from.   All too often, people get calls that look like they are coming from  down the street, but they are really coming from scammers half a world  away.   This legislation came about through the hard work of majority staff  and minority staff of the Energy and Commerce Committee, and I would  like to thank both staffs on the majority and minority for their hard  work and diligence to get this bill to the floor.   I urge my colleagues to support this bill.    DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support  of the Autism CARES Act of 2019.    My good friend and colleague, Chris Smith, and I formed the Autism  Caucus in 2001 to raise awareness in Congress about autism spectrum  disorder, ASD for short, to advocate for greater Federal involvement in  understanding ASD, and to help individuals and families get the support  they need.   Nearly 20 years later, we have made significant progress, but we are  still far behind where we would like to be and where individuals and  families need us to be. In 2000, the CDC reported approximately 1 in  150 children with ASD. The latest report found that number had  increased to 1 in 59 children.   Similarly, even though ASD can be diagnosed as early as 2 years old,  most children are not diagnosed with ASD until after age 4. Children  and adolescents with ASD have had average medical expenditures that  were $4,000 to $6,000 higher than children without ASD.   We also don't have a reliable estimate of autism's prevalence among  adults. As autism is a lifelong condition, an estimated 50,000 teens  and young adults with autism age out of school-based services each  year. That is why it is so important that we pass this bill: to  continue to close the gaps in knowledge and services surrounding ASD.   The Autism CARES Act of 2019 increases authorized program levels to  match our recent success in the Appropriations Committee: $296 million  annually at NIH, $23 million at CDC, and $55 million at HRSA. This  money will be used for research, surveillance, education, detection,  and intervention for individuals with autism spectrum disorders of all  ages, not just children.   The bill also supports training the healthcare workforce to better  understand and treat individuals with autism, and it prioritizes awards  to medically underserved areas.                                time  1515    It also directs HHS to submit a report to Congress on the health and  well-being of individuals on the autism spectrum, an often-overlooked  aspect of ASD.   The bill also adds important voices to the Interagency Autism  Coordinating Committee, including representatives from the Department  of Labor, the Department of Justice, the Department of Housing and  Urban Development, and the VA.   Finally, it increases the minimum number of self-advocates included  in the public membership of the committee, an important step for a  community whose voices are invaluable.   I am proud of the progress that we have made over the last 20 years,  but I know we have to do more. Autism CARES Act of 2019 takes important  steps toward our ultimate goal to ensure that every individual has  access to the treatment and support that is a right for them.   I thank Congressman Smith, Chairman Pallone, Ranking Member Walden,  Chairwoman Eshoo, and Ranking Member Burgess, as well as Autism Speaks,  Autism Society of America, Association of University Centers on  Disabilities, Autistic Self Advocacy Network, and other stakeholders  for their input and support for this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, reauthorization of the Autism CARES Act means a great  deal to millions of Americans affected by autism spectrum disorder. I  urge my colleagues to give this bill their wholehearted support and  vote in favor of this legislation.
