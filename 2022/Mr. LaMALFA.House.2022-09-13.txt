 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in memoriam of those who lost  their lives in the horrific wildfires that have once again plagued  Northern California this fire season.   In what is known as the McKinney fire in Siskiyou County, we lost  four of our neighbors: Kathleen Shoopman, who was 73; Charles Kays, 79;  Judith Kays, 82; and John Cogan, 76--all sadly lost their lives in this  fire.   Yet, another fire, also in Siskiyou County, known as the Mill fire,  two women, ages 66 and 73--whose names have not been publicly revealed  yet--sadly lost their lives, as well.   Season after season, our constituents are subject to fire danger. Our  prayers are with the families and the souls of those that we have lost  this season.   Mr. Speaker, I would ask for a moment of silence from the House.                            ____________________
