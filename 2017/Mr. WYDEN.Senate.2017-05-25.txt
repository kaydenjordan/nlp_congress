 Mr. President, I would like to take a few minutes today  and share with my colleagues an extraordinary piece of our country's  World War II and civil rights history: the story of the 555th Parachute  Infantry Battalion--or the Triple Nickles, as they would come to be  called.   The 555th was officially activated in December 1943 at Fort Benning,  GA, and began as a company of Black officers and enlisted men.  Seventeen soldiers graduated Army jump school the following February,  earning a coveted Parachutist Badge--their ``wings.'' The Army  transferred the unit after several months to Camp Mackall, NC, and, in  November 1944, redesignated it Company A of the newly activated 555th  Parachute Infantry Battalion.   Although the 555th did not serve overseas during World War II, it  performed an important role in defending the American homeland. In 1944  and 1945, the Japanese launched roughly 9,000 ``balloon bombs,''  explosives attached to paper balloons that rode the jetstream current  across the Pacific Ocean and over the contiguous United States.   One of these balloon bombs exploded in Oregon, killing a pregnant  woman and five children in what historians regard as the only American  World War II combat causalities to occur in the contiguous United  States.   The members of the 555th boarded a train westward to Oregon on a  secret mission to help defend Americans living in the Pacific Northwest  and the natural timber resources deemed vital to the war effort.   The incident in Oregon was one of more than 275 documented balloon  bomb related incidents as far east as Detroit, MI, south into Texas,  and north into Canada and Alaska.   Japanese balloon bombs, of course, had the potential not only to  wound or kill but also to set forests ablaze in the western United  States. Putting those fires out and dealing with their aftermath could  divert the Nation's focus on the war effort and dampen American morale.   The Triple Nickles arrived in Oregon in 1945 and were sent out to  Pendleton Air Field, then still an active military base. They were  assigned to work with  [[Page S3207]]  the U.S. Forest Service and received specialized training as  smokejumpers and on the handling of unexploded balloon bombs.   As part of Operation Firefly, the 555th made some 1,200 jumps and  fought more than 35 fires in Oregon, Washington, and other western  States between July and October 1945.   Smokejumping is no easy feat; it is dirty, sweaty, and dangerous  work, but because of the 555th's dedication and professionalism, the  unit only ever sustained one fatality: Malvin Brown tragically fell to  his death in the Umpqua National Forest about 45 miles northwest of  Crater Lake. His death is regarded as the first smokejumper death in  U.S. history.   Make no mistake about it, Malvin Brown and the other soldiers of the  555th Parachute Infantry Battalion are heroes. They were the first  Black paratroopers ever to serve in the U.S. Military, which they did  with honor and distinction. They are also the only military unit in  history to work as smokejumpers.   The soldiers of the 555th faced painful discrimination and blatant  racism on a daily basis. They were barred from the store on base while  at Fort Benning, GA, even though German and Italian prisoners were  allow to enter. Even after the Triple Nickles arrived in Oregon, they  found most restaurants and bars would not serve them.   The Army sent the 555th to Fort Bragg, NC, following the Japanese  surrender and, in December 1947, integrated the unit into the famed  82nd Airborne Division--making the 82nd the Army's first racially  integrated division.   On June 3, 2017, the State of Oregon will commemorate the 555th  Parachute Infantry Battalion's remarkable history and important  contributions to the country with the installation of an Oregon State  historic marker at the Smokejumper Museum in Cave Junction.   It is my true honor to share their story today with my colleagues and  to express my profound gratitude to all the Triple Nickles for their  service.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to Judge  Michael H. Bennett. Judge Bennett will be retiring in May 2017 after  serving 28 years as an immigration judge.   Former Oregon Governor Tom McCall once said, ``Heroes are not giant  statues framed against a red sky. They are people who say, `This is my  community, and it is my responsibility to make it better.''' Judge  Bennett truly is a hero, for he has devoted much of his life to making  the United States and his community better.   Judge Michael Bennett began his career as a general attorney for the  [[Page S3208]]  legacy Immigration and Naturalization Service in El Centro, CA. He also  worked as an Assistant Attorney General and Assistant Public Defender  for the Government of American Samoa. Judge Bennett was appointed as an  immigration judge in El Centro, CA, in 1989.   In Oregon, we were fortunate to have Judge Bennett assigned to our  immigration court in 1998. During his tenure, Judge Bennett has served  as an impartial adjudicator who is known for his fair and compassionate  decisions. He has gained the respect of his colleagues, fellow  attorneys, and the public for his intricate knowledge of immigration  law. Further, Judge Bennett has created a positive work environment in  the Portland immigration court that is commendable and should be  recognized.   Judge Bennett comes from a long line of public servants, including  his grandparents and parents. His grandfather served in the U.S. Navy  and fought in WWII. Judge Bennett's father also served in the U.S. Navy  and eventually earned his Ph.D. and became a teacher. Judge Bennett and  his wife, Sivai, have continued to dedicate themselves to making Oregon  a better place through their public service.   It is an honor to recognize Judge Michael H. Bennett for his service  to the United States, to Oregon, and to his community.                            ____________________
