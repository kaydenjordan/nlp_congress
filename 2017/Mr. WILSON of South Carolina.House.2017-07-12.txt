 Mr. Speaker, today the House of  Representatives will consider three critical bills that will continue  efforts to reduce and eliminate human trafficking and implement a  stronger detection system for American families.   I appreciate the leadership of Congressman Chris Smith, Congressman  Tim Walberg, and Congresswoman Vicky Hartzler for their work to build a  more effective system to apprehend traffickers.   As we take steps at the national level to prevent trafficking, equip  local officials, and support vulnerable communities, I am grateful that  the South Carolina Human Trafficking Task Force led by State Attorney  General Alan Wilson has been a pioneer in statewide efforts to combat  human trafficking. Under his leadership, South Carolina has one of the  strongest human trafficking laws in the country and has successfully  worked for prosecution, protection, prevention, and partnership.   I am encouraged by South Carolina's commitment to protecting the  dignity, freedom, and human rights of all citizens, and I hope their  success can build a model for other States.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the House  Armed Services Committee chairman, Mac Thornberry, for his determined  leadership to promote peace through strength. I am grateful to support  H.R. 2810, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018.  [[Page H5536]]    First of all, I would like to thank my colleague and ranking member,  Congresswoman Madeleine Bordallo of Guam, for her tireless efforts and  participation in this process, and I also thank the Readiness  Subcommittee members of the House Armed Services Committee on both  sides of the aisle for bipartisan input on this bill. The creation of  the 2018 National Defense Authorization Act truly was bipartisan.   Mr. Chairman, over the past several months, we have heard testimony  from every military service branch about their urgent need to address  the alarming readiness shortfalls. Their testimonies were sobering,  confirming Congress must take bold action.   Here today, we have the responsibility of reducing the risk to our  servicemembers by making sure they are well trained, supported, and  that the equipment they use is properly maintained and combat ready.  There are numerous important readiness provisions in the authorization,  including adding over $2 billion to long-neglected facilities  sustainment and restoration and modernization accounts.   It gives the Department of Defense more responsive facility  construction, repair, and real estate authorities for more efficient  use of DOD resources.   It extends multiple temporary hiring authorities to allow the  Department of Defense to fill critical manpower gaps, in particular at  our defense industrial facilities--our depots, arsenals, and shipyards.   None of the readiness provisions are arbitrary. They are specifically  targeted to stop and, as much as possible, to reverse the decline of  the readiness of our Armed Forces so we can continue to combat and  deter the threats to national security from around the world.   Mr. Chairman, I strongly support H.R. 2810, the National Defense  Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018, and encourage my colleagues in  the House to support it as well.    Mr. Chairman, I thank Congresswoman  Hartzler for her leadership, and I thank her for this opportunity to  speak on this misguided amendment.   I have visited Guantanamo Bay twice, and I know firsthand the  detainees at Guantanamo Bay are the worst of the worst, terrorists who  are conspirators of Osama bin Laden, trained mass murderers, and  extremists who have a sole intention of killing Americans.   We have also seen that releasing terrorists from Guantanamo puts  American families at risk. In a report last year, the Director of  National Intelligence from the prior administration was clear that at  least 116 detainees, nearly one-third, released from Guantanamo have  returned to the battlefield to kill American families.   As we have seen from the proliferation of terrorists around the  world, from Algeria and North Africa, through the Middle East, across  to South Asia and the Philippines, the deterrence of incarceration at  Guantanamo Bay has never been more important. I urge all of my  colleagues to reject this amendment.  [[Page H5729]]         Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the  desk.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   I thank the Chair for the opportunity to speak on the amendment to  restrict the funding from the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty  Organization while still providing funds for the international  monitoring system.   The purpose is simple. Congress never ratified the Comprehensive  Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. It is irresponsible to the taxpayer and  contradictory for the United States to financially support an  organization that the United States has never officially joined or  contributed funds for a treaty that was never enacted.   The amendment clearly continues to fund the international monitoring  system to improve our global and nuclear detection capability, and  returns us to the longstanding responsible policies from President  George W. Bush's administration.   This amendment makes it clear that protecting American families is  the job of Congress, not an unaccountable international body. As we see  a rise in threats around the world, our nuclear deterrence capability  is crucial to promote our ability to preserve peace. It is also  important that the United States does not require adherence to this  treaty in order to continue our self-imposed moratorium on testing  nuclear weapons of any size or of any kind.   However, as we live in a world of increasing threats, we should not  bind the United States to an agreement that other nuclear powers like  China and Russia do not adhere to.   The Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty has never been enacted so  there is no change in policy or outcome by supporting this amendment,  just a saving of taxpayers' dollars.  [[Page H5731]]    Mr. Chair, I urge passage of this amendment, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Rogers).    Mr. Chairman, to me, this is, again,  clearly an amendment which is in coordination with the Senate  initiative by Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas that clearly continues the  funding of the International Monitoring System to improve our global  nuclear detection capability and returns us to the longstanding  policies from President George W. Bush's administration.   The amendment is clear. Protecting American families is the job of  Congress, not an unaccountable, international body. As we see a rise-- as I have stated in the past--in threats around the world, our nuclear  deterrence capability is crucial to promote our ability to preserve  peace.   Mr. Chair, I urge the approval of the amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to  the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, I appreciate very much the efforts by Mr. McClintock,  but simply put, now is not the time to consider a Base Realignment and  Closure.   In the past, BRAC has been used without conducting a thorough study,  has incurred significant costs and jeopardized valuable military  communities, such as those of the Midlands of South Carolina  surrounding Fort Jackson or the Aiken-Barnwell community that I  represent adjacent to Fort Gordon, Georgia.   If facilities are shuttered, the existing secure assets will not be  reasonably replicated. In testimony before the House Armed Services  Committee just last month, Secretary Jim Mattis stated that he also has  reservations about the BRAC assessments.   It is also important to be clear: BRAC is not a proven cost-saving  measure. The last BRAC cost 67 percent more than planned to carry out,  dramatically reducing any projected savings.   It would be undermining to our national security and to communities  around the Nation to close down military installations without a  comprehensive study, especially as the military works to grow the force  to address emerging threats around the globe.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Austin Scott), my friend and colleague.    Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he  may consume to the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Bishop).    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of  my time.    Mr. Chairman, thank you for the  opportunity to speak on amendment No. 66.   On July 4, the Communist totalitarian regime in North Korea marked  the holiday testing an intercontinental ballistic missile. This is yet  another escalation by a regime that has tested ballistic missiles and  has conducted five nuclear tests.   This amendment expresses a clear sense of Congress: we will not  tolerate the escalation by the regime in North Korea testing ballistic  missiles or developing a nuclear weapon threatening American families.   The amendment also reaffirms the strong commitment of the United  States to our allies in the region, especially South Korea, Japan, and  Australia. I am encouraged by the leadership of President Donald Trump  for a commitment of peace through strength. It is clear the regime in  North Korea will only respond to strength, and this sense of Congress  strongly states our commitment to keeping all options on the table  while addressing the threat of North Korea, whether it be military,  diplomatic, or economic.   Mr. Chairman, I urge support of this amendment with the en bloc  package.
