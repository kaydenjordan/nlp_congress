 Mr. Speaker, with a little help from Dr. Seuss, I  would like to share the story of how the Grinch stole middle class tax  cuts:       Every middle class family wanted tax cuts a lot,      But the Grinch, who lived in a big white house, did not.      The Grinch hated middle class tax cuts, he wanted the whole             Tax Code uneven,      Now, please, don't ask why, no one quite knows the reason.      It could be his head was screwed on a bit wrong,      It could be his ties were 2 inches too long,      But I think that the most likely reason of all,      Was his heart, or his hands, were two sizes too small.      Whatever the reason, his heart or his ties,      He stood on Christmas Eve, planning workers' demise,      Staring out from his office with a sour, Grinchy frown,      At the workers' warm, lighted windows below in their town.      ``Tomorrow is Christmas, it is practically here,''      He said from his office with a terrible sneer.      ``Why, for 71 years I have put up with it now,      I must stop these middle class tax cuts. But how?''      Then he got an idea, an awful idea,      The Grinch got a terrible, awful idea.      ``I know just what to do,'' the Grinch thought with a pause,      ``With this coat and this hat, I look just like Santa             Claus.''      Then he loaded some empty bags on his plane,      And he took off to cause some mean Grinchy pain.      While working families dreamed of sweet tax cuts without             care,      The Grinch came to the first little house on the square.      ``This is stop number one,'' the old Grinch Claus hissed,      And he climbed to the roof, empty bags in his fist.      Then he slid down the chimney, Santa suit all in place,      And he stuck his head out of the small fireplace,      Where the tax deductions all hung in a row,      ``These deductions,'' he grinned, ``are the first things to             go.''      Personal exemptions, home equity interest, State and local             taxes, too,      ``I'll take almost every deduction away from you.''      Then he slunk to the tax brackets--the corporate tax cuts             were huge,      Why, that Grinch even took the Arctic Wildlife Refuge.      ``And now,'' grinned the Grinch, with his sacks in a net,      ``I'll stack the deficit with $1 trillion in debt.''      Then he heard a small sound, a child's soft cry,      ``Why are you taking our deductions, Grinch? Why?''      But, you know, that old Grinch was so smart and so slick,      That he thought up a fib, and he thought it up quick.      ``Why, my sweet little tot,'' the Grinch said on the fly,      ``I am here because corporate taxes are far too high.      ``So I am taking most of your deductions away,      ``To help corporations . . . and you get to pay.      ``See, my dear child, there is no reason to frown,      ``We will make them more wealthy, but it will all trickle             down.''      His fib fooled the child, then he patted her head,      And he got her a tax postcard, and he sent her to bed.      The Grinch took one last look at her sad little pup,      And he went to the chimney and shoved the deficit up.      Healthcare for 13 million was the last thing he took,      Then he slithered away without another look.      In their homes he left nothing but debt and despair,      While giving out handouts to corporations--the Grinch didn't             care.      And the one deduction that he extolled,      Was even too small for a single household.      He rode with his load of deductions for dumping,      ``Pooh-pooh to the middle class,'' he said, gleefully             jumping.      ``They're just waking up, I know just what they'll do,  [[Page H10185]]       ``Their mouths will hang open a minute or two, and they'll             all cry, `boo-hoo.'                                time  0915       ``That's a noise,'' grinned the Grinch, ``that I simply must             hear.''      So he paused. And the Grinch put his hand to his ear.      And he did hear a sound rising over the snow.      It started to low. Then it started to grow.      He stared down aghast. The Grinch popped his eyes.      Then he shook. What he saw was a shocking surprise.      Every American, the tall and the small, loudly demanding tax             cuts for all.      We want our deductions and a better deal, not tax cuts for             corporations while you cut Meals on Wheels.      And the Grinch, with his small hands ice-cold in the snow,             stood puzzling and puzzling:      ``How could it be so?      ``Am I a fool?      ``Are my policies all wrong?      ``Without those deductions, can the Nation be strong?''      And he puzzled 3 hours until his puzzler was sore.      Then the Grinch thought of something he had not tweeted             before:      ``Maybe tax cuts should help more than just corporations.      ``Maybe this Christmas I can help the whole Nation.      ``America's middle class is what made it thrive.      ``They need these deductions if they're to survive.''      We all know how the real story ends.      The Grinch finds his heart and he makes amends.      Now we know this tax bill won't end with such glee, because             the President and corporate lobbyists control the GOP.      This Christmas, families will get just coal in their             stocking.      Thanks to President Trump, the final result will be shocking.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. I  rise in strong hope that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle  will come to their senses and defeat this job-killing bill that will  explode the deficit and hurt working people.   It is important to note 83 percent of the benefits of the cuts in  this bill go to the top 1 percent; 86 million hardworking middle class  families will actually see a tax increase. Of course, we need to reform  our Tax Code, but we need to do it in a way that raises wages, produces  good-paying jobs, and makes sure the people have a brighter future.   This does just the opposite. It ransacks Medicare and Medicaid. It  creates an unsustainable burden for the next generation, and it is  very, very important to recognize it is not going to create jobs. This  is trickle-down economics. Let everyone at the top hold on to all of  their money, and it will trickle down to the rest of us.   It doesn't work. This is a failed economic policy. This does not  support strengthening the middle class. We need to defeat this bill and  reform our Tax Code in a way that will really promote job growth, that  will raise wages, that will ensure working families can get ahead.  There are millions of Americans tonight who will go to bed worrying  about how they are going to take care of their family; how they are  going to make ends meet. This bill will make that problem worse. I urge  my colleagues to defeat it.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California for  yielding.   I would like to begin by thanking Mr. Garamendi for his relentless  and passionate voice on behalf of working people, not only of  California, but this country. He comes to the floor regularly and  organizes these Special Order hours to help bring attention to these  very important issues, and I really thank him for the opportunity to be  part of it.   I want to begin where he left off, and that is the process.   We just learned today that the tax scam that the Republicans jammed  through the House has to come back for another vote because they made  some mistakes and didn't comply with some Senate rules.   This is what happens when you don't have hearings, you don't have  thoughtful deliberation, you don't listen to witnesses who can identify  problems with the bill, and instead you just bring it to the floor.    Mr. Speaker, yes. Exactly. The bill will come back.  So, hopefully, the American people will have another opportunity to  make certain their voices are heard.   But this is not the way to do a complicated piece of legislation. The  last time the Congress did tax reform, there were 400 witnesses,  experts who came in, hearings month after month, because it is  complicated. You want to make sure it works right. You are talking  about the American economy.   None of that happened here. It was written in the dark of the night.  Some of our Republican colleagues didn't see the text. This is not a  way to do legislation, and it is one of the reasons that excluding the  Democrats from contributing to this process was a terrible, terrible  mistake.   What is the result?   We end up with a bill that does exactly the opposite of what it says  it will do.   This is a job-killing bill. There is no more urgent priority that all  of us have to create good-paying jobs, family supporting jobs. We  Democrats have launched a very bold economic agenda that focuses on  better jobs, better wages for a better future.   Millions of Americans will go to bed tonight and lie awake worried  about whether or not they have enough money to pay their bills, whether  they can put aside some savings for their retirement, whether they can  send their kids to school.   All of those anxieties come from the fact they are not making enough  money to make ends meet. They haven't seen an increase in their income  in a very long time. What this tax bill does is make those problems  worse. This will raise taxes on 86 million middle class families in  this country.   They call it a tax cut. For those 86 middle class families, it is a  tax increase. In fact, 83 percent of the tax cuts go to the top 1  percent, the very richest people in this country and the biggest  corporations. It also makes more generous tax provisions that  incentivize companies to ship American jobs oversees.   This is not a job creator. The idea that if we just let the people at  the very top hold on to all their money, it is going to trickle down to  the rest of us, is a job killer. We know that doesn't work. They tried  during the Bush administration. We had the worst job loss in a  generation.   It doesn't work because we all know the way you actually create jobs  is you grow the middle class. You make sure folks have good-paying  jobs, have more money in their pockets to buy the goods and services.   Go to any small business in my State of Rhode Island, and I am sure  it is the same in the State of California, and ask a small-business  owner: What do you need to add a job? What do you need to increase the  number of people who work in your business?   They will say one thing: I need customers. I need people to buy what  I make and sell.   That is why strengthening the middle class, raising the income of  people in this country, is the way you grow the economy. This is just  the opposite.   I was sickened when that bill passed the floor a few moments ago and  I saw our Republican colleagues cheering and hooting and hollering like  they were at a ball game. They put points on the board. They didn't put  points on the board for the American people.    We are going to keep fighting for a tax reform bill that actually  provides cuts to middle class families that will help to promote  economic growth and create good-paying jobs.   We think the Tax Code is broken. We have always been willing to work  together in a bipartisan way to make the Tax Code simpler, more  competitive, and work for the American people.   That is not what the Republicans did. This is a giveaway to their  donors. Some of our colleagues said it out loud: If we don't pass a tax  cut, our donors told us to not call anymore. They actually said that  out loud.   That is not how you write legislation. Let's not forget who sent us  here and whom we should be working for.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for giving me an opportunity to  contribute to the conversation tonight. This is a bill which will hurt  Rhode Island, hurt this country, and hurt our economy.   Finally, it also will result in the gutting of Medicare and Medicaid.  Everyone forgets this creates a $1.5 trillion debt which, by our rules,  is going to result in automatic cuts to Medicare, Medicaid, student  loan programs, block grants, vocational rehabilitation programs, and on  and on and on.  [[Page H10237]]                                     time  1800    They give away $1.5 trillion that we don't have. They borrow the  money to give away the tax cuts, and then next year they come back and  say: Oh, we have no money. We have to cut Medicare and cut Medicaid and  cut Social Security and cut Pell grants and not rebuild the  infrastructure of our country.   Our Republican colleagues have said this is part one. Part two will  be these cuts. The American people know this, which is why this bill is  overwhelmingly unpopular with the American people. They see what the  Republicans are up to. They are insulting the American people. They  think they haven't figured this out. They are going to dangle a couple  of dollars in front of them but then whack them with huge cuts next  year.   The American people are smarter than this. The Republicans are going  to be held accountable. We have to fight with every fiber in our body  to stop this because it is really going to hurt people.
