 I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, along with my colleagues Senator Jim Risch,  Representative  Mike Simpson and Representative Russ Fulcher, I  congratulate Glen Tait, who is retiring from his position as Idaho  National Laboratory's--INL--Governmental Affairs Director, after nearly  20 years with INL.   Prior to joining INL in 2001, Glen served as my legislative director  when I was first elected to the Senate. During his time guiding my  legislative staff, he worked on annual appropriations, nuclear, and  other energy issues. He brought with him significant experience and  understanding of our great State of Idaho, as he had previously worked  as a senior adviser to my predecessor, Dirk Kempthorne. Prior to  serving on my staff, Glen's first job in Washington, DC, was working  for Vice President Dan Quayle. He served on the Vice President's  national security staff as a congressional liaison.   When announcing Glen's retirement, INL Director Mark Peters  recognized Glen's excellent leadership as he has worked with our Idaho  congressional delegation ``throughout the annual appropriations  process, securing the participation of INL experts in congressional  hearings, and working with Congress and federal agencies to advance  legislation and policies important to our energy and national  security.'' Glen has been instrumental in helping us ensure the  allocation of needed resources to INL and assisting with Federal policy  changes to best support nuclear innovation. For example, we have  greatly valued his assistance with the 2018 enactment of S. 97, the  Nuclear Energy Innovation Capabilities Act, and the 2019 enactments of  S. 512, the Nuclear Energy Innovation and Modernization Act, and S.  174, the Securing Energy Infrastructure Act. These laws are important  legacies of Glen's work, as they will ensure the research conducted at  INL keeps our Nation at the forefront of nuclear innovation. These  measures are a nice capstone to his years of service and dedication to  INL and nuclear energy, ensuring that research into advanced nuclear  reactors continues and that research is ultimately able to be  commercialized and deployed in the private sector.   Glen is dedicated and talented in many aspects of his life beyond his  work. He speaks Russian, is an avid gardener, bikes to work, and runs  daily. He is a big sports fan, with the Washington Nationals and the  California Golden Bears being among his favorite teams to watch. Glen  is also very generous with people and cares greatly about helping young  people get solid footing in Washington, DC. He is well regarded for his  guidance and mentorship, as he has helped newcomers with job and life  skills. He has taught many of our staff the ins-and-outs of the lab's  research and the science behind it. His patience and guidance are  deeply appreciated by many who were fortunate enough to work with him.   Glen, may retirement afford you many runs on the beach and great  times with your loved ones, including your wife, Jeannette, and  daughters, Lindsey Marie and Hailey Madison. Congratulations on an  outstanding 30-year career. We will miss your wit and intellect, and  thank you for sharing your talents with Idahoans all these years. We  wish you all the best in your retirement.                            ____________________
