 Madam Speaker, I rise today to remember  Petty Officer Logan Palmer of Harristown, Illinois, who was tragically  lost in the accident last August aboard USS John S. McCain.   Logan knew early that he wanted to serve his country. After he  graduated from Sangamon Valley High School and Richland Community  College, he enlisted in the Navy as an interior communications  electrician.   Petty Officer Logan Palmer died serving and protecting our country,  and for that, we remain eternally grateful.   Today, the House will vote on a bill to designate Harristown's post  office in Logan's hometown of Harristown, Illinois, a small rural  community in Macon County, Illinois, as the Logan S. Palmer Post  Office.   Although I never had the honor of meeting Logan, I have since come to  know his parents, Theresa and Sid, and I was honored they were able to  join me when I introduced this bill earlier this year. While they sat  in the gallery, I was able to drop that piece of paper in the box to  introduce this bill to the floor of the House, and I am honored today  to ask my colleagues to join me in passing this important legislation  to honor one of America's heroes.   Designating this post office will not only honor Logan's service, but  serve as a grave reminder of the risks that our servicemembers take on  each day and the responsibilities we have to them as a country.   It is my privilege to be able to honor Logan today, but, again, it is  not why we are here. Many times this chamber will be criticized for  naming post offices, naming public buildings, but, again, let us  remember the sacrifices that many of those who those buildings are  named after made for the freedoms and the liberties that many of us in  this country take for granted every day.   When Logan joined the Navy, no one in his hometown, let alone his  family, thought that he would sacrifice so much for the freedom and  liberty of our great country.   It is my honor to honor Logan S. Palmer with this bill today, and his  name will live forever on his local post office.                            ____________________
