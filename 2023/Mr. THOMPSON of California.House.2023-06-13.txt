 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition  to this bill. Armed braces are used to convert assault pistols into  short-barreled assault rifles that are more accurate, easier to  conceal, and can fire rounds capable of penetrating body armor.   Unregistered arm-brace-equipped firearms have been used in a number  of high-profile mass shootings: Dayton, Ohio, 9 killed and 17 injured  outside of a bar; Boulder, Colorado, 10 killed at a  [[Page H2838]]  grocery store; Colorado Springs, 5 killed, 19 injured at a club;  Nashville, Tennessee, 6 killed, including 3 9-year-old children at an  elementary school.   The ATF final rule closes the loophole that helps arm-brace-equipped  pistols circumvent firearm regulations, including the National Firearms  Act, which has regulated short-barreled rifles under heightened  scrutiny since 1934.   The resolution before us today will take an already menacing and  lethal weapon and turn it into a more accurate killing machine. This is  misguided and callous, and it will only lead to more death.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''
