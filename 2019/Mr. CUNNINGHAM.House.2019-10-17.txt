 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the heroic actions  of Captain Forrest Lampela, Captain Ken Dickenscheidt, Senior Airman  Chris Bowers, Airman First Class Timothy Henn, and Technical Sergeant  Nick Scarmeas, who broke diplomatic protocol and fought near-zero  visibility to save the life of a U.S. Navy sailor who was wounded in  combat.   The Joint Base Charleston crew was flying a critically injured sailor  to Walter Reed from Ramstein Air Base in Germany. Halfway through their  mission, the sailor took a turn for the worse and needed immediate  surgery. The commander, Captain Lampela, made the decision to turn  around and make an emergency landing in Shannon, Ireland, in dense fog  and without diplomatic clearance.   In an incredibly stressful situation, the team fell back on their  training and made a life-and-death decision that ultimately saved the  life of their fellow servicemember. I am honored to commend them.                            ____________________
