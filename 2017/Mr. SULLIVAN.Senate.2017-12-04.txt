 Mr. President, I wish to first compliment my colleague  from Ohio, Senator Portman, on his leadership on so many different  fronts in the U.S. Senate. His leadership is nowhere more important  than what he has been doing on the opioid epidemic that is raging  through Ohio, Alaska, and almost every State in the country. The STOP  Act he just talked about is legislation I have cosponsored, and he is  leading on it. It is one of the many things we need to do to really get  a handle on this.   This should be a bipartisan issue. The opioid epidemic is ravaging  through States, families, and communities. There has been no better  leader in the Senate than Senator Portman on these issues so I just  want to thank him for that.    Mr. President, I also want to express appreciation to a  number of my colleagues and, again, Senator Portman is certainly one of  them. We had an important night the other night with regard to the  critical passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. I think it is going to  be very important legislation to help grow our economy and, finally,  get money in the hands of middle-class families and small businesses so  we can finally start growing this economy nationally and, back home in  Alaska, get my State out of a deep recession that it is in.   There are a lot of Senators who played critical roles. Senators  Hatch, Portman, Toomey, Scott, and so many others, but, in particular,  I want to thank the majority leader. There is a provision in the Tax  Cuts and Jobs Act which I think is going to be critical for America and  certainly critical for my State, which is to help unlock more of the  vast energy resources we have in Alaska, particularly on the coastal  plain of the North Slope--what we call the 1002 area of Alaska. That  pass is part of this bill. It is something in Alaska we have been  working through in a bipartisan manner. Over 70 percent of Alaskans  want to get this done. We have been working on it in Alaska for over 40  years to get this done.   I really want to commend and thank the majority leader, Mitch  McConnell. Over a year ago, he and I sat down to talk about doing this.  Every step of the way, his commitment to me and to the people of Alaska  to make this happen for my State as well as for our great country--he  was there for us.  [[Page S7817]]    So I want to thank the majority leader for that firm commitment to  helping on an issue that has been critical to Alaskans for decades. We  have never realized it. We have a lot more work to do before we get  there, both on the tax bill and the 1002 area provision in it, but we  are closer. We are closer, in large measure, because of the leadership  of the majority leader, and I thank him.   Mr. President, I have been coming to the floor--many of us have been,  actually--for the last several weeks to talk about a really important  issue for the country; that is, getting administration officials in the  Trump administration confirmed by this body. There has been a  resistance, a desire to not want to move very qualified people,  unfortunately, by my colleagues on the other side. It is just not  helping the country.   With each new administration, our great Nation sees a peaceful  transition of power. It is a remarkable pillar of American democracy.  This doesn't include just the transition with regard to the President  and Vice President but also the team of officials in the Federal  Government at senior levels who are required to run this country. Good  people, whether it is a Democratic or a Republican administration-- Republican administration is not always easy to serve--and what we have  been trying to do is help this administration find, get nominated by  the President, and confirm high-quality American people in these jobs  to serve their country.   As a Senator from Alaska, I have had particular focus on Alaskans to  serve in positions of the Federal Government, and I will say that the  Trump administration has been very receptive to a number of these  highly qualified Alaskans who want to serve their country, but,  unfortunately, what we are seeing on the other side is just  obstruction. They don't want to move people. They never explain it.   I have come to the floor and given this speech several times, and I  have asked for the minority leader to come to the floor to explain why  they are delaying all of these very well-qualified Americans who want  to serve their government. Come to the floor and explain it. Tell the  American people why Assistant Secretaries across Federal agencies who  have been waiting months to be confirmed by this body, who have been  voted out of committee, with big bipartisan numbers, sit and wait and  wait and wait. What good is that doing for the country? Come to the  floor and explain it. I have been asking them to come to the floor and  explain it, and they never take me up on the offer.   So, unfortunately, we know the numbers. At this point, 8 years ago in  the Obama Presidency, almost 70 percent--almost 70 percent--of the  nominees by President Obama, who won his election, were confirmed by  the Senate.   Now, I wasn't in the Senate then, but I know my colleagues on this  side of the aisle, if they didn't like someone, they could vote against  them; they could put a hold on them for a while and get their questions  answered. So that is the way it worked. That is normal. Those numbers  are about normal. At the same time now, under the Trump  administration's Presidency, the Senate has only confirmed 40 percent-- 40 percent. Now, is that helping the country? No. It is not helping the  country. Do they ever come to the floor and explain why they are  resisting? No. So it is a frustration, and it is not helping the  country. We need good people in government.   If this trend continues, with the number of people we need to confirm  for the remaining Presidential-appointed positions, it will take us  more than 11 years. Let me repeat that--more than 11 years. We all know  a Presidential term lasts 4 years.   This is unprecedented. It is unprecedented; go take a look. Yet the  other side doesn't want to explain why they are so focused on  obstruction. It is certainly not helping the people. The vast majority  of these nominees are really well qualified.    Mr. President, I came to the floor a half hour ago  talking about a very well-qualified candidate for the Assistant  Secretary of Interior for Lands and Minerals, Joe Balash, whom I happen  to know very well. He was my former chief of staff, and he is the  former Commissioner of Natural Resources in Alaska. He is very well  qualified. His nomination came out of our committee with only one vote  against him.   This nomination has been waiting on the floor for several weeks now,  but I just had a constructive conversation with Members on the other  side of the aisle. What we intend to do is revisit Mr. Balash's  nomination in the next 24 hours, and, hopefully, we will free Joe  Balash to go serve the people of America and the people of Alaska. I  know he will do a very good job.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.                            ____________________
