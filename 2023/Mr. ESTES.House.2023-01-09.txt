 Mr. Speaker, I am pleased today to rise in support of  commonsense legislation that puts the American people ahead of padding  the coffers of the IRS.   It wasn't long ago that Washington was under one-party rule. This  Chamber was recently under the leadership of the Democratic Party that  worked to give D.C. bureaucrats more power and wanted to hire an army  of IRS agents to harass and audit my constituents while ignoring the  need for more border agents to address the crisis at our southern  border.   Congressman Smith's legislation eliminates the devastating IRS  provision that Democrats snuck into their so-called Inflation Reduction  Act by rescinding the funding to this D.C. agency.   The facts are that middle- and lower-income people are audited more  by IRS agents by design of the IRS.   The Kansans I represent need relief from high gas prices and rampant  inflation caused by the current administration and one-party rule. My  constituents don't need a supercharged IRS that will investigate their  transactions between friends and sic 87,000 new agents on them.   This bill, as the first bill that the new Congress addresses, puts  our priorities on full display. Republicans are ready to restore our  Nation and hold government accountable.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this crucial  legislation.
