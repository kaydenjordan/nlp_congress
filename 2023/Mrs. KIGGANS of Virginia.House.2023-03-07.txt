 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life  and memory of a member of the Greatest Generation, a Congressional Gold  Medal recipient, an American hero: Montford Point Marine Corporal  Linwood Holland.   A constituent of Virginia's Second Congressional District, Corporal  Holland passed away in Suffolk on February 16 at the age of 99 years  old. He leaves behind a legacy of bravery, perseverance, and love of  country.   In 1942, Linwood Holland traveled to Richmond, Virginia, to enlist in  the United States war effort. In the face of adversity and  discrimination, he became one of the first Black Americans to serve in  the Marine Corps.   Over the course of World War II, more than 20,000 Montford Point  marines served in segregated units. Corporal Holland served our Nation  and the Marine Corps honorably, fighting in the consequential battles  of Guadalcanal, Iwo Jima, and Okinawa.   He courageously paved the way for future generations of Black  Americans and U.S. Marines.   The Suffolk community, the Commonwealth of Virginia, and the United  States as a whole has lost a valiant member of the Greatest Generation.   Mr. Speaker, please join me in mourning the loss of Corporal Holland  and honoring this American hero for his service.                            ____________________
