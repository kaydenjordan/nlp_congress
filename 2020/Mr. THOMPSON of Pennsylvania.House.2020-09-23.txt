 Mr. Speaker, during the August recess I  had the pleasure of hosting one of my favorite annual events, an  agriculture summit in Cresson, Pennsylvania, Cambria County.   The event took place for the second year in a row at Mount Aloysius  College, and I was pleased to have several special guests join me, both  in person and virtually.   Participating in the summit to lend their expertise were: USDA Under  Secretary Bill Northey; Pennsylvania Secretary of Agriculture Russell  Redding; and Pennsylvania Farm Bureau President, Rick Ebert.   Joining our discussion were nearly 100 virtual attendees from across  the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.   Our discussion centered around a number of important policy issues  impacting our Nation's farmers, including a discussion on what they  hope to see in the next round of coronavirus relief.   I always look for opportunities to engage directly with farmers and  ranchers and producers and processors. This year's agriculture summit  provided valuable feedback about how the pandemic has affected rural  America; feedback that will be critical as Congress continues to  address the impacts of the pandemic on the agricultural sector.   Prior to the coronavirus, the farm economy had been in a multiyear  slump. Just as things were starting to look up, with USMCA signed into  law and new trade deals in the works, this pandemic hit all of us hard,  particularly our farm families.   I have heard a great deal of positive feedback across the board about  the USDA Farmers to Families Food Boxes. Not only is this program  providing fresh, nutritious foods to families in need, it also is  helping farmers sell crops that may otherwise go to waste.   I have been impressed with the quality of the program, particularly  with the oversight and efficiency. Thanks to the Farmers to Families  Food Box Program, more than 90 million boxes have been delivered to  families in need.   Another program that has been helping our farmers is the Coronavirus  Food Assistance Program, or CFAP. Now, I couldn't believe it, but one  of the farmers I met while back in my district for August recess had  not heard of the program and how it could help his family farm.   I want to urge my colleagues, especially now that the second round of  CFAP has been made available, to continue to spread the word about this  valuable resource.    While we have supported the agriculture industry in the previous  COVID relief efforts, many of our farmers are wondering what is next.   It is my hope that we put politics aside and finally come together on  a bipartisan agreement that will support our hardworking essential  employees in the agriculture industry, as well as our critical  industries.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, earlier this month, I had  the pleasure of touring the newest branch of the Centre County  Discovery Space called The Rivet.   The Rivet is a 5,000-square-foot community workshop that aims to  connect people and ideas to create and innovate. Members of the Centre  County community can take advantage of open shop hours and classes that  teach technical skills, critical thinking, and interactive learning.   At The Rivet, individuals can learn how to use 3D printers,  woodworking machines, a pottery studio, CAD software, and the list goes  on. America needs a qualified and skilled workforce.   In Pennsylvania jobs in the trades have been growing at roughly 3  percent each year, but job seekers with the qualifications for these  positions aren't matching that growth. That is what we call ``the  skills gap.''   I was encouraged by the work that The Rivet is doing by providing an  outlet for those who are seeking a career powered by career and  technical education.   I want to thank Rivet manager Camille Sogin for her work to provide  CTE opportunities in Centre County.                            ____________________
