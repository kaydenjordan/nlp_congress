 Madam Speaker, it is that time of year again in  California. Hundreds of thousands of acres are on fire--in our forests,  in our open lands, even burning into some of our cities and our  neighborhoods.   So, what is the deal? Once again, we are not prepared. Some of our  Federal agencies were not prepared to have the equipment and the  firefighters on hand, contracted, ready to go when we knew this was  coming.   As well, our people who procure electricity and govern that were not  ready for the rolling blackouts that would come along from the high  heat waves, as well as some of the shutdowns that would have to occur  in burning areas.   What is wrong with government agencies that do not plan to serve  their people, to keep them safe from fire, and to help keep the  electricity on?   What is wrong that they can't add up how many power plants that we  have available online, how much hydropower we have, how much water  behind the dams, how much we have available during these times of heat  waves to help keep the lights on?   What is wrong with Federal agencies that cannot plan to have people,  even during COVID, ready to go.   Madam Speaker, we have to do better because we are disserving our  people.                            ____________________
