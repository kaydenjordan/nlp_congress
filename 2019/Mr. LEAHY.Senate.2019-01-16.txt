 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President--and I welcome the distinguished Presiding  Officer, who has probably presided before, but this is the first time I  have been on the floor and have seen him preside. I realize he cannot  respond, but I welcome him to the Senate.                              Government Funding    Mr. President, for 26 days, President Trump has held funding for our  Federal Government hostage, using it as leverage to force Congress to  provide $5.7 billion to build his ill-conceived, expensive, and  unfortunately totally ineffective wall on the southern border. We knew  this was coming because for months during the campaign, he riled up his  base with chants of ``Build the wall. Build the wall.'' He invented a  crisis at the southern border and then told supporters that only he  could solve it. He gave his word over and over again that Mexico would  pay for the wall so American taxpayers would not have to.   That was over 2 years ago, and I think he is feeling the pressure now  as he shutters himself in the White House. Having failed to convince  both Republicans and Democrats in Congress that the campaign slogan was  actually good policy and having failed, as we all knew, to get Mexico  to pay for the wall, he turns to a negotiation tactic that he seems to  have mastered--bullying. He has shut down the government of the most  powerful Nation in the world, making us a laughing stock around the  rest of the world, and he says he will keep us shut down until he gets  what he wants. It is the height of irresponsibility. It certainly  destroys our effectiveness in other parts of the world.   He is the President of this country. We all--Democrats and  Republicans--accept that he is the President. But that also means he is  supposed to lead the Nation, not run it into the ground like so many of  his businesses that had to declare bankruptcy. But he sits in the White  House tweeting and watching television all day, ignoring the damaging  effect his actions are having on millions of Americans of whatever  political persuasion around the country.   The shutdown not only hurts our Federal workers, it is hurting  America's economy. The President's own Chair of the White House Council  of Economic Advisers estimates that gross domestic product will slow by  .1 percent for every 2 weeks the government is shut down. Today, there  are reports that this estimate is too low and that the impact could be  .1 percent for every week the government is shuttered.   Those are numbers, but let me tell you a story and give an example.  Small businesses employ more than 59 million people in this country.  Small businesses in this country are one of the main drivers of  economic growth, but every day the government is closed is a day small  businesses can't get Small Business Administration-backed loans to  invest and grow their companies.   Last week, I heard from a woman who runs a small sign company in  Essex Junction, VT. Essex Junction is in Chittenden County outside of  Burlington, VT. It is a beautiful community. It survives by small  businesses that expand. She is trying to grow her business, and she is  trying to acquire another one, but the SBA backs the space she is  trying to purchase, and so she can't bring the sale to finality during  the shutdown. As a result, the seller is threatening to just move on.  He can't get an answer from the SBA. And, of course, that would throw  her expansion plans into jeopardy.   We have many excellent craft breweries in Vermont. They bring in a  lot of revenue. They hire a lot of people. They are a key part of our  tourism. I heard from one of the head brewers from one of these major  craft breweries. He depends upon the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade  Bureau to approve his license applications, formulas, and the labels he  puts on his beer. He has been brewing the beer and it is ready to be  labeled, but the office is closed due to the government shutdown. They  are not processing applications. He wrote:         I am one of the millions of voters whose livelihood depends       on the government operating. . . . Every day that passes       without the  [[Page S238]]       ATTB up and running is another potential day of lost sales.    Farmers across the country and in Vermont are also feeling the pain  of the shutdown. Just a few weeks ago, we passed the bipartisan farm  bill. I was one of the conferees on that bill. I praised Senator Pat  Roberts, Republican from Kansas, and Debbie Stabenow, Democrat from  Michigan. They put together this bipartisan bill, and the President  took credit when he signed it.   Well, it is a 5-year farm bill, and now the President, right after  signing the farm bill, has shut the U.S. Department of Agriculture  field offices that help farmers implement the law. Farmers need  information now as the new planting and growing season looms. How long  will it affect operations heading into the planting year? Most of the  staff are on furlough. If you are a farmer in the Midwest and you are  preparing your crops, you can't say: Well, you know, we can wait a few  months--maybe past the growing season--to find out what the rules are  going to be, and then we will plant. The decisions have to be made now.   It also means that farmers can't apply for much needed loans. They  need these loans because the drop in commodity prices brought on by the  President's tariffs has hit many farmers hard. They need loans to help  pay their bills. Many banks are not willing to lend on them, so they  have to rely on the Department of Agriculture as a lender of last  resort.   Guess what happens in these multiple whammies. Offices that issue  these loans are closed due to the shutdown. They need the loans because  of the President's tariffs and the President's shutdown, but these  offices can't give them the loans.   For those farmers who have better credit, who can access other  lending options, many of their loans are also delayed by the shutdown  since the lenders are unable to confirm that the farmer has other  outstanding loans from the USDA. They could just connect to the USDA  office to ask, but it is closed.   Just this week at the Farm Bureau convention, the President loudly  proclaimed that he is providing assistance to the Market Facilitation  Program to have farmers mitigate the financial losses caused by the  Trump tariffs. But as of December 28, there is no one left in the USDA  accounting offices to process any new applications for these much  needed payments.   I recently heard from a dairy farmer in what we call the Northeast  Kingdom in Vermont. She milks 80 cows, and she is proud of her  operation, but she has been hit hard by the President's trade policies,  which have led to retaliatory tariffs against U.S. dairy exports, and  she is now behind in her electric bill. The electric company is  threatening to turn off the power to her home, to her barn, to her milk  parlor, to her milking machines. She received one installment from the  American Facilitation Program to help mitigate the effects of the Trump  tariffs, but she hasn't received the second installment because of the  Trump shutdown. The second installment is needed to help pay her bills.   She says that she will be in much better shape when the new Dairy  Margin Coverage Program from the new farm bill is implemented. Again, I  applaud Senator Pat Roberts and Senator Debbie Stabenow for ushering  that through in an almost unanimous vote. Unfortunately, no work is  being done to get the program up and running because of the government  shutdown. She is frustrated. She is worried about her future. She is  looking for help. She is an honest, hard-working person, and she is  stymied. I don't blame her.   Implementation of the farm bill, which I spent more than a year  working on--I was on the committee conference working hard to deliver  for our Nation's farmers on a wide range of key priorities, especially  our struggling dairy farmers. It is now on hold during the shutdown  with nearly every USDA Agency furloughed. This is life in the age of  the Trump shutdown.   The President says that shutting down the government, paralyzing our  country, is necessary to address a growing crisis on our southern  border. The only crisis we have in our country right now is the one  caused by the Trump shutdown. The crisis we face is not at our southern  border but at kitchen tables, on family farms, and in small businesses  across the country as families hurt by the Trump shutdown try to figure  out how to make ends meet.   The President talks of hordes of illegal immigrants rushing across  our borders, but border apprehensions have dropped 75 percent since  2000, and the majority of people apprehended at borders today are  families--women and children--fleeing violence in their own country.  They deserve our compassion, not vitriol.   More people are in this country illegally as a result of visa  overstays than from illegal border crossings. This wall does nothing to  address that. To address our complex immigration issues, we need  comprehensive legislation based on facts, not bumper sticker slogans.   We all support strong border security--every Democrat, every  Republican does. By working on a bipartisan basis in the last fiscal  year, Democrats and Republicans supported $21.1 billion for border  security and immigration enforcement. This followed a similar  investment we made in fiscal year 2017.   As vice chairman of the Appropriations Committee, I know that we  invested in our ports of entry, including the purchase of nonintrusive  inspection equipment to detect illegal and illicit contraband. We  invested in aircraft to monitor our sprawling border from above and  quickly respond to emergencies. We invested in video surveillance,  radar systems to detect movement in remote locations. These are  solutions that work. These are smart uses of taxpayer dollars. A 30- foot wall that Mexico will not pay for is not a good solution.   This shutdown is not about border security. If this were about border  security, we would be done with it today. The Trump shutdown is the  President trying to distract America from his failures as a leader and  shore up the support of his base. It is shameful.   It is clear that President Trump will not do the right thing on his  own, so it is time for Senate Republicans to step up. Just yesterday  morning, Democrats asked unanimous consent to take up two bills that  would get this government back open--a six-bill minibus that has  bipartisan support, including four bills that passed the Republican- controlled Senate 92 to 6--virtually every Republican voted for it--and  a continuing resolution for the Homeland Security Department through  February 8. Even though virtually every Republican has voted for this,  the Republican leader objected to going forward.   If they continue to object to opening the government, this shutdown  is as much on them as it is on the President. We have bipartisan bills  before us that could reopen the government. We could vote on them  today, and they would pass with veto-proof margins.   Leader McConnell, bring up these bills. Let's vote to end this  national nightmare.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, let me tell you about the impact the  Trump shutdown is having on one couple from my home State of Vermont.   Kelly and Ricky Klein own Groennfell Meadery in Colchester, VT. In  fact, this is Kelly with her very pretty little daughter, Nora.   Groennfell Meadery is part of a growing industry in Vermont. We are a  small State. We have the most craft breweries per capita in the Nation,  and they create jobs. They support small businesses. They bring people  to Vermont from all over the country. Business has been good. Kelly and  Ricky have been planning an expansion. Recently, they were approved for  a $1.3 million Small Business Administration loan. They were going to  buy three new stainless steel fermenter tanks. They were going to move  to a bigger facility, double their production, hire additional people,  and bought additional supplies in anticipation of it. What happened?  Their loan from the SBA is now on hold because of the Trump shutdown.  It is not clear if it will ever come through. So instead of expanding,  they have to use their own money. They have to use their stockpiles of  mead. They have to take out a loan to make payroll. They are really  hurting, but they told me one thing, even in this difficult time.   Even in this difficult time, they said they were more concerned for  people who have lost paychecks and lifesaving benefits and with others  in their industry who have been harder hit. It is a sense of community  and empathy. I wish President Trump had that same sense of empathy and  caring that they do.   We have to end this shutdown. I call on the majority leader--the  Republican leader--to bring up the bills, which we have already passed  by an overwhelming majority, that would reopen this government.  Democrats and Republicans have voted for them. All we need is for the  Republican leader to bring them up.   Stop the shutdown. Let people go back to their businesses.   I yield the floor.
