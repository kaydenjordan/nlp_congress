 Mr. Speaker, allow me to thank the chairman for  facilitating this bill to the floor and the support of our ranking  member, Mr. Rogers, for this legislation and the work that we do on the  Committee on Homeland Security.   Mr. Speaker, before I start, allow me to acknowledge, with my  thoughts and prayers, the wounded officers and members of the Houston  Police Department who were shot last evening in a senseless shooting.  Four of the officers were shot in the attempt to render a drug warrant,  and one was injured. I understand, of that group, there were several  who are in critical condition.   Thanks to the professional work of the Houston Police Department, two  of the persons perpetrating this crime have been stopped, and I hope  the families of the victim police officers take comfort in the  knowledge that everyone in our community--and, yes, in our Nation--is  praying for the speedy and complete recovery of each of the officers  wounded, injured in this terrible tragedy.   It is because of the importance of law enforcement in the  communication with the Department of Homeland Security that I  reintroduced H.R. 495 to require the Department of Homeland Security's  Office for State and Local Law Enforcement to report annually on its  activities.   As we all know, after the September 11 terrorist attacks, our Nation  learned that the inability of Federal, State, local, Tribal, and  territorial partners to share information was a critical failure in our  national security apparatus. Those of us who happened to be in the  United States Congress at that time saw that as this heinous act was  occurring. It was the first responders, local law enforcement, who all  converged on Ground Zero.   Today, I am proud to say that there has been real progress on closing  this once-prominent information-sharing gap. It is now commonplace  within the Federal Government to support policies that empower and  include our State and local partners. I can assure you, Mr. Speaker, it  is because of the work of the Members of the United States Congress--in  particular, members of the Committee on Homeland Security--who  gradually built this pathway that is so crucial.   I hear it often from my local law enforcement, the importance of  communicating via a two-way street--classified, confidential--with  officials in the Federal Government.    To keep DHS on that path, H.R. 495 requires the Assistant Director of  the DHS office in charge of coordinating, liaising, and advocating for  State and local law enforcement to submit an annual report to Congress  on its work. It is important because we in Congress are the watchdogs  to insist upon that cooperation.   Requiring this report will not only provide metrics to assess the  effectiveness of the Office's current work, but it would include  comprehensive information on existing programs and feedback from law  enforcement agencies themselves. Remember, they are, every day, on the  front lines. They are the first responders to see something and say  something as relates to protecting us against terrorism.   More, this measure would ensure future accountability of the  Department and its work with local partners.    It is no secret that the threat landscape of today  is constantly evolving. What we have learned from this challenge is  there must be proactive measures in place at all levels of the  government to track the growth of and reflect upon our capabilities to  combat crime and terror.   State and local law enforcement provide tireless work to investigate  and apprehend individuals of heinous crime. It is our duty to ensure  that they are able to do their very best work in collaboration with  their Federal partners and keep our communities safe.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to support this very important  legislation, and I also ask for prayers not only for those shot last  night, but the injured officers in my district who were injured on  Christmas Eve, one severely burned--that is two officers, Officer Daily  and Officer Reid. We continue to pray for Officer Daily, who suffered  burns all over his body.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 495, the ``FIRST State and  Local Law Enforcement Act.''   Mr. Speaker. I want to take this time to acknowledge the Houston  police officers injured.   My thoughts and prayers are with the wounded officers and the members  of the Houston Police Department.   The senseless shooting of four of Houston's finest and bravest last  evening, while they were serving a warrant, is a tragedy and another  reminder of the dangers faced by law enforcement officers who risk  their lives to keep their communities safe. One officer injured his  knee. Totaling 5 officers hurt.   Thanks to the swift and professional police work of the Houston  Police Department, two of the persons perpetrating this heinous crime  have been stopped.   I hope the families of the victims take comfort in the knowledge that  everyone in our community is praying for speedy and complete recovery  of each of the officers wounded in this tragedy.   Mr. Speaker, I reintroduced H.R. 495 to require the Department of  Homeland Security's Office for State and Local Law Enforcement to  report annually on its activities.   As we all know, after the September 11th terrorist attacks our Nation  learned that the inability of the Federal, State, local, tribal and  territorial partners to share information was a critical failure in our  national security apparatus.   Today, I am proud to say that there's been real progress in closing  this once prominent information sharing gap.   It is now common practice within the Federal government to support  policies that empower and include our State and local partners.   To keep DHS on that path, H.R. 495 requires the Assistant Director of  DHS' Office in charge of coordinating, liaising, and advocating for  state and local law enforcement to submit an annual report to Congress  on its work.

State and local law enforcement provide tireless work to investigate  and apprehend individuals of heinous crimes.   It is our duty to ensure that they are able to do their best work in  collaboration with their Federal partners to keep our communities safe.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 495, which passed the House on suspension last  Congress, requires DHS' Office of State and Local Law Enforcement to  produce an annual report.   This report documents the office's coordination, liaison, and  advocacy efforts for state and local law enforcement.   Again, I have reintroduced this measure because I believe our  national security is at its best when the Federal government works  together with our State and local partners.   With that, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 495.   I want to take this time to acknowledge the service and fighting  spirit of Houston Police Officers John Daily and Alonzo Reid.   On Christmas Eve, Officers Daily and Reid were responding, with  lights on, to a call for assistance from a fellow officer when they  were hit nearly head on.   Their patrol car rolled several times before it collided with a pole  and caught fire.   Thankfully, both survived the fiery car crash.   Officer Reid showed true heroism when he pulled Officer Daily from  the driver's seat with the assistance of a passer-by, Juan Carlos  Salgado.   Thankfully, Officer Reid was released from the hospital on Christmas  Day.  [[Page H1258]]    However, Officer Daily, who suffered burns to over half his body, has  endured five surgeries and is still in the hospital in serious  condition.   Officers Daily and Reid put service above self every day, including  on Christmas Eve when they were on their way to offer assistance to a  fellow officer.   My thoughts and prayers are with Officer Daily, his family, and  fellow officers for a full recovery.    Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in strong support of  H.R. 495, the FIRST State and Local Law Enforcement Act, which supports  the work of the Department of Homeland Security's Office of State and  Local Law Enforcement (OSLLE) by requiring that an annual report of its  activities be submitted to Congress so that we can be aware of the  range of benefits and services needed by local and state law  enforcement agencies.   The work of law enforcement is rewarding to those who serve, but it  can also be very dangerous.   My thoughts and prayers are with the wounded officers and the members  of the Houston Police Department.   The senseless shooting of five of Houston's finest and bravest last  evening, while they were serving a warrant, is a tragedy and another  reminder of the dangers faced by law enforcement officers who risk  their lives to keep their communities safe.   Thanks to the swift and professional police work of the Houston  Police Department, two of the persons perpetrating this heinous crime  have been stopped.   I hope the families of the victims take comfort in the knowledge that  everyone in our community is praying for speedy and complete recovery  of each of the officers wounded in this tragedy.   The basis for creating the office is one of 33 recommendations of the  9/11 Commission, which called for a primary coordinator, liaison, and  advocate for state, local, tribal, and territorial law enforcement  agencies.   This legislation mandates that OSLLE also leads the coordination of  DHS's policies related to state, local, tribal, and territorial law  enforcement's role in preventing, preparing for, protecting against,  and responding to natural disasters, acts of terrorism and other man- made disasters.   As a member of the Committee on Homeland Security, I am very much  aware of the importance of the work performed by the men and women who  protect us from terrorism.   Homeland Security is defined as:   ``the national effort to ensure a homeland that is safe, secure, and  resilient against terrorism and other hazards where American interests,  aspirations, and ways of life can thrive to the national effort to  prevent terrorist attacks within the United States, reduce the  vulnerability of the U.S. to terrorism, and minimize the damage from  attacks that do occur''   I am proud to have so many first responders as friends, and I am  committed to working tirelessly to assure that they have the full  support of Congress in getting the resources and training they need to  protect our communities.   This bill will provide an important opportunity for DHS to report on  this vital work with state and local law enforcement agencies.   The sacrifices made by our men and women in state and local law  enforcement all too often go unnoticed.   One example of their heroism and bravery was seen when Houston Police  Officers Alonzo Reid and John Daily were involved in a Christmas Eve  car crash.   On Christmas Eve, Officers Daily and Reid were responding, with  lights on, to a call for assistance from a fellow officer when they  were hit nearly head on.   Their patrol car rolled several times before it collided with a pole  and caught fire.   Thankfully, both survived the fiery car crash.   Officer Reid showed true heroism when he pulled Officer Daily from  the driver's seat with the assistance of a passerby, Juan Carlos  Salgado.   Thankfully, Officer Reid was released from the hospital on Christmas  Day.   However, Officer Daily, who suffered burns to over half his body, has  endured five surgeries and is still in serious medical condition.   I ask my colleagues to join me in offering prayers and well wishes to  Officer Daily for a fully recovery.   Officers Daily and Reid like tens of thousands of their counter  parts, put service above self every day.   The Department of Homeland Security has been in existence for 16  years, and in that time the men and women who serve on the front lines  of defending the United States against terrorist acts at home have not  wavered in their commitment.   During times of crisis, the relationships among federal, state, and  local law enforcement agencies is proven to be of the greatest value to  an effective government wide response.   On August 25, 2017, Hurricane Harvey made landfall in Texas.   Local, state, and federal first responders rescued 122,331 people.   The Coast Guard deployed 2,060 personnel, 50 aircraft, 75 boats and  29 cutters, rescuing 11,022 people and 1,384 pets.   FEMA deployed 28 Urban Search and Rescue (USAR) teams from across the  nation to Texas to assist state and local agencies with the lifesaving  mission.   This is in addition to the tens of thousands of meals, water,  supplies, and public assistance that were also provided.   Hurricane Harvey's Federal, state, and local response agencies  benefit from collaborating with DHS.   Because the DHS office plays a significant role in the required  outreach to state and local law enforcement entities it is important  that the Committee on Homeland Security be kept apprised of its work.   Today, DHS is not funded due to the Trump Shutdown.   It is shameful that 85 percent of DHS employees are either working  with no paycheck or have been furloughed.   These men and women work for Cybersecurity and Infrastructure  Security Agency, Customs and Border Protection, Citizenship and  Immigration Services, Federal Emergency Management Agency, U.S. Coast  Guard, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Secret Service, and  Transportation and Security Administration.   It has been reported that many DHS employees have described feeling  depressed, stressed out, anxious, uncomfortable, and insecure because  of the Trump Shutdown.   It is time to end the Trump Shutdown.   This bill will need DHS fully staffed and functioning to ensure that  the reporting requirement of this bill are fulfilled so that the  federal, state, and local agencies working with DHS receive the support  that they need.   For this reason, I ask that my colleagues join me in voting for H.R.  495.    Madam Speaker, as we put the pieces back together  again, the Budget Committee had a meeting with the Congressional Budget  Office director. We know that it is clear that during this shutdown,  the Nation lost $11 billion; $3 billion of it will not be recoverable.  A shutdown is foolish. It hurts the American people.   And I am committed: One, to increase the pay of American workers,  Federal workers, tomorrow, and, as well, to reflect that a shutdown  should not hold our patriotic fellow workers hostage.   I ask my colleagues to join me in that.   Today, however, I am excited that I am introducing a bill, which is  H.R. 835, the Anti-Doping Act, with Dr. Burgess and, of course, in the  other body, Senator Wicker and Senator Whitehouse, that deals with the  World Anti-Doping Agency that failed to suspend the Russian Anti-Doping  Agency for missing a crucial December 31, 2018, deadline, and for the  violations at the Olympics.   Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join in supporting this  legislation. Let's get doping out of the Olympics. Let's have sports  that are fair and square and to do what is right for these wonderful  young athletes.                            ____________________
