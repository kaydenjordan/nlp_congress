 Will the Senator yield for a unanimous consent request?    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at the  conclusion of remarks by our leader, Mr. McConnell, I be recognized for  45 minutes.    I have no objection.    Mr. President, let me, first of all, join my friend from  Illinois in this tribute he is making to Tammy and the baby. I do have  to correct him on one thing, however. He talked about diaper bags. They  don't use diaper bags anymore. They are disposable diapers. I know  because I have 20 kids and grandkids. But I agree with the Senator's  remarks wholeheartedly.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I know there is a lot of competition for  the time right now, and I feel badly that I finally got to the point  where, in order to get the message out--it is a message many people  think is not significant, but I assure you that this is of grave  importance not just to a country but to the entire continent of Africa.   The House of Representatives, just last week, passed H. Res. 128 to  chastise one of our closest allies on the African continent, Ethiopia.  Although the legislation claims to support Ethiopia, the reality is  that the resolution is outdated. It was written years ago and was  blindly passed without consideration for the current situation in  Ethiopia. It was also passed under a voice vote so that no one member  of Congress would have to carry the stigma of being on the record  voting for it.   I know the House passed it because most of them have never been to  Ethiopia and don't really know the miracle we have seen in that  country. I know the transformation Ethiopia has made in economic and  social development alongside their ongoing commitment to establishing  security in the Horn of Africa.   Since 2005, I have visited Ethiopia 18 different times, engaging and  developing relationships with Prime Ministers, with Cabinet Ministers,  legislators, businessmen, aid workers, and everyone else in between.  There isn't another Member of Congress who has traveled in Ethiopia,  engaged with the Ethiopian Government and the Ethiopian people more  than I have.   I say this for a reason. It is to show that I know something about  Ethiopia. I know we have been here before. What happened last week has  happened before. People don't even know it. So they passed a negative  resolution on Ethiopia by voice vote. The resolution fails to  understand the history of Ethiopia. I want to talk about that.   Ethiopia is the oldest independent country in all of Africa, but one  that is newly democratic. It is all new to them.   There is also a Christian history to the nation, which nobody else  has on the continent of Africa. Ethiopia is featured in both the Old  Testament and the New Testament.   In the New Testament, we hear about Philip. This is in Acts 8. Philip  meets the Ethiopian eunuch on the road to Damascus. We find out later  that the eunuch was actually the treasurer of the country of Ethiopia  at that time. Philip told the eunuch about Jesus. He talked about the  Old Testament and the Queen of Sheba and Solomon. There are over 50 of  these mentions in the Bible. They had long conversations about Jesus.   Philip was making these comments. Before the conversation was over,  he baptized the eunuch. The eunuch went off to Ethiopia and took the  first word of Jesus to Ethiopia. That is very significant.   Coincidentally, while Addis Ababa is the capital of Ethiopia, there  was a time when Aksum was the capital. That was many years ago. During  the time of the Queen of Sheba, that was the capital of Ethiopia.   Coincidentally, I happened to be in Ethiopia when a farmer in a field  ran into some old relics, and they started excavating. They found out  that was the palace of the Queen of Sheba. There had been discussion as  to whether or not the Queen of Sheba was from Yemen or Ethiopia, but  that was concrete proof they had discovered that it was the case. The  story goes on and on.   We all know about the Queen of Sheba and Solomon. Solomon had all the  wealth in the world, and she wanted to meet Solomon. She went down to  the Red Sea to see Solomon. Well, she got to Israel and she met  Solomon. They were engaged very closely together. I think we all know  that they ended up having a son who went back to his country.   By the way, the part of the Old Testament I am quoting right now is  in 1 Kings 10:1. That is about the trip between Israel and Ethiopia.  Sheba and Solomon had a boy. The boy was Menelik. He was a very smart  person. As he was growing up in years, before returning to their home  country in Ethiopia, he actually took the Ark of the Covenant back to  Ethiopia, where it is today in Aksum.   A lot of people don't know that. If anyone questions what I am saying  right now, there is a book written that was called ``The Sign and the  Seal,'' by Graham Hancock. It is very well-documented. When you read  that, you come to the conclusion that this is where the Ark of the  Covenant is. I have been to the Ark of the Covenant with many Members  of the Senate here--certainly, Senator Boozman from Arkansas, Senator  Mike Enzi from Wyoming, Senator Mike Rounds from South Dakota, and many  others. We have been up there and we have actually seen where this has  taken place.   I say this because there is that very rich history. It is all  documented in both the Old Testament and the New Testament.   The current controversy, and why we are here today, started back in  the 1970s with a man named Mengistu. From 1974 to 1991, Mengistu was  the leader of the communist Derg. This was the controlling party at  that time. It is a communist party. They ran Ethiopia. It was a  terrible time for Ethiopia. That was during one of the worst famines  they had, which killed over a million people--perhaps the most  significant famine in history in terms of deaths.   Many Ethiopians fled during that time and relocated in the United  States. That is understandable. The communists were booted out. A lot  of the people, during the time they were still in, came to the United  States.   It is interesting because the Ethiopians are very outstanding people.  They are the kind that get things done when other people don't. That  makes them different from all the other countries in Africa.   So a lot of these Ethiopians came to America, and they have made  great, really remarkable contributions to America, building  organizations and getting involved. Rightfully so, they were outspoken  against the brutal regime, but they haven't changed their outspokenness  to reflect the changing conditions in Ethiopia.   At the time that this took place, one person who was responsible, to  a large extent, for getting rid of the communists and the communist  threat in Ethiopia was a guy named Meles. He ran, he came from the  bush, and he won. He ended up as Prime Minister. This is really the  election that a lot of people don't like, and they forget about the  fact that he was the Prime Minister who actually got rid of the  communists in Ethiopia.   So he became a Prime Minister. He started to build democracy. He died  in 2012. I got to know him quite well during that timeframe, and I saw  the progress that he made and the advances they made.   He was then replaced by another Prime Minister, whose name is  Hailemariam. Now, he became Prime Minister, and he continued to push  for democracy. Hailemariam worked diligently to improve things.   Under his tenure, Ethiopia established the independent Ethiopian  Human Rights Committee to report on violence and human rights problems  and abuses. They didn't just establish  [[Page S2285]]  it; they acted on it. They came out with a report and acted on it to  hold perpetrators accountable and to make the improvements that were  being made. Our relationship wasn't just government to government; it  was brother to brother.   In February of 2017, Prime Minister Hailemariam suggested that, since  the provinces were all fighting at that time--there were nine provinces  in Ethiopia. Each province has a Governor. We suggested on the phone,  with the Members of the Senate here and the House at a Prayer  Breakfast, that what we ought to do is that we ought to follow the  recommendation of Eisenhower. He said--in fact, this is right after  World War II: The problems of this world are so great that we will  never resolve the problems until we learn to sit down and pray  together. So we decided: Let's get all the Governors, the Prime  Minister, the Members of the House, the Senate, and the rest together,  and we will pray for them.   We did this. In fact, I had five Senators with me at that time, and  we went over. The problem was only two Governors showed up. So 8 months  later, we came back and put together the same thing and talked to them  to let them know what this is all about. And it happened 8 months  later. We were just talking about it just recently.   We had nine Governors who had been fighting. Hailemariam and we all  prayed together.   Now, at the same time, there was a Congressman, Randy Hultgren, over  at the House, who happened to be president of the House Prayer  Breakfast. The time change worked perfectly. At the time we were  praying there, if you took the 7-hour differential, they were meeting  at the House Prayer Breakfast here in Washington. So he joined in. Now,  I am not smart enough to figure out how they do this. It is some kind  of thing called Skype, where you can get on TV and communicate. So they  were praying over there with all of these House Members at the same  time that we were praying. On top of that, we had a bunch of great  pages, like the pages sitting right in front of me today, all praying  at the same time. This was going on all over America.   So they all got together, and it worked--the same group of people who  had just hated each other, who had never been in the same room before.  The Prime Minister and all of us--Members of the Senate and others who  were there--were all rejoicing and embracing each other.   That's really significant. The 9 governors had never been together  before. The majority of Americans can't easily grasp this, but is  different in Ethiopia. Most of the people don't live in cities, and  that made this effort that much more difficult. That is the reverse of  the rest of the world. The vast majority of people who live there are  in rural communities, and that made this widespread change and  development a longer and more difficult path.   In Ethiopia, the tribal factions also play a greater role. Anyone who  has been there understands this. If you go from Province to Province,  that used to be from tribe to tribe, and they historically have not  gotten along until this time. So it made it more difficult because of  the factions and all of that, but it worked. We unified them together,  and that was unlike anything that has ever happened.   Earlier this month, Ethiopia took another step to showing their  commitment to a free and fair democracy by selecting a new Prime  Minister. And who is this? His name is Abiy Ahmed, a doctor.   In fact, it is kind of interesting, if you think about his  credentials. Just listen to this. Abiy received his first degree, a  bachelor's degree, in computer engineering from the Microlink  Information Technology College in Addis. That was in 2001.   In 2005, Abiy earned a postgraduate certificate in cryptography in  South Africa. He holds a master of arts in transformational leadership  and change with merit, earned at the Business School in Greenwich  University in London, in collaboration with the International  Leadership Institute in Addis, in 2011. He holds a master of business  administration from the Leadstar College of Management and Leadership  in Addis, in partnership with Ashland University in Ohio.   In 2017, Abiy was awarded a Ph.D. from the Institute for Peace and  Security Studies at Addis Ababa University.   Now, we haven't studied it all the way through, but what we did is we  took a cursory look at that, and we believe he is the most highly  educated Prime Minister in the history of the continent.   Here we are with this Dr. Abiy, who has been specially selected for  his commitment to democracy, good governance, and the rule of law. I  met Abiy for the first time in February of 2016 at a leader's  breakfast, where he told the story of his journey of faith in Jesus. He  is very, very articulate, someone who no one would forget about.   We met a year later, when we prayed and talked about how to unify the  country in peace, not conflict. It is from these meetings that I know  that Abiy is committed to democracy and the future of Ethiopia. He is  showing that with his actions as well.   Last week, he specifically sought to engage the opposition party and  its leaders. He said:         We want to work hand in hand with you. What we say and do       must match.    Since his inauguration, he has also restored the internet service all  across the country, and he has released 11 high-profile dissidents.  This is what we need to be encouraging, not delegitimizing his  authority with a heavy handed resolution. After his first week in  office, the first week in office, they passed this resolution--this  hateful resolution over at the House.   He is also the youngest head of state in all of Africa. Abiy is just  41 years old. He shows an optimistic and engaged future for Ethiopia--a  country where 70 percent of the population is less than 35 years old.  He deserves a chance to enact the democratic reforms he called for  during his inaugural address, before being slapped with a condemnation  of his government by a House of Representatives resolution.   They have quite an opportunity. Ethiopia is one of the fastest  growing economies in the region, and it has made great strides in  lowering the poverty rate. But the resolution that passed last week  wasn't about this. They didn't talk about everything that I just  articulated.   Ethiopia is also an important partner for us in promoting regional  peace and security. We have all recently seen how Islamic terrorists  are pushing from the Middle East and regrouping and establishing  themselves across Africa. This is the thing that he has inherited. That  is what he is in right now.   Ethiopia has been an important partner for the United States in  combating the spread of terrorism from Somalia and al-Qaida. He is our  closest partner in this effort.   As terrorism grows through Djibouti and the Horn of Africa into  northeastern Africa, this is a threat to global security. Ethiopia has  been a critical partner for the United States in combating that spread  of terrorism.   Ethiopia is the top African contributor to U.N. peacekeeping troops  and supplies about 8 percent of the global peacekeeping force. It is  not the second or among the first. He was No. 1--the first one to be a  contributor to the U.N. peacekeeping effort. Those are contributions  they have made. Other countries have not done that, but they have.   More than that, Ethiopia's professional and capable military has also  been a positive force in regional stability. When we had problems in  parts of Africa--and Somalia comes to mind right now--when we call upon  them to send troops, they are the first ones who respond, and they are  the ones who send the most of their capable troops.   Ethiopia was a regional stabilizer during the crisis with Sudan and  South Sudan. I think we all remember when Sudan was one unified  country, and they had not always gotten along with South Sudan. South  Sudan had been trying to get their independence for years and years,  and, finally, they were successful, and right after that, it looked  like it wasn't going to work.   But the resolution last week didn't consider any of the progress  Ethiopia has made and the leadership they have provided.   Beyond just the government, more good things are happening in  Ethiopia than I have ever seen. The people are not just like other  people. There is not time, but I could give so many examples. I will  single out just one family  [[Page S2286]]  who is really typical of what is going on in Ethiopia.   We have longtime friends there--Marta Gabre-Tsadick and her husband  Demeke Tekle-Wold. I will refer to them as Marta and Demeke. They  founded an organization called Project Mercy. This is kind of  interesting. This wasn't government. This is what they have done and  are trying to do in their country.   It is kind of interesting because Marta, as a very young girl, went  to work for Haile Selassie. We all know Haile Selassie and what a hero  he was before the communists came in in 1974 and murdered him and took  over the country. Marta actually had worked for him at one time.   They received political asylum in the United States in the early  1970s, after the communist takeover in Ethiopia, only to return to the  country to care for, as they say, the ``least of these.'' That is what  they have been doing.   Marta wrote a book that should be required reading so people would  know the sacrifices that people make to escape communism. The name of  her book is ``Sheltered by the King.''   In fact, if any of you want a copy of it, I will give it to you.   It tells the story about the communist takeover when Haile Selassie  was murdered. It was about their escape from the communists.   Throughout the years, I have partnered with Marta and Demeke on  several occasions. In 2008, I worked with the USAID. At that time, we  had a guy, who, unfortunately, wasn't able stay there very long. He was  head of the USAID. At that time, they prioritized the shipment of 43  containers of Atmit. This is during the time of starvation. Amit is a  nutritional supplement that was sent to young children, to those in the  most severe stages of starvation.   Ethiopia was hit especially hard in the global economic crisis, and  these containers equaled 600 tons of food to feed 27,000 severely  malnourished children.   The story of Marta and Demeke is kind of interesting because they  started out in Addis, the capital. They started out in a small house,  getting three or four young men--boys--uneducated and taught them the  Scriptures, taught them how to read and write, taught them all of these  things, and then how to put together an economy and get these people so  that they can go out on their own. They were successful.   That grew from 3 people to 6 people to 100 people. Then they went  down to a part of Africa, a part of Ethiopia, that is really  interesting. It is called Yetabon. Yetabon is interesting because that  is an area where there wasn't any civilization. It was in the bush, on  the side of a mountain.   I went down to Yetabon to see. This is some time ago. I was thrilled  that Raj Shah, the Administrator of USAID, accepted my invitation to go  down there to see Yetabon and to see what they have done down there.  When you stopped and looked in that remote area, with the two of them  alone, it is not just a matter of 10, 12, or 100 kids, but 1,700 kids  were all lined up, K through 12, smiling with big smiles. Their lives  had been changed, and all of that took place down there.   I remember that there was a terrible storm down there as we were  leaving, and it was all muddy. I told Raj: Anyone under age 70, get out  and push. I was the only one exempted, of course. Anyway, he saw the  significance of the resource of the Ethiopian people and the progress  the country had made in furthering democracy and stabilizing the  region.   USAID is now headed up by another person who loves Africa, Mark  Green. I remember Mark Green. He used to be the Ambassador to Tanzania.  He is a close friend of mine. I actually served with him at one time  back at the House.   Raj recognized the genius of the Ethiopian people. We are privileged  to deliver a another program they put together, where they would  crossbreed cows and start dairy farms in the area close to Addis. It  has been a very successful program. Keep in mind that this is all as a  result of one family.   I could give examples of this all over the country in Ethiopia. The  technical assistance and training to improve the products that they  have were done all by one family. All that was largely from Demeke.   There is another person who is set aside from other countries in  Africa, and that is a doctor named Hamlin. She actually started the  Hamlin Fistula Hospital. Fistula is a disease that people who are  pregnant could have. It is fatal in many cases. It is very unique to  that part of Africa. So they have an organization working alongside the  Ethiopian Government to provide sustainable solutions to the Hamlin  Fistula Hospital. It has been a haven for the care of women.   All of this one person started. This is the character of the people.  They started treating women in Ethiopia's busy capital city of Addis  since 1959. It has now grown to an additional five regional hospitals,  a midwifery college, and a rehabilitation center for long-term  patients.   I and my wife Kay visited the hospital along with Senator Enzi's  wife, Diana, and Senator Boozman's wife, Cathy. We saw the miracle that  is taking place there--all because of one woman. It is typical of the  people you find in Ethiopia.   They saw the impact that the hospital is making to the lives of women  throughout the country to be able to deliver their baby safely and be  treated with dignity for childbirth injuries.   So much of this development and progress is due to the emergence of  past and present African leaders such as the recently sworn in Prime  Minister, Dr. Abiy Ahmed, who are investing in the lives of their  people, and the realization by the United States of the strategic  importance to Africa.   They are important. They have joined us in every effort--every  military effort--that we have had, more than any other country. None of  that was considered by the House last week when they passed this  shortsighted resolution.   I tried to work with key sponsors of the resolution to make needed  changes to reflect the fact of Ethiopia's progress, but my efforts were  unsuccessful. They wouldn't listen to me. I still can't figure out why  it is that a handful of people who probably have never, ever been to  Ethiopia were doing this to that country. The resolution made a lot of  claims that said that ``democratic space in Ethiopia has steadily  diminished since the general elections of 2005'' and that the ruling  party ``claimed 100 percent of the parliamentary seats'' in the 2015  elections--continued insults to our closest friends in Africa. But the  democratic space in Ethiopia has never been more vibrant, as the  numbers speak for themselves. There were more opposition candidates in  the 2015 election than there have ever been in any election in the  history of Ethiopia.    In 2015, the African Union observers--they were the ones who were  observing the election, and they concluded that the elections had been  free, peaceful, and credible and had provided an opportunity for the  Ethiopian people to express their choices at the polls. Overall, the AU  observers offered conclusions and recommendations to the government,  the electoral board, the political parties, and to the media to  strengthen that process, and that has been successful.   The resolution inaccurately stated that the ruling party claimed to  have won 100 percent of the parliamentary seats. That is not true at  all. There is no truth at all in that. In fact, that is not a ruling  party. The EPRDF is not one party; it is a coalition of four major  political parties with proportional representation from four regions;  namely, from Oromia, Amhara, and some of the other southern nations.   The resolution also claimed that peaceful protests were often  hijacked by violent events.   Last year, there were protests and demonstrations in part of Oromia  and Amhara, in that region, and it did grow violent.   Ethiopia has a duty to ensure law and order like any other country,  and that is exactly what they did. They openly acknowledged that people  have legitimate grievances and expressed their willingness to address  those. They are making strides. The second National Human Rights Action  Plan--the current ruling party has embarked on a dialogue with 222  opposition parties. The United States should allow this dialogue to  continue free of interference.  [[Page S2287]]    This resolution wasn't new. The House of Representatives did this in  2007 also. By the way, they also did this by voice vote then because no  one wanted to be tied to something that they had to vote on without  really knowing what it was all about. So they did it in 2007. I don't  think the outcome of that was ever discussed, so I am going to tell the  story now.   The 2007 resolution claimed that its purpose was to ``encourage and  facilitate the consolidation of peace and security in Ethiopia,'' but  in reality, it focused only on the shortcomings while blatantly  ignoring the unprecedented progress the country had made.   I went to Ethiopia 3 weeks after the House voted in 2007. The  resolution was reported widely for weeks in the Ethiopian press as the  United States sharply criticizing Ethiopians, the same as they did last  week. It caused great confusion and anger with the Ethiopian people,  who were emerging from Communist rule. You could argue that at the time  this happened, the people were protesting the administration under  Prime Minister Meles. Probably they were saying that they prefer the  Communists because this is something he was responsible for changing at  that time.   So they had that resolution. It was reported that it hurt them and  hurt their reputation around the world, caused great confusion and  anger with the Ethiopian people, who were emerging from a Communist  rule and working with democracy.   I met with Prime Minister Meles on that trip, and he said that the  House vote really hurt our relationship with Ethiopia. I remember  exactly what he said to me. He said: Our survival depends on  democratization.   He was also open and honest about the problems they had in the 2005  election. He acknowledged the riots and that better training could have  prevented the deaths of some seven policemen. That is not the story we  hear. We hear about hundreds of people dying, but that is simply not  the case.   Prime Minister Meles also noted that they were being singled out for  criticism and sanctions when Eritrea--an autocratic government that  openly gave refuge to terrorists--faced no such condemnation. He stated  that he felt insulted by the bill, as well he should have.   When I was visiting with Azeb, Meles's wife--by the way, Azeb and  Meles fought together in the feud that took over the country from  communism, in the bush. When she asked me how the United States could  attack our friends in this way, I didn't have an answer for that.  Remember, we are friends. Ethiopia has been a partner on the global War  on Terror and has contributed troops to peacekeeping missions and  supports regional security efforts.   We also met with a group of Ethiopian citizens in Addis who had  returned to Ethiopia to rebuild the nation. They had returned in the  mid-2000s because it was the first time they had confidence in the  government to return. They were very frustrated and disappointed by the  resolution.   Today I am sure that Prime Minister Abiy and the Ethiopian people are  also confused and frustrated by this resolution. I want to speak now to  our friends in Ethiopia who may be feeling abandoned by the United  States and questioning our partnership and friendship in such a  critical part of the world.   This resolution, while offensive to you, does not change your  friendship with the United States.   I want to repeat that. I want to make sure people know that the  resolution, while it is offensive to you, doesn't change your  friendship with the United States.   We have a long history of economic and military cooperation that will  continue, and Ethiopia is only gaining momentum as a nation. This is  apparent when you look at Ethiopia's economy, their military, and the  U.S.-Ethiopia trade relationship that they are now building with our  country. Ethiopia ranks among the fastest growing economies in the  world. This is significant: Despite the recent drought, the IMF  estimates that Ethiopia will have an average GDP growth rate of 7.4  percent from 2017 to 2020.    This is what I would have said yesterday, but something happened  yesterday that I didn't know was going to happen. Yesterday, in the  latest World Economic Outlook, the IMF announced that Ghana had lost  its position as the fastest growing economy in Africa, and they lost it  to Ethiopia. Ethiopia now has the fastest growth--8.5 percent. We in  the United States would love to have an 8.5-percent economic growth  rate.   Total U.S. direct investment, including partnerships, stands at more  than $567 million, with more than $65 million originating solely from  the United States.   The United States has a positive trade balance with Ethiopia,  particularly in manufacturing, energy, and agricultural processing.   Over the past 70 years, Ethiopian Airlines has purchased more than  100 U.S.-origin aircraft.   In 2016 alone, Ethiopia utilized over $149 million worth of U.S.  agricultural products, including wheat, coffee, and oil seeds.   The United States continues to provide assistance to support  Ethiopia's agricultural development. Through the USDA, the 3-year, $13  million Food for Progress Program--known as the FEED project--helps to  improve yields of milk, meat, eggs, and other products by increasing  the availability and quality of livestock feed.   The U.S. International Military Education and Training Program--by  the way, that is called IMET--the IMET Program was put together many  years ago so that when our troops go into other areas, they mingle with  the troops there, and then we invite the troops from the various  countries to come into the United States and get their training here.  We found out that once the training takes place in this country, we  have their allegiance for the rest of the time they are there. They  have been working to train future leaders here in the United States and  create a rapport between the United States and the Ethiopian military.  They had over 600 members from 2010 to 2015--one of our most successful  IMET programs, working military to military.   Along with their own successes, Ethiopia has established itself as a  world player. Ethiopia and the United States belong to a number of the  same organizations, including the United Nations, the International  Monetary Fund, and the World Bank. The nation is an observer to the  World Trade Organization and is currently serving on the United Nations  Security Council as a nonpermanent member.   So I say to my colleagues in the Senate, I would like to remind you  that with the passing of resolution 128, we are repeating the past.  That is exactly what they did a few years ago. That doesn't mean we  have to do it again in the future. Ethiopia is a key friend, and Prime  Minister Abiy--just keep in mind, here is a guy who is the highest  educated Prime Minister we think in the entire history of the entire  continent of Africa. He deserves a chance for a strong start.   I will continue to fight for that strong friendship in Congress, and  I urge the United States to give them the chance they have rightly  earned. Clearly, resolution 128 does not reflect America's relationship  with Ethiopia, one of our most valued allies in all of Africa.   ``Are you listening?'' I asked my brother. Prime Minister Abiy,  America is with you. America is with you.   I yield the floor.   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
