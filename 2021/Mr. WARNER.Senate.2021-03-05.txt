 Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 1391 and ask that  it be reported by number.    I ask unanimous consent that there be 2 minutes equally  divided.    My colleagues, I think this may be the last amendment. It  is broadly bipartisan. This amendment simply continues provisions that  were included in the earlier COVID relief packages.   It was called section 3610, and it ensures that our classified  government contracting workforce--a workforce that oftentimes takes  many years to receive top-level security clearance--continues to be  compensated through the balance of the fiscal year. Failure to do this  would lose this workforce to private sector and other competitors and  seriously put our national security at risk.   I point out this is an independent bill of this nature that cleared  unanimously earlier this week on this side of the aisle.   I yield the balance of my time to Senator Rubio.    Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.
