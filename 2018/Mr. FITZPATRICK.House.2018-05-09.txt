 Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to recognize a woman who  has worked tirelessly to make our communities back home a better place  to live, work, and raise a family. Her decades of experience as a  jurist, nonprofit executive, and an author mark a remarkable career of  public service.   Judge Renee Cardwell Hughes, just last month, was the 2018 recipient  of the Pearl S. Buck International Woman of Influence Award in  Perkasie, Bucks County, Pennsylvania. During her tenure, Judge Cardwell  Hughes has shown a sustained commitment to justice, presiding over some  of Philadelphia's most noteworthy homicide cases. She was also a fierce  advocate for fairness in our legal system, founding Philadelphia's  mental health court.   Judge Cardwell Hughes most recently served as CEO of the American Red  Cross of Eastern Pennsylvania, which serves over 6 million  Pennsylvanians.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to extend my gratitude to Judge Cardwell  Hughes for her service and congratulate her on this well-deserved  award.                            ____________________
