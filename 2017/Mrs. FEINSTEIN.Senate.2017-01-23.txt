 Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from  Kansas for giving me the opportunity to make some remarks for the  record.  [[Page S379]]    I support Mike Pompeo to be Director of the CIA. I want to make clear  that Congressman Pompeo has committed to following the law with respect  to torture. He committed, during his open hearing, to a question I  asked, to refuse any orders to restart the CIA's use of enhanced  interrogation techniques that fall outside of the Army Field Manual.   However, what has happened is that his written answers to my  questions for the record on torture appear to leave open the  possibility that he would be open to the CIA carrying out these  practices again in the future. I have had an opportunity to discuss  this with Congressman Pompeo, and I asked him today to give me some  statements from him that I could put directly into the record in that  regard, and I wish to share these responses. I received them today,  prepared by his staff.   Let me quote. ``By law, any agency interrogations will be limited to  techniques in the Army Field Manual.''   ``The Army Field Manual explicitly prohibits waterboarding and other  techniques.''   He further recommitted to the promise he made at his hearing that he  ``would `absolutely not' comply with an order that violates the law,  including an order to restart a program with techniques that violated  the limitations in the Army Field Manual.''   Additionally, he clarified his comments regarding which experts he  intends to consult at the CIA and other organizations in the government  regarding the Army Field Manual. This is where there was particularly-- I think in the Daily Beast, this question was raised, as well as in  other places, so I want to clear it up. Here is his statement: He  ``would listen to any items raised by the High-Value detainee  Interrogation Group''--which we call the HIG--``or other career  intelligence professionals that any improvements were needed to the  Army Field Manual based on their professional experience.''   Moreover, he promised to provide objective analysis of Iran's  compliance with the nuclear agreement and insisted that he would keep  the Senate informed of all CIA activities in that regard.   Additionally, he has promised to put aside his previous political  considerations, and he has committed to providing the President and the  Congress with independent, objective intelligence analysis.   Certainly, I, and certainly others, intend to hold him to these  commitments. For these reasons, I am clearly voting for his  confirmation and look forward to working closely with him on the Senate  Intelligence Committee to make sure strong congressional oversight of  the CIA continues.   I thank the Chair.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, today I wish to express my deep sorrow  on the passing of Tim Mitchell. Through his absolute dedication to this  institution and the special kind of person he was, Tim made the Senate  a better place.   Tim served as the assistant secretary for the minority. As Senator  Reid shared during his September remarks in celebration of Tim's 25  years of exemplary service, Tim began his career in the Senate working  for Senator Don Riegle, Jr., of Michigan.   He later worked for Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota and the  Democratic Policy & Communications Committee before joining the  Democratic floor staff in 2001. Tim also took night classes at Catholic  University of America Columbus School of Law--an impressive feat.   The Senate often calls for long days and longer nights. Debates on  the floor may get heated, rollcall votes may drag on for hours, but Tim  always kept a calm temperament and kind demeanor. He was soft spoken,  but firm--not an easy feat while juggling the Members of this body's  unique needs and passions.   He was simply the best at what he did, and he made a real difference  in how the Senate worked. The value of his service is incalculable.   To Tim's family--his wife, Alicia, and his 11-year-old son, Ben--I am  so sorry for your loss. I am forever grateful that you shared Tim with  us for so many years.   I echo Senator Reid's previous remarks: Tim's time here changed the  Senate and this country for the better.                            ____________________
