 Thank you, Mr. Chairman.   I certainly agree with and really understand and appreciate all the  comments the chairman just made about  [[Page S2459]]  Matt Pollard. He was the person I worked most closely with in the intel  community. He served his country his whole adult life. He loved his  country. He loved his work. He understood the importance of protecting,  advancing, and defending who we are.   The chairman pointed out his real dedication to his son. Often, Matt  would come over to my office for a topline indication of what we were  going to be doing when we got to the Intel Committee. Since you really  can't talk about that until you get to the Intel Committee, a sure way  to get a good conversation going was to say: Tell me about that son of  yours. He would have chapter and verse of what had happened in the last  few days of the things he was doing with Brad.   He was really appreciated by his coworkers. I talked to the Chaplain  yesterday. He went to see our Intel team moments after they found out  about the loss of Matt Pollard, and the Chaplain was impressed by the  emotional sense of loss this whole team felt.   He knew more about his area of expertise than anybody on our staff.  We will miss that, but we will mostly miss him. We are grateful for his  service, grateful for his dedication to his country and his son and the  future of both his country and his family.   I yield back to the chairman.
