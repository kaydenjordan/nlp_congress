 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Comer for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I am grateful that today we are considering my  commonsense resolution, H.J. Res. 42, which would block the  implementation of the D.C. Council's so-called Comprehensive Policing  and Justice Reform Amendment Act of 2022.   H.J. Res. 42 is essential to both increase public safety and combat  rising crime in our Nation's Capital City. For far too long,  Washington, D.C., which is supposed to represent a beacon of freedom,  patriotism, and prosperity for all America, has been overrun by violent  criminals.   As millions of people visit D.C. every year, it is imperative that  our Nation's Capital is safe for all residents and visitors.  Unfortunately, this simply is not the case.   While many local Democrat officials continue to bury their heads in  the sand, such as D.C. Council Chairman Phil Mendelson, who insists  there is ``not a crime crisis in Washington, D.C.,'' the data reveals  the inescapable reality of an out-of-control crime wave taking over our  city.   According to the Metropolitan Police Department, so far this year,  there have already been more than 60 homicides, nearly 50 cases of  sexual abuse, 2,000 incidents of motor vehicle theft, over 750  robberies, 300 burglaries, and more than 2,200 cases of theft from  auto. The list goes on and on. In fact, crime overall is up 25 percent  from last year.   These dangers are widely known across the District, but especially  here on Capitol Hill. In the last few months, both a congressional  reporter and a Member of Congress had the wheels stolen off of their  cars. One of Senator Rand Paul's staffers was horrifically stabbed in  broad daylight. A Member of this body, Congresswoman Angie Craig, was  violently assaulted in an elevator in her apartment building.                                time  1230    Crime is clearly out of control in our Nation's Capital. Who is  charged with protecting the people and streets of Washington?   The Metropolitan Police Department.   Instead of providing MPD officers with the resources, support, and  political backing required to combat crime, the D.C. Council is  determined to kneecap MPD's capabilities, subsequently emboldening  dangerous criminals.   The council's anti-police law creates undue burdens on the MPD. A few  of these policies include: Limiting physical contact with the suspect.  They  [[Page H1854]]  claim it bans choke holds, but choke holds have been banned for  decades, since 1985. So this ban is really just a cheap attempt at a  political talking point. It goes further, placing liability on officers  just for touching near the neck area without any intent whatsoever.   Additionally, this legislation sets MPD officers up for failure by  prohibiting officers from viewing body-worn camera footage when writing  initial reports. This reform requires the Mayor to publicly release the  names of officers in all instances of serious use of force, allowing  radical activists to target officers and their families.   The D.C. Council bill strips the D.C. Police Union of collective  bargaining rights.   It repeals the D.C. code provision that requires the Metropolitan  Police Department to commence disciplinary action against an officer  within 90 business days. This means that officers could be placed under  investigation for an indefinite period of time, which strips their  right to timely due process of law.   Notably, since this legislation has been in effect under emergency  legislative powers since 2020, the MPD has lost almost 1,200 officers  and currently operates at a 500-officer deficit. Officers are  expressing their great concern with their feet and are leaving faster  than they can be replaced. The D.C. police force has been depleted to  an astonishing half-century low.   Undoubtedly, the D.C. Council's misguided legislation has driven out  men and women in blue who protect us, while disincentivizing  individuals to join the force.   Honestly, who can blame them? Who wants to put their life on the line  in a city where local officials continue to put criminals first and  police officers last?   Back in 2020, Mayor Bowser allowed a painted message, ``Defund the  Police,'' to remain on a street near the White House for more than 2  months. Clearly, D.C. officials have made their message abundantly  clear, and they continue to fail the men and women of the Metropolitan  Police Department.   In response, we must be united in supporting MPD officers and  restoring law and order in Washington by blocking the D.C. Council's  legislation. We have both the authority and the responsibility to do  so, just as we repealed the D.C. Council's soft-on-crime Revised  Criminal Code Act just a few weeks ago.   Article 1, Section 8, Clause 17 of the Constitution grants Congress  exclusive legislative authority over Washington's affairs. It is time  to effectively exercise this power yet again to ensure our Nation's  Capital City is safe for all Americans. After all, the heart of our  Republic, Washington, D.C., should be the safest city in this great  Nation.   Public safety is not a partisan issue. It is a commonsense one.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle  to support my resolution, H.J. Res. 42, so we can take the necessary  steps to turn our crime-ridden Capital City into a safe, free, and  prosperous city.
