 Mr. Speaker, years ago, the administration,  working through an international group, had helped to negotiate and put  together an agreement on climate change known as the Kyoto Protocol.  That protocol was resoundingly rejected by the United States Senate.   It actually had provisions in it that indicated that should the  United States in the future end up entering into some sort of climate  agreement or any type of agreement, that there would have to be some  type of a consent by the United States Senate; that this would have to  be presented before the United States Senate.   We don't have a unilateral government. We don't have a dictatorship.  We have scenario whereby we have a Congress, we have a President, and  we work together. In this case what has happened is, under the Obama  administration, these Paris accords were agreed to unilaterally,  meaning they were never submitted to the Congress. They were never  submitted to the United States Senate for approval.   Mr. Speaker, that is why the American people have their  Representatives. Their Representative is their Senator, and that is how  their voice is heard on agreements like this.   Yet, we had a President that unilaterally agreed to the Paris accords  and did not submit it to the United States Senate. So now we have a  President that is saying: Well, this was unilaterally agreed to. I am  unilaterally withdrawing.   We have a bill this week, H.R. 9, that attempts to prevent the  President from withdrawing from this. So I want to stick with procedure  here for just a minute, Mr. Speaker.   We unilaterally entered into an agreement that we don't believe  should have been entered into unilaterally. We think it should have  been presented to the United States Senate. It was not.   Now the President is saying, I am withdrawing. And now this bill is  trying to prevent that. So, on the one hand they think that a President  should be able to unilaterally act, and in another scenario, the  withdrawal that President Trump has proposed, you have folks saying  with H.R. 9 that, no, no, you can't do that. You can't have both. One  or the other, take your pick.   Now, let's actually get into the contents of the agreement. The Paris  accords set targets on emissions reductions for the United States. All  right, so they try and set emissions reductions.   Mr. Speaker, under this agreement, we could eliminate all emissions  from the United States, all greenhouse gases. We can eliminate all of  them, and China can come in and they can emit 10 times what we were  emitting before we cut. Under this agreement that is totally legal. It  doesn't make sense.   To add insult to injury, China can go years and years increasing  emissions; not reducing, increasing. I want to remind you, we live in a  global environment. As much as we like to think we are the only country  in the world, we are not. It is a global environment. If you care about  the whole environment for the entire globe, you have got to look  holistically.   You can't come to the United States and say: Okay, you have to cut  emissions. Yet, in China, they can double, triple, they can go tenfold  increasing their emissions, twentyfold increasing their emissions, and  that is all legal under this agreement. That is inappropriate. If we  care about the global environment, let's care about the global  environment.   Now, to add insult to injury, the agreement also establishes an  entirely different metric for developing countries like China than it  does for the United States.   Now, think about this, if we are in the Olympics; we are running a  race, and you win the race. But then somebody comes, and they say: No,  no we are giving this Chinese runner a 20-second deduction. That is not  fair. And that is what has happened here.   They have an entirely different metric that they are measured by.  Why? If we live in a global environment, if we care about overall  reducing emissions, why are we giving different standards, different  measurements? That is inappropriate. This entire agreement is flawed.   Now, some of you may be sitting there thinking: Well, wait a minute.  I care about the environment. I care about emissions reduction.   Let me read you a statement that was included in the International  Energy Agency's Global Energy & CO2 Status Report.   Here is the statement: ``Emissions in the United States remain around  their 1990 levels, 14 percent and 800 metric tons of CO2  below their peak in 2000.''   Now, here is the kicker. Listen to this statement. ``This is the  largest absolute decline among all countries since 2000.''   I am going to say that again. ``This is the largest absolute decline  among all countries since 2000.''   Let me translate that, Mr. Speaker. What that means is that the  United States, over the last, nearly 20 years, has reduced emissions  greater than every other country.   So, we are actually operating without a requirement, just with an  incentive. We are operating on already reducing emissions. We are  already transitioning to an all-of-the-above energy strategy which  includes solar, which includes wind, which includes geothermal, which  includes hydro, and nuclear, and natural gas, and coal, and oil, and  other things, all of the above, whichever makes the most sense.   We had a hearing today in the Select Committee on the Climate Crisis  and it was fascinating listening to people  [[Page H3331]]  talking about the impact of these energy policies on the poor.   Well, Mr. Speaker, the home State where I am from, south Louisiana,  we have the lowest electricity rates in the United States, the lowest.  The States that have the highest are the ones that are forcing things  that are perverting or distorting markets. Those are the States that  have the highest electricity rates. That disproportionately affects the  poor.    We were citing today an analysis by the Manhattan Institute. In that  analysis, they looked at if you invested $1 million and you could  invest it in solar, you could invest it in wind, or you could invest it  in natural gas and shale--I see my friend here from North Dakota that  represents much of the shale production in the United States--you would  get a sixfold increase in the amount of energy produced by investing it  in shale.   I remind you, Mr. Speaker, transitioning to natural gas results in a  significant reduction in emissions as compared to other sources. It is  part of our existing infrastructure. It is part of a transition plan.  And not to say that we don't ever transition or continue migrating to  renewable sources; it is all of the above.   Don't say all of the above, as President Obama and others did, but  then carry out policies that prevent you or drive up the cost of these  other energy sources. It doesn't make sense and that is what  disproportionately affects the poor.   Mr. Speaker, we have other Members here from the Select Committee on  the Climate Crisis, and I appreciate them being here. I am looking  forward to engaging with them on bringing reality, bringing  practicality to this discussion today.   But I want to say in summary: number one, procedurally, the Paris  accords were flawed. Practically speaking, the targets that were  established disproportionately affect the United States, and it  establishes a different measuring stick, a different standard for us  than it does for China and other countries.   I remind you, Mr. Speaker, China, the country that is here under the  auspices of a developing Nation, this is the country that is spending  billions and billions of dollars around the world on projects in other  countries to improve their national security, their defense, contrary,  in many cases, to the United States and our allies. This is a  developing country. This is inappropriate.   And I will say one last thing in closing. We are the country that  over nearly the last 20 years has had the greatest reduction in  emissions and we have done it by incentivizing, not by coming in and  distorting markets and putting perverse policies in place.   H.R. 9 is a flawed approach that is going to have a disproportionate  impact on the poor. It is going to simply squeeze a balloon in the  middle and make it pop out on the sides where you have more emissions  resulting in China and other countries. Because companies will leave  the United States, jobs will leave the United States if we address this  inappropriately, and they will go to other countries where they will be  less energy efficient. They will release greater emissions into our  global environment. That is not a win.   Mr. Speaker, I urge rejection of H.R. 9. I urge support of involving  the United States Senate, the United States Congress in these  discussions and negotiations, and to develop a true all-of-the-above  energy strategy that incorporates things like incentives, thinks about  our infrastructure network and other important components of ultimately  achieving this objective, which we all share, which is giving a better  planet to future generations.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia, Congressman Buddy  Carter, that, similar to me, represents a coastal district.    Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman  from Georgia for his comments.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from North Dakota (Mr.  Armstrong), who is another member of the House Select Committee on the  Climate Crisis.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  North Dakota for his comments.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from West Virginia (Mrs.  Miller), who represents a lot of the victims of bad energy policy or  energy policy that is not thought out.    Mr. Speaker, might I inquire how much time  is remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I will now close.   Mr. Speaker, it has been fascinating serving on the House Natural  Resources Committee, where we have talked about efforts to stop  pipelines from being built under the auspices of this is protecting our  environment.   Mr. Speaker, study after study has shown that, when you stop  pipelines, it doesn't stop the utilization of oil and gas. What it does  is it puts that on barges, on trains, and on trucks--less safe means of  transportation. The safest thing you can do is put energy in a  pipeline. If you care about the environment, that is what you should  do.   Mr. Speaker, we had a hearing recently in the Natural Resources  Committee where we had a career Department of the Interior official. We  talked to him and asked him: What happens when you try and stop the  supply of energy? Does that reduce the demand for oil and gas?   Do you know what the response was? This person has served in at least  the Clinton administration, all of these different Republican and  Democratic administrations. He said: No. As a matter of fact, we have  researched this extensively. What it does is it causes us to import  more energy.   Mr. Speaker, I remind you of some of the top nations we would import  from: Venezuela, Middle Eastern countries, and Nigeria. We are giving  them billions of dollars.   To put it in perspective on how much this is, Mr. Speaker, in 2011,  58 percent of our Nation's trade deficit was attributable to our  importing energy.   Mr. Speaker, I want to be clear. I am going to reiterate what my  friend from Georgia said.   I have children. I care about the environment. I taught outdoor  education classes for years, and I care about the environment.                                time  1545    I care about the environment. I know that facts can be pesky little  things, but we have to introduce more science and data into these  decisions to make sure that we are making informed, deliberate  decisions that result in a better global environment, not simply coming  in and squeezing the United States to the benefit of China where they  end up releasing greater emissions into our global environment.   That is a flawed strategy. It is what this bill, H.R. 9, would do. I  urge, once again, rejection of this flawed approach.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
