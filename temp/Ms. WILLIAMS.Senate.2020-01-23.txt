 Mr. Chairman, I was asked during the closed-      door testimony how I felt about the call; and, in reflecting       on what I was thinking in that moment, it was the first time       I had heard internally the President reference particular       investigations that previously I had only heard about through       Mr. Giuliani's press interviews and press reporting. So, in       that moment, it was not clear whether there was a direct       connection or linkage between the ongoing hold on security       assistance and what the President may be asking President       Zelensky to undertake in regard to investigations. So I--it       was--it was noteworthy in that regard. I did not have enough       information to draw any firm conclusions.         It was the first I had heard of any requests       of Ukraine which were that specific in nature. So it was       noteworthy to me in that regard.    Mr. Manager CROW. In fact, the hold was formally implemented by OMB  the very day of the call. Just hours after the call between President  Trump and President Zelensky, Duffey sent an email to senior DOD  officials instructing them to put a hold on the security aid. He said  he underscored: ``Given the sensitive nature of the request, I  appreciate your keeping that information closely held to those who need  to know to execute the direction.'' In other words, don't tell anybody  about it. If the President ordered the hold for a legitimate policy  reason, then why did he want to hide it from the rest of the  administration?   President Trump has obstructed Congress's ability to get those  answers. We would like to ask Duffey why they wanted to keep it quiet.  There is more evidence, of course--a lot more. In fact, there is so  much evidence that, according to witnesses, the fact that the security  assistance was conditioned on investigations became as clear as ``two  plus two equals four.'' Everyone knew it. Indeed, with no explanation  for the hold, unanimous support for its release in the administration,  and ongoing efforts by the President's top advisers to pressure Ukraine  into announcing the investigations by holding up the White House  meeting, it became crystal clear, as confirmed by multiple witnesses,  that the only reason for the hold was to put additional pressure on  Ukraine.   David Holmes, the senior official at the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv,  explained.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         GOLDMAN. Mr. Holmes, you have testified that by late August       you had a clear impression that the security assistance hold       was somehow connected to the investigation that President       Trump wanted. How did you conclude that--how did you reach       that clear conclusion?        HOLMES. We'd been hearing about the investigation since       March, months before. President Zelensky had received a       letter, a congratulatory letter, from the President saying       he'd be pleased to meet him following his inauguration in       May. And we hadn't been able to get that meeting, and then       the security hold came up with no explanation. I'd be       surprised if any of the Ukrainians . . . you said earlier, we       discussed earlier, sophisticated people . . . when they       received no explanation for why that hold was in place, they       wouldn't have drawn that conclusion.        GOLDMAN. Because the investigations were still being       pursued?        HOLMES. Correct.        GOLDMAN. And the hold was still remaining without       explanation?        HOLMES. Correct.        GOLDMAN. This to you was the only logical conclusion that       you could reach?        HOLMES. Correct.        GOLDMAN. Sort of like two plus two equals four?        HOLMES. Exactly.    Mr. Manager CROW. And Ambassador Sondland said the same thing.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         GOLDMAN. So, is this kind of a two plus two equals four       conclusion that you reached?        SONDLAND. Pretty much.        GOLDMAN. Is the only logical conclusion to you that, given       all of these factors, that the aid was also a part of this       quid pro quo?        SONDLAND. Yep.    Mr. Manager CROW. Ambassador Sondland didn't reach that conclusion  based only on common sense. It was confirmed by Secretary Pompeo and  Vice President Pence, too.   So let's begin with what Secretary Pompeo knew about the link between  the investigations and the aid. In front of you is an email. At the end  of August, before President Trump canceled his trip to Warsaw to meet  with President Zelensky, Sondland sent an email to Secretary Pompeo in  which he proposed a pull-aside between President Zelensky and President  Trump at the proposed meeting in Warsaw. Three minutes later, Secretary  Pompeo replied ``yes.'' That is it. Ambassador Sondland explained the  email in his testimony.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)
