 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend  their remarks and to submit extraneous material into the Record.    Mr. Speaker, gun violence is the leading  cause of death for American children.   Let me repeat that: Gun violence is the leading cause of death for  our kids. It is shameful that every Member in  [[Page H3688]]  this body knows that guns are used to kill our kids and the Republican  majority is refusing to take any action to stop this epidemic.   Parents are scared to send their kids to school. They are worried  that it may be the last time they see them alive. Kids are being  impacted by active-shooter drills and are scared to death that their  school will be the next site of a school shooting.   The Gun Violence Prevention Task Force is leading efforts in Congress  to compel our Republican colleagues to bring gun violence prevention  measures up for a vote.   The American people are with us on this. The only place that gun  violence prevention is a partisan issue is right here in this Congress.   A recent FOX News poll shows that the American people overwhelmingly  support gun violence prevention measures, 87 percent support universal  background checks, 81 percent support raising the legal age to purchase  firearms to 21, 80 percent support red flag laws, and in this same FOX  poll, 61 percent support banning assault weapons.   It is time for the House Republicans to join House Democrats in  prioritizing saving our kids. Democrats took an important first step in  the last Congress when President Biden signed into law the Bipartisan  Safer Communities Act, which was the first major gun violence  prevention bill signed in 30 years. There is still more work to do.   We are here this evening to shine a spotlight on the failure of the  Republicans to join us in support of policies that will save lives. The  Republican leadership's callous inaction is contributing to a mass  casualty every day in our country. There have been more mass shootings  this year than there have been days in the year.   As a combat veteran, a hunter, and a gun owner, not one Republican  can tell me that background checks interfere with our Second Amendment.   When debating background checks, we have definitively refuted every  tired Republican excuse time and time again. Republicans have countered  with an even more callous response: They respond to every death with  deafening silence.   The Gun Violence Prevention Task Force will continue our work to hold  Republicans accountable for their obstruction. The leading cause of  death of our children and teens demands our attention, and we are  demanding that the House pass legislation to help save lives.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr.  Crow), my friend and colleague from Colorado, and an Army Ranger who  was deployed in both Afghanistan and Iraq.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman  from Pennsylvania, Mary Gay Scanlon.     Mr. Speaker, I would just remind you that  guns are the leading cause of death for children in the United States  of America, and we are here today because we can do something about it.   If you look at this other chart, it clearly points out that, again,  firearms are the leading cause of death. However, if you look at other  factors, the second, motor vehicle accidents, look at the steep decline  in the loss of lives from motor vehicle accidents.   It is because we did something. We passed laws, we made cars safer,  we reduced the number of children who were killed in automobile  accidents by taking action on this floor, and it is shameful that the  Republican leadership will not allow us to do that today to curb  children's death by gun violence.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts  (Mr. Auchincloss).    Mr. Speaker, can you give us any idea  when the Republican leadership will bring bills to deal with gun  violence prevention to the floor for a vote?   I didn't think so.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Michigan (Ms. Scholten).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman  from North Carolina (Mrs. Foushee).    Mr. Speaker, the gentlewoman mentioned  that our Republican colleagues aren't doing anything in regard to guns.  It is actually worse than that. They have done something. The  Republicans passed a bill, a gun bill, off this floor this year. Their  bill would make this gun legal.   Short-barreled rifles have been regulated by the National Firearms  Act for decades. They are regulated because they are incredibly  dangerous, they are easy to conceal, and they are deadly accurate. They  are used in crimes. They are responsible for the deaths of many, many  people, and they have been tightly regulated.   The Republicans in this House passed a bill that makes this gun  legal. They call it an arm brace. ``Arm brace'' is just another way of  saying you are putting a stock on a semiautomatic assault pistol, so  you are making it a short-barreled assault rifle. It is lethal. It is  immoral. Everyone who voted for that bill and the leadership who  brought it to this floor for a vote should be ashamed of themselves.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Michigan (Ms. Tlaib).    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to the time  remaining?    Mr. Speaker, 30 people every day are  killed by someone using a gun. If you add accidental deaths and  suicides, that number jumps up to 100 people per day. It costs the  American taxpayers roughly $600 billion every year. Gun violence costs  almost $600 billion every year. Communities across our country are  upended. We already heard that there have been more mass shootings this  year than there have been days of the year.  [[Page H3690]]    Police officers across the country are taking ghost guns off the  streets every single day, guns that can be purchased as a kit so they  don't need a background check and they are unserialized. These are guns  that are used a lot in crime. Cops are taking them off the streets  every day.   This is a serious problem. Our communities are hurting. People are  being killed. We need to take action. The Republican leadership in this  House needs to bring gun violence prevention legislation to the floor  so we can vote it out and help keep our communities safer.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr.  DeSaulnier).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman  from Illinois (Mr. Schneider).                                time  1915     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  his remarks.   Mr. Speaker, tonight, members of the Gun Violence Prevention Task  Force have made clear the terrible cost of gun violence on our kids,  families, schools, and communities.   We have talked about sad milestones. In 2020, guns became the leading  killer of kids in America after overtaking motor vehicle accidents.   Another dark milestone has been the 389 mass shootings already this  year. We have had more mass shootings by mid-July this year than we had  in all of 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018.   We know it doesn't have to be this way. We know that States with the  most gun violence prevention laws have half the death rate for children  and teenagers compared to States with the least gun violence prevention  laws. The States can't do it alone.   These weak national gun safety laws make it much too easy for people  who are a danger to themselves or a danger to others to access guns  regardless of where they live.   According to the ATF gun-tracing database, the largest source of out- of-State guns used in crimes in my home State of California is Arizona,  a State with over twice the gun death rate whose gun laws are rated an  F.   Likewise, New York, a State with the fourth lowest gun death rate,  has guns pouring in from Georgia, which, you might have guessed, has an  F rating as well for their weak gun violence laws and over three times  the gun death rate.   Similarly, gun deaths in Illinois are fueled by guns from Indiana,  Missouri, and Wisconsin, States whose gun laws are rated F, F, and D- plus, respectively.  [[Page H3691]]    Members of our task force have been calling on the Republican  leadership to bring commonsense gun violence prevention bills to the  floor to protect our kids and keep our communities safe.   Mr. Speaker, tonight, we have been on the floor for 30 minutes  focused on gun violence prevention. That is 30 more minutes than  Republicans have scheduled to debate gun violence prevention bills on  the House floor this entire Congress.   Tonight, you heard from Army veterans, Marine Corps veterans, combat  veterans, hunters, gun owners, and moms and dads. We say: Enough. We  need to pass laws that will help keep our children and our communities  safe.   We will continue to fight until Republicans join us in stopping the  gun violence epidemic or until Democratic leadership in the next  Congress can resume our work and pass the gun violence prevention  legislation that has proven to save lives.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms.  Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for  her remarks, her good work on gun violence prevention efforts, and her  dedication to making sure that we pass the laws that will keep our kids  and our communities safe.   Mr. Speaker, as I mentioned earlier, we have had Army combat  veterans, Marine Corps combat veterans, hunters, gun owners, gun  collectors, and moms and dads on this floor tonight asking and pleading  with the Republican leadership to allow gun violence prevention  legislation to come to this floor for debate and for a vote.   Mr. Speaker, can you give us any idea when your leadership will be  bringing gun violence prevention bills to the floor for action?   Sadly, that is what I was afraid of. Silence. Just like after every  mass shooting, silence.   There has to be an effort on the part of this leadership to deal with  this issue that is disrupting communities and leading to thousands and  thousands of deaths.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
