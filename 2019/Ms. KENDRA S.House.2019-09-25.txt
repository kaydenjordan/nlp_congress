 HORN of Oklahoma. Madam Speaker, I rise today to talk  about H.R. 1595, the SAFE Banking Act. Later today, we will consider  this important piece of right-sized, pragmatic legislation that tackles  problems facing our communities.   H.R. 1595, the SAFE Banking Act, is a bipartisan bill that confronts  a problem that has arisen from the conflict between State and Federal  law and is currently endangering communities, as well as inhibiting  small businesses from growing.   Currently, 33 States, including my home State of Oklahoma, have  passed some form of legalized cannabis. However, due to the schedule I  status in Federal law, it is illegal for banks across this country to  work with cannabis and cannabis-related businesses, even in States  where it has been legalized.   This prevents businesses from using banks to deposit their revenue,  pay their bills, finance capital improvement projects, and makes it  challenging for them to file their taxes.   This has also created a serious safety hazard for cannabis and  cannabis-related businesses by forcing them to hold on to large amounts  of cash on their premises and increases the likelihood of tax evasion,  which has been historically prevalent among cash-only businesses.   The SAFE Banking Act resolves these issues by creating a legal  pathway for banks to serve cannabis and cannabis-related businesses  without fear of Federal sanctions.   Importantly, this bill defends States' rights by allowing banks in  States where cannabis is legal to serve these businesses, but does not  force banks to serve them and does not force it in States where it is  illegal.   Last year, Oklahoma legalized medical cannabis, and, since then,  Oklahoma's industry has become one of the fastest growing in the  Nation. Just this past April, Oklahomans spent more than $18 million on  medical cannabis, and the Oklahoma Medical Marijuana Authority has  licensed 1,400 dispensaries and 2,700 commercial growers in the State.   This industry is bringing revenue to our State, creating small  businesses, and helping those who suffer with physical illness to  relieve their ailments. The SAFE Banking Act supports this growing  Oklahoma industry, our banks, and works to keep Oklahomans that work in  and around this industry safe.   Madam Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this pragmatic  legislation that makes our community safer, protects States' rights,  supports small businesses, and grows our economy.                            ____________________
