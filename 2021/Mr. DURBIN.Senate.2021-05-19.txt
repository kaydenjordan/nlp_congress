 Mr. President, it has been my good fortune to serve in  the U.S. Senate for several terms and in the House before. I can  remember this Chamber from my first visit when I sat in that Gallery as  a college student and watched the proceedings of the U.S. Senate, and I  can remember so many historic days that I have been blessed to have a  front-row seat to observe great memories. But in addition to those  great memories, there is one sad memory--no, it was more than sadness;  one memory that brings sadness and anger--and it is related to January  6 of this year.   I remember that day so well. The Vice President of the United States,  Michael Pence, was presiding over the U.S. Senate. We were counting the  electoral votes to determine the official outcome of the previous  election. The President of the United States, Donald Trump, was holding  a rally near the White House, not far from Capitol Hill. The  demonstrators who came to his rally then marched on this Capitol, and  what transpired after that was historic and shameful.   I remember the moment when the Vice President of the United States  was spirited off that platform, yanked by his arms out that door.  Clearly his security detail felt that his life was in danger, and they  removed him.   I remember a member of the Capitol Police coming, standing on the  podium in front of the Senate, and saying that we should remain in our  seats, that this was going to be a safe place, this room, the Senate  Chamber. Then they started bringing in the staff, who were gathered  around the Chamber, to stand along the walls because of the safety of  this circumstance. So we knew there was something happening in the  Capitol.   Minutes later, just minutes later, that same Capitol policeman  announced: ``Evacuate this room as fast as you can. As quickly as you  can, move off this scene and go to another place.''   I never thought that I would see that in the U.S. Capitol Building,  nor in the Chamber of the U.S. Senate, but it was a reality.   As we quickly moved out through the exits, all the Senators and  staff, I remember looking out the window and seeing hundreds of people  descending on the Capitol. That was the snapshot in my mind as we  quickly escaped the danger in the U.S. Capitol Building.   We know at the end of the day that at least five people lost their  lives. We know that 140 law enforcement were assaulted by this mob who  tried to take control of the Capitol during the electoral college  count. Of course, there is ample historic evidence of what happened-- videotapes galore, videotapes from every angle, information gathered.   That is why I was skeptical when they suggested creating a Commission  to chronicle what happened on January 6. We saw it. We lived it.  America watched it, many times on live television. The videotapes have  been played over and over and over again to dramatize what was  happening as people were spraying so-called bear spray in the faces of  law enforcement, beating them with poles, crashing through the windows  of the Capitol and breaking down the doors to come inside.   We know what happened after we evacuated this Chamber. The mob took  over. Oh, they had their glory as they were taking pictures of one  another going through our desks here, acting like this was a holiday  and that they were somehow patriots in that shameful moment.   I questioned whether we needed a Commission to establish this. It is  there. But then last week, there was a vivid reminder that, despite  reality and despite the evidence, there are people who want to rewrite  history. Let me note one in particular.   Congressman  Andrew Clyde, Republican of Georgia, at a House  Oversight Committee hearing on the January 6 riot, said that the House  floor was not breached, that supporters of former President Donald  Trump who stormed the Capitol behaved ``in an orderly fashion.''  Congressman Clyde went on to say that if you looked at the videotapes,  you could see that ``there was an undisciplined mob. There were some  rioters, and some who committed acts of vandalism.''   Then he went on to say:         Watching the TV footage of those who entered the Capitol,       and walk through Statuary Hall showed people in an orderly       fashion staying between the stanchions and ropes taking       videos and pictures, you know.    That is what the Congressman said. He said:         If you didn't know that TV footage was a video from January       the sixth, you would actually think it was a normal tourist       visit.    End of quote from Congressman Clyde.   This is a quote from Congressman Paul Gosar, Republican from Arizona.  The law enforcement officials in the Capitol were ``harassing peaceful  patriots.''   So far, more than 440 people have been charged by our government with  participating in this attack, 440 of Congressman Clyde's orderly  tourists. Many have ties to rightwing extremist groups, the FBI said.  They recounted that five people died in the events that led up to the  attack. It is outrageous.   We know President Trump and his followers have been pursuing the Big  Lie when it comes to the results of the election. The President has  finally embarrassed even some Republican followers with his extreme  statements in that regard. But now his loyalists are turning on the  facts and the videotapes and the reality of January 6.   This has to come to an end. The truth has to prevail. This  Commission, which I understand Senator McConnell has now said he  opposes, is absolutely necessary--a bipartisan Commission to establish  once and for all what did occur, as if we have to, but we do.  Otherwise, Congressman Clyde, Congressman Gosar, and others will set  out to rewrite history and blame other forces for being at work that  day.   I join Senator Schumer in calling for the creation of this Commission  and demanding a vote on the floor of the U.S. Senate for its creation  so that we can establish once and for all what did occur on January 6  and must never happen again                             Endless Frontier Act    Mr. President, years ago, I traveled to Israel with then-minority  leader Senator Harry Reid. We met with Shimon Peres, and something  happened that I have never forgotten.  [[Page S2750]]    Senator Reid asked: ``What do you see as the greatest threat in the  world to the United States?'' That was just a couple of years after 9/ 11 when that question was posed. I thought Peres might cite terrorism  or loose nukes. Instead, he said without hesitation: ``China. Don't you  see that?''   Economically, strategically, diplomatically, China was already  focused like a laser on advancing its position as the world's most  powerful nation, and that was 16 years ago.   Five days ago, China launched a spacecraft safely and landed it on  Mars, becoming only the second nation in history, after the United  States, to land on the Red Planet.   In 1957, at the height of the Cold War, the Soviet Union became the  first nation to launch an Earth-orbiting satellite into space. That  launch shocked the world and caught us off guard. Our response was an  unprecedented commitment to reclaim America's dominance in the world as  a leader in scientific and technological discovery and innovation. The  effort became known as America's Sputnik moment. Twelve years later,  America put a man on the Moon.   You might say that now, instead of a Sputnik moment, America is going  through a Zhurong moment. That is the name of the Chinese Mars rover,  Zhurong.   Let me be clear. While China is our fastest growing competitor, the  United States has lost some ground globally as many nations recognize  the importance of R&D investments to their industrial innovation and  competitiveness. In 1960, just 3 years after Sputnik launched, the  United States accounted for approximately 69 percent of the world's R&D  funding. By 2018, 58 years later, this percentage had dropped from 69  percent to 28 percent. Others were joining in the pursuit of technology  and innovation at a record clip.   The question is, Can we come together, as Americans did in the last  century, to make investments in science, technology, and  competitiveness to guarantee that America's economy remains the world's  largest and most innovative?   Some Members of Congress and the Senate--and we have heard their  speeches on the floor--say: Go slow. No hurry. Well, I think they are  committed to a solid second-place finish for the United States of  America, and I don't want to be a part of it.   The Endless Frontier Act, which we are going to consider, gives us a  reason for hope. It is broad-based. It is bipartisan. It shows  leadership by Majority Leader Chuck Schumer; Senator Todd Young,  Republican of Indiana; along with Commerce Committee Chair Maria  Cantwell of Washington and Ranking Member Roger Wicker of Mississippi.   Like America's response to Sputnik, the new era of scientific and  technological discovery will be driven by seed money from the Federal  Government, but this effort is not limited to government spending.  America is home to the world's best research colleges and universities  and laboratories, like the Argonne National Lab in my State of  Illinois. They are part of this effort too. We will harness the  combined efforts of America's best scientific and technological minds  in the public sector and the private sector.   The Endless Frontier Act and broader competitiveness package  represent the largest investment in U.S. science and technology since  the Apollo era. It will authorize more than $100 billion over 5 years  to support breakthrough scientific discovery and technological  innovation in 10 key areas vital to building an innovation economy for  the 21st century and creating good jobs in the process. These key areas  include fields such as advanced energy, semiconductors, artificial  intelligence, biotechnology and genomics, quantum computing, robotics,  materials science, disaster prevention, and, of course, cyber security.   If you need a reminder of why it is urgent that we improve U.S. cyber  security, look at how the ransomware attack last week by Russian cyber  criminals on a major American oil pipeline caused long gas lines and  panic buying throughout the eastern half of our country.   Investing strategically in these 10 key innovation areas will enable  the United States to protect America's position as a leader in the  global economy and protect our national security. It will reinvigorate  and expand our industrial and manufacturing base, and it will create a  stronger middle class in our country.   The Endless Frontier Act will also strengthen the security of  essential supply chains and our ability to solve disruptions caused by  crises. Remember those fearless doctors and nurses working in COVID-19  wards last year, when they had to dress in garbage bags because of a  nationwide shortage of PPE? A nation as wealthy and powerful as ours  should never be caught so dangerously unprepared. This bill will make  sure that we aren't.   Here is another cautionary tale about supply-line disruption. In  Belvidere, IL, which is in the northern part of our State, workers at  the Stellantis plant are proud of their work assembling Jeep Cherokees.   In late March, that plant was forced to shut down because of a global  shortage of microchips. The plant is scheduled to reopen as soon as the  end of this month. But late last week, the company announced that the  plant will be forced to shut down one of its two production lines in  late July, again because of microchip shortages. As many as 1,600  employees could be laid off.   You can't build a prosperous economy and stable middle class if you  can't secure your supply lines. We know that American workers can build  cars and trucks for the future because they are already doing it, and  they are going to be launching it in many places around our Nation.  Just this week, President Biden visited an electric vehicle assembly  plant in Michigan. And they are doing it today as well in Normal, IL,  where a company called Rivian--remember the name: R-I-V-I-A-N, Rivian-- repurposed and expanded a former Mitsubishi assembly plant to produce  the company's first assembly plant for electric cars and trucks. Is  this going to work? Will it actually have a demand for electric  vehicles?   Remember this one too. Amazon has already ordered 100,000 delivery  vans from this plant. By the end of the year, Rivian expects to employ  2,500 people at the Normal assembly plant, 2,500 workers in good- paying, middle-class jobs in America. The Endless Frontier Act and  President Biden's American Jobs Plan provides the leadership and  resources to make sure that America remains the world leader in the  21st century.   On another critical issue, let me say that we need to get serious  when it comes to combating intellectual property theft and  counterfeiting. The previous administration's policies were haphazard.  We can do better. The Endless Frontier Act will impose tough sanctions  on entities that violate U.S. intellectual property and trade  protections.   I am working with Senator Cassidy, a Republican from Louisiana, and  others on a bipartisan bill that provides additional safeguards to  combat the sale of counterfeit goods, especially on the internet.   As I said, the Endless Frontier Act and competitiveness package will  invest more than $100 billion over 5 years to support breakthrough  technologies. Now, $100 billion is a big investment, but it is  dramatically less than what China is now spending in the same areas.  And it is far less when adjusted for inflation than what we spent on  the race for space.   If we contributed the same share of our GDP to science and technology  today as we did in the early 1960s--1 percent of our overall economy-- we would have to spend $900 billion, not $100 billion, in this effort.   My support for the Endless Frontier Act builds on my commitment to  securing steady, predictable funding increases for so many research  Agencies of the Federal Government but especially for NIH. They  provided the lifesaving vaccines that allow us to take off our masks  and resume our lives.   Monday, I went out to NIH with several of my colleagues. Senator  Blunt led a group from the Appropriations Committee. We met with NIH  Director Francis Collins, Dr. Anthony Fauci, and scientists who are  working on breakthrough discoveries.   It was 6 years ago that Senator Roy Blunt, Republican from Missouri,  and I made an informal pact. We worked together to increase the NIH  budget by 5 percent a year over and above inflation. With the help of  Senator Patty  [[Page S2751]]  Murray and Lamar Alexander, we increased the NIH budget more than 40  percent.   Because of those modest investments and the genius of NIH-funded  researchers, we have a real chance of developing better treatments and  cures for terrible diseases, including cancers, sickle cell, and  Alzheimer's.   The race for the future isn't an either-or deal--either we invest in  science or breakthrough technologies. We have to invest in both. I will  continue to work with Senators from both parties to preserve steady,  predictable funding increases for research.   No one bill will safeguard our national security or resolve all of  our outstanding issues with China. We still have a lot of work to do,  both in Congress and diplomatically. We still have to strengthen our  immigration system so that America continues to welcome immigrants who  want to put their genius to work for the good of America, as Nikola  Tesla and Albert Einstein did in the last century, as did Katalin  Kariko, the Hungarian-born Nobel laureate whose NIH-funded research  paved the way for today's COVID vaccines.   Strengthening America's role as a global leader in science and  technology is an essential piece of our effort to preserving our  leadership in the world. For that reason, I support the Endless  Frontier Act, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.    Mr. President, I have 10 requests for committees to meet  during today's session of the Senate.
