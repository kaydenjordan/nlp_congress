 Mr. President, I rise to express my support for our  renewable energy tax incentives. The production tax credit, PTC, for  wind and the investment tax credit, ITC, for solar must remain intact  as agreed to in this Chamber 2 years ago. These two credits are  necessary to continue to create clean energy jobs in Colorado. Although  the Senate tax package does not modify the PCT and ITC, the House  version includes harmful changes to the existing credits.   During the Finance Committee mark up, I asked the majority if they  intend to preserve the ITC and PTC credits in current law during  conference. Senator Grassley stated that, in private conversations with  the administration, it indicated it would preserve the bipartisan  compromise on energy credits. I urge the leadership to retain existing  law on the energy tax credits during conference. I take this  opportunity to ask unanimous consent that our exchange from the Finance  Committee markup be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:         Senator Bennet. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thanks so much for       having a second round of questions.        Ms. Acuna, I would like to know if the lack of an energy       title in the Senate markup implies an endorsement of the       House bill which undercuts the permanent extension of the ITC       for solar, it reduces the credit for the wind PTC. Or does       the Committee plan on honoring the ITC, PTC commitment we       made two years ago in a bipartisan way during reconciliation       at conference? Do you expect to maintain that in the       conference and is that our position?        Ms. Acuna. Thank you. I am not at liberty to speak of       whether or not the mark represents an endorsement or a lack       of endorsement of the House bill with respect to the energy       provisions. That rests with our members and I will leave it       at that.        Senator Bennet. So can silence be read to be acquiescence       to the House bill? How should we understand it?        What is the administration's position, Mr. West, on this       question?        Mr. West. I am not here to speak to the administration's       position today, Senator, on that particular provision.        Senator Grassley. If the senator would yield, I can speak       to----        Senator Bennet. Sure, I would yield to my colleague. You       were at the heart of those negotiations.        Senator Grassley. Yeah. From this standpoint, both in the       privacy of my office pre-Mnuchin nomination and at this       hearing, I asked that very question about the       administration's or at least his view on preserving it. I do       not know whether he get into the pros and cons of the tax,       but I brought it up from the standpoint that two years ago we       established a transition rule phasing out the wind energy       credit in 2020. And that is three years through that process.       That transition rule ought to be maintained and he said yes.        Senator Bennet. Well, let me say I am grateful for your       leadership as I always have been.        That is not the position that the House has taken in their       bill.        Senator Grassley. They have done great damage to our       transition rule.
