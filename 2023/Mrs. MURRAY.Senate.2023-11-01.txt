 Mr. President, for the information of the Senate,  starting at 2:30 p.m. today, the following amendments are expected to  be called up and made pending: Cruz No. 1249 and Lee No. 1121. Upon  disposition of the amendments, the Senate will vote on  [[Page S5276]]  adoption of the substitute amendment No. 1092, as amended, and on  passage of H.R. 4366, as amended; further, that upon disposition of  H.R. 4366, the Senate will vote on passage of H.R. 662, as amended, and  that all previous provisions of the order from October 24 remain in  effect.   So for the information of all Senators, there will be four rollcall  votes beginning at 2:30 p.m. today.    Mr. President, we have a bipartisan package before us.  This amendment that is being offered would slash funding supported  unanimously in our committee in the Ag and T-HUD bills--kicking women  and kids off of WIC or gutting funding for our farmers and agricultural  research, making our food supplies less safe; laying off air traffic  controllers, leading to flight delays and cancellations; booting people  from their homes as housing assistance would be cut off; eliminating  resources for communities to invest in important local infrastructure  needs and a lot more. This would be catastrophic.   The bills we are considering today have been carefully drafted. They  are written to the spending levels that were set by the debt ceiling  agreement that the House Republicans and the President agreed on.  Congress passed it in July, so I urge my colleagues to vote no.                          VOTE ON AMENDMENT NO. 1347     Madam President, I want to thank everyone who has worked  with me and the senior Senator from Maine to get our bipartisan  spending package here.   Over the last few days, we have had a truly robust amendment process  and considered 40 amendments, and this vote is now our chance to get  Congress back on track so that we can fund our  [[Page S5283]]  government in a bipartisan way, avoid another massive, end-of-the-year  omnibus, and address pressing issues like aid to our allies, disaster  relief, childcare prices, and more.   By passing this bill today, we can send a crucial message to the  American people and the world that, yes, Democrats and Republicans can  work together; and, yes, the United States is still strong and still  responsive to the challenges before us.   So I urge everyone who wants to avoid another year-end omnibus,  everyone who has worked with us to put this package together, to vote  with us to pass it. Let's get the job done.   I yield the floor.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, what we have just done is really  important, and I want to thank everyone who helped us get here: my vice  chair, the senior Senator from Maine; our subcommittee leaders, the  Senators from Arkansas, New Mexico, North Dakota, Hawaii, and  Mississippi; and all of our colleagues--all of our colleagues--who  worked hard to craft and strengthen these bills. I want to thank Senate  leadership and, of course, all of our tireless staff who have met every  challenge this process has thrown at us.   Today, months of hard work paid off. We just passed a strong  bipartisan spending package--the only bipartisan spending bills in  Congress, by the way--and we did it with an 82-to-15 vote.   So let us be crystal clear about what that means. Unlike the funding  measures we have seen pushed through the House, these are serious and  reasonable bipartisan bills that can actually be signed into law.   They are the product of months of hard work, careful negotiation, and  thoughtful input from Members on both sides of the aisle.   They stick to the spending levels that House Republicans and  President Biden signed and negotiated and that we all passed into law  this past spring.   And despite the tough funding constraints, these bills move our  country forward, not back, with important investments to keep our  promise to our Nation's veterans, to get Americans where they need to  go safely, to increase our housing supply, address the homelessness  crisis, support our farmers, our ranchers, and keep American families  healthy and safe and more.   What we have done here--finding common ground to produce reasonable,  bipartisan bills--is not just a template; it is the only way to get our  jobs done in a divided government. There is a clear lesson from the  last few months here in Congress, and it is that we must work together,  not retreat to extreme partisan corners.   So let us be clear to my colleagues. We have a lot more work to do.  Our mission here isn't just to send a message or pass a bill through  the Senate. We have to work to get these bills signed into law. And I  don't just mean these investments but crucial funding in all of our  bipartisan appropriations bills.   While we may need another CR before our work is done, we absolutely  have to remember: Long-term CRs are no way to govern, and they  certainly  [[Page S5284]]  are no way to lead. When we operate under long-term CRs, our Agencies  are stuck in neutral. They cannot plan for the future. They have to  delay initiatives and investments. They are far less equipped to meet  the pressing challenges we face. Governing by CRs hurts families who  need a government that works reliably, seriously stunts our economy and  American innovation, and dangerously impedes our national security.   I think we all know that our competitors across the world are not  putting their budgets on autopilot. They are doing everything they can  to get ahead, and they are hoping that we fall behind into the chaos of  partisan infighting. We cannot let that happen. We need to pass full- year funding with the investments we need to keep the United States  strong and safe and competitive--especially in a moment that truly  calls for American leadership.    There is no question we have got our work cut out for us, but today,  we have shown a clear roadmap for how we can get our work done. So I am  talking with my vice chair about the next set of bills we will work to  move in the Senate and continuing work to move a comprehensive,  bipartisan supplemental funding package.   We need to start conferencing our appropriations bills. That will  require House Republicans to get serious about governing, to get back  to the spending agreement that they negotiated and work with us to  finalize these bipartisan bills. It is critical that happens.   We do not have time to waste. The clock is ticking. The American  people are tired of watching Congress wait until the last second before  kicking the can down the road. Our constituents do not want to see  chaos. They do not want to see shutdowns or threats, and they don't  want to see our country's future limited by CRs. They do want to see  their elected officials roll up their sleeves, sit down at the table,  and do the hard work of governing to help people and solve problems.  That is what we have done today. So let's get to it, and let's get our  work done.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
