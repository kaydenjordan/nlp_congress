 Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member, and I thank  the chairman, as well as the authors of this piece of legislation, Mr.  Chabot and Mr. Crowley, for their work on this important issue.   Last month, I visited Burma and Bangladesh on a congressional  factfinding mission. Our visits to refugee camps, our conversations  with survivors, made it clear that the persecution of the Rohingya  people in Burma's Rakhine State is a severe humanitarian crisis and  demands robust American leadership. This resolution is an important  first step in demonstrating that Congress will not tolerate human  rights abuses against the Rohingyas.   Our delegation saw, however, there is a path forward. The Burmese  Government and the military must fully implement the recommendations of  the former U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan's advisory commission.  Burma must work with Bangladesh, and the U.N. must fully work to return  voluntarily the Rohingya refugees with guarantee of a safe return and a  fair process to allow the Rohingyas to apply for and secure  citizenship. That must be established.   Finally, there must be an independent investigation to ensure  accountability for the atrocities and the abuses that have taken place.   Mr. Speaker, I saw people suffering in both Burma and in Bangladesh,  and the suffering must come to an end. They are crying out for action,  and the United States and the international community must help them  secure justice. This resolution, this vote today, is just the  beginning. I encourage people to support this.
