 Mr. Speaker, today, on International Holocaust  Remembrance Day, we mark the 75th anniversary of the liberation of  Auschwitz-Birkenau.   We remember the 6 million Jews, as well as millions of other minority  populations, who were systematically murdered by the Nazi regime and  its collaborators. We remember the families who were separated and the  sacrifices made by those who protected Jewish lives.   Pure evil was committed against Jews, Roma, Catholics, LGBTQ  individuals, people with disabilities, and others.   We honor the 10,000 Holocaust survivors who live in south Florida and  the nearly 70,000 more who live around the United States.   Mr. Speaker, I also want to honor my friend, Dr. Miriam Klein  Kassenoff, who fled Nazi Europe as a child in 1941. An educational  specialist for Holocaust studies at Miami-Dade County Public Schools  and director of the Holocaust Institute at the University of Miami,  Miriam has dedicated her life to educating the new generation of  teachers and students about the horrors of the Holocaust.   Mr. Speaker, as we enter this new decade, we recommit ourselves to  ensuring that ``never again'' means never again. We will never stop  fighting virulent, hateful anti-Semitism and discrimination wherever  and whenever it appears.    In this House, the people's House, we stand together, united against  hate. We stand together in pledging ``never again.''   Never again.
