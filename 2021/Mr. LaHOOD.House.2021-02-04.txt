 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Orion Samuelson  on his retirement and to thank him for his 60 years of work at WGN  Radio and Nexstar Media.   Orion's Hall of Fame career leaves behind a legacy known throughout  the country, especially in our agriculture community in central and  west central Illinois.   Born on a dairy farm in La Crosse, Wisconsin, Orion got his start in  radio in Appleton and Green Bay. In 1960, he came to Chicago and joined  WGN Radio as their farm director. In the six decades since, Orion has  become the best known voice in agriculture radio. From presenting his  signature farm reports to anchoring ``The Noon Show'' and hosting his  ``U.S. Farm Report,'' which still airs today, Orion is a legend in  broadcasting and agriculture. In 1963, Orion was the first to read the  on-air bulletin that President Kennedy had been assassinated in Dallas.   His booming and distinctive voice is known well throughout Illinois  and in our agriculture community. We will miss hearing his voice on  air, seeing him at the Illinois State Fair in Springfield, and hearing  his reports that helped guide our farmers to success over the years.   I want to thank Orion for his years of work and service, and I hope  he enjoys a well-earned retirement.                            ____________________
