 Mr. President, I rise today to introduce my first bill in  the U.S. Senate--a bill to help relieve the burden of student debt for  young entrepreneurs from New Hampshire and the entire country.   Most of us have seen personally how heavily the burden of student  loan debt weighs on students and families across New Hampshire. Less  visible, but no less important, is how student loan debt is weighing  down our economy--stifling innovation and job creation.   Student loan debt is preventing the next generation of entrepreneurs  and innovators from opening their own businesses. A New York Times  report highlighted that the percentage of new entrepreneurs between 20- 34 years old fell to 25 percent in 2014, down from almost 35 percent in  1996. And Gallup found that 19 percent of graduates with student loan  debt say they have delayed starting a business because of it.   It is time to once again unleash the entrepreneurial potential of our  young people into creating the jobs of the future. That is why this  week I introduced the Reigniting Opportunity for Innovators, ROI, Act,  the first bill I am writing as a U.S. Senator, which would help provide  the relief necessary for young entrepreneurs to start up and grow  innovative small businesses.   The ROI Act will allow eligible founders and full-time employees of  certified small business to defer their Federal student loan payments  and interest accrual for up to 3 years while launching a startup. This  will help give graduates the financial stability they need to take the  risk of starting a business that can create good-paying jobs.   Additionally, this legislation provides an additional incentive for  startup companies to move off the beaten path to help revitalize  struggling communities. If the startup is located in an economically  distressed area, founders and employees will be eligible for  cancellation of up to $20,000 in student loans.   The ROI Act is an important step that we can take now to help young  entrepreneurs and lay the foundation for a new generation of economic  growth.   New businesses are historically the top job creators in our country,  and small businesses are the driving force of New Hampshire's economy.  But to get the education they need to compete for jobs in the 21st  century economy, students are taking on more debt than ever before. In  2015, college graduates left school with an average of $30,000 of  student loan debt, and New Hampshire students had the highest average  student debt in the country.   At a roundtable discussion at Keene State College, I heard from  students about the challenges posed by their student loan debt. One  young woman told me that she hoped to start her own business but that  she would likely have to put off that goal for another 10 years because  of her student loan debt.   Any entrepreneur will tell you that getting a small business off the  ground is expensive. These costs, mixed with student loan debt, make it  even more daunting for young entrepreneurs to consider taking the leap  of starting a new business. Student debt decreases the cash flow of  potential entrepreneurs, it hurts their ability to build equity, and it  can negatively affect credit scores and their ability to secure  financing.   With the deck too often stacked against them, we need to be doing  everything we can to support young entrepreneurs looking to start the  innovative businesses that will drive job-creation and move our economy  forward.   The ROI Act would work to drive our 21st century economy, but we know  that we have more work to do to bring down the costs of higher  education and ensure that New Hampshire students, families, and  innovative businesses have the support they need. In addition to  working to pass this commonsense legislation, I will continue to focus  on expanding Pell grants, lowering interest rates for student loans and  allowing students to refinance, and increasing apprenticeship and job  training opportunities.   The ROI Act is an important step that we can take now to help young  entrepreneurs and lay the foundation for a new generation of economic  growth, and I look forward to working with members of both parties to  pass this commonsense bill.                                  ______                                         By Mr. DURBIN (for himself and Mr. Cassidy):   S. 850. A bill to amend the Higher Education Act of 1965 to establish  fair and consistent eligibility requirements for graduate medical  schools operating outside the United States and Canada; to the  Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.
