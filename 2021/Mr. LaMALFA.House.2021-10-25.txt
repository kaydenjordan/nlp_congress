 Mr. Speaker, I rise today with bittersweet sentiments.   I recognize the departure of my legislative assistant, Riley Scott,  of Petaluma, California, to an amazing, new adventure.   Riley has been, in addition to her strong work in my office for 2  years, a lifetime swimmer and received a full ride out of high school  to USC where she won several PAC-12 championships and competed at the  top level in the NCAA's.   I point out this impressive record because Riley's new opportunity  will be competing to represent our country in the 2024 Paris Olympics.   Riley will be training for the women's pentathlon, which consists of,  of course, swimming, horsemanship, a combination of running, pistol  shooting, and fencing.   Now, I told Riley that there is a lot of fencing around our ranch  that needed to be repaired, but she said that wasn't the same thing.   I told Riley early on if she ever had this type of opportunity post  college, she had to go out and take that chance and do it, and so she  is.    It is a loss for our office and here in Congress, but watch as Riley  goes for the gold as Californians are known to do.   Fight on to victory, Riley Coyote.                            ____________________
