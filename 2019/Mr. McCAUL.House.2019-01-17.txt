 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this joint resolution.   I have long maintained that provocations by Vladimir Putin and his  cronies require a decisive and forceful response by the United States.   As the former chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, I love the  effort to strengthen our cyber defenses so that Russia cannot attack  our political institutions and undermine our democracy. I have seen the  classified reports and I know the threats. I take a back seat to no one  in confronting Russia's malicious activities. The whole world has seen  Russia's aggression in Ukraine and its support for Assad's brutality in  Syria.                                time  1130    Bottom line, Putin's Russia is an adversary and must be treated as  one. An effective foreign policy needs to use all economic and  diplomatic tools to confront belligerent behavior by a foreign power.  Those who threaten America and our allies need to understand that they  will pay a heavy price so long as those threats persist.   As someone who believes that partisanship should stop at the water's  edge, as the chairman often says at our Foreign Affairs Committee  briefings, I don't believe that this issue should divide our two  parties. In fact, it should unite us.   This also means that Congress must guard against playing partisan  politics with sanctions. We must impose them when they are warranted,  and we must allow them to be lifted when they have accomplished their  goals.   I think many Members find Treasury's case for delisting these  particular Russian companies to have an argument, but not very  compelling.   For example, some still have questions about whether moving some of  the oligarch shares to a family charity and to a sanctioned Russian  bank will sufficiently sever the control and enrichment that he  currently enjoys, and whether we can adequately monitor that with  transparency.   Even though we may have a good-faith disagreement about the wisdom of  this particular delisting at this point in time, I do want to commend  the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control. They  implement and police many of the sanctions that Congress enacts, and  there are good reasons for their bipartisan reputation for integrity  and professionalism.   But because we cannot be sure that we have removed the heavy hand of  this Russian oligarch, I cannot support the delisting of these  sanctioned entities at this point in time. Therefore, I support this  joint resolution, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I just want to be clear, as the Republican leader of the  Foreign Affairs Committee, that I support this resolution. I am not  sure if my opening statement was properly heard by the other side of  the aisle, but I join my  [[Page H695]]  colleagues on the other side and support this resolution in a  bipartisan manner, as it should be, against our enemy Russia, Putin,  and the oligarchs.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    I continue to reserve, Mr. Speaker.    Mr. Speaker, I have no other speakers, and, yes, I am  prepared to close.   Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I was in the October 2016 classified briefings on the  interference by the Russians in our Federal elections and in our  Presidential elections. I condemned it at that time, and I continue to  condemn it. I supported sanctions then, and I support those sanctions  today.   For that reason, Mr. Speaker, until we have been fully satisfied by  the Treasury Department, I support this resolution, and I yield back  the balance of my time.
