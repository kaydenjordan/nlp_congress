 BOYLE of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission  to address the House for 1 minute.)    BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, this week, it is a  privilege to honor the men and women of law enforcement who put their  lives on the line every single day to keep us safe.   In my hometown of Philadelphia and across the Nation, police officers  serve our communities with immeasurable courage. Every police officer  goes to work knowing that any day could be their last. In Philadelphia  alone, more than 260 police officers throughout our city's history have  lost their lives.   One thing in Congress that we could do to show just how much we honor  their sacrifice is to enact the legislation that myself, along with  Congressman Fitzpatrick, Senators  Casey and Toomey, have introduced.  It would provide a boost of education aid, up to the maximum Pell grant  award, for the children of fallen law enforcement and first responders  who have died in the line of duty. The bipartisan Children of Fallen  Heroes Scholarship Act is widely supported by the law enforcement  community.   Although we can never fully repay our debt to those families who have  made the ultimate sacrifice, I believe this would be an important step  in the right direction.                            ____________________
