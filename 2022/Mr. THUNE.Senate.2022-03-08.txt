 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, it took several months and the worst  inflation in 40 years, but finally--finally--Democrats are  acknowledging that we have an inflation problem.   The President actually acknowledged inflation in the State of the  Union last week. But, unfortunately, while Democrats may finally be  talking about inflation, they still don't seem to understand how we got  here, and they are continuing to push a whole raft of terrible  proposals that would hurt working families and make our inflation  crisis even worse.   So how did we get here? Why are Americans currently struggling with  huge grocery bills and big price increases on essential goods? It is  true that supply chain issues and the reopening of economies after  COVID shutdowns created certain inflationary pressure, but a big part  of the reason things are so bad in the United States right now is  because of the American Rescue Plan spending spree the Democrats passed  last March.   When Democrats took office last January, inflation was at 1.4  percent, well within the Fed's target inflation rate of 2 percent. And  it might have stayed there had Democrats not decided that they needed  to pass a massive partisan $1.9 trillion spending spree under the guise  of COVID relief--mere weeks, I might add--after Congress had already  passed a major COVID bill. That is right. President Biden and  congressional Democrats took office right after Congress had approved a  fifth--fifth--bipartisan COVID relief bill, and it was abundantly clear  that we were not in immediate need of trillions more in government  spending.   But that didn't matter to Democrats. Now that they were in control of  Congress and the White House, they wanted to take advantage of the  COVID crisis. So in the name of COVID relief, they pushed through a  massive partisan piece of legislation filled with unnecessary spending  and handouts to Democratic interest groups.   And, of course, the results were predictable. The bill flooded the  economy with unnecessary government spending, and the economy  overheated as a result. In the words of Jason Furman in a January New  York Times article, `` `The United States has had much more inflation  than almost any other advanced economy in the world,' said Jason  Furman, an economist at Harvard University and former Obama  administration economic adviser. The difference, he said, comes because  `the United States' stimulus is in a category of its own.' ''   Unfortunately, Democrats seem unable--or unwilling--to recognize that  it was their policies that helped push us into our current inflation  crisis. In fact, the President used his State of the Union Address to  push for even more--more--excessive government spending, a sure way of  making our inflation crisis even worse--and not just increased in  spending but major new entitlements.   Yes, our Nation is massively in debt, inflation is soaring, and  Democrats think now is a good time to create major new entitlements,  and, of course, to raise taxes to pay for them. The President claims  that he won't raise taxes on anyone making less than $400,000, but that  is not actually the case. Analysis of Build Back Better proposals  reveals more than one tax hike would hit Americans with incomes below  $400,000. And then there are the indirect costs.   A centerpiece of the President's tax plans is increasing taxes on  corporations. While that may sound like a tax hike on the uber rich,  the truth is that the burden of corporate tax hikes would fall heavily  on ordinary workers in the form of lower wages, decreased job  opportunities and retirement savings, and a less vibrant economy.   The President likes to talk about tax fairness, about hiking taxes on  corporations and wealthy Americans so that they pay ``their fair  share.'' Of course, he ignores the fact that wealthy Americans pay a  disproportionately large share of taxes in this country and that the  Federal Government has seen a huge increase in corporate tax receipts,  thanks in part to business growth in the wake of the Tax Cuts and Jobs  Act.   All that aside, I find the President's call for wealthy Americans to  pay their fair share highly ironic considering the Democrats managed to  include a tax break for wealthy Americans in their Build Back Better  plan. That is right. The Democrats' SALT proposal would  overwhelmingly--overwhelmingly--benefit affluent taxpayers in high-tax  States. Apparently, making wealthy Americans pay their fair share only  applies to wealthy Republican Americans or until wealthy Democrats  start asking for tax breaks.   On the corporate tax side, in the State of the Union Address, the  President highlighted the corporate minimum tax he is proposing. What  he didn't mention was that his corporate minimum tax isn't actually a  minimum tax at all. Thanks to the clean energy and affordable housing  tax credits the President is advocating, among other credits, companies  that take action on Democrats' preferred policies could end up  completely evading Biden's so-called minimum tax. So much for making  corporations pay their fair share.    In his State of the Union Address, the President highlighted ``the  revitalization of American manufacturing.'' He said, ``Companies are  choosing to build new factories here when just a few years ago, they  would have gone overseas.'' He said that in the State of the Union  speech.   The revitalization of American manufacturing is, indeed, something to  celebrate. But, unfortunately, President Biden wants to undo the very  tax policies that helped create the conditions for this manufacturing  renaissance in the first place.   Before Republicans passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in 2017, we were  experiencing a wave of inversions, which is a wonky way of saying that  companies were moving their headquarters overseas. Why were companies  moving  [[Page S1027]]  overseas? Because of the punishing corporate tax system we had in the  United States. Prior to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the United States  had the highest corporate tax rate in the developed world. That put  American businesses at a real disadvantage next to their foreign  counterparts, and it created a significant incentive for U.S. companies  to move jobs or their entire companies overseas. The Tax Cuts and Jobs  Act addressed this problem by lowering our Nation's massive corporate  tax rate and bringing the U.S. international tax system into the 21st  century.   How did it work? Well, in the wake of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act,  inversions stopped--stopped--and as the President pointed out,  companies are building here in America. To quote the President of the  National Association of Manufacturers:         Reducing tax rates drove historic growth in the       manufacturing sector.    Unfortunately, if the President has his way, this manufacturing  renaissance would likely drastically slow or come to an end altogether.  Hiking taxes on American companies, as the President wants to do, would  once again put American companies at a competitive disadvantage next to  their foreign counterparts.   If the President hikes corporate taxes, we won't be seeing a surge of  new building in America or companies keeping jobs here at home.  Instead, we will be seeing fewer American jobs and more jobs and  companies heading overseas. Democrats have already wreaked a lot of  economic harm on American families with their American Rescue Plan  spending spree. And the other policies that they are pushing and the  tax hikes and new entitlements the President outlined in his State of  the Union Address would prolong our inflation crisis and do further  damage to our economy and to American workers and families.   I am glad the Democrats are finally recognizing that inflation is a  problem, but it would have been nice if they could also recognize how  their spending helped get us into this mess in the first place and how  their current tax hike and spending plans would hurt Americans and  result in a less prosperous economy in the future.
