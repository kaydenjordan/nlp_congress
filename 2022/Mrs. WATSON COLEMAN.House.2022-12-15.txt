 Mr. Speaker, I rise today because the Republican  Party has once again chosen to stand against civil rights.   Yesterday, Senator Cory Booker brought the CROWN Act to the Senate  floor. This bill would ban hair discrimination, including the practice  of discriminating against people, Black people, because of the way  their hair naturally grows out of their heads. Republicans stopped the  bill in its tracks.   The CROWN Act should never ever have been a controversial bill. It  simply protects our right to exist as our authentic selves. Apparently,  that was just too much for today's Republican Party.   Mr. Speaker, I stand here disappointed but not defeated. I will never  stop fighting for all Americans' right to exist as their authentic  selves. I pray that my Republican colleagues set petty party politics  aside and choose to stand for justice when the next opportunity arises.                            ____________________
