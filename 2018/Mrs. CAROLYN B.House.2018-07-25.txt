 MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I thank my good  friend and co-chair of the Hellenic Caucus for all his hard work on  this Special Order and for his hard work in Congress and on so many  issues. He has been a leader for Greece, Cyprus, Florida, and the  United States, and is a strong and effective leader here in Congress.   Mr. Cicilline, who is here representing the Democratic side, has been  a strong advocate and leader, not only in this but in so many areas in  our caucus, in our Congress, and in so many ways.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to show my strong and unwavering support  for the U.S.-Cyprus relationship.   As co-chair of the Hellenic Caucus along with Mr. Bilirakis, I would  be remiss if I did not mention the tragic wildfires that tore through  Greece yesterday, killing dozens, and injuring and displacing hundreds  more. I am heartbroken by the loss of life and destruction these  rapidly moving fires left in their wake, and I send my deepest  condolences, along with all of my colleagues in Congress, to the Greek  people at this time.    I know that the Hellenic American community, many of whom are my  constituents, are affected by this disaster as well and have already  begun efforts to help.   I want to thank, especially, my fellow Hellenic Caucus co-chair,  Representative Gus Bilirakis from the great State of Florida, for  organizing this Special Order hour, and also the Congressman from Rhode  Island (Mr. Cicilline) for joining him in organizing it.   I founded the caucus with his father, former Representative Mike  Bilirakis, in 1996, and it remains one of the largest and most active  caucuses in Congress. We founded this caucus after Turkey invaded EMEA.  It seemed like, every other day, there was a major crisis that came to  the floor of Congress, and we felt it was important to really find  where our supporters were.   I am proud that, since this caucus has been founded, no single bill  has been taken to the floor that in any way hinders or rolls back  rights to Greece or Cyprus.   Cyprus is one of our staunchest allies in the world. Strengthening  our alliance must remain a constant foreign policy priority for the  United States.   We must acknowledge a solemn anniversary last week. It has been 44  years since the illegal, terrible, unjust invasion by Turkish troops  into the northern third of the nation of Cyprus. To this day, the  island and the people living on either side of the U.N.-monitored  buffer zone remain separated. There are 40,000 Turkish troops occupying  northern Cyprus today. It is unjust; it is wrong; and they should be  removed.   They pose a looming threat that the Cypriot people have been forced  to live with each and every day. Negotiations on reunification,  unfortunately, are stalled for now, after some signs of progress early  last year.   Turkish troops are undeniably a hindrance to peace. No just and  lasting settlement for either Greece or Turkish Cypriots can be  achieved with the presence of the Turkish military.   We are here today to show the support of the U.S. Congress for a  bicommunal, bizonal federation that is in the best interests of the  United States, the entire Eastern Mediterranean, and, most of all,  Cypriots themselves.   Two years ago, I joined a congressional delegation led by Ileana Ros- Lehtinen, the former chair of the Foreign Relations Committee, to  Cyprus. As we toured along the buffer zone, or the so-called Green Line  that partitions the country, the ghost towns of Famagusta and Varosha  illustrated the drastic impact that a divided Cyprus has on its people.   I would call it a lost opportunity and lost economic advancement. It  is literally a deserted ghost town on one of the most beautiful beaches  in the world, one of the most beautiful towns in the world. Yet, I have  constituents who I represent who crawled out of Famagusta on their  bellies as Turkish planes were dropping bombs after them, and their  dream is to go back to their homeland.   But it is a wasteland. When you pass the Green Line into the occupied  area, it is like totally deserted. It is like a lost economic  opportunity, lost living style, lost life. When you see it, it is a  visualization of so many opportunities lost for this great country, the  time wasted and the development foregone because of this extended  conflict and separation between the Greek and Cypriot areas and the  Turkish areas.  [[Page H7684]]    Some may not be aware that the buffer zone is patrolled now by U.N.  peacekeeping forces. The U.S. must maintain its financial support for  these forces that are keeping peace in Cyprus. It is an effective  investment, especially now, and it is needed.   There are numerous examples of Turkish aggression in the Eastern  Mediterranean. Violations of Greek airspace and territorial waters are  commonplace. Turkey continues to intimidate and interfere with the  companies operating in Cyprus' exclusive economic zone and violates  Cyprus' sovereign claims to its territory.   Fortunately, there are near-term initiatives that Congress is  pursuing right now to defend Cyprus' stability and sovereignty. The  NDAA conference report released Monday includes a provision to study  lifting the arms embargo on Cyprus that has been in place since 1987.   I think we need to go much further than that. I think the embargo  should be lifted today, and I am proud to be an original cosponsor of  Representative Cicilline's bill to do just that. This study will  hopefully be at least a step in the right direction.   The NDAA also prohibits the sale of F-35 fighter jets to Turkey. That  provision is long overdue, and that is in the defense budget that we  will be considering today and tomorrow.   Cyprus is a vital U.S. partner in global and regional security,  economic cooperation, and energy development. I am proud to be a  champion of this relationship in Congress through the Hellenic Caucus  and to have the support of so many of my Hellenic American constituents  in that effort.   Mr. Speaker, I see my colleague, Mr. Cicilline, representing the  great State of Rhode Island is here. He is an incredible leader in this  caucus, the leader of our messaging unit, and, in so many other ways,  an important leader in this Congress.                                time  2030
