 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember the  wonderful life of Mr. Paul Lovezzola of Bloomingdale, Georgia, who  passed away on Friday, June 3. He was 79 years old.   He was the owner and operator of the beloved Lovezzola's Pizza Family  Restaurant since 1978, which has proudly fed of city of Pooler for  almost 45 years.   Above all, Paul was a devout family man who worked hard to support  his family and spoil his grandchildren.   Paul was orphaned at the age of 12. From that young age, he looked up  to our military servicemembers, which led him to serve in the U.S. Air  Force.   He was communicant of Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church, where he  is remembered as a people person, a hard worker, and for always having  a story to tell.   Paul served the people of Pooler for many years. In fact, he loved  the city so much that he faced his restaurant toward Pooler instead of  I-95.   My prayers are with his wife of 57 years, Juanita Lovezzola, and his  three children, Steven, Sherri, and Tim, along with their nine  grandchildren whom he dearly loved.                      Recognizing Southern Soul Barbeque     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  Southern Soul Barbeque for winning the Brunswick-Golden Isles Small  Business of the Year for their superior barbecue and service to their  community.   The Small Business of the Year award is awarded to a business that  demonstrates excellent knowledge and integrity while providing a  valuable service to the community.   Southern Soul Barbeque has continuously delivered their mission of  support for the citizens and the local business community while  exhibiting initiative, creativity, and a can-do attitude.   Businesses like this are what binds our precious communities together  and keeps our economies moving in the right direction. Plus, it is  always great to enjoy some exceptional southern-style barbecue.   I look forward to being in St. Simons for many reasons, but the  pulled pork from Southern Soul Barbeque is certainly toward the top of  the list. It is a must every time for me.   It is my honor to recognize a commendable business such as Southern  Soul Barbeque, and I wish them great success in the future as they  continue to set an example for other small businesses in the community.                           In Memory of Kirk Warner     Mr. Speaker, I rise today in memory of the  legendary and beloved Kirk Warner, a teacher, a coach, a mentor, a  father figure, and a friend to so many in his community, who peacefully  passed away last June 16.   Kirk was a football fanatic with an apparent gift for the game from a  young age, which ultimately led him to play tight end for the  University of Georgia and then go on and spend 21 seasons as the head  coach of the Liberty County High School football team.   From his first day at the school, he made Liberty County his home and  was known for being a humble man with a true passion for inspiring the  next generations through his coaching.   He was known for putting highly competitive teams on the field and  took pride in his players being the best they could be, inspiring some  to make it to the NFL.   The fact that his players respect him as much as they do, truly  speaks to his character as a coach and as a man.   His legacy has been left for the rest of us to learn from and live  by, to help guide the future generations of young student leaders and  athletes through faith, love, and respect for others.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Pat Cooper  for her achievement of being named the 2022 M.H. ``Woody'' Woodside  Community Champion of the Year. Pat Cooper is the owner of a not-so- small business known as Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices Hodnett Cooper  Real Estate in St. Simons, Georgia. The M.H. ``Woody'' Woodside  Community Champion of the Year is given out to a small business that  gives back to local nonprofits, events, and organizations through their  time and resources to better their community.   The founder of the company and Pat's father, Roy Hodnett, built this  company and made giving back to his community the foundation of his  business.

Among their service to organizations, members of the company have  also given back to their community by playing roles in community  initiatives such as SPLOST and zoning issues to enhance the quality of  life in the Golden Isles.   Congratulations to Pat. I commend her for her incredible service to  her community.                            ____________________
