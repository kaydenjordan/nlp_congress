 Mr. Speaker, it is with great frustration that I rise  today to speak on the Supreme Court hearing arguments today in three  cases relating to former President Obama's DACA policy.   President Trump's decision to rescind DACA has thrust fear into  hundreds of thousands of Dreamers. These individuals are active members  of our society who pay taxes, create jobs, and help drive our Nation  forward. To subject these individuals to the threat of deportation is  absolutely wrong.   I have heard directly from many constituents who depend on DACA, and  I am heartbroken by the trauma and fear they now face.   My colleagues and I did our job earlier this year in passing H.R. 6,  the American Dream and Promise Act; however, Senator McConnell has  failed to consider this important legislation. As a result, we are now  dependent on the Supreme Court offering a favorable decision that  upholds DACA.   I urge Senator McConnell to bring H.R. 6 for a vote and hope the  Supreme Court will give a favorable decision on these cases.                            ____________________
