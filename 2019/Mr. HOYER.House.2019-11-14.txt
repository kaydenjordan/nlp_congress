 Mr. Speaker, we are involved in a very serious process to  determine whether the President of the United States has committed high  crimes and misdemeanors.   The Constitution provides for the removal of high officials who  violate their oath of office, who violate the powers of their office,  and who commit bribery or treason, or high crimes and misdemeanors.   In the course of that process, we have been involved with numerous  people asking for the whistleblower to testify. I will not speak to the  substance of the consideration that is ongoing with respect to the  impeachment of the President of the United States, but I do want to  speak pointedly to the calls from so many that the whistleblower be  identified.   The whistleblower, of course, has no direct evidence to offer. What  the whistleblower is is somebody who responded to ``if you see  something, say something.''   We have witnesses to wrongdoing all over this country and all over  the world, and our police departments have a line that is called an  anonymous tip line so that somebody who sees something will say  something. It is anonymous so that we do not intimidate those people or  expose them to danger for coming forward to out criminal behavior.   The President of the United States has made an analogy to this  information coming forward as the result of spying, treason, which, as  we all know, according to the President, can subject someone to capital  punishment.   Why do we have a whistleblower statute? We have a whistleblower  statute,  [[Page H8830]]  Mr. Speaker, because we want to encourage people, and we want to not  expose them to danger or intimidation--including from the most powerful  person on Earth, the President of the United States--or retaliation.  Yet we continue to hear: Tell us who the whistleblower is. Let us throw  the whistleblower into the lion's den.   In fact, of course, what we do know is the whistleblower, the  information that was brought forward, A, led to the release of funds to  the Ukrainians just shortly thereafter and, in addition, has led to  substantive testimony corroborating the information that the  whistleblower either saw or heard.   If you see something, say something.   It is irresponsible, it is wrong, and, in fact, in almost every  jurisdiction, there are criminal penalties for threatening a witness,  for impeding justice.    So, Mr. Speaker, when people say, ``Show me the whistleblower,'' what  they are doing is not only trying to intimidate that whistleblower,  they are trying to intimidate every other whistleblower who might deign  to come forward because they saw something or heard something.   I would hope all of my colleagues would think to themselves: Why do  we have a whistleblower statute?   I represent 62,000 Federal employees, and, very frankly, I want them  to have the confidence to come forward if they see wrongdoing in the  Federal Government, even if it is about the President of the United  States, and even if the President of the United States wants to make an  analogy to a capital offense--despicable--undermining the very essence  of why the Congress of the United States enacted a whistleblower  statute and the essence of why police departments all over the United  States have anonymous tip lines and why almost every State has a  statute which imposes a criminal penalty for the intimidation of  witnesses.   We are a nation of laws, not of men. We are proud of that. But if we  are to be a nation whose top leaders try to intimidate those who would  come forward if they see something or hear something and they say  something, then we will be a lesser nation, less focused on a nation of  laws.   Mr. Speaker, I would hope that Members on both sides of the aisle,  political pundits, commentators, and, yes, the President of the United  States would cease and desist from trying to intimidate this  whistleblower and all of those who may be whistleblowers.   The intent of that legislation, the intent of those protections, the  intent of witness protection statutes and intimidation of witnesses is  so that we will get at the truth and that our government of the people,  by the people, and for the people will be more honest, will be more  safe, will be more just.                            ____________________     Mr. Chair, I thank the chairwoman for yielding.   And I thank Mr. McHenry for his work on the committee. Mr. Chair, I  say to Mr. McHenry: There is still time to get well.   Mr. Chair, I rise in strong support of this legislation. I have been  the majority leader in years past, the minority whip in years past, and  now again the majority leader. During all of those years, I have been a  strong supporter of the Ex-Im Bank.   Mr. Cantor, who was the majority leader, and I worked together the  last time we brought this bill to the floor for reauthorization. There  were 42 Republicans, many of whom served on the Financial Services  Committee, who signed a discharge petition, a Republican discharge  petition, because the chairman of the committee refused to bring this  bill to the floor.                                time  1500    Mr. Chair, this bill enjoys the support of the United States Chamber  of Commerce, wide support among the business community throughout  America, support of the labor movement--the AFL-CIO and labor unions-- all over America, and the support of millions of workers who are  producing products here in America.   I have an agenda. I call it Make It In America. This is critical to  that because all of our competitors around the world have an agency  similar to the Export-Import Bank that facilitates their products being  sold in competition with ours.   If we fail to reauthorize this piece of legislation, and if we fail  to effect the reforms that have been included in not only dealing with  the amount of money that they are authorized to lend but also the fact  that we will not be locked into the inability of either a President or  a Senate to confirm members of the Ex-Im board, but we will be able to  act.   This legislation, therefore, is better than we have done before.   I thank Maxine Waters for her untiring leadership on this issue, and  I also congratulate my friend Denny Heck, a member of the committee  from Washington State who has been as tenacious and faithful in his  support of ensuring the reauthorization when we had the discharge  petition, and this time, as anybody in this House. I thank the  gentleman, Mr. Heck, for his leadership on this issue.   When that bill was discharged, some of you may remember, even though  the Republican leadership would not bring it to the floor, it had to be  discharged. Forty-two Republicans signed the discharge petition, led by  Mr. Lucas and Mr. Fincher from Tennessee.   Mr. Lucas is still here. I hope Mr. Lucas will vote for this bill  when he has the opportunity to do so one more time.   I had made the point with Mr. Cantor that I believed that the  majority of Republicans would support the reauthorization. And, in  fact, they did. The majority of Republicans, when the vote came, voted  for the bill that had been refused by Mr. Hensarling to bring it to the  floor.   So this is not as if it is some partisan piece of legislation. I  would hope the Republicans would have the courage--although I see them  too often marching in lockstep to their party principle rather than  their own principle. I am disappointed with that, Mr. Chair, because  this is a piece of legislation that will protect and create hundreds of  thousands of jobs and because it will make us more competitive.   We make some of the best products in the world, period. But we need  to be price competitive because people will be inclined to buy,  perhaps, a less quality product because it is cheaper.   That is why the U.S. Chamber of Commerce is overwhelmingly in support  of this. That is why the administration is in favor of reauthorizing  the Ex-Im Bank.   They say they want it clean. The President was initially, during the  course of his campaign, opposed to the Ex-Im Bank. Then he talked,  frankly, to some people in manufacturing who said: Mr. President, if we  don't have an Export-Import Bank, you said you want to create jobs, but  you are going to lose jobs.   So he changed his mind. Then, unfortunately, he appointed somebody to  head up the Ex-Im Bank who was totally against it, a guy named Scott  Garrett from New Jersey. The good news is the Senate said, because it  supports the Ex-Im Bank, they are not going to take Garrett, so his  name was withdrawn.   Mr. Chair, I appreciate Chairwoman Waters for bringing this to the  floor. I urge every Member of this body to support it. Don't snatch  partisanship from the jaws of bipartisanship every time you get the  opportunity.   Let's try to reflect to the American people that business and labor  are together, and, yes, even Democrats and Republicans, conservatives  and liberals, are together because this is good for American jobs. It  is good for people who want to make it in America.   That is what Ms. Waters, the chair of the committee, has been  arguing, and Mr. Heck, and Gwen Moore, who chaired the subcommittee  when we took it out last time, and others who have fought so hard for  this bill.   Our economy depends on strong export growth, not just for large  businesses, but small and medium-sized businesses in communities across  the country. It is not just the exporter. It is all the secondary small  businesses that provide products for those large exporters.   For this reason, the Export-Import Bank has traditionally had strong,  bipartisan support. A majority of Republicans just a few years ago  supported this bill. Not this exact bill. This bill should have that  kind of support, too.   There is not a single provision in this bill that those on the other  side of the aisle can legitimately label a poison pill. That doesn't  mean it is exactly like they want it. We don't always get everything we  want. But the central part of this bill ought to be supported by every  one of us.   The last time this came up, one Democrat voted against it. He is no  longer with us--not because of his vote on this bill. But I point out  to you that we are overwhelmingly for this bill. Business wants this  bill.   Usually, you don't see the Democrats saying yes to business groups.  This is for jobs for working Americans. That is why this bill has the  strong and unified support of the business community.   I am disappointed, frankly, that Republicans have decided to make  this bill partisan. Frankly, Mr. McCarthy was for this bill before he  was against this bill--not this bill. He was for the Export-Import Bank  before he was against it, if you look at the Record. He is going to  vote against it this time.   Mr. Scalise voted against it last time, as did Mr. McCarthy on the  reauthorization that I just mentioned that was discharged out of  committee, as did Mr. McHenry. All three of them opposed this bill in  the past.   So it is not a question of these amendments. For whatever reasons,  they are opposed to this bill. That is a shame. There is no reason for  supporters of American exports on both sides of the aisle not to come  together and support the Ex-Im Bank's reauthorization.   My hope is that what this House will do today is send a strong  message of support for the Export-Import Bank. Tell the rest of the  world we are going to compete. Tell the rest of the world we are going  to compete on an even playing field. Tell the rest of the world we are  going to support our exporting community.   Indeed, according to the National Association of Manufacturers,  during the 4-year period from 2015 to 2019 when the Ex-Im Bank lacked a  quorum needed to do its job properly, our country gained 80,000 fewer  manufacturing jobs and lost $119 billion in manufacturing output, all  because we didn't fix the quorum, which is now fixed in this bill. Let  me repeat that: 80,000 fewer manufacturing jobs and $119 billion in  lost output.   This fixes that. If you vote against this bill, you may be voting  against $119 billion--probably more because of inflation, maybe $150  billion--to the good. Not government spending, increased output,  increased economic activity, and increased jobs of 80,000, probably  more.   Countries all around the world have export credit agencies, as I have  said. In fact, China has three export credit agencies that provided  more support in just 1 year than the Export-Import Bank has provided in  its entire history.  [[Page H8854]]    What do you say by a ``no'' vote? We are going to retreat from that  competition. We are not going to play. Who does that advantage? China.  Who does that advantage? Every one of our other competitors. Who does  that disadvantage? American workers.   Mr. Chair, we need to give our exporters a fair, fighting chance by  providing export financing to American business. That is what this bill  does.   It is not a partisan bill. It is not a Republican bill or a  Democratic bill. Those of you who say you are probusiness and proworker  and want to build jobs, that is why the President of the United States  decided he is for reauthorization. He may not like a provision or two  in this bill, but the administration says they are for reauthorizing  this.   This gives you the opportunity to do that. Take it. This is not going  to be a partisan bill for any of us. Take this opportunity to stand up  as the majority of your colleagues did the last time this  reauthorization came to the floor, and as they have done every time it  has come to the floor.   Join me, my colleagues, in voting for American workers, American  manufacturers, suppliers, subcontractors, little businesses, small  businesses, and medium businesses. This is good for America. Vote  ``yes.''    Mr. Chair, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   Mr. Chair, by the way, Mr. McHenry is my friend. He and I have a good  working relationship, and I appreciate that friendship. I regret that  he is opposing this bill. I know there was an attempt to reach a  bipartisan agreement.   In candor, I think everybody on this floor needs to know there were  outside business concerns about that agreement, so it was not simply a  partisan act. It was that those who see this as a job creator thought  that some of the provisions that were put in the so-called compromise  would be harmful to job creation and to the sale of exports across the  sea.   But the reason I really rose--and I thank Madam Chairwoman for  yielding--is to say, yes, the President said he was going to veto this;  yes, the majority leader in the Senate said he is not going to bring  things up. That is unfortunate, but the statement I made is accurate.   The President of the United States says he is for the reauthorization  of the Export-Import Bank. That is a change in his position during the  course of his campaign in 2016. It is a change because he was convinced  that the reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank is good for America,  good for jobs, good for business, good for working men and women in  this country. And so he has repaired, also, to partisanship.   There are no poison pills in here. There may be some things you  wanted that are not in this bill; there may be some things in this bill  that I would have liked that are not in this bill. But the central  point of this is this reauthorizes the Bank.    Mr. Chair, I thank the gentlewoman.   It takes care of the challenge that we had when there was no quorum,  and the fact that we had no quorum was all about politics.   Don't make this about politics as well. An estimate of 80,000 jobs,  $150 billion lost because we didn't have a quorum. Let's not twist in  the wind.   This bill has 95 percent agreement. The gentleman who spoke before me  said he voted for this last time. There is no change that, in my  opinion, warrants a change in heart.   I know that there is some upset that the bipartisan bill that was  agreed to didn't fly, but it didn't fly mostly because the outside came  in and said: This will not help us; this will not affect the end that  we want. That record ought to be clear, Mr. Chairman.   So the chairwoman worked on bringing a bill to the floor that will  help. She has done that. I hope my colleagues will put their  partisanship behind them, put protecting, frankly, their positioning in  terms of negotiation behind them and vote for this bill.
