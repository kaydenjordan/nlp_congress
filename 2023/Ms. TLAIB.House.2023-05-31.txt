 Mr. Speaker, everyone, no matter their ZIP Code, should be  able to enjoy natural resources. This week, Congresswoman Melanie  Stansbury and I introduced the Environmental Justice in Recreation  Permitting Act to require the Biden administration to complete an  inner-agency report on the effects of special recreation permits on  environmental justice communities.   Our communities of color, Mr. Speaker, low-income communities, Tribal  and indigenous communities are on the front lines of the climate  crisis.   Enabling greater connections between environmental justice  communities and recreation opportunities on our public lands and waters  is just the beginning of advancing true environmental justice for our  residents in Michigan's 12th District and beyond.   Every single American, Mr. Speaker, deserves the right to breathe  clean air, and every American deserves to experience all that our  public lands and waters have to offer. This body must do more to  protect them instead of gutting our bedrock environmental laws.   This legislation, Mr. Speaker, did pass the House in the Protecting  America's Wilderness and Public Lands Act, and I urge my colleagues to  pass this commonsense bill again this session.                            ____________________
