 Mr. President, I welcome all Members back to the  Senate for a busy week, but first there is something I need to address.   Over the last several days, I was called unpatriotic, ``un- American,'' and essentially treasonous by a couple of leftwing pundits  on the basis of bold-faced lies. I was accused of ``aiding and  abetting'' the very man I have singled out as an adversary and opposed  for nearly 20 years: Vladimir Putin. This was less than 24 hours after  the outraged industrial complex was disappointed yet again by Special  Counsel Mueller.   Partisan Democrats and their media allies were crushed a few months  ago, when Mueller's report cleared the President of conspiring with  Russia during the 2016 campaign. Now their frantic hyping of the  special counsel's congressional testimony has fallen flat once again,  but the conspiracy theories and reckless accusations had to continue.  Too many people had invested too much time in the hysterical echo  chamber to simply wind it down and join the rest of us in the real  world.                            ____________________     Mr. President, the outraged industrial complex needed  a new target, and that is where I come in--Mitch McConnell--the hawkish  foreign policy conservative who has spent decades pushing back on  Russia every way I can think of, was accused of what amounts to treason  by multiple media outlets within a couple of hours.   These absurd smears weren't thrown out there by anonymous Twitter  accounts or fringe bloggers. Oh, no. This modern-day McCarthyism was  pushed by big-time outlets. The smear that I am ``a Russian asset'' ran  in the opinion pages of the Washington Post. The accusations that I am  ``un-American'' was broadcast on MSNBC.   This is the state of leftwing politics in 2019. It is like an  inflationary crisis but with outrage instead of dollars.  [[Page S5122]]  These people have worn out the volume knob so badly that they have  nothing left but the most unhinged smears. Welcome to modern-day  McCarthyism--McCarthy-like tactics out in the open for everyone to  see--in Dana Milbank's column in the Washington Post and on a major  cable channel run by NBC.   What started all this? Here was my crime--bless me, for I have  sinned: Last week, I stopped Democrats from passing an election law  bill through the Senate by unanimous consent, a bill that was so  partisan it only received one Republican vote over in the House. My  Democratic friends asked for unanimous consent to pass a bill that  everyone knows isn't unanimous and never will be unanimous, so I  objected.   These theatrical requests happen all the time in the Senate. I  promise that nobody involved, including my friend the Democratic leader  who made the request, actually thought he would get a Republican Senate  to instantly unanimously pass a bill that got one Republican vote over  in the House. This kind of objection is a routine occurrence in the  Senate. It doesn't make the Republicans traitors or un-American; it  makes us policymakers with a different opinion, but the outraged  industrial complex doesn't let a little thing like reality get in their  way. They saw the perfect opportunity to distort, tell lies, and fuel  the flames of partisan hatred, and so they did.   It started with the angry lies on MSNBC. The host lied and said I  have dismissed Russia's interference in our 2016 election as ``a  hoax.'' Of course, I have never said any such thing--ever. I have  spoken extensively and often about Russia's unacceptable interference  in 2016. I have constantly discussed all we have been doing to correct  the Obama administration's failures to respond more assertively to the  Russian threat, including on election security.   So let me make this crystal clear for the hyperventilating hacks who  haven't actually followed this issue. Every single Member of the Senate  agrees that Russian meddling was real and is real. We all agree that  the Federal Government, State governments, and the private sector all  have obligations to take this threat seriously and bolster our  defenses.   Claims to the contrary--claims that anybody here denies what Russia  did on President Obama's watch--are just lies. They are not partisan  distortion, not clever spin, just total fabrications.   At least this show is honest about what it offers--and it isn't  journalism. Immediately after the host finished his angry string of  false claims and calling me ``un-American,'' another panelist chimed in  to applaud the remarks, and here is what he said:         We are at war. It's time for the Democrats to wake up. . .       . [And] we're not necessarily going to play fair.    ``Not necessarily going to play fair''--well, I should say not. Let's  remember how deep MSNBC waded into the conspiratorial fever swamp over  the past 2 years.   They gave airtime to individuals like one guest who has publicly  tweeted, among other things, that a former White House adviser was  close to being executed for espionage and that Chief Justice Roberts  had sent the Marshal of the Supreme Court to the White House to  threaten the President. That is utter nonsense. They hosted these kinds  of conspiratorial voices.   Just a few days ago, one former host at the network pointed out that  ``MSNBC built segment after segment, show after show on building  anticipation for a big reveal,'' but then the Mueller report took some  of their most unhinged stories right off the table.   Then, just last week, the special counsel's in-person testimony  disappointed the political left yet again, so the conspiracy theories  needed a new target.   A few hours later came the Washington Post column. It was authored by  Dana Milbank, a pundit who spent much of the Obama administration  carrying water for its failed foreign policies and excusing President  Obama's weakness on Russia. Here is the headline: ``Mitch McConnell is  a Russian asset''--a shameful smear and based on more lies.   Mr. Milbank repeatedly claims that I have blocked all efforts to  raise our defenses against Russian meddling. The truth is, I have  championed the coordinated work between Congress, the administration,  and the States, which are primarily responsible for our elections, and  the Senate has passed several major provisions on this subject this  year. I have spoken frequently on the floor about the need to keep up  the progress and to stay vigilant. What is more, one of the specific  pieces of legislation he claims I have blocked is something I literally  have never opposed. His online column links directly to a bill, and it  is something I have never opposed.   You would think a columnist leveling these kinds of smears would at  least consult a fact checker before accusing an elected official of  ``aiding and abetting'' Vladimir Putin, but, alas, it is not even a  competent hit piece, just sloppy work.   Ironically, Mr. Milbank has frequently written pieces lecturing  Republicans who he feels has impugned others' patriotism. Back in 2013,  the same guy wrote a piece insisting that ``in America, a political  opponent is not the enemy.'' In 2015, he criticized ``nutters'' for  questioning the President's patriotism and said that ``such beyond-the- pale-rhetoric'' had to be thrown out ``to have a civilized debate.'' So  you get the picture.   When a liberal politician is being criticized, these leftwing pundits  become choir boys calling for civility and decency and high mindedness,  but when it is time to smear somebody on the other side, oh, they are  delighted to lead the charge.   As recently as 2017, this very columnist wrote:         [L]et's pause to remember: We are all the American people.       And we all love our country.    As all of our colleagues know, I have spoken at length about Russia's  attack on American democracy. I worked to ensure that Congress sent  hundreds of millions of dollars to the States to improve their defenses  and applauded the whole-of-government efforts that the administration  continues to carry out with States and localities.   Good news may not sell any newspapers, boost ratings, or help with  Democratic fundraising, but the facts are the facts. The facts are that  this administration has made huge strides--huge--on election security  since 2016. They made a noticeable impact in securing the 2018 election  and are vigilant and proactive as we head into 2020.   A few weeks ago, every Senator had the opportunity to attend an all- Members classified briefing that I helped to organize detailing the  major work that has been underway since 2016. I have been in a lot of  classified briefings over the years. It is not exactly common for  Members to break out in spontaneous applause, let alone bipartisan  applause, but that is exactly what happened in that classified  briefing. Behind closed doors, Democrats joined Republicans in  applauding the progress made since 2016.   This administration--thanks in large part to our friend and former  colleague, DNI Dan Coats, whom I was very sorry to hear is stepping  down--has increased and improved our intelligence collection on these  threats. It has built better and more functional relationships with  State election authorities. It has enlisted more help from the private  sector to identify and counter foreign influence campaigns. It has  worked more closely with foreign allies and partners who face similar  threats from Russia. It has imposed real costs on Russia for its  misdeeds and cut down on the ability of Russian intelligence to operate  inside our country.   In particular, the Department of Homeland Security has employed  special capabilities in all 50 States for detecting malign cyber  activity. It has deployed cyber security advisers all across our  country. It operates the National Cybersecurity and Communications  Integration Center and supports the Elections Infrastructure  Information Sharing and Analysis Center.   Among its many offerings to the States, DHS offers cyber security  assessments, detection and prevention tools, training, and career  development for election officials, all free of charge. Using the  hundreds of millions of dollars Congress sent to the States, which I  proudly voted for and supported, the authorities who actually conduct  our elections on the frontlines have gotten themselves better prepared.   This is a long list of significant achievements--achievements that my  [[Page S5123]]  Democratic colleagues applauded and cheered behind closed doors when  the administration briefed us a few weeks ago. But in public? In public  and in front of the cameras, some of my colleagues quickly pivoted  right back into hysterical accusations that only fan the flames of this  modern-day McCarthyism.   These pundits are lying when they dismiss the work that has been  done. They are lying when they insist I have personally blocked  actions, which in fact I have championed and the Senate has passed.  They are lying when they suggest that either party is against defending  our democracy. This work is essential, and it will continue.   Over 2 years ago, I asked Chairman Burr and the Intelligence  Committee to take a hard bipartisan look at all aspects of the Russian  threat in 2016 and the steps the Obama administration took or failed to  take to defend against it. Here was the headline in December 2016 from  NBC news: ``McConnell Backs Senate Investigations of Russian Hacking.''  We wanted a serious, detailed investigation, and not a political  sideshow. I am impressed and grateful for the nonpartisan work of the  committee staff under the leadership of Chairman Burr and Vice Chairman  Warner. The committee's reports on the various aspects of the threat  are now being released. They will add vital context and analysis and  inform on what to do about this ongoing threat.   I am sure all of us will be open to discussing further steps that  Congress, the executive branch, the States, and the private sector  might take to defend our elections against foreign interference. Any  further legislation must be informed by this detailed report and by all  the steps the government has already taken.   At the same time, you can be sure that I have spoken out against  Democrats' efforts to seize on the crisis and use it to advance their  other long-held partisan goals for the political process. Some of these  changes they have sought since long before the 2016 meddling--long  before it. So, no, I am not going to let Democrats and their water- carriers in the media use Russia's attack on our democracy as a Trojan  horse for partisan wish list items that would not actually make our  elections any safer. I am not going to do that.   My opposition to nationalizing election authorities that properly  belong with the States is not news to anybody who has followed my  career or knows anything about Congress. Even the New York Times'  editorial board noted over the weekend that while they certainly don't  agree with all my views, they are principles going back decades, and  the Times had to admit the Democrats are ``playing politics'' by  introducing legislation with--listen to this--``no chance of passing  the Senate [that] serves only to harden partisan divisions.'' That is  the New York Times this weekend.   So my differences with Democrats on complicated matters of election  law are the kind of disagreements we used to be able to have without  mainstream media outlets screaming that one side is traitorous. This  Congress and this entire country only works when we refuse to let  baseless smears displace real debate.   Benjamin Franklin said we have this Republic if we can keep it, and,  among other things, keeping our Republic means we can't let modern-day  McCarthyism win.   So here is my commitment: No matter how much they lie and no matter  how much they bully, I will not be intimidated. For decades, I have  used my Senate seat to stand up to Russia and protect the United States  of America. I am proud of my record. I am proud that it is right there  in black and white, and liars cannot gaslight it away.   In the 1980s, as a freshman Senator, I proudly stood with President  Reagan on missile defense and other aspects of his Soviet policy. While  the liberal media was shrieking that the Reagan-Bush foreign policy  wouldn't work, I was honored to support them with my vote and then  watch communism crumble.   Then, in the 1990s, I used my place on the State, Foreign Operations,  and Related Programs Subcommittee to sound the alarm when President  Clinton was too soft on Russia. Here is the Wall Street Journal on  December 1994: ``Kentucky Senator, Handed Keys to Foreign Aid, To Be  Most Potent Foe of Clinton's Russia Policy.'' Here is what that article  said: ``But the real challenge to the administration's policy is  [McConnell's] plan to attach stiff political conditions to that aid. .  . . threatening a cutoff unless Russia stops meddling in its neighbor's  affairs.''   Let me say that again. As early as the 1990s, I was on record as  laser-focused on Russia's meddling beyond its borders and making sure  the Russians were held accountable.   I ask unanimous consent that the December 13, 1994, article from the  Wall Street Journal entitled ``Kentucky Senator, Handed Keys to Foreign  Aid, To Be Most Potent Foe of Clinton's Russia Policy'' be printed in  the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:               [From The Wall Street Journal, Dec. 13, 1994]  Kentucky Senator, Handed Keys to Foreign Aid, To Be Most Potent Foe of                          Clinton's Russia Policy                          (By Carla Anne Robbins)         Washington--Jesse Helms may breathe more fire, but the       comparatively understated Mitch McConnell is the senator who       will be the most potent foe of the Clinton administration's       Russia policy.        As new Republican chairman of the key Senate appropriations       subcommittee overseeing Russian aid, Sen. McConnell will have       his hands on the foreign-aid money levers. He brings to that       task a deep mistrust of Russia's Boris Yeltsin matched only       by his skepticism of Deputy Secretary of State and Russia       policy architect Strobe Talbott, whom he describes as ``the       brightest, best-educated man I've ever met [who's] been most       consistently wrong.''        The senator from Kentucky is determined to wean the U.S.       from what he dismisses as ``Strobe-Talbot-Russia-      First(ism).'' Just yesterday, Sen. McConnell gave some idea       of what he has in mind when he unveiled his plan for       overhauling the American foreign-aid system. He pledged to       earmark spending on the former Soviet Union to ensure that       the lion's share of a shrinking aid package goes to countries       other than Russia.        But the real challenge to the administration's policy is       his plan to attach stiff political conditions to that aid,       ``linkages'' in Cold War parlance, threatening a cutoff       unless Russia stops meddling in its neighbors' affairs.        Sen. McConnell says that while his efforts to ``write       Russia policy into the foreign-aid bill'' have been       frustrated until now by a Democratic majority, ``I think it's       reasonable to assume that that's not going to happen this       year.'' Republican skepticism about Russia will only increase       because of Mr. Yeltsin's decision this week to send tanks       into the separatist region of Chechnya.        In a sign of the aggressive role he now intends to play,       Sen. McConnell yesterday upstaged both Sen. Helms, who will       run the Foreign Relations Committee, and the Clinton       administration by releasing his own version of a new foreign-      aid budget. He proposed doing away entirely with the Agency       for International Development, the nation's principal       foreign-aid agency, and making free-market policies rather       than human rights or absolute need the standard for deciding       who gets help. ``In the past, development assistance has       focused on relieving the symptoms of poverty and despair,''       he said. ``But by any standard, the fact is most poor       countries are still poor.''                             cutting back on aid         Overall, Sen. McConnell's program calls for cutting foreign       aid by some 20%, with only the Middle East, the former Soviet       Union and Eastern Europe escaping cuts that deep. Sen.       McConnell made clear that the only reason the former Soviet       Union would get $750 million under his plan, just $100       million less than currently, is his intention to send a       significant portion of that money to former Soviet Republics       such as Ukraine and Armenia, not to Russia.        A well-described Internationalist who has supported aid to       Russia in the past, Mr. McConnell is likely to have great       credibility in a Republican-controlled Congress fearful of       being tarred isolationist but also deeply skeptical about       foreign aid and Messrs. Yeltsin and Talbott.        Mr. McConnell and the Appropriations Committee may also       have more real power than Sen. Helms and his Foreign       Relations Committee, which is supposed to write foreign-aid       bills but hasn't succeeded in getting one passed since 1986.       The job won't get easier under a divisive figure such as Sen.       Helms. That leaves the task of actually parceling out foreign       aid to the appropriating committees. Mr. McConnell's House       counterpart, Alabama Rep. Sonny Callahan, who has tried to       kill Russia aid before, will be supportive.                           taste of battles to come         The administration got a taste last summer of battles to       come with Mr. McConnell. At his urging, the Democratically       controlled Senate voted to cut off all U.S. funds to Russia       unless its troops pulled out of Estonia by their promised       withdrawal date of Aug. 31. The provision was struck in a       conference committee, but only after frantic lobbying by       administration officials who warned that  [[Page S5124]]       brinksmanship would actually harden nationalistic feelings in       Moscow and make a withdrawal less likely. The Russians pulled       out on time, with both Sen. McConnell and the White House       claiming victory.        Mr. Talbott says that he's puzzled by the charges of       Russia-firstism. He notes that some 55% of U.S. aid to the       former Soviet Union this year will be spent outside of       Russia. Ukraine, in particular, will receive about $200       million, significantly more than the $150 million earmark       proposed earlier this year by Sen. McConnell.        Mr. Talbott also makes no apologies for his enthusiastic       support of Russian reform, which he says ``unarguably'' will       make life better for Russia's neighbors and the U.S. ``It's       not a question of `what's good for Russia,' but whether       Russia continues to develop in a manner that's good for       American interests and values and standards of international       behavior,'' he says. ``If Russia does continue to develop in       that manner it will also be good for the other countries in       the region.''        Mr. Talbott and others also warn against ``mechanistic and       punitive linkages,'' which he says are unlikely to alter       specific Russian actions and could end up souring what he       describes as a fundamentally sound relationship.                         republican internationalists         Despite all the Russia-bashing and Talbott-bashing on       Capitol Hill, and a recent bout of U.S.-bashing by Mr.       Yeltsin, President Clinton shows no signs of giving up on the       Russian leader. The administration's fiscal 1996 foreign-aid       request for the former Soviet Union, which goes to Congress       next month, will likely be close to this year's $850 million       appropriation, with Russia again receiving about 45% of the       total.        To get their package through, officials say they will rely,       as they have for the previous two packages, on the support of       a large cadre of Republican internationalists including       incoming Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole, House Speaker       Newt Gingrich, Sen. Richard Lugar and, they hope, Sen.       McConnell.        But whether that support is still there is far from       certain. Indeed, anti-Russian sentiment has been growing on       both sides of the aisle ever since Russian nationalists       scored big wins in last December's Parliamentary elections       and the Central Intelligence Agency unmasked longtime Russian       spy and senior CIA analyst Aldrich Ames. Ongoing quarrels       with Moscow over Bosnia and the future of NATO will only feed       those doubts in months to come.        Partisan jockeying may only make matters worse. The more       President Clinton claims his Russia policy as a success, the       more tempting it will be for presidential aspirants such as       Mr. Dole to criticize the policy and Mr. Talbott, whose       Brahmin manner, first-friend status and unstinting defense of       the Russians makes him an easy target. Even Mr. Gingrich, who       became a sudden convert to action in Bosnia after Mr.       Clinton's recent retreat, may be tempted to switch sides in       the Russian debate.        But even the less emotional and less partisan legislators       are having serious doubts as well. Sen. Lugar, a longtime       champion of Russian aid, says that three years of hard       experience show that spending such money effectively in       Russia is even harder than voting for it in Washington.        Pointing to a large backlog of appropriated but as yet       unspent funds--of the nearly $2 billion in economic aid       promised to Russia from 1992 to 1994, less than $500 million       has so far been spent--Mr. Lugar suggests that the       ``appropriators may simply ask what's the point of       appropriating any more.''     Mr. President, on the other end of the Clinton  administration, I used hearings to grill Democratic officials who were  soft on President Yeltsin and optimistic about President-elect Putin. I  didn't share Democrats' faith that Putin would be our friend.   I ask unanimous consent that two excerpts of my committee statement  from the April 4, 2000, Senate Committee on Appropriations,  Subcommittee on Foreign Operations hearing be printed in the Record.         There being no objection, the material was ordered to be       printed in the Record, as follows:   Senate Comittee on Appropriations, Subcommittee on Foreign Operations                        Hearing on USAID Programs--         Excerpts from opening statement of Sen. Mitch McConnell:        ``First, we should support immediate and unrestricted       access for humanitarian relief works, human rights       investigators, and the media. President-elect Putin says he       supports the dictatorship of law. Accepting the presence of       these organizations will tell us whether the president       intends to emphasize dictatorship or the accountability of       laws. Based on the UN High Commissioner's trip this week,       he's coming up a bit short.''        ``We should act with clarity, principle, and purpose. If       Russia rejects that agenda, it rejects the core freedoms and       virtues which define democracies. I see no wisdom in shoring       up dictators, even if you do dress them up as democrats.''     Mr. President, regardless of who was in the White  House and regardless of which way the political winds were blowing, I  have consistently treated Russia like the threat that it is. Even under  a Republican administration, I spoke out when I was afraid the United  States wasn't doing enough to stop the erosion of democracy and the  rule of law in Russia.   A conference report that I coauthored in December 2003 stated: ``The  managers remain gravely concerned with the deterioration and systematic  dismantling of democracy and the rule of law in Russia.'' We pushed  President Bush's administration--a Republican administration--to do  more.   And, of course, I helped lead the charge against the Obama  administration's completely feckless Russia policies. President Obama  mocked his 2012 opponent for taking Russia too seriously. His  administration sought a naive reset with the Kremlin, and for 8 years,  I helped to lead the charge against that weakness.   In 2010, I stood with John McCain and Jon Kyl to oppose the New START  Treaty, a watered-down placeholder for the sort of tough stance we knew  was necessary. As Vladimir Putin was building up his missile arsenal,  we even had to push President Obama to commit to deploying capable  missile defenses to Europe.   In 2012, I firmly supported sweeping legislation to authorize heavy  sanctions following the killing of Sergei Magnitsky in a Russian  prison. The Obama administration flinched and tried to tiptoe around  our legislation to avoid messing up their charm offensive, but we  backed him into a corner, and the President signed the bill into law.   In 2014, I and other Republicans constantly pressed President Obama  to get tougher on Russia with respect to Putin's aggression in Ukraine.   I ask unanimous consent that the news article dated March 4, 2014,  entitled ``McConnell: Obama's `Passive' Foreign Policy `Is A Mistake'''  be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                               [Mar. 5, 2014]     Mitch McConnell: Obama's `Passive' Foreign Policy: `Is a Mistake'                           (By Sabrina Siddiqui)         WASHINGTON--Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.)       laid into President Barack Obama's grasp of foreign policy       Wednesday, although he stopped just short of blaming Obama       for the crisis in Ukraine.        In recent days, a growing number of Republicans have       directly pointed fingers at Obama over Russian President       Vladimir Putin's aggression in Ukraine. GOP Sens. John McCain       (Ariz.) and Lindsey Graham (S.C.), as well as Rep. Mike       Rogers (Mich.), have all said that the president's attempt to       reset U.S.-Soviet relations showed he was both naive and too       trusting of Putin.        McConnell was asked during his weekly press conference if       he agreed with his Republican colleagues' assessment, to       which he responded with a lengthy critique of Obama's overall       handling of foreign policy.        ``I would put it this way: Can you think of any place in       the world where we're better off now than we were when he       came to office?'' McConnell said, before tracing Obama's       global approach to his 2009 address in Cairo, Egypt, which he       interpreted as ``questioning American exceptionalism and the       uniqueness of our own country.''        ``And he's acted in such a way, almost amounting to       passivity in many instances,'' he continued. ``We're not       suggesting here that the use of force is appropriate on very       many occasions . . . but there's a widespread kind of lack of       respect of U.S. opinion.''        ``It's no wonder that Putin looks at the United States and       sort of concludes that no matter what he does, he doesn't pay       a price for it,'' McConnell added.        The Kentucky Republican was pressed again to state whether       or not he believed Obama is to blame for Putin's move to       heighten Russia's military activity in the Crimean region.       Once again, McConnell implied as much without explicitly       holding the president responsible.        ``I think a passive approach to foreign policy, which       basically means not asserting American interests, is a       mistake,'' he said. ``Some leaders are going to exercise       power [and] will push limits as far as they can if they think       that there's no push back.''        McConnell added that he was ``hard pressed to think of       foreign policy successes'' under the Obama administration,       but nonetheless emphasized the need for Congress to work with       the White House on providing economic assistance to the       Ukrainian people.        ``We need to work with the administration to try to       undergird, if you will, reinforce the new administration in       Ukraine in every way that we can,'' he said.        Moments after McConnell spoke, Senate Majority Leader Harry       Reid (D-Nev.) came to Obama's defense and pointed to former       President George W. Bush's infamous declaration that he had       looked into Putin's eyes and seen his soul.        ``I've not heard Obama say that. In fact, I've heard Obama       speak out very clearly  [[Page S5125]]       about that what Putin has done is wrong,'' Reid said.        He added that it was unclear what the ``right wing''       Republicans attacking Obama were seeking from the president.        ``Did they think that he should do an Iraq move maybe?''       Reid said. ``I don't understand what they're saying. I think       that the cautious direction of the president has been very       good in Ukraine.    Mr. President, since 2017, I have continued reminding  everyone that Putin is not our friend. Russia is going to continue  trying to meddle. We need a comprehensive strategy to contest Russian  aggression, and alliances like NATO are critical for standing up to our  adversaries.   Once more, for good measure, I ask unanimous consent that the news  article dated August 15, 2018, entitled ``U.S. Senate's top Republican  likens Russia to `old Soviet Union' '' be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                             [August 15, 2018]       US Senate's Top Republican Likens Russia to `Old Soviet Union'                               (By Joe Gould)         Washington--Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.,       isn't ready to get cozy with Russia, comparing it to ``the       old Soviet Union'' on Tuesday.        A month after the Helsinki summit between U.S. President       Donald Trump and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin, at       which Trump discredited U.S. intelligence and American       policies isolating Moscow, the powerful Senate leader showed       he was on a separate track.        ``The Russians are not our friends. They try to create       problems in every way they can,'' McConnell said in a news       conference at Fort Knox, Kentucky, set up to tout the $716       billion National Defense Authorization Act that Trump signed       into law Monday.        ``I think the Russians are acting like the old Soviet Union       used to act,'' McConnell said, pointing to its alleged       meddling in U.S. and European elections and its 2014       annexation of Crimea from Ukraine. (Louisville-based Spectrum       News posted video of the presser.)        Without mentioning it directly, McConnell displayed his       differences with Trump and Sen. Rand Paul, the junior senator       from Kentucky and an outlier in the Senate when it comes to       Moscow. Paul, who visited Russia this month, said the       politics in America around the issues are poisoning the       chances for cross-Atlantic dialogue.        Trump's openness toward Russia has fueled tensions over the       separation of powers. Trump issued a signing statement for       the NDAA that claimed some provisions mandating tough action       on Russia would actually impinge on the powers of the       executive branch.        ``This signing statement is troubling because, yet again,       the President is showing the world he cannot be trusted when       it comes to standing by U.S. commitments and promoting our       interests over--his own,'' the Senate Foreign Relations       Committee's ranking member, Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., said       in a statement. He called on Trump to ``unequivocally stand       strong for the United States and our allies and against       Kremlin aggression.''        The Senate has taken a few bipartisan shots at Trump on       Russia, voting overwhelmingly to affirm support of NATO and       unanimously to oppose giving the Kremlin access to U.S.       officials. Still, Senate GOP leaders blocked a bipartisan       measure to reject Putin's denial of election interference,       mandate immediate enactment of sanctions passed by Congress       last year and ask Senate committees to hold hearings into the       summit's private meeting between Putin and Trump.        On Tuesday, McConnell lauded the NDAA's aid for Fort Knox       (home to Army Human Resources Command), its authorized end-      strength boost, and its recognition of America's tense       relationships with Russia and China.        ``It would have been denying reality and in a sense putting       our head in the sand not to have a significant increase in       military spending,'' McConnell said, acknowledging Defense       Secretary Jim Mattis' advocacy to Trump and Congress for       added spending.        ``In fact, we gave the Department of Defense exactly what       they asked for,'' McConnell added. The Senate leader also       praised Trump's tough stance against China on trade.        ``We'd rather not be adversaries, but we don't have a       perfect relationship either,'' McConnell said of Beijing.       ``The Chinese have become more aggressive on the military       side, which has been unusual for them in the past.''    Mr. President, I don't normally take the time to  respond to critics in the media when they have no clue what they are  talking about, but this modern-day McCarthyism is toxic and damaging  because of the way it warps our entire public discourse. Facts matter.  Details matter. History matters. And if our Nation is losing its  ability to debate public policy without screaming about treason, that  really matters.   In the middle of the 20th century, the original McCarthyism hurt  America's strength and diminished our standing in the Cold War by  dividing us against ourselves and letting lies, innuendo, and baseless  accusations crowd out reasonable politics. The frenetic politicized  witch hunt distracted from legitimate efforts to contest the Soviet  Union, including more sober efforts to root out real Soviet agents in  our midsts. In short, McCarthyism did the Russian's work for them.  McCarthyism did the work for the Russians.   Now, here we are in 2019. Again, Putin and the Russians seek to  provoke fear and division in our country, to undermine faith in our  institutions, to exacerbate our political divisions until we tear  ourselves apart, and, once again, it seems there are some who blindly  take the bait.   American pundits are calling an American official treasonous because  of a policy disagreement. If anything is an asset to the Russians, it  is disgusting behavior like that.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to Calendar No. 165,  H.R. 3877.    I send a cloture motion to the desk for the motion to  proceed.    I move to proceed to executive session to consider  Calendar No. 402.    I send a cloture motion to the desk.    I move to proceed to legislative session.    I move to proceed to executive session to consider  Calendar No. 394.    I send a cloture motion to the desk.    I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory quorum  calls for the cloture motions be waived.    I ask unanimous consent that the Senate resume  legislative session and consideration of the veto messages as under the  previous order.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that  notwithstanding rule XXII, following the cloture vote on the Liburdi  nomination, the Senate vote on the cloture motion on the Welte  nomination; I further ask consent that if cloture is invoked, the  Senate vote on the confirmations of these nominations in the order  listed at 11:30 a.m., on Tuesday, July 30, and that if confirmed, the  motions to reconsider be considered made and laid on the table and the  President be immediately notified of the Senate's actions.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  remaining votes in this series be 10 minutes in length.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session and be in a period of morning business,  with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 290, submitted earlier today.    I know of no further debate on the resolution.    I ask unanimous consent that the preamble be agreed to  and the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the  table with no intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Committee on Environment and Public Works be discharged from further  consideration of H.R. 2695 and the Senate proceed to its immediate  consideration.    I ask unanimous consent that the bill be considered  read a third time and passed and the motion to reconsider be considered  made and laid upon the table.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m., Tuesday,  July 30; further, that following the prayer and pledge, the morning  hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be  [[Page S5150]]  approved to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their  use later in the day, morning business be closed, and the Senate  proceed to executive session and resume consideration of the Liburdi  nomination under the previous order. Finally, I ask that the Senate  recess following the cloture vote on the Hendrix nomination until 2:15  p.m. to allow for the weekly conference meetings.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 7:40 p.m., adjourned until  Tuesday, July 30, 2019, at 10 a.m.
