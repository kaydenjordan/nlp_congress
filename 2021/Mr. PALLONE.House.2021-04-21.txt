 Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2630) to amend the Temporary Reauthorization and Study of  the Emergency Scheduling of Fentanyl Analogues Act to extend until  September 2021, a temporary order for fentanyl-related substances, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2630         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Extending Temporary       Emergency Scheduling of Fentanyl Analogues Act''.       SEC. 2. EXTENSION OF TEMPORARY ORDER FOR FENTANYL-RELATED                     SUBSTANCES.         Effective as if included in the enactment of the Temporary       Reauthorization and Study of the Emergency Scheduling of       Fentanyl Analogues Act (Public Law 116-114), section 2 of       such Act (Public Law 116-114) is amended by striking ``May 6,       2021'' and inserting ``October 22, 2021''.       SEC. 3. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 2630.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise to seek support for the Extending Temporary  Emergency Scheduling of Fentanyl Analogues Act.   As we continue to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, we are also facing a  tragic, growing trend of overdose deaths across this country.   We have lost nearly 1 million Americans since the beginning of the  Nation's drug epidemic. These Americans are sons, daughters, mothers,  fathers, neighbors, coworkers, and members of our communities. Now,  data tells us that the COVID-19 pandemic, increased isolation, and  related economic hardships over the past year may be hampering efforts  to turn the tide.   Last week, Madam Speaker, the Centers for Disease Control and  Prevention released its most recent data finding that, from August 2019  to August 2020, there were 88,000 overdose deaths reported. That is the  highest ever recorded in a 12-month period.   This most recent data represents a worsening crisis driven primarily  by synthetic opioids, such as illicitly manufactured fentanyl. This  drug is 50 times more potent than heroin and 100 times more potent than  morphine. Although fentanyl itself is often used for medical purposes,  use of illicitly manufactured fentanyl has increased in recent years,  including co-use with cocaine and methamphetamines. As little as 2  milligrams can cause a lethal overdose.   Congress has recognized this unprecedented threat and acted in strong  bipartisan fashion to combat it with resources to communities around  the country. We passed major pieces of legislation like the  Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, the 21st Century Cures Act,  and the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act.   At the end of last year, in the final omnibus bill, we included over  $4 billion to increase mental health and substance use services and  support. Recognizing the worsening trends early this year, we passed  the American Rescue Plan last month that provided an additional $4  billion in resources. This critical funding will be used to enhance  mental health and substance use disorder services supported by the  Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, the Health  Resources and Services Administration, and the Indian Health Service.   Madam Speaker, while this critical assistance is on the way,  unfortunately, due to the disturbing rates of overdose and substance  use, more work is clearly needed. The Biden administration is asking  Congress to extend a temporary tool we provided last Congress so that  agency experts can come together to examine the facts and come up with  an effective, long-term solution. That tool is the authority to  temporarily classify fentanyl-related substances as schedule I  substances under the Controlled Substances Act.   Ensuring fentanyl-related substances remain scheduled will maintain  an important deterrent to traffickers, manufacturers, and those  distributing this substance.   During an Energy and Commerce Committee hearing last week, the White  House Office of National Drug Control Policy's Acting Director Regina  LaBelle testified on the importance of this extension. Acting Director  LaBelle highlighted ongoing discussions with the Department of Health  and Human Services, the Department of Justice, and the Drug Enforcement  Administration. She testified that an extension of this temporary  authority would allow executive branch agencies time to convene and  present a long-term solution to this ever-changing drug environment  that balances the risk of illicit fentanyl with the need to ensure  appropriate enforcement.   The Biden administration is taking this drug epidemic seriously and  has delivered a thoughtful, thorough set of drug policy priorities. I  ask my colleagues to join me in giving these agency experts time to  produce a thoughtful, thorough solution to this scourge of overdose  deaths.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this measure, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from New Hampshire (Mr. Pappas), the sponsor of this  legislation.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Texas.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I would urge support for this bipartisan  bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.
