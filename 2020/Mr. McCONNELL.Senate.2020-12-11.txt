 Mr. President, the Senate needs to pass a stopgap  funding measure today to prevent a lapse while the bipartisan,  bicameral efforts close in on a full-year funding bill, and we need to  advance what will be the 60th annual Defense authorization bill.   This year's NDAA will cement the historic steps that Congress and the  Trump administration have taken over the past 4 years to rebuild and  reequip a 21st century fighting force. It directs investments in  technologies to maintain our strategic edge. It makes critical supply  chains more secure and the Pentagon more accountable. And in the face  of threats ranging from adversaries to this pandemic, it expands  efforts to keep our men and women in uniform safe.   I remain hopeful that essential progress on these items will  continue. We ought to pass a full-year funding measure, and I hope our  committees in the Senate and the House can complete their work and  deliver legislation next week.                            ____________________     Mr. President, that said, we know the American  people's eyes are trained on the Capitol for another reason as well.  Struggling families, exhausted health workers, and anxious small  business owners are waiting--waiting--for the Senate to do what I have  tried to accomplish over and over for months: Pass a significant,  targeted COVID-relief bill built on all the areas where bipartisan  consensus already exists.   We know what that common ground looks like: a new second round of the  Paycheck Protection Program so hard-hit small businesses can keep  paying their people, the necessary investments in distribution to get  lifesaving vaccines out to our people, and an extension of some  unemployment programs  [[Page S7434]]  that will otherwise expire in just a matter of days.   Republicans have been crystal clear about the sort of urgent and  unobjectionable relief we are ready to deliver. I even offered to  temporarily set aside one of our side's major requests, commonsense  legal protections--by the way, 6,500 lawsuits have already been filed-- to set aside commonsense legal protections to aid the reopening if  Democrats drop their own controversial outstanding demands. But day  after day, the Democratic leader finds new reasons not to compromise,  new ways to avoid taking yes for an answer.   In what universe should emergency aid for small businesses be  contingent--contingent--on massive bailouts for State governments with  no linkage to actual needs? Democrats are acting like it is more  important to supply the Governor of California with a special slush  fund than to help restaurant workers in California keep their jobs. Oh,  and, by the way, these demands for State and local government giveaways  are blocking urgent aid for struggling families at a time when many  States' tax revenues have largely gone up--up   In November, California admitted their tax revenue for this fiscal  year was running about 19 percent ahead of what they had predicted. The  Governor said earlier this week that he foresees a tax windfall-- windfall--not a horrible budget crunch, but a windfall of nearly $16  billion.   State lawmakers are preparing to argue over where to put all this  unexpected tax money. According to the L.A. Times, they are considering  topping up the State's cash reserves. They aren't just getting by; they  are putting more money away.   Here is another headline from a few days back--a State the occupant  of the Chair is familiar with--``Massachusetts tax revenue[s] eclipsed  total for last November despite COVID-driven recession.'' This is  another State where revenues are actually up over last year.   Whatever future problems Democrats may think they see around the  corner, it is preposterous to claim that these blue States that are  bragging about their tax windfalls must receive another Federal handout  right this instant, before working families can get a penny more.   Small businesses need saving right now. Unemployed people need relief  extended right now. Vaccine distribution networks need funding right  now. None of that should be held hostage over intergovernmental  bailouts for States that are currently raking in revenue faster than  they can spend it.   Yet the Speaker and the Democratic leader have persuaded their entire  conference that nothing should pass unless the Governors of California  and New York get to cut the line and jump in front of millions of  Americans who are trying to figure out how to pay their bills each and  every month.   Then there is Democrats' apparently strong opposition to enacting any  kind of legal protections to aid the reopening. Targeted, temporary  liability reforms are a common feature of national emergencies or  strange events, such as the Y2K mess and September 11. This is not some  new concoction; it is what Congress has done in the past.   But this time, Democrats say the trial lawyers' interests must come  first. They are threatening to kill any compromise whatsoever unless  Congress leaves small businesses, universities, and healthcare workers  as sitting ducks--sitting ducks--for frivolous lawsuits.   My colleagues across the aisle want to present this stance as some  bold crusade against evil corporations? Well, for one thing, it is the  big corporations who can afford the massive legal departments. Lawsuits  are not exactly alien from the perspective of the Fortune 100.   No, it is small business advocates who have been pleading with  Congress to pass legal protection since last May. It has been college  presidents and higher education experts who have sounded this alarm the  whole time. About 7 in 10 small business owners said a second pandemic  of lawsuits was a major concern. University administrators told us  liability is ``a national problem requiring a national solution'' that  could produce ``a chilling effect'' on American education if not  addressed. But Democrats are threatening to walk away altogether if  Republicans try to give these institutions what they need.   So look, a legislator's true position lies in what they do, not what  they say. What Republicans have done since July is make one attempt  after another to generate a consensus package that can actually be  signed into law.   What Senate Democrats have done is recite an endless--endless--chain  of changing stories about why nothing that anyone proposes is any good.  If my friends actually oppose PPP funding, vaccine distribution money,  or extending some expiring unemployment aid, let's hear why. But if  they do not oppose these things, let's get them out the door.   I have proposed setting aside both liability protections and State  and local bailouts and making law where we can agree. Democrats have  thus far declined, but at the same time, they are blocking an agreement  on these issues. So unless something changes, they will get to explain  to a restaurant owner that Democrats didn't let her get a second PPP  loan to save her business because her Governor needed a special slush  fund or explain to a laid-off worker that his relief program may expire  completely because Democrats didn't feel it was urgent or explain to an  older couple, who have hunkered down and survived this long year, that  their vaccines will arrive later than necessary because Democrats  wouldn't let us fund distribution.   If my Democratic friends don't want to explain these inexplicable  things, then they need to let us act now.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session  to consider Calendar No. 931.
