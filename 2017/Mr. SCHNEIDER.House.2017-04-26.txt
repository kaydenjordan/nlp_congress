 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Conrad 30  Waiver program set to expire at the end of this week. This program  helps match medically underserved communities, both rural and urban,  with much-needed doctors. Currently, foreign medical students studying  here using J-1 visas must return to their home country and wait 2 years  before they can apply to work in the United States. This makes no  sense.   The American medical education system attracts the best and the  brightest and produces the best medical graduates in the world. When so  many of our communities are struggling to attract medical  professionals, we should be creating incentives for these newly trained  doctors to stay.   Through the Conrad 30 program, a limited number of new physicians can  stay if they can commit to work 3 years in underserved communities.  Continuing the Conrad 30 Waiver program is a commonsense step towards  helping underserved Americans. I am proud to introduce H.R. 2141 with  Congressman Issa of California to extend and expand this program.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to do the same.                            ____________________
