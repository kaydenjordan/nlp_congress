 Madam President, I want to thank my colleague from  Missouri. And I will just mention here in the Senate his leadership on  so many issues are really going to be missed. Maybe he will reconsider  his decision to leave this august body, which is going to be a lot  less--a lot less of an institution that thinks hard about these  difficult issues when he is gone. So I want to thank Senator Blunt for  all he has done. He is a great friend of mine, so we are going to miss  him.   It is Thursday, and once again it is an opportunity for me to talk  about our Alaskan of the week.   Now, I know that our pages--the new pages, they are going to really  realize this is probably one of the most exciting, interesting speeches  of the week. Some of our friends in the media even like it because it  is end of the week. I get to brag about Alaska and talk about someone  who is doing something really great for our State, maybe their  community, maybe the country, maybe the world, right?   We have all kinds who do this.   I always like to talk a little bit about what is going on in Alaska  first.   So it is amazing how quickly the seasons go by because it is almost  summer solstice in the State. That is when the Sun rarely sets across  any part of Alaska and the State is filled with life, filled with  energy. You can feel it when you come up. Hopefully, we get a lot of  tourists this summer. I know we are going to get a lot. A lot of people  want to get up to Alaska, particularly after the pandemic. You can feel  it in the air when you are there, this sense of energy and excitement.   So our tourists are there now. They are seeing spectacular scenery,  wildlife, glaciers, our salmon-choked streams. They will be able to  hike through thousands of miles of State and Federal parks, climb  mountains, fly through the skies, and some are even there to watch  baseball. Yes, baseball.   Now, maybe not the Braves, but still good baseball. Now, I know that  is going to sound odd to some people. Now, wait a minute. Going up to  Alaska to watch baseball probably isn't the first thing that comes to  many people's minds when they think about Alaska.   But diehard American baseball fans know that Alaska has played a  fundamental role in America's pastime. They know how important Alaska  summers are and have been for decades, taking young college students  with raw but exceptional talent and growing them under the midnight Sun  into seasoned professional Major League Baseball players.   This is the Alaska Baseball League, one of the premiere amateur  collegiate summer baseball leagues that anybody plays anywhere in  America.   Let me give you just a few--and I mean a few--of those who have come  up through the Alaska Baseball League. It has produced some of Major  League Baseball's most well known All-Stars, including Mark McGwire,  Barry Bonds, Tom Seaver, Dave Winfield, and Randy Johnson, just to name  a few.   The Alaska Baseball League is sometimes composed of five teams,  sometimes six--two teams in Anchorage, one in Palmer, one in Chugiak- Eagle River, one in Kenai.   And then there is a team, a very famous team, in Fairbanks--the  oldest  [[Page S2998]]  and most storied of them all--which I am going to focus on today.   It is the Fairbanks Goldpanners; and the team's general manager, who  is our Alaskan of the Week, John Lohrke, makes the baseball magic of  Alaska happen.   So, first, a few words about John's background. He was raised in a  baseball family. His father, Jack Lohrke--Lucky Lohrke, as baseball  fans might know him--was a World War II veteran who landed on Omaha  Beach 6 days after D-day, fought his way across Europe, survived many  near-death experiences in combat and even back home; hence the name  ``Lucky.''   After the military, Jack played baseball as a third baseman for the  New York Giants and the Philadelphia Phillies.   After Jack Lohrke retired, his family moved to California, but, as I  said, baseball is in the Lohrke family's blood.   Our Alaskan of the Week, John, had an older brother, who was drafted  by the Red Sox, and John himself got into the game administratively. As  a college student at Santa Clara, he began helping his college team  behind the scenes.   In 1980, the Santa Clara coach was going to Alaska to coach the North  Pole Nicks. John thought that that sounded great and asked if he could  come. He did, he fell in love with Alaska and stayed, like so many in  our State.   He managed the Nicks for 7 years, then was the president of another  team, the Oilers, on Alaska's beautiful Kenai Peninsula; then it was  back to the interior part of the State, where John stayed involved with  baseball as a board member of the Goldpanners.   In 2016, he became president of the board, and now he is the general  manager of the Goldpanners in Fairbanks, the person in charge of making  it all happen. And what a responsibility and what a team and what a  history and what a legacy of excellence John has been part of.   Since its founding in 1960, the Goldpanners have had over 211 players  that have gone on to the major leagues. Isn't that remarkable--211  players? A pipeline into the major leagues from Fairbanks, AK. Who  knew? And that doesn't include the countless others who went on to be  coaches or general managers or scouts.   The current Cleveland Guardians manager played for the Goldpanners.  The current pitching coach for the Red Sox is also a Goldpanner  alumnus. As I mentioned, the Goldpanners are one of the premier  pipelines into the major leagues.   One of the highlights of the season in Alaska, something that is  happening very soon--actually, this Tuesday--is when the Goldpanners  play their most famous game. It is the Midnight Sun game, and it is  played every summer on the summer solstice.   The tradition of the Midnight Sun game in Fairbanks goes way, way  back. The first one of these games was played in 1906. Americans have  been playing midnight baseball in Alaska well over 100 years, and now  this game is famous--worldwide. It is a must-do bucket list game for  baseball enthusiasts all across America. Thousands of people, many of  whom come from across the globe, will gather for this game this  Tuesday, as they do every summer in Fairbanks.    Now, this game is a culmination of a dizzying array of activities  that occur in Fairbanks. Right now, parties, street festivals, a famed  Midnight Sun Run. Fairbanks--a great city. My wife was born and raised  there--is known for its spirit, generosity, and on the summer solstice  weekend, that spirit explodes. I will be heading there tomorrow. I am  going to partake in some of these festivities, including taking in a  Goldpanners game and maybe, as I usually do, join the many runners in  the Midnight Sun Run, where I have been known to bring up the rear of  all the runners. We will see what happens.   But for Tuesday night's Midnight Sun game this year, the Goldpanners  will be playing the San Diego Waves. The game starts at 10 p.m. in  Growden Park and goes until the wee hours.   With Fairbanks just 150 miles south of the Arctic Circle, the Sun  just begins to set in the north a little bit as the game gets underway  but never fully goes down under the horizon, and as the game ends, the  Sun is actually starting to rise again.   As one sports writer put it: ``It is the stuff that baseball dreams  are made of.''   And it is never dark. And throughout its century-long history,  artificial lights have never been used ever--not once.   John Lohrke, our Alaskan of the Week, understands how important that  particular game is to the larger culture of baseball, not just to  Fairbanks and the interior. He understands how important the  Goldpanners team is for all of Alaska, for Fairbanks, but for baseball  writ large.   Since starting in as a manager, he has put more money into the  stadium to spruce it up. There are a lot of pictures of some of the  great alumni there that I mentioned earlier in my remarks. He is  constantly in touch with members of the business community who help  sponsor and support the team.   He is in charge of getting housing for the 24-member team and the  coaches, many of whom are talented athletes who come up to Alaska from  the lower 48 for the summer.   He is in charge of transportation needs. He is in charge of the  vendors and ticket sales and the beer garden. He is in charge of making  all of this run smoothly for Fairbanks, for the team he loves, and for  the love of baseball.   ``I love Fairbanks,'' he said. ``And I love baseball. It's in my  blood,'' and this is where it happens.   So thanks to all the Goldpanner players and the community that  supports the team. Thank you, John, for all you do to make it happen to  bring us together to keep baseball alive. Congratulations for being our  Alaskan of the Week.   (Mr. WARNOCK assumed the Chair.)                            Tribute to Liz Banicki    Mr. President, I just talked about our Alaskan of the Week. I am  going to mention another Alaskan who deserves really, really great  praise. It is with a heavy heart that this week Team Sullivan will be  losing a critical member of our staff in the wonderful staffer Liz  Banicki, who is moving on to the private sector to help veterans, a  group she has worked tirelessly for during her time in my office.   Liz is from Eagle River, AK. She is a Chugiak High School graduate.  She graduated from the University of Portland with a degree in  political science and German studies. She received two Fulbrights to  study, first in Germany and then Austria, but her heart has always  remained in Alaska.   She interned for the late, great Congressman Don Young before joining  my campaign in 2014, my first election. She did a great job. Then she  came to Washington with my team, and she is a member of what we call in  our office the OG--been there from the beginning.   Liz's story is a story of success, and it has been an honor to watch  her hard work and all she has done for me, my team, and most  importantly, Alaskans.   She began with focusing on veterans and then expanded her role to  take on foreign policy and homeland security and trade and fisheries.   In the process, she became one of the most impressive staffers in the  whole U.S. Senate--I am a little biased, but I think it is true--on all  of these diverse issues. It is a marvel listening to her explain, for  example, fish import trade codes--so many of which she knows by heart.   She also understands and has worked the power of networking that has  helped her do her job so well. She knows countless people in think  tanks, the private sector back home, in embassies, and in the White  House; and that has helped her get the job done for Alaska.   That is Liz's ethos: Getting the job done.   Now, we all know these jobs take a lot of hours. Liz puts in those  hours. I can't tell you how many nights I have left the office 9:30, 10  p.m., and I will walk past Liz's office--she is still there working in  front of her computer, on the phone, making sure our veterans get the  help they need; working on banning Russian fish from being imported to  the U.S.; assisting refugees trying to get out of Afghanistan, which  she worked tirelessly on; working on my bill to deter China from  invading Taiwan--I could go on and on and on.   Now, we all know, having staff, they will push back on occasion when  they don't agree with the direction of their boss. It is something that  can be difficult but necessary. And I don't think  [[Page S2999]]  that anybody would accuse Liz of being shy from pushing back. She knows  her mind, and she speaks it, and she has done an exceptional job in my  office; and most importantly, she has helped thousands and thousands of  Alaskans.    So I just want to thank her for her dedication to her State, her  country, and to our office. We are going to miss her very much.   Good luck, Liz. You will always be a part of ``Team Sullivan.''   I yield the floor.
