 Mr. Chair, when I am at home, I don't hear anyone say,  Let's make it easier for folks to use big money to influence elections,  and yet there are provisions in this spending bill that would do just  that.   My colleagues across the aisle are putting these provisions into this  spending bill because they know that shocking our political system with  even more money is incredibly unpopular, and these provisions would  never pass if they were given an up-or-down vote in their own right;  therefore, I am standing up today for restoring accountability for  campaign spending and highlighting the two provisions that should not  be in this bill.   First, we need some sunlight in this murky world of campaign  spending. 501(c)(4) groups can play fast and loose in our elections,  and I want to be sure that they are actually working on issues that  impact the people I represent, not trying to get their preferred  candidates elected. And yet this legislation that we are voting on  ensures that the IRS will not have the authority to look into groups  that might be flouting the rules, and that is wrong.                                time  1630    Unfortunately, secondly, we have also seen the Federal Election  Commission struggle to enforce our campaign finance laws. This was a  body that was created after Watergate to make sure politicians don't  cheat. The Commission was designed to be the people's advocate in our  elections, and yet, unfortunately, it has seen more gridlock than  Congress.   The Federal Election Commission is once again undermined in this bill  because the bill says that the Commission cannot enforce any rules  regarding how certain special interests are able to raise money. We  should not be making it easier for political action committees to raise  additional money from a few wealthy individuals without Federal  Election Commission oversight.   We should be voting on campaign finance laws that strengthen the  integrity of our elections, not bills like this that weaken it. So my  hope is that we can chart a new course, a better course, and one that  brings people power back to these hallowed Halls rather than, again,  giving more power to the deepest pockets and to special interests.
