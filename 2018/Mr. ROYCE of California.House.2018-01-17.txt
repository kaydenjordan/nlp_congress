(a) In General.--Not later than 180 days after the date of       the enactment of this Act, the Board of the Millennium       Challenge Corporation, acting through the Chief Executive       Officer, shall submit a study to the appropriate       congressional committees that assesses the feasibility and       desirability of developing partnerships at the subnational       level within candidate countries that would be complementary       to, and, as applicable, concurrent with, any Millennium       Challenge Corporation national-level or regional investments.        (b) Content.--The study required under subsection (a) shall       examine--        (1) the extent to which targeting investments at the       subnational level might provide new opportunities for       reducing poverty through economic growth;        (2) the extent to which traditional approaches to defining       poverty may not adequately capture the nature of poverty       within a country;        (3) the types of subnational entities that might be       appropriate partners for subnational Millennium Challenge       Corporation compacts;        (4) how candidates for subnational partners might best be       identified; and        (5) what role each national government should play in       creating or implementing a subnational partnership.        (c) Appropriate Congressional Committees.--In this       subsection, the term ``appropriate congressional committees''       means--        (1) the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate;        (2) the Committee on Appropriations of the Senate;        (3) the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of       Representatives; and        (4) the Committee on Appropriations of the House of       Representatives.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and  extend their remarks and include extraneous materials in the Record.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I have been honored to serve as chairman of the House  Foreign Affairs Committee for the past 5 years. Over this period, there  has been no shortage of threats to our national security. But I must  share with you, there have also been great opportunities--opportunities  to make America safer, to make this country more prosperous through  strategic investments in diplomacy, and also investments in  development.   This bill before us today is one example. The African Growth and  Opportunity Act and Millennium Challenge Act Modernization Act seeks to  facilitate trade and private sector growth in poor but relatively well- governed countries. This is particularly true in sub-Saharan Africa.   Mr. Speaker, I would share with my colleagues the goal here is so  that they can grow their own way out of poverty. What this legislation  does is it seeks to help countries graduate from the need for foreign  aid, while simultaneously opening doors for American businesses to  break into the most promising emerging markets. For those of you who  have followed this, you have watched trade double and then triple with  sub-Saharan Africa.   Through AGOA--as we call this African Growth and Opportunity Act-- goods produced in eligible African countries enter the United States on  a duty-free basis. But to be eligible, countries must be committed to  the rule of law, to eliminating barriers to U.S. trade and investment,  to combating corruption, and to supporting counterterrorism activities.   So AGOA, as you can see, advances U.S. interests on so many different  levels. I am proud to be a member of the AGOA coalition from the  beginning. I was one of the original authors of the bill and I have  witnessed its transformative impact.   So despite its benefits, AGOA does remain underutilized in too many  countries. Prior to its reauthorization in 2015, I set out to learn  why, and I traveled to many countries in southern and eastern Africa,  where I met with U.S. and African trade officials, business leaders,  and entrepreneurs. I visited garment factories and power stations. We  saw trade hubs.   I heard a lot about poor infrastructure. I heard a lot about  competition with China and burdensome U.S. regulations that are  difficult to understand.   Then I walked into an artisan shop in Addis Ababa, and it was run by  a remarkable woman. Her name was Sara Abera. I learned that she, in  fact, had benefited from technical assistance through the U.S.-East  Africa Trade and Investment Hub. She was now exporting to the United  States through AGOA. I learned that she was, though, an exception to  the rule. She is not the rule.   Other than Sara, there were very few businesses and very few business  leaders and entrepreneurs that seemed to have the knowledge of how to  access AGOA. To fix this, the bill before us today would make  information about AGOA available to an easily accessible public  website. This bill also urges U.S. Embassies in eligible countries to  more consistently promote AGOA and trade hubs, and it seeks to bring  greater transparency to commitments made at annual AGOA forums to  followup on these commitments.   So this bill strengthens the Millennium Challenge Corporation, which  is already one of our most effective tools for incentivizing policy  reform and unlocking market-based growth in developing countries. It  increases the MCC's flexibility to promote regional trade,  collaboration, economic integration. It does this by allowing up to two  simultaneous compacts with an eligible country. It also improves  transparency and accountability. It does that by streamlining and  strengthening congressional oversight.   Trade and free-market principles, frankly, if we think about it, have  helped lift more than 1 billion people out of poverty over the last  decade. But it is not just this humanitarian goal that leads us to  invest in communities abroad. It is clear that investments targeted  towards greater health, towards growing a healthier society, and  towards growing a more sustainable society also helps advance U.S.  security and economic interests.   It is, therefore, vital that we ensure that two of our most impactful  development and trade facilitation tools--that is the African Growth  and Opportunity Act, and our Millennium Challenge Corporation--are  efficient, effective, and fully utilized. This bill will do exactly  that.   Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to support this important measure, and I  reserve the balance of my time.

Dear Chairman Brady: Thank you for consulting with the       Foreign Affairs Committee and agreeing to forgo a sequential       referral request on H.R. 3445, the AGOA and MCA Modernization       Act, so that the bill may proceed expeditiously to the House       floor.        I agree that your forgoing further action on this measure       does not in any way diminish or alter the jurisdiction of       your committee, or prejudice its jurisdictional prerogatives       on this resolution or similar legislation in the future.        I will seek to place our letters on H.R. 3445 into the       Congressional Record during floor consideration. I appreciate       your cooperation regarding this legislation and look forward       to continuing to work together as this measure moves through       the legislative process.            Sincerely,                                                   Edward R. Royce,      Chairman.                                   ____                                       Committee on Foreign Affairs,                                        House of Representatives,                                  Washington, DC, December 14, 2017.      Hon. Christopher H. Smith,      Chairman, Subcommittee on Africa, Global Health, Global Human           Rights, and International Organizations, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Smith: I am writing regarding H.R. 3445, the       African Growth and Opportunity Act and Millennium Challenge       Act Modernization Act, which the Committee on Foreign Affairs       marked up on September 28, 2017.        As the author of H.R. 3445, the Chairman of the Committee       on Foreign Affairs, and a legislator committed to the       protection of life, I have confirmed that nothing in H.R.       3445, including the amendments made by this bill, alters       existing statutory or policy prohibitions against the       performance or promotion of abortion under section 104 of the       Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2151b) or any other       provision of law, which categorically prohibits the       Millennium Challenge Corporation from utilizing U.S. foreign       assistance dollars--including funds reserved for       administrative expenses--to support the performance or       promotion of abortion overseas. This includes longstanding       prohibitions on the use of funds ``to lobby for or against       abortion,'' most recently enacted in Title III of Division J       of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 (P.L. 115-31),       which preclude U.S. foreign assistance agencies, including       MCC, from using their activities to promote changes in the       abortion laws of foreign countries.        I will place this letter into the Congressional Record       during Floor consideration of H.R. 3445, and thank you for       your cosponsorship and support for this important       legislation.            Sincerely,                                                   Edward R. Royce,      Chairman.                                   ____                                        Committee on Ways and Means,                                        House of Representatives,                                    Washington, DC, January 3, 2018.      Hon. Edward R. Royce,      Chairman, Committee on Foreign Affairs,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Royce: I am writing with respect to H.R.       3445, the ``AGOA and MCA Modernization Act.'' As a result of       your having consulted with us on this legislation, I agree       not to request a sequential referral on this bill so that it       may proceed expeditiously to the House floor.        The Committee on Ways and Means takes this action with the       mutual understanding that by forgoing formal consideration of       H.R. 3445, we do not waive any jurisdiction over the subject       matter contained in this or similar legislation, and the       Committee will be appropriately consulted and involved as the       bill or similar legislation moves forward so that we may       address any remaining issues that fall within our Rule X       jurisdiction. The Committee also reserves the right to seek       appointment of an appropriate number of conferees to any       House-Senate conference involving this or similar       legislation, and requests your support for such request.        Finally, I would appreciate your response to this letter       confirming this understanding, and would ask that a copy of       our exchange of letters on this matter be included in the  [[Page H434]]       Congressional Record during floor consideration thereof.            Sincerely,                                                       Kevin Brady,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I would like to close if the  gentleman has no other speakers. I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1415     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I will sum up here. What this bill does is unlock a  greater potential for AGOA, for the African Growth and Opportunity Act,  so communities in Africa can strengthen their own economies and become  U.S. trade partners rather than aid recipients. It also enhances the  impact of MCC by accelerating regional economic integration trade.   It is good for American taxpayers. It is certainly good for job  creators in the United States. It is good for our national security. It  is good for Africa--for the people of Africa.   I think this legislation is the product of more than 2 years of  negotiations. It enjoys very broad support. As I say, it doesn't cost  the taxpayers anything.   I really want to thank some of the Members who worked hard on this. I  thank Representative Karen Bass for her good work, Congresswoman Sheila  Jackson Lee, Ranking Member Engel, and Representative Chris Smith;  Senators Corker, Cardin, Isakson, and Coons. I thank them for their  help on my measure here today and for their continued commitment to  reducing poverty through market-based economic growth.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 3776) to support United States international cyber  diplomacy, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3776         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Cyber Diplomacy Act of       2017''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) The stated goal of the United States International       Strategy for Cyberspace, launched on May 16, 2011, is to       ``work internationally to promote an open, interoperable,       secure, and reliable information and communications       infrastructure that supports international trade and       commerce, strengthens international security, and fosters       free expression and innovation . . . in which norms of       responsible behavior guide States' actions, sustain       partnerships, and support the rule of law in cyberspace.''.        (2) The Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) on Developments       in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the       Context of International Security, established by the United       Nations General Assembly, concluded in its June 24, 2013,       report ``that State sovereignty and the international norms       and principles that flow from it apply to States' conduct of       [information and communications technology or ICT] related       activities and to their jurisdiction over ICT infrastructure       with their territory.''.        (3) On January 13, 2015, China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan,       Russia, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan proposed a troubling       international code of conduct for information security which       defines responsible State behavior in cyberspace to include       ``curbing the dissemination of information'' and the ``right       to independent control of information and communications       technology'' when a country's political security is       threatened.        (4) The July 22, 2015, GGE consensus report found that,       ``norms of responsible State behavior can reduce risks to       international peace, security and stability.''.        (5) On September 25, 2015, the United States and China       announced a commitment ``that neither country's government       will conduct or knowingly support cyber-enabled theft of       intellectual property, including trade secrets or other       confidential business information, with the intent of       providing competitive advantages to companies or commercial       sectors.''.        (6) At the Antalya Summit from November 15-16, 2015, the       Group of 20 (G20) Leaders' Communique affirmed the       applicability of international law to State behavior in       cyberspace, called on States to refrain from cyber-enabled       theft of intellectual property for commercial gain, and       endorsed the view that all States should abide by norms of       responsible behavior.        (7) The March 2016 Department of State International       Cyberspace Policy Strategy noted that, ``the Department of       State anticipates a continued increase and expansion of our       cyber-focused diplomatic efforts for the foreseeable       future.''.        (8) On December 1, 2016, the Commission on Enhancing       National Cybersecurity established  [[Page H436]]       within the Department of Commerce recommended ``the President       should appoint an Ambassador for Cybersecurity to lead U.S.       engagement with the international community on cybersecurity       strategies, standards, and practices.''.        (9) The 2017 Group of 7 (G7) Declaration on Responsible       States Behavior in Cyberspace recognized on April 11, 2017,       ``the urgent necessity of increased international cooperation       to promote security and stability in cyberspace . . .       consisting of the applicability of existing international law       to State behavior in cyberspace, the promotion of voluntary,       non-binding norms of responsible State behavior during       peacetime'' and reaffirmed ``that the same rights that people       have offline must also be protected online.''.        (10) In testimony before the Select Committee on       Intelligence of the Senate on May 11, 2017, the Director of       National Intelligence identified six cyber threat actors,       including Russia for ``efforts to influence the 2016 US       election''; China, for ``actively targeting the US       Government, its allies, and US companies for cyber       espionage''; Iran for ``leverage[ing] cyber espionage,       propaganda, and attacks to support its security priorities,       influence events and foreign perceptions, and counter       threats''; North Korea for ``previously conduct[ing] cyber-      attacks against US commercial entities--specifically, Sony       Pictures Entertainment in 2014''; terrorists, who ``use the       Internet to organize, recruit, spread propaganda, raise       funds, collect intelligence, inspire action by followers, and       coordinate operations''; and criminals who ``are also       developing and using sophisticated cyber tools for a variety       of purposes including theft, extortion, and facilitation of       other criminal activities''.        (11) On May 11, 2017, President Trump issued Presidential       Executive Order 13800 on Strengthening the Cybersecurity of       Federal Networks and Infrastructure which designated the       Secretary of State to lead an interagency effort to develop       strategic options for the President to deter adversaries from       cyber threats and an engagement strategy for international       cooperation in cybersecurity, noting that ``the United States       is especially dependent on a globally secure and resilient       internet and must work with allies and other partners''       toward maintaining ``the policy of the executive branch to       promote an open, interoperable, reliable, and secure internet       that fosters efficiency, innovation, communication, and       economic prosperity, while respecting privacy and guarding       against deception, fraud, and theft.''.       SEC. 3. UNITED STATES INTERNATIONAL CYBERSPACE POLICY.         (a) In General.--Congress declares that it is the policy of       the United States to work internationally with allies and       other partners to promote an open, interoperable, reliable,       unfettered, and secure internet governed by the       multistakeholder model which promotes human rights,       democracy, and rule of law, including freedom of expression,       innovation, communication, and economic prosperity, while       respecting privacy and guarding against deception, fraud, and       theft.        (b) Implementation.--In implementing the policy described       in subsection (a), the President, in consultation with       outside actors, including technology companies,       nongovernmental organizations, security researchers, and       other relevant stakeholders, shall pursue the following       objectives in the conduct of bilateral and multilateral       relations:        (1) Clarifying the applicability of international laws and       norms, including the law of armed conflict, to the use of       ICT.        (2) Clarifying that countries that fall victim to malicious       cyber activities have the right to take proportionate       countermeasures under international law, provided such       measures do not violate a fundamental human right or       peremptory norm.        (3) Reducing and limiting the risk of escalation and       retaliation in cyberspace, such as massive denial-of-service       attacks, damage to critical infrastructure, or other       malicious cyber activity that impairs the use and operation       of critical infrastructure that provides services to the       public.        (4) Cooperating with like-minded democratic countries that       share common values and cyberspace policies with the United       States, including respect for human rights, democracy, and       rule of law, to advance such values and policies       internationally.        (5) Securing and implementing commitments on responsible       country behavior in cyberspace based upon accepted norms,       including the following:        (A) Countries should not conduct or knowingly support       cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property, including trade       secrets or other confidential business information, with the       intent of providing competitive advantages to companies or       commercial sectors.        (B) Countries should cooperate in developing and applying       measures to increase stability and security in the use of       ICTs and to prevent ICT practices that are acknowledged to be       harmful or that may pose threats to international peace and       security.        (C) Countries should take all appropriate and reasonable       efforts to keep their territories clear of intentionally       wrongful acts using ICTs in violation of international       commitments.        (D) Countries should not conduct or knowingly support ICT       activity that, contrary to international law, intentionally       damages or otherwise impairs the use and operation of       critical infrastructure, and should take appropriate measures       to protect their critical infrastructure from ICT threats.        (E) Countries should not conduct or knowingly support       malicious international activity that, contrary to       international law, harms the information systems of       authorized emergency response teams (sometimes known as       ``computer emergency response teams'' or ``cybersecurity       incident response teams'') or related private sector       companies of another country.        (F) Countries should identify economic drivers and       incentives to promote securely-designed ICT products and to       develop policy and legal frameworks to promote the       development of secure internet architecture.        (G) Countries should respond to appropriate requests for       assistance to mitigate malicious ICT activity aimed at the       critical infrastructure of another country emanating from       their territory.        (H) Countries should not restrict cross-border data flows       or require local storage or processing of data.        (I) Countries should protect the exercise of human rights       and fundamental freedoms on the Internet and commit to the       principle that the human rights that people have offline       enjoy the same protections online.       SEC. 4. DEPARTMENT OF STATE RESPONSIBILITIES.         (a) Office of Cyber Issues.--Section 1 of the State       Department Basic Authorities Act of 1956 (22 U.S.C. 2651a) is       amended--        (1) by redesignating subsection (g) as subsection (h); and        (2) by inserting after subsection (f) the following new       subsection:        ``(g) Office of Cyber Issues.--        ``(1) In general.--There is established an Office of Cyber       Issues (in this subsection referred to as the `Office').

(b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that       the Office of Cyber Issues established under section 1(g) of       the State Department Basic Authorities Act of 1956 (as       amended by subsection (a) of this section) should be a Bureau       of the Department of State headed by an Assistant Secretary,       subject to the rule of construction specified in paragraph       (5)(B) of such section 1(g).        (c) United Nations.--The Permanent Representative of the       United States to the United Nations shall use the voice,       vote, and influence of the United States to oppose any       measure that is inconsistent with the United States       international cyberspace policy described in section 3.       SEC. 5. INTERNATIONAL CYBERSPACE EXECUTIVE ARRANGEMENTS.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and to include extraneous material on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, let me begin by saying the United States is increasingly  under attack by foreign actors online. Nobody knows this better than  our members on the Foreign Affairs Committee, but especially Mike  McCaul, who assisted me on this bill. As you know, Mike McCaul also  chairs the Homeland Security Committee.   So this legislation is focused on correcting a serious threat.   Malicious cyber activities by state and non-state actors threaten our  U.S. foreign policy, our security, and our economic interests right now  around the globe.   Last year, the intelligence community's Worldwide Threat Assessment  summed this up well. As they looked at the problem, they said: ``Our  adversaries are becoming more adept at using cyberspace to threaten our  interests and advance their own, and despite improving our cyber  defenses, nearly all information, communication networks, and systems  will be at risk for years.''   But it is not just the security of our networks that the United  States needs to protect. It is the very fabric of the internet itself  that is increasingly under assault by governments that want to erect  digital borders, that want to impose more control, and that want  censorship online.   The State Department has a critical role to play in promoting an open  and secure cyberspace by developing international norms of responsible  state behavior and deterring malicious actors from carrying out  destructive cyber operations.   Last year, the President signed an executive order charging the  Secretary of State with creating an interagency strategy to protect the  American people from cyber threats along with a plan to improve  international cooperation in cybersecurity.   Despite the prominent role assigned to the Department by the  President's executive order and support from this body for such work,  the office tasked with leading this effort for the State Department was  merged into the Bureau of Economic and Business Affairs. The concern is  that this limits the Department's ability to confront the full range of  issues in cyberspace--such as security, internet access, online human  rights, and cybercrime--beyond the clear economic challenges.   So I believe this sends the wrong signal to Moscow, to Beijing, and  to other governments around the world. The United States should make it  clear that we place a high priority on the whole range of cyber issues,  including cybersecurity, internet access, online rights, deterrence,  and cybercrime.   In testimony before the Foreign Affairs Committee--and here is the  good news--I was relieved to hear our Deputy Secretary Sullivan say  that this was just an interim step and that he expects cyber issues  will ultimately be elevated to a Senate-confirmed role. This is exactly  what this bill requires.   So now, more than ever, we need a high-ranking cyber diplomat at the  State Department to prioritize these efforts to ensure that we keep the  internet open, keep it reliable, and keep it secure. The bipartisan  Cyber Diplomacy Act is going to help counter foreign threats on the  internet, it is going to promote human rights abroad, and it is going  to also, by the way, create new jobs and economic growth here at home.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. McCaul), who is the chairman of the Homeland  Security Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, I would like to thank Mr. Sires. I  appreciate his efforts in supporting this legislation. I thank Mr.  Engel and Mr. McCaul, as well.   As the birthplace of the internet, it is the United States that has  been most impacted. We have a foreign policy and economic interests and  have been working internationally to ensure that the internet remains  open. Part of our idea is that this would be capable of carrying the  free flow of ideas. We thought it should remain reliable and secure.   But increasingly authoritarian regimes are very aggressively  promoting a different vision from the one that Americans brought to the  table, their vision of cyber sovereignty, which they sometimes call it.  What cyber sovereignty means for these governments is state control  over cyberspace. That does run counter to the values of a free people  and the values of individual and economic liberty.   Working with our allies and partners, I think the United States has  got to be prepared to advance our own vision of cyberspace when it is  under this kind of attack and censorship. The Cyber Diplomacy Act will  give us the tools to do just that.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues for their help with this  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 1660) to direct the Administrator of the United  States Agency for International Development to submit to Congress a  report on the development and use of global health innovations in the  programs, projects, and activities of the Agency.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1660         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Global Health Innovation Act       of 2017''.       SEC. 2. ANNUAL REPORT.         (a) In General.--Not later than 180 days after the date of       the enactment of this Act, and annually thereafter for a       period of 4 years, the Administrator of the United States       Agency for International Development shall submit to Congress       a report on the development and use of global health       innovations in the programs, projects, and activities of the       Agency.        (b) Matters To Be Included.--The report required by       subsection (a) shall include the following:        (1) A description of--        (A) the extent to which global health innovations described       in subsection (a) include drugs, diagnostics, devices,       vaccines, electronic and mobile health technologies, and       related behavior change and service delivery innovations;        (B) how innovation has advanced the Agency's commitments to       achieving an HIV/AIDS-free generation, ending preventable       child and maternal deaths, and protecting communities from       infectious diseases, as well as furthered by the Global       Health Strategic Framework;        (C) how goals are set for health product development in       relation to the Agency's health-related goals and how       progress and impact are measured towards those goals;        (D) how the Agency's investments in innovation relate to       its stated goals; and        (E) progress made towards health product development goals.        (2) How the Agency, both independently and with partners,       donors, and public-private partnerships, is--        (A) leveraging United States investments to achieve greater       impact in health innovation;        (B) engaging in activities to develop, advance, and       introduce affordable, available, and appropriate global       health products; and        (C) scaling up appropriate health innovations in the       development pipeline.        (3) A description of collaboration and coordination with       other Federal departments and agencies, including the Centers       for Disease Control and Prevention, in support of global       health product development, including a description of how       the Agency is working to ensure critical gaps in product       development for global health are being filled.        (4) A description of how the Agency is coordinating and       aligning global health innovation activities between the       Global Development Lab, the Center for Accelerating       Innovation and Impact, and the Bureau for Global Health.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and include any extraneous material on the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1660, the Global Health  Innovation Act. I thank Mr. Sires of New Jersey, the ranking member of  the Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere, for bringing this forward  in a timely manner.   Over the past two decades, we have made unprecedented progress in  addressing some of the most difficult global health challenges of our  time. When you think about it, global rates of child mortality have  dropped by 53 percent. The prevalence of tuberculosis has been cut, in  fact, by half. Malaria deaths are now down 47 percent.   Five countries in sub-Saharan Africa once ravaged by HIV/AIDS are on  the verge of controlling their epidemics. The eradication of polio is  within reach. The only place it still exists is on the Pakistani-Afghan  border, which the Taliban controls. As you know, the Taliban resists  vaccinations. They, in fact, assassinate health workers who vaccinate.  That is the only reason we have not been able to eradicate this last  spot where polio continues to create damage to young lives.   Yet, despite these successes, we still do have a long way to go. Part  of that is reflected in the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa that  resulted in 11,000 deaths in 10 countries. It serves as a very stark  reminder of the global threat of infectious diseases.   Though global child and maternal death rates have been cut in half,  there is still an estimated 830 mothers around the world who continue  to die from preventable causes every day. That is why we talk about  maternal health.   USAID is working to address these global health challenges by  harnessing the power of science, technology, and innovation to develop  low-cost, high-impact health technologies. They are devoting  considerable time and resources to developing these innovations.   This bill makes sure that we ensure that they are being effectively  deployed. It supports USAID's efforts, while also enhancing  congressional oversight. It directs the Administrator of USAID to  report on the development and use of global health innovations in its  programs, particularly those related to HIV/AIDS, maternal and child  health, and combating infectious diseases to ensure that our  investments in global health are deployed and are delivering results.   Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to support the bill, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, again, I thank Mr. Sires of New Jersey, ranking member  of the Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere. I thank him for bringing  forward this timely measure.   The Global Health Innovation Act seeks to accelerate USAID's work to  identify, develop, and expand access to low-cost, high-impact health  technologies that will enhance the U.S. global health security agenda.  Frankly, that will save a lot of lives.                                time  1445    What it does is ensure that the time and the resources that are being  directed toward developing these technologies are put to good use, and  are put to good use quickly.   Mr. Speaker, I support this bill and I urge its adoption.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
