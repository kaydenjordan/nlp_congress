 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to share with my colleagues  in Washington--and all watching at home--the dire situation COVID-19  has created in the Navajo Nation and across our Nation.   But first, standing in this Chamber today, I want to recognize the  nearly 100,000 lives lost thus far to the coronavirus, a staggering  number that has affected families, communities, economy, frontline  first responders, and many others.   Though some Americans may feel they have reached a new normal, hot  spots across our Nation are still in the thick of this pandemic, and  the fear for what might come in the fall and winter is at the forefront  of our thoughts.   One of those hot spots is the Navajo Nation. Per capita, the Navajo  Nation has more confirmed coronavirus cases than any U.S. State. Under  the CARES Act, signed into law March 27, my colleagues and I fought to  include $8 billion for Tribal governments to use for expenses incurred  during the pandemic.   The first round of that funding did not reach the Navajo Nation until  May 5. Much of the delay was because officials within the Department of  the Interior were considering allocating a portion of this $8 billion  to the Alaska Natives Corporation, a group of for-profit entities that  generate billions of dollars in revenue each year, and answer to  individual stakeholders.   I immediately joined the voices of Tribes across our Nation in  demanding that these funds reach established Tribal governments, not  corporations.   On April 27, a U.S. district judge announced that the Treasury  Department could begin distributing money to federally-recognized  Tribes, and not to this corporate group. Delayed funding is not the  only issue here. While Tribes wait for the rest of the CARES Act money  they were promised, politics in Washington continue to complicate  already acute public health concerns on Navajo.   Recent reports indicate that respirator masks sent to Navajo Nation  hospitals through a Federal contract with a former White House staffer  may be faulty. I have serious concerns about the lack of oversight and  accountability in this contract-awarding process, considering that this  $3 million deal was awarded to a friend of the administration with no  prior Federal contracting experience, who had only been in business for  11 days.   It is unacceptable for government to be delivering anything other  than what is needed to any community, much less a hard-hit community  like Navajo.   I have asked my colleagues here to help me launch an immediate  investigation into the potentially faulty PPE, and to make sure that  the entire contracting process receives more oversight.   While Tribes deal with the fallout politics has caused, they endure  other  [[Page H2288]]  factors that have complicated this pandemic as well. Critical water,  sanitation, and broadband projects throughout the Navajo Nation remain  unfunded and firmly on Congress' back burner.   Since coming to Washington in 2017, I have tried to raise the alarm  about these long-overlooked issues. I have worked with Tribal  governments, shareholders in my district, and my colleagues here on  Capitol Hill to find solutions to the problems faced by Indian Country.   This public health crisis continues to shine a brighter light on the  hurdles that many Tribal families face every day, not just during a  global pandemic. I hope I can count on the many who have joined me in  speaking up for Tribal communities to continue to do so after this  crisis because lives are at stake here.   Tribal communities are tired of partisan games and political spin.  They need the resources they were promised so each sovereign Nation can  care for their people.   The Dine people are resilient and they will win this fight.   In a report yesterday from my friend and Navajo Nation President  Jonathan Nez, he noted that the Navajo Nation's own aggressive public  health measures have helped flatten the curve of COVID-19  significantly.   The situation could have been much worse without his leadership, and  the region remains at a high risk if the Federal Government does not  step up and do its part.                            ____________________
