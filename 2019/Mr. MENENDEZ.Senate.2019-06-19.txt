 Mr. President, I am very pleased that we have been able  to work on an agreement on the unanimous consent request that the  majority leader just propagated that would provide for votes on these  22 joint resolutions of disapproval over the administration's proposed  arms sales to Saudi Arabia and the United Emirates.   I thank the bipartisan group of cosponsors of these resolutions. The  majority leader and our staff are diligently working through an  unprecedented process. I would also like to briefly engage the chairman  of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Risch, in a  colloquy. I thank the chairman for agreeing to quickly take up two  priority pieces of legislation.   Earlier this year, I led a bipartisan group of Senators, including a  number on the Foreign Relations Committee, in reintroducing legislation  to hold Saudi Arabia accountable for its devastating actions in Yemen,  gross human rights abuses, and the murder of American resident Jamal  Khashoggi.   I understand the chairman has also been working on such legislation,  and we have agreed to use his legislation as  [[Page S3832]]  a base text to which we will be able to offer amendments, including  those that reflect the bipartisan consensus contained in my bill, the  Saudi Arabia Accountability and Yemen Act.   Additionally, the chairman has agreed to a markup of the SAFE Act,  which I believe will take place at a business meeting next week, which  prospectively eliminates the ability of the President to use emergency  authority to sell arms to any country that is not a NATO plus five  member. These votes couldn't be more important.   I am happy to yield to the chairman.    Mr. President, with that and with the chairman's  agreement that we will have a markup of these two bills moving forward,  I thank the distinguished chairman, and I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I rise to begin the debate in support of  22 resolutions of disapproval and ask my colleagues to join me in  asserting congressional prerogative over arms sales to foreign  governments and to say unequivocally that our security partnership with  Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, or any other nation is not a  blank check.   On May 24, the Secretary of State attempted to bypass this body in  order to push through 22 separate arms sales to Saudi Arabia and United  Arab Emirates, claiming an ill-defined emergency regarding Iran. Make  no mistake. Iran continues to be a threat to U.S. interests in the  Middle East. It continues to jeopardize the greater stability of the  region. It has been rightly designated a state sponsor of terrorism. I  think it is safe to say that no one in this body has been tougher on  Iran than I. But we must ask whether the administration's actions are  making us safer from Iranian threats or actually putting us more at  risk. Does this administration have a strategic, maximum pressure  campaign in place to address Iran's nuclear capabilities or its  destructive behavior or is the Trump administration's only plan to turn  the Middle East into a pressure cooker with no release valve? I fear it  is the latter.   Let me address the resolutions at hand, highlighting just a few. Arms  sales are a critical national security tool, and reviewing and  approving them are core functions of the Senate Foreign Relations  Committee. We are responsible for considering how each proposed sale  fits into our broader foreign policy goals and our national security  interests, including the capacity and interoperability of our partners.   The congressional review of arms sales is mandated for a reason--so  that the Secretary of State explicitly cannot do what he tried to do  last month with these 22 sales to Saudi Arabia and the UAE.   Despite the Secretary of State's claims, his May 24 justification  lacks any detailed, persuasive information to demonstrate that these  sales will somehow better enable the United States or our allies to  address an imminent threat or ``emergency'' or that he was justified in  trying to bypass Congress.   Beyond failing to consult with Congress, I am troubled by the  administration's continued willingness to withhold information from  Senators. Just 3 days prior to the announcement, this ``emergency,''  Secretary Pompeo briefed the Senate on the very threat he now claims  justifies invoking emergency authorities. Yet during this briefing, the  Secretary did not mention, not once, any need to sell more arms to  Saudi Arabia to address such a threat.   An ``emergency'' by definition is an urgent and unexpected event  requiring immediate action. Yet last week, Assistant Secretary of State  Clarke Cooper admitted in an open House hearing that the decision to  make the emergency determination was in the works for months--for  months. When pressed on how an emergency declaration couldn't be in the  works for months, Cooper tried to argue that the ``emergency'' showed  up sometime in between the 2 days that the Secretary briefed members  and then made the notifications.   It doesn't work that way. If it is in the works for months, as you  testified, and you were thinking about it, you should have told us.   Their abuse of emergency authorities will ultimately be detrimental  to the State Department, the defense industry, and U.S. national  security.   For decades, the Congress, multiple Presidential administrations, and  the defense industry have engaged in the arms sales process in good  faith. The Senate has approved billions of dollars of arms sales to  dozens of countries.   Whenever I am concerned about a particular sale, I have sought to  work with the administration, the recipient country, as well as defense  firms to explain those concerns and to reach a mutually acceptable  solution. This approach has served all parties well. It ensures that  there is a check on the Executive, whoever that Executive is. It  ensures there is oversight over the number and types of U.S. weapons  that make their way around the world.   Allow me to outline a little bit of background regarding two of the  resolutions we will vote on individually: S.J. Res. 36 and 38, for  those keeping score. Then I would like to address border concerns with  Saudi Arabia and implications for some of the other sales.   These two resolutions are related to the sale of precision-guided  munitions and parts to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, weapons they have  used in the killing of untold numbers of innocent civilians in their  ongoing campaign in Yemen.   Over the course of 4 years, Saudi Arabia's air operations in Yemen  have killed and maimed thousands of Yemeni civilians. Ninety thousand  Yemenis have died. Eighty thousand children have died of starvation.  Seven thousand or more cases of cholera are reported. Three million  people are displaced--3 million people are displaced. Some statistics  tell us that there are 14 million more on the brink of starvation. The  United Arab Emirates has joined in this coalition in this fight on  Yemen, and there are credible reports, concerns that I raised about  abusive torture at Emirati detention centers  [[Page S4126]]  and illicitly transferring U.S. weapons to third-party actors in Yemen,  some of which the United States considers terrorist organizations.   These precision-guided munitions are supposed to be a way to avoid  civilian casualties. Saudi Arabia has apparently intentionally targeted  hospitals, bridges, power stations, apartment buildings, weddings,  schools, and even a school bus filled with children--filled with  children.   We have heard claims that these precision-guided munitions are  ``humanitarian'' weapons and that they reduce the chance of accidently  hitting and killing civilians. Well, that is not the case if the Saudis  are purposefully targeting civilians in the first place. They only  target them with greater precision.   In light of the harrowing conflict in Yemen and in line with our  regular committee process, last year I placed, as the ranking Democrat  on the committee, an informal hold on the sale of 60,000 precision- guided munitions, PGMs, to Saudi Arabia.   I sent a detailed letter to the Secretaries of State and Defense. I  outlined my concerns and asked for more convincing information about  how U.S. assistance would improve Saudi Arabia's appalling behavior.   Simply put, I followed every standard procedure in good faith and  with respect for the executive branch's critical duty to protect our  national security. Yet, for months upon months, this administration has  failed to demonstrate how equipping the Saudis with more weapons would  improve the Saudis' respect for human rights in Yemen or advance  America's own values and national security interests, nor has this  administration explained how these arms sales would improve the Saudi  Air Force and command authority's ability and willingness to  differentiate between military and nonmilitary targets and thereby  reduce the wholesale slaughter of civilians in Yemen.   In fact, after last year's brutal murder of the Washington Post  journalist and American resident, Jamal Khashoggi, in October inside  the Saudi consulate in Turkey, the Trump administration apparently gave  up on trying to convince anyone that the Saudis have any regard for  human rights at home, in Yemen, or abroad.   Like a number of the other 22 proposed sales, these precision-guided  munitions will not be used to counter a sudden emergency threat from  Iran. This proposed sale of precision-guided weapons kits to Saudi  Arabia is slated for one purpose, and that is the Saudi's disastrous  air war in Yemen. Indeed, when asked this question directly in a  hearing last week, Assistant Secretary of State Clarke Cooper admitted  as much.   Let no Member of this body deceive themselves or the American people.  These bombs will most likely be dropped on Yemen--and not just on  Houthi rebels and what few legitimate military targets remain after 4  years of war. If Saudi Arabia acquires these weapons, American-made  arms are likely to be used to kill Yemeni civilians.   Finally, as with some of the other proposed sales, President Trump  and the Secretary of State are enabling the transfer of both American  jobs and sensitive American military technology to the Saudis. With  this particular export license, Saudi workers will begin to manufacture  part of the electronic guidance system for these precision-guided  munitions--work that has been done and should continue to be done by  American workers right here in the United States. In other words, the  administration is not only selling the Saudi these weapons but also  portions of the blueprints for building these weapons.   In the midst of so much volatility in the Middle East, how could  anyone possibly think that is a good idea?   America's defense industry produces the most sophisticated systems in  the world, and yet the Trump administration is opening the door for the  Saudis to manufacture their own similar weapons in the future or  transfer our American-made technical know-how to other countries.   Disturbingly, we also know that the administration will not stop with  this particular sale. State Department officials have actually admitted  to Foreign Relations Committee staff that this is to be the first of  many sales authorizing the Saudis to manufacture even larger, more  sensitive portions of these highly advanced weapons.   My colleagues, I hope you hear me because this is nothing short of  madness. There is no way, shape, or form that these precision-guided  missile systems could be used to address any kind of emergency, large- scale Iranian threat that requires bypassing 30 days of congressional  review. The same could largely be said of the rest of the 22 sales that  this administration is trying to ram through.   Finally, let me stress that since placing a hold on this particular  sale, I have actually cleared a number of other sales to the region. In  fact, I have cleared some of the sales the administration saw fit to  try to ram through. So let no one accuse me of stonewalling all arms  sales, of doubting the Iranian threat, or of ignoring legitimate  threats faced by the Saudis and worthy of our continued cooperation.   But there is simply no need at all for this administration to  flagrantly disrespect this institution and longstanding norms that  support good governance.   In light of the recent news about aggressive Iranian action and the  administration's decision to send more troops to the region, we must  always consider changing dynamics.   I urge the President to use the leverage he has indeed created from  his campaign to find a serious diplomatic path forward that  meaningfully constrains Iran's nuclear ambition and its other malign  activities.   I continue to believe that upending congressional prerogative doesn't  make us safer, and it is not in our long-term interest.   This administration's willingness to turn a blind eye to the  wholesale slaughter of civilians and the murder of journalists suggests  that a move forward with these arms sales will have lasting  implications for our moral leadership on the world stage. This behavior  sends a message that America is no longer exceptional and that our  behavior should be no different than a Russia or a China--pursuing  power, acting transactionally, and avoiding accountability.   My colleagues, America is better than this. It is well past time for  the Senate and the entire Congress to stand up and push back--to stand  up for our role as a coequal branch of government.   I would remind my colleagues that today it is President Trump.  Tomorrow it will be some other President, maybe one you disagree with.  If you set the precedent that you can just have arms sales go under  this false emergency procedure, you will have no say in arms sales.   Stand up for the rule of law instead of the rule of lawlessness, and  stand up for our greatest American values that transcend party and  politics and together defend the long-term security interest of the  United States.   Let me close by highlighting alarming and truly disturbing  developments just over the past 48 hours. Yesterday we learned that  over the objection of his own diplomats and belying numerous credible  reports about its recruitment of children from Sudan to fight in Yemen,  Secretary Pompeo blocked the inclusion of Saudi Arabia in the section  detailing the use of child soldiers in the State Department's annual  ``Trafficking in Persons Report''--over the objection of his own  diplomats. This administration is protecting Saudi Arabia, declining to  condemn its recruitment of children to fight its battles.   This morning, Agnes Callamard, the U.N. Special Rapporteur  investigating the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, released a gruesome,  scathing report about the murder itself and the appalling U.S.  response. She details calculated, horrific details, including plans to  cut up Mr. Khashoggi's body, with one participant saying that  separating the joints should not be a problem. This is truly horrific.   I could go on. I plan to return to the floor to speak tomorrow. I  know I have Senator Cardin here, a senior member of the committee, and  others.   Let me now simply say that this report has reignited and even  deepened the concern about why this administration seems incapable of  criticizing Saudi Arabia.  [[Page S4127]]    I urge my colleagues to think long and hard about what these votes  will signify to the American people, to our allies, to our fundamental  values, and to the institutional rights the Senate has to review arms  sales that are a critical part of our foreign policy. Do not give it  away to this administration or any other.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, let me summarize. I don't know of any  other colleagues at this point. I do know that some will probably speak  right before the votes tomorrow morning.   I thank the distinguished Senator from Connecticut, who has been such  a clarion voice from the earliest days on this question of the Yemeni  conflict. He has been there every step of the way in his arguing and  pricking of the conscience of the Senate as it relates to this. Senator  Cardin is also well-known for his advocacy of human rights in his many  years between the House and the Senate.   This vote tomorrow is a vote for the powers of this institution to be  able to continue to have a say on one of the most critical elements of  U.S. foreign policy and national security--arms sales--to not let that  be undermined by some false emergency and to preserve that  institutional right regardless of who sits in the White House. Do not  give up that power on behalf of this Senate and future Senates to come.  Think about what you will do if you cede that right.  [[Page S4129]]    Stand up for the Constitution. Article I of the Constitution became  the very first article. It is about this body's--the Congress'--being a  separate, coequal branch of government as the Founders of the Nation  envisioned. Stand up for the Constitution. Stand up for the proposition  that our bombs will not be the ones that create an incredible  humanitarian disaster for which our moral conscience will be stained  forever.   All Members will have that moment to decide where they want to stand  in history and whether their votes are to give the Saudis and the UAE  arms that ultimately drop on innocent civilians. Can you live with  yourself? Is this your moral compass?   Lastly, stand up for the proposition that the greatest country in the  world--the United States of America--will not stand by when a  journalist--someone who practices the First Amendment rights that we so  cherish, whether it be here at home or around the world--because of  nothing else but his criticism of the Saudi King, could be dismembered  by a saw in a consulate of the Saudi Government's in a foreign country.  How can we be silent in the face of that?   These are all of the elements that are involved in this vote  tomorrow, and I trust the Senate will live up to its collective history  and stand up for a moment of principle, a moment of courage, if you  will, and stand up for all of these values that make America unique, a  shining light to the rest of the world. That is what is at stake in the  three votes we will cast tomorrow morning.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
