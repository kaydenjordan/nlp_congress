 Madam Speaker, thank you to my colleague from  Washington for managing this important bill.   I rise today to speak in support of the Middle Class Health Benefits  Tax Repeal Act. We cannot afford to let this 40 percent excise tax on  employer-sponsored health plans to take effect. This tax would increase  costs for America's working and middle-class families.   For many working families, necessary medical treatment remains  tragically unaffordable due to exorbitant out-of-pocket costs and  deductibles. If this so-called Cadillac tax isn't repealed, this crisis  of affordability for medical care will only worsen.   To avoid the excise tax, employers will, in all likelihood, reduce  the value of their plans and reduce benefits and even increase their  workers' share of the cost. This would result in increases in out-of- pocket costs for more than 180 million workers, including 1.3 million  people in my home State of Nevada, and it would decrease access to  quality insurance plans across the country.   This vote helps labor throughout the country, including the Culinary  Workers Union in my home State. Members' benefits, wages, and overall  compensation allow them to stay afloat financially, and to quote the  international union president for UNITE HERE, D. Taylor: ``They drive  used cars, not Cadillacs, and their healthcare does not include spa  treatments.''   At a time when this is the reality for our constituents, Congress  should make sure that employers doing the right thing and providing  high-value health insurance to their employees are supported.    Madam Speaker, Congress should make sure that employers  doing the right thing and providing high-value health insurance to  their employees are supported, not penalized with an egregious tax.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from UNITE HERE and  several other national organizations.                                                     UNITEHERE!,                                       Las Vegas, NV, July 15, 2019.      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: On behalf of UNITE HERE and the       300,000 men and women and their families from the fastest       growing private sector labor union in America, I am asking       for your vote to approve H.R. 748, the ``Middle Class Health       Benefits Tax Repeal Act of 2019.''        It is time to finally put a marker down and bring real tax       relief to hard pressed working Americans, not just to health       insurance and medical device companies who have a legion of       lobbyists at their disposal. At a time when consumer anxiety       is high and where only one job should be enough to make a       living but isn't, the 181 million middle-class Americans who       receive their health benefits from a private employer need an       economic boost and some good news. I want to make the       position of our union and membership clear: We support tax       relief for middle-class Americans, starting with the repeal       of the 40% excise tax on employer-sponsored health insurance.        The so-called ``Cadillac Tax'' impacts far more health       plans than many members of Congress, including some       Democrats, who characterize these hard-earned health benefits       ``overly generous.'' In fact, the 40% excise tax unfairly       taxes our own members who make--all in, salary and benefits--      under $50,000 a year. UNITE HERE members' benefits, wages,       and overall compensation allow them to stay afloat       financially. They drive used cars, not Cadillacs, and their       health care does not include spa treatments.        Delayed but not yet repealed, this tax has already       incentivized employers to dramatically reduce their health       benefits and overall compensation to avoid the tax       thresholds. As you should be aware, health care costs are       soaring. In fact, 73% of employers have changed, or plan to       change, their health insurance offerings to avoid the tax,       according to a recent survey by the International Foundation.       Many of our low-income members reject pay raises just to       maintain their health benefits.        Our union is already doing its part to keep health costs       down among our members. Ken Blair, President of UNITE HERE       Local 217 says: We're fighting hard to keep our costs down       inside our union by making sure our members stay healthy or       making sure they use the most cost effective way to keep our       insurance low. Now we're going to be taxed!        Our membership is majority minority, a majority of women,       and represent workers from over (111) countries. On behalf of       our members, I again urge you to vote for H.R. 748 and stand       up for millions of middle-class Americans who receive modest       health insurance coverage through their jobs.                                                      D. Taylor,                                            International President,      UNITE HERE.                                   ____                                                   Service Employees                                             International Union,                                      Washington, DC, July 17, 2019.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the two million members       of the Service Employees International Union (SEIU), I urge       you to vote for H.R. 748, Middle Class Health Benefits Tax       Repeal Act, which will eliminate the 40 percent ``Cadillac''       tax on health benefits. Employers are using the tax as       justification to shift more costs to employees, raising costs       for workers and their families. Congress must take action to       ensure that everyone has access to affordable coverage       whether that coverage comes through an employer-sponsored       plan, private non-group coverage, or public programs.        Too many working families are struggling to afford high out       of pocket costs--including deductibles, co-insurance, and co-      payments required under their employer sponsored insurance       (ESI) plans. Unfortunately, the impending 40 percent health       benefits tax has exacerbated the trend of shifting health       costs to working people by creating new pressure for       employers to reduce the generosity of coverage in order to       avoid triggering the tax. Though some claim providing       consumers more ``skin in the game'' through increased cost-      sharing will encourage them to use care more efficiently and       reduce costs, research demonstrates that high cost-sharing       requirements prevent people from accessing even necessary       care, including care for chronic illnesses that could prevent       more expensive interventions in the future. For example, a       2019 survey of adults with employer health benefits conducted       by the Kaiser Family Foundation/LA Times found that half of       respondents said that they or someone in their family went       without or postponed needed care or medication as a result of       cost. Given the economic stress working people face, policies       should encourage high-value comprehensive coverage. The 40       percent health benefits tax acts to discourage it.        Furthermore, since their inception, unions have advocated       and bargained on behalf of their members for comprehensive       affordable healthcare. As a union, we value the robust health       insurance coverage we fought for at the bargaining table for       so many years, often at the expense of higher wages. Many of       our members live in geographic areas with higher living       expenses that include significant  [[Page H5971]]       health costs. The majority of our membership is comprised of       women; as they are likely to need health services that will       cost more than their younger male counterparts, their       coverage plans will be more expensive. We should not punish       workers who, through their union, are able to have a voice in       their pay and benefits and in fact should honor the choices       and decisions workers make through negotiations with their       employers.        For decades, SEIU members have fought for healthcare as a       basic human right, not a privilege. We believe that everyone       in America has a right to quality, affordable healthcare.       SEIU members support all legislation that improves and       strengthens our healthcare system--including expanding       coverage and lowering excessive out-of-pocket costs--that are       a huge financial burden on working American families today       and a major cause of economic stress. We view repeal of the       excise tax as a necessary improvement that is consistent with       our goal to support policies that make healthcare more       affordable. While some in the Administration and Congress       actively work to sabotage our healthcare system, whether       through regulation or legal attacks, it is heartening to see       that others are taking seriously their obligation to try and       improve America's healthcare seriously.        For all these reasons, we ask you to support the Middle       Class Health Benefits Tax Repeal Act (H.R. 74).            Sincerely,                                                    Mary Kay Henry,      International President.                                   ____                                                           LiUNA!,                                      Washington, DC, July 15, 2019.      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the 500,000 members of       the Laborers' International Union of North America (LIUNA), I       urge you to support and vote for H.R. 748, bipartisan       legislation to repeal the so-called Cadillac Tax provision of       the Affordable Care Act (ACA).        Since the ACA became law, this regressive tax has been a       looming dark cloud above every union member's health benefits       and the remaining 181 million Americans who rely on their       employer-sponsored insurance. For the half-million members of       LIUNA whose healthcare benefits are collectively bargained       for and essentially self-funded in order to provide good       healthcare for themselves and their families, this is       unacceptable and it needs to end now.        For nearly ten years, unions, businesses, patient       advocates, and consumer groups have supported repeal of the       Cadillac Tax, and, with over 350 cosponsors, we finally have       the opportunity to repeal it.        We urge you to support H.R. 748 and vote to end this unfair       tax on America's working class.        With kind regards, I am            Sincerely yours,                                                  Terry O'Sullivan,      General President.                                   ____                                                     Air Line Pilots                                       Association International,                                      Washington, DC, July 16, 2019.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the 62,000 professional       pilots represented by the Air Line Pilots Association,       International (ALPA), I write in support of the bipartisan       Middle Class Health Benefits Tax Repeal Act of 2019 (H.R.       748). H.R. 748, introduced by Representative Joe Courtney (D-      CT), repeals the 40% excise tax on health care plans.        H.R. 748 currently has 361 bipartisan cosponsors, and polls       conducted in 2018 revealed that taxing employer provided       health care benefits is opposed by over 81% of Americans. The       excise tax on employer provided health care benefits is       predicated on the flawed economic assumption that the cost of       a health insurance plan is the main driver of health care       costs. Detailed analysis of our health insurance system has       demonstrated that the real drivers of health care costs are       location, occupation, gender and age.        Without a repeal, many employers are necessarily preparing       for the introduction of the excise tax by increasing copays,       deductibles and out of pocket maximums in their health care       plans. The excise tax will further erode the health care       protection provided by our plans and drive out of pocket       costs up for professional pilots and other workers.        When H.R. 748 comes up for a vote this week, I urge you to       support it. Thank you for your consideration.            Sincerely,                                            Capt. Joseph G. DePete,      President, Air Line Pilots Association Intl.                                   ____                                                      July 15, 2019.      Hon. Richard E. Neal,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Congressman Neal: On behalf of our 3 million members       and the 50 million students they serve, we urge you to VOTE       YES on the Middle Class Health Benefits Tax Repeal Act (H.R.       748), which would eliminate the 40 percent excise tax on       ``high cost'' employer-sponsored health plans scheduled to       take effect in 2022. Votes on this issue may be included in       NEA's Report Card for the 116th Congress.        Under the Affordable Care Act, ``high cost'' employer-      sponsored health benefits whose value exceeds specified       thresholds will be subject to a 40 percent excise tax       starting in 2022: $11,200 for single coverage and $30,150 for       family coverage, the Tax Policy Center projects. We support       repeal because:        The tax would take money out of the pockets of educators       who have accepted lower wages in return for decent health       care coverage--just when there's growing recognition among       lawmakers and the American people that educators deserve       better compensation. Moreover, educators would be among those       hit hardest by the tax as noted in an analysis published in       Health Affairs.        The tax applies equally to plans for lower- and higher-      income employees, as well as retirees, regardless of whether       they live in areas with unusually high health care costs.        The tax is far likelier to hit plans due to factors beyond       employees' control--their age, gender, and location--than       because of the benefits provided.        Initially, the Kaiser Family Foundation estimates, the tax       would affect 21 percent of employers who provide health       coverage--31 percent when workers' voluntary contributions to       Flexible Spending Accounts are taken into account as the law       requires.        Over time, more and more workers would be subject to the       tax since health care costs continue to rise at a faster rate       than inflation.        Educators are already struggling to make ends meet--they       cannot afford to pay even more for health care. Please VOTE       YES on the Middle Class Health Benefits Tax Repeal Act (H.R.       748).            Sincerely,                                                      Marc Egan,                                   Director of Government Relations,      National Education Association.                                   ____                                              United Steelworkers,                                      Pittsburgh, PA, July 16, 2019.      Re United Steelworkers support H.R. 748, the Middle Class           Health Benefits Repeal Act of 2019.       House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the 850,000 members of       the United Steelworkers (USW), I urge you to support the       Middle Class Health Benefits Repeal Act of 2019 (H.R. 748).        With more than half of Americans covered under employer-      sponsored healthcare, the so-called ``Cadillac Tax'' could       affect the healthcare costs of more than 181 million       Americans across the country. By allowing this excise tax to       go into effect, hardworking middle-class families with       employer-sponsored healthcare plans could face reduced       benefits and increased out-of-pocket costs as employers push       to restructure and renegotiate workers' hard-earned       healthcare benefits.        The bipartisan Middle Class Health Benefits Repeal Act of       2019 (H.R. 748) would repeal the 40 percent excise tax on the       value of employer-sponsored health plans, ensuring that       workers and their families retain access to the care they       need. Although the tax has been delayed multiple times since       its inception, its looming nature impacts the bargaining of       multi-year contracts between USW members and employers. The       USW is currently negotiating contracts including healthcare       plans that will be subject to the tax without congressional       action, and workers are facing the potential costs at a time       when out-of-pocket healthcare expenses are already rising.        Despite hefty increases in premiums, deductibles and co-      pays, workers are not experiencing equivalent increases in       their wages. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation's 2018       Employer Health Benefits Survey, workers' healthcare costs       are increasing faster than both inflation and wages. Since       2008, deductibles on workers' plans have increased 212       percent and family premiums have risen 55 percent. Further       taxing workers' healthcare benefits will only add to the       burden of these increased healthcare costs, not reduce them.        It is time for Congress to permanently repeal the misguided       excise tax on employer-sponsored health plans. The USW urges       you to support the Middle Class Health Benefits Repeals Act       of 2019 (H.R. 748) and pass this important legislation.            Sincerely,                                                  Thomas M. Conway,                                           International President.     Madam Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues today to  stand with America's working men and women and support the Middle Class  Health Benefits Tax Repeal Act and vote in favor of abolishing this  tax.
