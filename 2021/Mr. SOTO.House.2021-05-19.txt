 Mr. Speaker, in honor of Asian American and Pacific  Islander Heritage Month, I would like to recognize Newlyn Wing.   Newlyn Wing is a current resident of Orlando, Florida, who over the  last 5 years has become a passionate advocate for building leadership  coalitions in the Asian-American and Orange County communities.   With a family history stemming from Michigan and Vietnamese refugees,  he grew up experiencing the individualistic and collectivistic cultures  of the United States and Vietnam. His upbringing created a belief  within Newlyn that our collective well-beings are tied to each other's  progress. He believes when our best individual efforts and perspectives  are shared, we can all progress forward.   This principle led him to pursue leadership positions and projects  with local and national nonprofits and associations. He holds roles as  the president of the National Association of Asian American  Professionals, Orlando chapter, and the chief strategy officer role  with the NAAAP national. Newlyn is passionate about strategies and  partnerships that give individuals a platform for building their  leadership and having a true impact in their industries and  communities.   In his work within the Orange County community, Newlyn has created  leadership programs for high school and college students, helped lead  voter education initiatives, and led efforts to increase the  representation of Asian American Pacific Islanders in community  leadership positions. He is grateful for the amazing leadership teams  he has been a part of and for the opportunity to serve his community.   Outside of his community volunteer work, Newlyn currently serves as  association manager for Junior Chamber International USA, a not-for- profit organization of young active citizens. The JCI USA mission, to  provide development opportunities that empower young people to create  positive change, aligns with Newlyn's passion and background.   For this and more, Mr. Newlyn Wing, we honor you.

She is a child  of Cambodian refugees who escaped the Khmer Rouge. Due to unfortunate  circumstances, she and her siblings were removed from her parents' care  and placed in the foster system. One of her first recollections of the  judicial system was when she advocated on behalf of her siblings to  have them reunited  [[Page H2606]]  under one roof. Rather than being broken by such adversity, she  embraced her experiences to fuel a passion for public service and child  advocacy. She aged out of the foster system and went on to become the  first in her family to attend college and graduate from the University  of Florida. She earned her J.D. from Stetson University College of Law,  where she earned the prestigious Victor O. Wehle Trial Advocacy Award  and the Thomas E. Penick, Jr. Award.

She is  also an active board member of the National Association of Asian  American Professionals, a member of the Orange County Asian American  Committee, and the scholarship chair of the Orange County Bar  Association Foundation.   But for all her accomplishments and accolades, her greatest pride and  joy is to share with her husband the adventure of raising three  multiracial daughters to become strong, empowered women.   For this and more, Mrs. Onchantho Am, we honor you.

Supporting his family financially, Sadiq worked as a dishwasher with  his brother-in-law Mohamed Amin in a diner in Schenectady, New York,  until they gathered enough money to build their own restaurant in  Newark, New Jersey.

Mr. Speaker, in honor of Asian American and Pacific  Islander Heritage Month, I would like to recognize Dr. Francisco Rueda  Halili, M.D., F.A.C.S.   Dr. Francisco ``Frank'' Halili, M.D., is a man who appears to have  more than 24 hours in a day. And for every single second of those extra  hours, there is a man living life to the fullest, a man of God and  country. He uses his time, talents, and treasures to help others.   A board-certified general surgeon in the central Florida area for  more than 27 years, Dr. Halili's sharp mind and skillful hands have  sought to provide the best care for everyone he meets. It is hard to  even imagine the number of lives he has changed either directly or  indirectly as a doctor.   Born in Manila, Philippines, to Filipino-U.S. immigrants who made  sacrifices, like many other immigrants do when starting over in the  U.S., he was instead raised by his grandmother in the Philippines.   A graduate of Ateneo de Manila High School, he would eventually  attend Florida Southern College, majoring in biochemistry, and later  attend medical school at the University of Miami School of Medicine,  class of 1988.   Dr. Halili did his surgical residency at Brookdale Hospital Medical  Center in Brooklyn, New York, and started his private practice in 1993  as a general surgeon in Kissimmee, Florida.   Anyone who has ever seen Dr. Halili in the operating room knows of  his love for his alma mater and UM Hurricane sports. His medical  students and nurses can easily spot him proudly wearing anything and  everything University of Miami, orange and green, all the way down to  his famous orange-colored operating room shoes. Go Canes.   Over his 27-year career, it is hard to say exactly how many hours Dr.  Halili has spent in surgery, with delicate hands caring for his  patients. But for every one of those hours, getting to the four  hospitals no matter what time or emergency, he has somehow defied the  laws of physics and created even more time in the day to be a full-time  loving husband to Joanna and devoted father to Francis and Francene.   For this and more, Dr. Francisco Halili, we honor you.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
