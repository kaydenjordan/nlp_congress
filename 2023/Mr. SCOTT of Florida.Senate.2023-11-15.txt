 Mr. President, I stand to recognize and  congratulate Alex Sanchez, president and CEO of the  [[Page S5539]]  Florida Bankers Association, on his retirement. Mr. Sanchez is a Cuban  immigrant and American patriot. Sanchez served in the U.S. Air Force  from 1976-1981 and holds a juris doctorate from the Iowa College of  Law.   Mr. Sanchez has served as president and CEO of the Florida Bankers  Association for 30 years and will be retiring on December 31, 2023.  Under his leadership, the Florida Bankers Association was instrumental  in bringing to light and stopping harmful Federal legislation and  regulation programs such as Operation Chokepoint and making nonresident  alien account information public. He also oversaw the association's  historic merger with the Community Bankers of Florida, combining the  two banking organizations to better serve Florida's banking industry  and the families and businesses it serves.   Mr. Sanchez was appointed by President George W. Bush and confirmed  by the U.S. Senate as a board member to the Federal Retirement Thrift  Investment Board, where he served from 2003-2010. Former Florida  Governor Jeb Bush nominated him to the Florida Schools of Excellence  Commission, where he served from August 2006-April 2007. Later, he was  chosen by the Financial Services Volunteer Corps for a mission to  Tunis, Tunisia, to partner with the Tunisian Bankers Association and  work with them on banking and priority regulatory reforms. He also led  a mission to Arusha, Tanzania, in 2013 to lead a workshop on regional  banking for the banking associations in the East African Community,  including Uganda, Tanzania, Kenya, Rwanda, and Burundi.   The Florida Bankers Association was established in 1888 to advocate  on behalf of Florida banks and promote the banking industry in the  State. The association provides unparalleled advocacy in Washington,  DC, and Tallahassee, excellent educational programming, quality  products, and valuable services for Florida's banking industry.   It is my honor to congratulate Alex on his many achievements and on  his retirement.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise to recognize the  Associated Builders and Contractors--ABC--Florida East Coast Chapter  and the many vital contributions to commercial, industrial, and  infrastructural construction that contractors make, improving the  quality of life for the people of Florida.   The ABC Florida East Coast Chapter was founded in 1968 and recognized  as the leader of the merit shop construction industry and one of the  oldest organizations representing the construction industry in Florida  for 55 years. The ABC Florida East Coast Chapter is the single largest  provider of apprenticeship education in the State of Florida, educating  nearly 700 apprentices annually.   The mission of ABC Florida East Coast Chapter is the advancement of  the merit shop construction philosophy, which encourages open  competition and a free-enterprise approach that awards construction  contracts based solely on merit, regardless of labor affiliation. It  represents the profession responsible for the construction of  commercial, industrial, and infrastructure projects such as schools,  hospitals, office buildings, sports venues, factories, energy  production plants, water systems, waste disposal and treatment  facilities, roads, bridges, and other public and private facilities  that are the foundation on which the economy of Florida stands and  grows.   I recognize that the ABC Florida East Coast Chapter, through its  education trust, is building tomorrow by recruiting, educating, and  training approximately 8,500 skilled workers in the past decade who  drive the construction industry forward with the merit shop principles  of free enterprise and open competition. The ABC Florida East Coast  Chapter's tireless collaboration with builders, contractors, and  educators has contributed significantly to the resilience and growth of  the construction industry. By providing quality education and fostering  a diverse and skilled workforce, the ABC Florida East Coast Chapter is  playing a crucial role in building a stronger America.   I wish to extend my heartfelt congratulations to the ABC Florida East  Coast Chapter and the ABC Institute for its unwavering commitment to  apprentice education. As we look toward a future of economic growth and  opportunity, their efforts serve as a shining example of the positive  change that can be achieved through dedication and  collaboration.                            ____________________
