 Madam Speaker, if enacted, H.R. 8 would turn  law-abiding citizens into criminals in the name of preventing crime.   H.R. 8 would establish universal background checks that aren't  universal at all, nor would we have prevented any of the recent crimes  involving firearms. The criminals involved either passed a Federal  background check or stole the firearms they used. This should prove  that background checks aren't the problem.   This bill doesn't stop at the transfer of firearms, but it also  requires background checks for temporary transfers of possession. Under  this bill, simply handing a gun to someone could result in a penalty of  up to 1 year in prison and a $100,000 fine.   For example, this weekend, my son brought some of his friends over to  the house to shoot skeet, and one of the young men borrowed my gun. So  now, are we criminals when we loan a young man a gun for learning to  shoot skeet?   I don't understand how in the world we are going to start to  criminalize everyday activities in this country.   We are talking about a waiting period. Remember, when we got this  mask, they told us 2 weeks to flatten the curve? We are a little over a  year now.
