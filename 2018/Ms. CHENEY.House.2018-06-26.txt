 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the proceedings  during the former Members program be printed in the Congressional  Record and that all Members and former Members who spoke during the  proceedings have the privilege of revising and extending their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 961 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 961         Resolved, That at any time after adoption of this       resolution the Speaker may, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule       XVIII, declare the House resolved into the Committee of the       Whole House on the state of the Union for consideration of       the bill (H.R. 6157) making appropriations for the Department       of Defense for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2019, and       for other purposes. The first reading of the bill shall be       dispensed with. All points of order against consideration of       the bill are waived. General debate shall be confined to the       bill and shall not exceed one hour equally divided and       controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the       Committee on Appropriations. After general debate the bill       shall be considered for amendment under the five-minute rule.       An amendment in the nature of a substitute consisting of the       text of Rules Committee Print 115-77 shall be considered as       adopted in the House and in the Committee of the Whole. The       bill, as amended, shall be considered as the original bill       for the purpose of further amendment under the five-minute       rule and shall be considered as read. Points of order against       provisions in the bill, as amended, for failure to comply       with clause 2 of rule XXI are waived except as follows: page       86, line 1, through page 86, line 7. No further amendment to       the bill, as amended, shall be in order except those printed       in part A of the report of the Committee on Rules       accompanying this resolution and pro forma amendments       described in section 3 of this resolution. Each further       amendment printed in part A of the report shall be considered       only in the order printed in the report, may be offered only       by a Member designated in the report, shall be considered as       read, shall be debatable for the time specified in the report       equally divided and controlled by the proponent and an       opponent, shall not be subject to amendment except as       provided by section 3 of this resolution, and shall not be       subject to a demand for division of the question in the House       or in the Committee of the Whole. All points of order against       such further amendments are waived. At the conclusion of       consideration of the bill for amendment pursuant to this       resolution, the Committee of the Whole shall rise without       motion. No further consideration of the bill shall be in       order except pursuant to a subsequent order of the House.        Sec. 2.  At any time after adoption of this resolution the       Speaker may, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare       the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on       the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R.       2083) to amend the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 to       reduce predation on endangered Columbia River salmon and       other nonlisted species, and for other purposes. The first       reading of the bill shall be dispensed with. All points of       order against consideration of the bill are waived. General       debate shall be confined to the bill and shall not exceed one       hour equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking       minority member of the Committee on Natural Resources. After       general debate the bill shall be considered for amendment       under the five-minute rule. It shall be in order to consider       as an original bill for the purpose of amendment under the       five-minute rule an amendment in the nature of a substitute       consisting of the text of Rules Committee Print 115-79. That       amendment in the nature of a substitute shall be considered       as read. All points of order against that amendment in the       nature of a substitute are waived. No amendment to that       amendment in the nature of a substitute shall be in order       except those printed in part B of the report of the Committee       on Rules accompanying this resolution. Each such amendment       may be offered only in the order printed in the report, may       be offered only by a Member designated in the report, shall       be considered as read, shall be debatable for the time       specified in the report equally divided and controlled by the       proponent and an opponent, shall not be subject to amendment,       and shall not be subject to a demand for division of the       question in the House or in the Committee of the Whole. All       points of order against such amendments are waived. At the       conclusion of consideration of the bill for amendment the       Committee shall rise and report the bill to the House with       such amendments as may have been adopted. Any Member may       demand a separate vote in the House on any amendment adopted       in the Committee of the Whole to the bill or to the amendment       in the nature of a substitute made in order as original text.       The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the       bill and amendments thereto to final passage without       intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or       without instructions.        Sec. 3.  During consideration of H.R. 6157 for amendment,       the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on       Appropriations or their respective designees may offer up to       10 pro forma amendments each at any point for the purpose of       debate.        Sec. 4.  (a) During consideration of H.R. 6157, it shall       not be in order to consider an amendment proposing both a       decrease in an appropriation designated pursuant to section       251(b)(2)(A)(ii) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit       Control Act of 1985 and an increase in an appropriation not       so designated, or vice versa. (b) This paragraph  [[Page H5669]]       shall not apply to an amendment between the Houses.        Sec. 5.  House Resolution 952 is laid on the table.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Hastings),  pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During  consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose  of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution  961, which provides a structured rule for consideration of H.R. 2083,  the Endangered Salmon and Fisheries Predation Prevention Act and a  structured rule for consideration of H.R. 6157, the Department of  Defense Appropriations Act for fiscal year 2019.   The rule makes in order amendments for both bills, including three  amendments offered by the minority to H.R. 2083 and several amendments  offered by members of both sides of the aisle for H.R. 6157.  Additionally, Mr. Speaker, I expect that we will consider a rule  tomorrow to provide for the consideration of additional amendments to  H.R. 6157.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2083, the Endangered Salmon and Fisheries Predation  Prevention Act, authored by my colleague, Ms. Herrera Beutler of  Washington, clarifies the authority and streamlines the process to  manage sea lion populations that are decimating ESA-listed salmon,  steelhead, and other non-listed species, such as white sturgeon in the  lower Columbia River. It also provides ESA-listed salmon in the lower  Columbia River a habitat where they can recover while controlling the  stocks of sea lions on a limited basis. The bill will benefit the  residents of the Pacific Northwest who have invested millions of  dollars to protect, restore, and enhance salmon and other endangered  species on the Columbia River.   In my home State of Wyoming, Mr. Speaker, we are far too familiar  with the abuses of the ESA. The goal of the Endangered Species Act  should be to recover species, not place restrictive and unnecessary  burdens and protections on threatened and endangered species in  perpetuity.   While the ESA process as a whole must be reformed, this bill provides  a targeted approach to allow the citizens of the Pacific Northwest to  achieve the original intent of the Endangered Species Act, which is to  recover species. This is a good bill. I support its inclusion in this  rule, and I urge its adoption.   Additionally, Mr. Speaker, this rule allows for consideration of H.R.  6157, the fiscal year 2019 Department of Defense Appropriations Act,  authored by my colleague from Texas (Ms. Granger).   Mr. Speaker, providing the funding needed by our men and women in  uniform to defend this great Nation is by far the most important  responsibility we have as Members of the United States Congress.   For far too long, Congress has failed in this regard. For nearly a  decade, we have forced our men and women in uniform to operate under  continuing resolutions and the devastation of sequestration.   In this Congress, Mr. Speaker, we have begun to change that. For  fiscal year '18, we provided $700 billion to begin to rebuild our  military from the cuts and misguided policy of the Obama years. But our  job is far from done. Rebuilding our military and providing the  resources needed will require dedicated efforts for years to come.   Mr. Speaker, we simply must stop forcing our men and women in uniform  and their families to pay the price for the dysfunction of the  congressional budget process.   Mr. Speaker, we know that this House is not the problem. In fact,  since Republicans took control of the House in 2011, we have never  failed to pass a defense appropriations bill on time and often with  large, bipartisan majorities.   With this week's consideration of H.R. 6157, we in this House intend  to keep that streak alive. However, as we have too often found, the  Senate is unable or unwilling to complete their work, and our men and  women in uniform suffer.                                time  1230    Secretary Mattis spoke late last year about this issue when he  released the National Defense Strategy. He said: ``As hard as the last  16 years have been on our military, no enemy in the field has done more  to harm the readiness of the U.S. military than the combined impact of  the Budget Control Act's defense spending cuts, worsened by us  operating, 9 of the last 10 years, under continuing resolutions,  wasting copious amounts of precious taxpayer dollars.''   Secretary Mattis then went on to say that: ``The consequences of not  providing a budget are clear: Without a sustained budget, ships will  not receive the required maintenance to put to sea; the ships already  at sea will be extended outside of port; aircraft will remain on the  ground, their pilots not at the sharpest edge; and, eventually,  ammunition, training, and manpower will not be sufficient to deter  war.''   H.R. 6157 is a bipartisan bill that provides the resources necessary  to continue the job of rebuilding our military. The bill provides our  troops with the highest pay raise they have received in 9 years. It  continues restoring readiness through increases in the operation and  maintenance accounts, including providing needed flight time and battle  training, as well as equipment and facility maintenance.   This bill also provides procurement funding to ensure our troops have  the tools and equipment they need, and increases the funding for  research and development for future needs.   We must, as General Dunford said in front of the Armed Services  Committee earlier this year, ``ensure we never send America's sons and  daughters into a fair fight.'' We need to ensure that they are armed to  prevail every time.   Mr. Speaker, we now face a more complex and dangerous set of threats  than at any time since the end of World War II. Passing H.R. 6157 will  help put us on the path we need to be on to restore the readiness of  our military so we can deter and, if necessary, defeat those threats.   In addition, Mr. Speaker, we must end this cycle and this decade of  budget dysfunction. We must repeal the Budget Control Act and provide  the stable resources our military needs, if we are to continue to  maintain an Armed Forces that is second to none. H.R. 6157 is an  important, bipartisan, and necessary step down that path.   Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I urge support for the rule to allow  consideration of H.R. 6157, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Alabama (Mr. Byrne), my friend and colleague on both the Armed Services  Committee and the Rules Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close as well, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my colleague's commitment to coming to some  sort of a resolution on the challenges we are facing at our border.   I think it is crucially important that we secure our border, and I  respect very much my colleague from the Rules Committee. I appreciate  that, perhaps, he doesn't believe in open borders, but certainly, Mr.  Speaker, we have seen across the country, including most recently a  Democratic candidate for Governor of New York referring to our ICE  officials as ``terrorists.''   That is the kind of rhetoric that really does a huge disservice and,  frankly, is shameful to those who are making sure that our borders are  secure, to those trying to protect us. We are a Nation of laws, and we  have got to ensure, Mr. Speaker, that we enforce those laws.   Mr. Speaker, I think it would be a benefit and a positive move for  the citizens across this country if both sides of the aisle were able  to come together on this. Unfortunately, we have gotten into a  situation where there are a number of people on the other side of the  aisle who believe we ought to have open borders, and we simply can't  accept that and can't defend that. We have got to make sure we secure  our borders, Mr. Speaker.   Mr. Speaker, there is a statue that stands at the Antietam National  Battlefield, which is just about 70 miles from here. Antietam, as  Members know, was the site of the single bloodiest day in American  history. Close to 23,000 Americans were killed, wounded, or lost that  day.   The statue, Mr. Speaker, is a statue of a Union soldier that  overlooks the graves of the fallen. There is an inscription on the  statue which says, ``Not for themselves, but for their country.''   It should be a reminder to all of us, regardless of party, Mr.  Speaker, that the ultimate sacrifice has been paid by so many Americans  in every single battle of this Republic's history, that those who fight  to secure our freedom do it willingly. They do it by saying they are  willing, as Secretary Mattis has said, to write a blank check to the  Republic.   They do it to defend everything we hold sacred and, indeed, Mr.  Speaker, to defend what we are doing here today, to defend our right to  debate, to defend our right to make laws, to defend our right to vote.   Those are the freedoms that are so crucial to the founding and the  establishment of this Republic. I am really proud, Mr. Speaker, that  with this Defense Appropriations bill, we were able to come together in  a bipartisan way to demonstrate our support for our men and women in  uniform.   What we need to do now, Mr. Speaker, is come together in a bicameral  way. We need to ensure that our actions are worthy of those men and  women on the front lines who are defending us every day.   We are considering a rule, Mr. Speaker, that will allow the debate  and the passage of this bill to fund our troops. For generations, young  Americans have--and again I am going to quote Secretary Mattis--``been  willing to shoulder the patriot's burden,'' to put on the cloth of our  Nation and to fight to defend all of us and all we hold sacred and  dear.   It is time for us in the United States Congress, the House and the  Senate, to shoulder our burden and to provide the funding our men and  women in uniform need.   Mr. Speaker, in addition to the Rules Committee, I also serve on the  Natural Resources Committee and the Armed Services Committee. Over the  course of the last 18 months that I have been in Congress, we have  received repeated testimony on the funding, modernization, and  readiness crisis facing the United States military.   I can say, Mr. Speaker, that no experience that I have had since I  have been a Member of this body has had a greater impact on me than  hearing from the Secretary of Defense, from the Chairman of the Joint  Chiefs of Staff, from all the combatant commanders, from all the  service Secretaries, time and time again, hearing them come before this  body and say that no foe in the field has done more damage to the  United States military than has the United States Congress.   I think it is really important for people to stop, think, and listen  to what that means. Our men and women in uniform and the leaders of our  military are making the case--an accurate case--that we have done more  damage than has any enemy.    We have absolutely got to stop that, Mr. Speaker. We have got to end  this process of sequestration. We have got to end the continuing  resolutions. We have got to end the dysfunctional budget process. We  simply cannot allow this situation to continue.   The threats that we face as a Nation are real, and they are growing.  Yet, as a Congress, we have continually forced our military to operate  on continuing resolutions of varying lengths for nearly a decade. We  have got to end this cycle of dysfunction. We cannot force our men and  women in uniform and their families to pay the price for our  dysfunction. That is simply reprehensible, Mr. Speaker.   I fully expect and hope that we will pass H.R. 6157 this week, and I  urge my Democratic colleagues in the Senate to forgo attempts to  filibuster this important bill and to work with Republicans in the  Senate and Members of this House to fulfill our most solemn and sacred  obligation, providing funding for the men and women in uniform who  volunteer to put their lives on the line to defend this great Nation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of both the rule, H.R. 6157, and H.R.  2083.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Hastings is as follows:            An Amendment to H. Res. 961 Offered by Mr. Hastings         At the end of the resolution, add the following new       sections:        Sec. 6. That immediately upon adoption of this resolution       the Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII,       declare the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole       House on the state of the Union for consideration of the bill       (H.R. 6135) to limit the separation of families at or near       ports of entry. The first reading of the bill shall be       dispensed with. All points of order against consideration of       the bill are waived. General debate shall be confined to the       bill and shall not exceed one hour equally divided among and       controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the       Committee on the Judiciary and the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on Homeland Security. After general       debate the bill shall be considered for amendment under the       five-minute rule. All points of order against provisions in       the bill are waived. At the conclusion of consideration of       the bill for amendment the Committee shall rise and report       the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been       adopted. The previous question shall be considered as ordered       on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without       intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or       without instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and       reports that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then       on the next legislative day the House shall, immediately       after the third daily order of business under clause 1 of       rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further       consideration of the bill.        Sec. 7. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 6135.                                   ____           The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not  [[Page H5672]]       merely a procedural vote. A vote against ordering the       previous question is a vote against the Republican majority       agenda and a vote to allow the Democratic minority to offer       an alternative plan. It is a vote about what the House should       be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to       a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to       yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first       recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no       substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''       But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the       Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in       the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,       page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous       question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally       not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member       controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the       motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the       time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering       the previous question. That Member, because he then controls       the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for       the purpose of amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on       Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further       debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:       ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a       resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control       shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous       question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who       controls the time for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools for those who oppose the Republican       majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the       opportunity to offer an alternative plan.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.
