 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from the great State of  Georgia for introducing me and for this opportunity to talk about an  important Supreme Court case, Janus v. AFSCME, Council 31, and the  importance of our unions.   Our unions give us much to celebrate in our neighborhoods nationwide.   As we know all too well, this case stands to destabilize collective  bargaining rights within the public sector. This is clearly an attack  on freedom and liberties of hardworking Americans.   We are in the business of doing no harm. That is what we should be.   All that this case aims to do is take away the rights of the ability  of hardworking Americans to have a strong voice in their workplace.  That is just not right.   Next month, the Supreme Court will hear the oral arguments in this  case to determine whether fair share fees violate the First Amendment  rights of workers.   When it comes to this case, a negative decision for our unions  nationwide would take us in the wrong direction.   Across the country, more than half of African-American workers and  nearly 60 percent of Latino workers are paid less than $15 per hour.  Union jobs have historically been, and continue to be, a path to the  middle class for people of color, who often face low-wage jobs.   African-American union members today earn 14.7 percent more and  Latino workers earn 21.8 percent more than their nonunion counterparts.  In some sections, the difference is even greater.   African-American women in unions earn an average of $21.90 an hour,  while nonunion workers earn $17.04.                                time  2030    In addition, there are more than 72 percent of women in unions who  have health insurance, while less than 50 percent of nonunion African- American women do not.   Our unions are a key road to our growing middle class, especially for  women and communities of color. Nationwide, our unions continue to be  on the frontline of fighting for higher pay, fair wages, safer working  conditions, and better hours to provide for themselves and their  families.   I will continue to stand on the frontline of protecting rights for  all hardworking Americans. It is up to us to lift up unions in all of  our communities.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Georgia for leading this  caucus in this need.
