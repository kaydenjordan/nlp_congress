 Madam Speaker, I rise today to deliver a simple  message: It is time to bring the United States-Mexico-Canada trade deal  to the House floor for a vote.   The USMCA is a big improvement over NAFTA, the old North American  Free Trade Agreement. This deal is fairer to American workers and  companies in a variety of industries. Farmers and ranchers get wider  access to foreign markets, and new rules make U.S. manufacturing more  competitive. The USMCA is the first trade deal to help small businesses  cut through international red tape.   The President has negotiated a deal that benefits not only large  employers, but also small businesses and middle-class families in  Republican and Democratic districts across the country.   The USMCA is important to successful negotiations with our other  trading partners. This and future trade deals will continue the strong  economic and job growth that tax reforms, smart regulations, and more  domestic energy production have already helped to create.   I urge Congress to pass the USMCA quickly.                            ____________________
