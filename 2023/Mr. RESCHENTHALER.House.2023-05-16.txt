 Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend and fellow  Rules Committee member, Representative Fischbach, for the time.   A quick history lesson.   June 2020, Vice President Kamala Harris applauded former L.A. Mayor  Eric Garcetti's decision to slash police funding by $150 million.   Representative Ocasio-Cortez has stated, ``defunding police means  defunding police,'' an exact quote.   Representative Cori Bush has said that she would ``make sure'' she  has private security for her protection while simultaneously promising  to defund the police that protect you.  [[Page H2362]]    Representative Tlaib has said: ``No more policing, incarceration, and  militarization.''   Representative Omar has stated: Not only do we need to defund, we  need to dismantle police departments.   What has been the result? What has been the result of these attacks  on law enforcement? Well, 2021 was the deadliest year in two decades  for our law enforcement officers.   Mr. Speaker, 64 officers were shot and killed in the line of duty in  2022. Just to put that in perspective, that is a 40 percent increase  from 2020.   At least nine cities, the vast majority of which are Democrat- controlled cities, saw record homicides last year and skyrocketing  crime that continues to plague our communities all across the country.   Right here in D.C., for example, we are already seeing a 13 percent  rise in violent crime in 2023 compared with 2022 when crime was already  at near-historic levels.   Democrats are now trying to deflect responsibility for this rise in  crime, but it is their own far-left radical policies that are to blame.   It is essential that we make it clear that Congress, at least this  Republican majority, condemns all efforts to dismantle and defund our  Nation's police officers.   Mr. Speaker, for those reasons, I urge my colleagues to support this  rule and support the underlying piece of legislation.                                time  1230
