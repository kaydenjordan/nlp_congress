 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule I, I demand a  vote on agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the Journal.    Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a  quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not  present.    Mr. Speaker, it gives me great pleasure today to welcome  the guest chaplain to the House floor. He is a leader in our community  in Pennsylvania's 16th District, as well as my oldest brother.   Mr. Speaker, five other brothers of ours are in the gallery with us  here today on what I learned was a very appropriate day, as this is  National Siblings Day. I am so very pleased to host my brothers, who  are enjoying the sites here in Washington, D.C.   Mr. Speaker, we have five sisters as well, but I guess that will be  another day.   My oldest brother, Sam, was born into an Amish home and was really  used by God. Sam leads a congregation called the Worship Center in  Lancaster County. They have 4,000 members. He also leads a ministers'  fellowship impacting 100 other fellowships, and has traveled to 40  countries in missionary endeavors across the world.   Mr. Speaker, we are proud of Sam. He has had an impact not only on  our community, but across the world as well, and certainly is a  spiritual leader for our family, and we welcome him here today.                            ____________________
