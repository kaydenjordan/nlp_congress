 Mr. President, along with my colleague Senator Mike  Crapo, I rise today to recognize Idaho State Senate President Pro  Tempore Brent Hill's 19 years of service to the State of Idaho.   In 2001, Brent Hill was appointed to lead Idaho's 34th District as a  State senator. He quickly developed a reputation as a legislator who  led with integrity, civility and kindness--characteristics that earned  him reelection to serve nine consecutive terms in the Idaho State  Senate.   In the Idaho Senate and throughout the 34th District, Brent was known  as a stalwart supporter of small businesses, family values, natural  resources, and public education. Brent's expansive knowledge of the  Federal and State tax codes from his experience as a CEO, CPA, and a  financial planner allowed him to shape Idaho's tax policy and  communicate complex tax legislation to fellow legislators and  constituents. He considered tax dollars sacred and took great care in  spending them responsibly.   As he climbed the ranks of leadership to become president pro  tempore, Brent never forgot the people he served in Madison and  Bonneville Counties and always demonstrated true concern for their  challenges and concerns. Despite the demands on his time, he continued  to serve his community on the board of the Citizens Community Bank and  as president of the Rexburg Chamber of Commerce and Rexburg Kiwanis  Club. He never stopped advocating on behalf of his constituents,  regularly contacting our offices to secure assistance for those needing  help with Federal agencies.   Senator Brent Hill leaves behind a legacy of service and integrity,  and we wish him and his wife Julie, their children and grandchildren  the best as he transitions back to private life. His steadfast  leadership will be missed in the Idaho Senate, but we know his  community and our State will continue to be blessed by his influence  for years to come.                            ____________________
