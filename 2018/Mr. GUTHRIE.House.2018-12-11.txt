 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my legislation, the  EMPOWER Care Act, which is included in H.R. 7217. It will ensure that  Medicaid beneficiaries can receive the best long-term care possible in  their communities or in their own homes.   The EMPOWER Care Act will extend the Medicaid Money Follows the  Person program, which allows certain Medicaid beneficiaries, such as  the elderly or individuals with disabilities, to transition from a  healthcare facility to receiving care in their own homes. It does not  force patients to leave a facility if they don't want to.   My home State of Kentucky is currently working to transition 50  individuals from healthcare facilities back into their own communities,  empowering these individuals who have chosen to receive care in their  community.   I thank my friend, Congresswoman Debbie Dingell, for working with me  on this bipartisan bill. I look forward to working with her to make the  Money Follows the Person program permanent in the future.
