 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak on  leader time before we have a vote.    Mr. President, this morning, the life and career of the  41st President of the United States was celebrated at the National  Cathedral. Friends, family, former leaders of our country, and leaders  from around the world gathered to pay tribute to a life spent in joyful  service to our country and unfailing dedication to his family. I was  there. It was a very moving and wonderful ceremony.   The Senate now joins the rest of the country in mourning President  George Herbert Walker Bush.
