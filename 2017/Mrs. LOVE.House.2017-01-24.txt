 Madam Speaker, let's talk about what this is really about.  This is about the loss of human lives.   Each child potentially brings with him or her unique gifts and  talents that can be used for the betterment of our society. An unborn  child may be the doctor that cures cancer or Alzheimer's, may be the  astronaut that lands us on Mars or the future leader that solves the  problems of today. The list of our children's potential is infinite in  value.   Any time a child's life is lost, there is something more that is  lost. It is a loss for us, it is a loss for our society, and it is a  loss for our Nation. If you want to invest in our future, in the words  of Henry Hyde: ``We cannot in logic or in conscience help fund the  execution of these innocent, defenseless human lives.''   A strong majority of Americans and a bipartisan majority in Congress  opposes taxpayer-funded abortions. Because of this, there exists,  currently, over 40 years of laws that prevent this practice. These laws  have been deemed constitutional by the United States Supreme Court.   So this is not about women's health. I want you to know very clearly  that I support women's health. I support a healthy, organic, and open  healthcare system that gives women more care than they currently  receive today. What this bill does is codifies something that we  already have. It ends the patchwork and establishes permanent  protections for our children and the future of our society.   I want you to know, Madam Speaker, that when I stand up and I meet  with my Maker, I want you to know that I am not going to be ashamed. I  am going to know that I stood up for the lives of these innocent  children.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of our future,  in favor of our unborn potential, and in favor of H.R. 7.                                time  1500    Ms. DeGETTE. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Foster).
