 Mr. Speaker, I come today to the floor to salute women,  living legends, women who are focused and determined and hopeful and  empowered--not just one, but a roll call from my district:   Karen Morrison, Ohio Health; Trudy Bartley, The Ohio State  University; Stephanie Hightower, the Urban League; Kathy Espy, Mount  Carmel; Yvette McGee Brown, Jones Day law firm; the Women's Fund; the  YWCA, with Christie Angel; Go Red for Women; Delta Sigma Theta; The  Links, Incorporated; the Matriarch; Barbara Benham, Huntington Bank;  Dawn Tyler Lee, the mayor's office; Emilia Sykes, Ohio House Democratic  leader;   Our judges, African American women elected to the courts: Jaiza Page,  Laurel Beatty Blunt, Monica Hawkins, Kimberly Browne, Terri Jamison.  And the list goes on and on: Jennifer Brunner, judge; and, yes, the  Ohio Supreme Court, Melody Stewart.   Today I stand here and I say thank you to Jo Ann Davidson, the first  female Speaker in Ohio; Colleen Marshall, reporting it every day on the  news; and so many more.   Today I join women on this floor because we salute women. Women make  a difference. But most importantly, Mr. Speaker, we know when women  succeed, America succeeds.                            ____________________
