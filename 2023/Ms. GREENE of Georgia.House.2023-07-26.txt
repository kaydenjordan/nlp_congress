 Mr. Chairman, first I would like to  acknowledge all the amazing women that serve in our Nation's military  and the mothers that serve in our Nation's military.   But I will respond to something I heard a few minutes ago here, the  pronouncement, the actual statement that abortion is women's  healthcare.   I state for the record, abortion is not healthcare in any way.  Abortion is the murder of the unborn child in a woman's womb. Abortion  is defined as taking a life. It doesn't save a life. It kills a life.   Abortion methods are brutal, horrific, absolutely some of the worst  things in today's times; ripping the limbs off an unborn baby, ripping  its head off, killing it with chemicals inside of its mother's womb.   This is not something that taxpayers should have to ever pay for.  This is something that honestly should not exist. Abortion is murder,  and it is evil.   We should be supporting mothers in the military. We should be  supporting women's actual healthcare, and that is not abortion.                                time  1500     Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I rise today to ask the House to  support my amendment No. 3, which will cut the $73 million increase in  funding for the NATO Security Investment Program. This is simply  keeping the NATO funding at the same level as last year's  appropriations level. I think this is very important.   The United States overwhelmingly contributes more than our fair share  to NATO for Europe's defense, and it is time for European countries to  pay their dues.   While our own border is overrun by border-crossers and deadly,  poisonous fentanyl daily, we continue to send hundreds of billions of  dollars to NATO to defend Ukraine's democracy, even though they aren't  even a NATO member nation.   Investing in NATO security is an America-last policy. All increases  in funding should be investing in the United States of America's  security and the defense of our own border.   President Trump was exactly right when he called on European nations  to put the required minimum of 2 percent of their GDP toward NATO  defense spending. Most NATO countries still don't meet that  requirement, and the U.S. ends up paying for 70 percent of the  alliance's defenses. This is outrageous. The American people do not  like paying for other countries' defenses when our borders are overrun  daily.   The current 2023 defense expenditure for NATO countries has the  United States at $860 billion. The United States of America's military  is not meant to be the world's police. As we find ourselves funding a  war in Ukraine, when the United States' position should be pushing for  peace, not paying for and not funding war and the death of innocent  people, we should not increase our spending and increase the amount of  funding by $73 million more to the NATO Security Investment Program.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, perhaps my colleagues are confused.  Ukraine is not a member of NATO. Ukraine has not been accepted into  NATO. Why are they using defense of Ukraine for their argument for an  additional $73 million increase for the NATO security investment  program? That makes absolutely no sense.   If you want to talk about national security, Mr. Chair, let's talk  about the American people's national security. My colleague across the  aisle speaks of hostile nations and how they present a clear danger to  America's national security. Well, you have to look no further than the  southern border. The southern border is where hostile nations are  invading our country every single day with poisonous fentanyl, which is  murdering over 300 Americans a day.   If there is going to be an increase in funding for the defense of any  nation, it should be the United States of America's border in defense  of American lives.   Mr. Chair, I would like to add, my position and the position of most  Americans is peace, not funding the murder and death in continued  foreign wars, defending other countries' democracies while completely  ignoring our own.   Mr. Chair, I ask the House to pass my amendment that keeps the  spending level at the same level it was this previous appropriations  bill--the same level. An increase in $73 million is another step  towards funding world war III.   It is another step in United States aggression over a country that is  not even a member of NATO in the name of a NATO security investment  program. This is absolute madness. It is outrageous.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    May I inquire how much time I have remaining?    Mr. Chair, I will wrap this up. It is very  simple. We are at $32 trillion in debt. There is no need to increase  spending over the level that it was last year. Americans are already  spending $860 billion for NATO for the defense of other nations. There  is no reason to increase it by $73 million.   My amendment is very simple: It is asking to keep the appropriations  level the same as it was this past year.   Mr. Chair, I ask the House to support my amendment, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, my amendment asks the House to  support striking the funding for the Office of Resolution Management,  Diversity and Inclusion.   The Office of Resolution Management, Diversity and Inclusion in the  VA is charged with promoting woke DEI initiatives. My amendment would  strike over $86 million of funding for this woke office which provides  training for VA employees to teach them about their implicit bias.   Just for you to understand what implicit bias means, Mr. Chairman,  because it was something I had to look up myself, implicit bias--this  is ACORN--implicit bias refers to a person's unconscious attitudes  about other communities that can affect their behavior to those  members.   Unconscious attitudes? We are funding $86 million for people to be  trained about things they feel that they don't know that they feel?   This makes absolutely no sense for the care of our great veterans.   Instead of spending millions of tax dollars on woke ideology, we  should put that money toward making the VA  [[Page H3997]]  an agency that actually helps our heroes and our great veterans who  served our military and our country and who desperately need good care.   When I am at home in my district and I speak to veterans there, that  is what I hear them talk about to me constantly: is the care that they  want to receive at the VA, but yet they are failed so many times?   Sick and injured veterans suffering with PTSD, depression, and mental  illness and who are on the verge of suicide don't care if VA employees  serving them have checked their White privilege. They just want to get  the treatment that they need.   Just for some examples for the House to hear about the type of  training that happens in this DEI department that is costing the  American taxpayers $86 million, a few examples are managing gender  diversity in the VA, managing implicit bias--remember those are  feelings you don't know you have--valuing workforce diversity in the  workplace inclusion; participating effective diversity and inclusion in  the workplace for managers, supervisors, and team leaders;  understanding micro behaviors in the VA work environment.   It is time to put $86 million to taking care of our veterans'  healthcare needs. That is the right place to spend the money.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, the great news for all of us here  today is that the Constitution declared long ago that all of us are  created equal. It is time that we started acknowledging that in all of  our funding, in all of our departments, and all across America, and, as  well, that our veterans are created equal. We don't have to spend $86  million on educating everyone on how different they are. It is time to  start treating everyone equally.   As far as sexual harassment claims, private businesses all across the  country are able to handle these without having special diversity,  equity, and inclusion departments to handle sexual harassment. That is  usually handled in human resources or among managers who can handle the  situation.   Management has always been a problem in the VA. We do not need to  fund $86 million creating a big, woke department that is actually  already created. We should spend $86 million, again, toward helping our  veterans. Our veterans have enough issues they face.   Not too long ago there was a tragic story in Georgia where one of our  veterans committed suicide while waiting for the care in the waiting  office at the VA. This should never ever happen.   This type of funding, $86 million, again, should not go towards  educating people about gender and gender bias, educating people about  their skin color, and educating people about how they think  unconsciously without knowing how they think. These are the type of  woke ideologies that divide and separate Americans and that veterans  could care less about.   They care about the care that they will receive, they care about  having their appointments, they care about their medical treatment, and  they care about one another.   One of the things veterans care most about is the fact that they  suffer with PTSD from all the foreign wars that they have been sent to  and served in.   It is time we take better care of our veterans and stop dividing  America with identity politics.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Mast).    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my  time.
