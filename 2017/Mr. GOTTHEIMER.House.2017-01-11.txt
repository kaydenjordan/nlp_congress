 Mr. Speaker, I rise today for my first statement from  the House floor, honored and humbled to serve as the Representative  from New Jersey's Fifth Congressional District. I vow to work  tirelessly on their behalf.   We are all tired of Washington's partisanship, and I will work across  the aisle, whenever possible, to get things done. New Jersey families  and businesses are struggling with high taxes and not seeing good  return on investment for the hard-earned tax dollars they send to  Washington each year.   I will work to bring those dollars home to fight domestic terror,  deal with opioid abuse, improve our schools, and fix our crumbling  roads and bridges. I will work to bring good-paying jobs back to New  Jersey and keep them there, to lower our taxes, cut wasteful spending  and unnecessary regulations, and ensure every tax dollar is used  wisely.   I will stand up for New Jersey values, ensuring that women,  minorities, and the LGBT community are always treated with respect. I  will have the backs of our veterans, law enforcement, firefighters, and  all first responders. I will stand with Israel, ensure our children  have clean drinking water, and stand up for equal pay and a woman's  right to choose. I will work for everyone in the District.   Working together, I believe our best days will always be ahead of us.                            ____________________
