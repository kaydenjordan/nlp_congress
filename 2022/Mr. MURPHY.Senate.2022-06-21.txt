 Mr. President, when I returned to Connecticut after the  shootings in Uvalde and Buffalo, I saw  [[Page S3024]]  a level of fear on the faces of the parents and children whom I spoke  to that I have never seen before. This country has lived through mass  shooting after mass shooting, rising rates of homicide, but there was  something different in the eyes of these families as they once again  had to contemplate the idea that our schools are no longer safe places,  that our supermarkets are no longer safe spaces.   But they also were contemplating the idea that Congress was so caught  up in its own politics, so addicted to backing into our own corners  that we wouldn't be able to do anything meaningful about the thing that  matters most to parents and to families in this country: the physical  safety of their children. Think about it. What matters more to you than  the physical well-being of your children? You would give away  everything--your job, your car, the roof over your head--in order to  guarantee that your children were safe from physical harm.   So the anxiety and the fear that I saw in Connecticut and that I  think many of my colleagues saw when they returned to their States was  not just for the safety of their children but also a fear about the  ability of government to rise to this moment and do something and do  something meaningful.   I believe that this week we will pass legislation that will become  the most significant piece of anti-gun violence legislation Congress  will have passed in 30 years. This is a breakthrough, and more  importantly, it is a bipartisan breakthrough. I am glad to join my  friend Senator Cornyn on the floor today to talk a little bit about the  piece of legislation that our colleagues will be able to look at  hopefully in a matter of moments and that this body will be able to  consider this week.   I want to thank Senator Cornyn, Senator Tillis, and Senator Sinema in  particular. It was a hard road to get to this compromise, but nothing  worthwhile is easy. And nobody in a compromise gets everything they  want. This bill will be too little for many; it will be too much for  others. But it isn't a box-checking exercise. This bill is not window  dressing. This bill is going to save lives. This bill is going to save  thousands of lives. It is going to be something that every single  Member of this Senate who votes for it can be proud of.   I want to tell you a little bit about it, and some of this has  already been covered by my friend Senator Cornyn. First, let me talk  about the provisions in this bill that change our Nation's firearms  laws.   First, we are going to invest in the development of crisis  intervention orders. We are going to give money out to States that they  will be able to use to implement what are commonly called red flag  laws. These are laws that allow local authorities and courts to take  weapons, firearms, temporarily away from individuals who are  threatening to hurt themselves or others.   We just saw Connecticut's red flag law be used just in the last month  or so to take weapons away from a young man who was making threats to  shoot up schools, potentially saving dozens of lives.    Under this bill, every State will be able to use significant new  Federal dollars to be able to expand their programs to try to stop  dangerous people--people contemplating mass murder or suicide--from  being able to have access to the weapons that allow them to perpetrate  that crime.   As Senator Cornyn said, we will also make those dollars eligible for  a narrow range of other court-based anti-violence interventions-- something that was very important to our Republican colleagues.   Second, this bill is going to make sure that no domestic abusers can  purchase or own a gun. We are closing the boyfriend loophole. What we  know is that in States that have taken this step already, there are 10  percent fewer intimate partner deaths. This is an incredibly important  step forward. We know this provision alone is going to save lives of so  many women who unfortunately die at the hands of a boyfriend or an ex- boyfriend who hunts them down with a firearm.   To be consistent with State felony restoration rights, this  legislation will allow individuals to be able to get their right back  after a period of time but only for first-time offenders and only if  there are no crimes of violence in the intervening time.   This bill will provide for enhanced background checks for younger  buyers. What we know is that the profile of the modern mass shooter is  often in the 18- to 21-year-old range, and so this bill has enhanced  background checks for those individuals, including a call to the local  police department--a process that can take up to 3 days and up to 10  days if there are particular signs of concern that investigators need  to perform followup on. That enhanced background check is going to make  sure that younger buyers who are in crisis have another check  performed--perhaps a short period of time in between their decision to  buy a lethal weapon to perform a crime and their ability to get that  weapon.   This bill has new criminal statutes banning gun trafficking and straw  purchasing. This is incredibly important for our cities. We have a flow  of illegal guns coming into these cities, and yet, for decades, for  some reason, Congress has not given our Federal authorities the ability  to interrupt these gun-running rings because we have no effective ban  at a Federal level on trafficking and straw-purchasing. We will after  we pass this law.   Finally, we clarify under this bill who needs to register as a  federally licensed gun dealer. One of the individuals who sold a weapon  to a mass shooter in Odessa, TX, should have been licensed as a Federal  dealer, but he wasn't, and he sold the gun to a person who was  prohibited from buying the gun because of his mental health history,  without a background check. We will clarify in this law that  individuals like that need to register as Federal firearms dealers, and  they need to perform background checks.   As Senator Cornyn said, this bill makes a historic investment in  mental health--a historic investment in mental health. Thanks to Debbie  Stabenow and Roy Blunt, we are going to be able to expand the certified  community health center model nationally. That literally means millions  of people in this country in underserved areas who have no access to  mental health are going to be able to get it after we pass this bill.   We have significant new funding in this bill for school-based health  centers to make sure that kids are better served, especially those kids  who are in crisis.   We have help in this bill for pediatricians who are trying to do  telehealth consults with behavioral health professionals who are trying  to get more training on mental health so they can help their patients.   Finally, we make investments in school and community safety, funds to  help schools make their campuses safer places but also funds for  community-based programs that are doing good work in cities from Boston  to Hartford to Dallas interrupting cycles of violence in our  communities.   For 30 years--murder after murder, suicide after suicide, mass  shooting after mass shooting--Congress did nothing. This week, we have  a chance to break this 30-year period of silence with a bill that  changes our laws in a way that will save thousands of lives. It is a  compromise. It is a bipartisan compromise. It is a path forward to the  way that both Republicans and Democrats can work together to address  some of the most vexing, most difficult challenges this Nation faces.   We have a chance to show parents and kids and families that we take  their safety seriously and we are prepared to do not just something but  something that saves lives in order to protect them.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.
