 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for  yielding to me.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 47. In addition to permanently  reauthorizing the Land and Water Conservation Fund, which is, of  course, critically important, this bill also establishes a memorial for  the St. Francis Dam disaster. This memorial is a project that has been  a priority for my hometown, the city of Santa Clarita, for many years,  and the site is just miles from where I grew up and where my sister now  lives.   The St. Francis Dam was an integral part of our city's water  infrastructure back in the 1920s. On March 12, 1928, the dam failed,  and the resulting flood killed over 450 people, cost millions of  dollars, and destroyed many homes and other property. The collapse of  the St. Francis Dam is considered one of the worst civil engineering  failures of the 20th century and is the second deadliest disaster in  California history.   I am proud that, in the 116th Congress, we will finally be able to  magnify the stories of this tragedy and provide a constant reminder of  how critical infrastructure is to the safety and security of our  communities.
