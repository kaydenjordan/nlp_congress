 Madam Speaker, September 5, 2017: that is a day that  will forever be ingrained in the minds of immigrants and DREAMers as  the day that Donald Trump crossed a moral line.   The President is playing hot potato with a group of young people who,  like me, came to this country ``with heart,'' ``con corazon;'' ``with  humility,'' ``con humildad;'' and ``with a desire to do more,'' ``con  el deseo de hacer mas.''   DREAMers are ``fighters,'' ``luchadores.'' They are fighters, and so  we will not rest until the Dream Act is the law of the land and until  DREAMers and their parents can go to sleep without the fear of ICE  knocking on their door and showing up in their place of worship,  school, or at a hospital.   To my colleagues, we urge you to stand with us, stand with 800,000  DACA recipients, and stand with their parents in passing the Dream Act.
