 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize an outstanding  woman of God, Mrs. Mary Sue Mixon. Mrs. Mixon will celebrate her  retirement as a distinguished Sunday school teacher at the Mountain Gap  Church in The Rock, Georgia.   Mary Sue Mixon is a native of Pike County, Georgia, and has taught  Sunday school classes for adults, preteens, and primary classes for  over 40 years. Beyond simply reading her weekly lessons to the fourth  through sixth grade students, she has dedicated herself to sharing the  full knowledge, love, and relationship she has with Christ, and has  enabled countless others to walk with Him.   Mary Sue is a revered teacher and a humble community leader, but  above all, she is a faithful servant of God. She has achieved so much  in her life, but none of it would be possible without the grace of the  Lord, and the love and support of her family.   Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me today, along with the  congregation of Mountain Gap Church, and the residents of Georgia's  Third Congressional District, in extending our sincerest  congratulations to Mary Sue Mixon on this joyous occasion.                            ____________________
