 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, Congress has no greater responsibility  than providing for a strong national defense and keeping Americans  safe. The National Defense Authorization Act is one of the most  important pieces of legislation that is considered each year by the  U.S. Senate. It authorizes the weapons systems, programs, and resources  that support the men and women who serve our country in the Armed  Forces as well as their families.   Last week, the Senate completed its work on the fiscal year 2021  National Defense Authorization Act for the 60th consecutive year. The  bill received, as it should, wide bipartisan support in an 86-to-14  vote. I was proud to support the NDAA.   In my home State of Colorado, our military installations, including  Fort Carson, the Air Force Academy, Buckley, Peterson, and Schriever  Air Force Bases, along with Cheyenne Mountain Air Force Station, are on  the cutting edge of space operations, military training and readiness,  and protecting our national security.   I want to thank Chairman Inhofe and the ranking member for their  bipartisanship at the Senate Armed Services Committee and for doing  such a great job in fulfilling their tremendous responsibility in  providing for national defense. It cannot be overstated enough how  grateful we all are, and I appreciate the time and work they dedicated  to this effort. The security of the United States should always be more  important than any partisan politics, and I appreciate their commitment  to placing national defense above partisan bickering. We have seen how  even in the most rancorous political times Republicans and Democrats  can come together through the Defense Authorization Act to renew the  country's commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific region, such as  when the Asia Reassurance Initiative Act became law in December 2018.   As was stated in the U.S. Department of Defense ``Indo-Pacific  Strategy Report,'' which was released in July of last year, ``This  legislation [ARIA] enshrines a generational whole-of-government policy  framework that demonstrates U.S. commitment to a free and open Indo- Pacific region and includes initiatives that promote sovereignty, rule  of law, democracy, economic engagement, and regional security.''   Now the U.S. Senate has taken the next step toward renewing the  country's commitment to the Indo-Pacific region by passing this NDAA  bill, enshrining and establishing a new Pacific Deterrence Initiative,  PDI, that will complement ARIA and implement its vision of a more  robust U.S. military presence in the Indo-Pacific. This initiative will  enhance the security commitment set forth in ARIA and help guide the  Congress and the Pentagon in making the tough choices necessary to  prioritize the Indo-Pacific and to extend critical deterrence  initiatives to check our adversaries.   Earlier this summer, Chairman Inhofe and I authored an op-ed entitled  ``Renewing America's Commitment to the Indo-Pacific.'' It described the  Pacific Deterrence Initiative, which will complement the Asia  Reassurance Initiative Act and implement its vision of a more robust  U.S. military presence in the Indo-Pacific.   Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have the op-ed in the  Diplomat of July 2, 2020, be printed in the Record   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                     [From the Diplomat, July 2, 2020]     Renewing America's Commitment to the Indo-Pacific--A New Pacific  Deterrence Initiative Will Complement ARIA and Implement Its Vision of          a More Robust U.S. Military Presence in the Indo-Pacific                      (By Jim Inhofe and Cory Gardner)         As China brashly tries to impose its own system of rules       and order in the Pacific, the United States and our allies in       the Indo-Pacific confront a time for choosing. We must choose       to advance our vision for a free and open Indo-Pacific. We       must choose to ensure the success of the principles of       regional and global order that remain essential to our shared       security and prosperity. These are difficult choices that       will come at increasingly greater cost. Beijing will do its       best to make sure that the right choice and the easy choice       are never the same, but we believe Americans and our allies       are up to the task.        For instance, U.S. allies like Australia are already making       the tough choices, while braving Beijing's bluster and       bullying. By standing by its calls for an independent inquiry       into the origins of the coronavirus and by remaining open to       trade while refusing to trade away fundamental values,       Australia has set a proud example for all the world. As       Beijing lashes out across the region from the Himalayan       Mountains to the South China Sea, Australia's actions serve       as a reminder for our other allies that in a free and open       Indo-Pacific, right makes might--and not the other way       around.        Australia should not be alone in this effort. The United       States stands with our allies, and we are prepared to make       our own tough choices.        In the United States, we have seen how even in the most       rancorous political times, Republicans and Democrats have       joined together to renew the country's commitment to the       Indo-Pacific region, like when the Asia Reassurance       Initiative Act (ARIA) became law in December 2018. As was       stated in the U.S. Department of Defense Indo-Pacific       Strategy Report, released in July 2019: ``This legislation       enshrines a generational whole-of-government policy framework       that demonstrates U.S. commitment to a free and open Indo-      Pacific region and includes initiatives that promote       sovereignty, rule of law, democracy, economic engagement, and       regional security.''        In the coming days, the U.S. Senate will take the next step       toward renewing the country's commitment to the Indo-Pacific       region by passing the National Defense Authorization Act for       Fiscal Year 2021, which establishes a new Pacific Deterrence       Initiative that will complement ARIA and implement its vision       of a more robust U.S. military presence in the Indo-Pacific.       This initiative will enhance the security commitments set       forth in ARIA, and help guide Congress and the Pentagon in       making the tough choices necessary to prioritize the Indo-      Pacific and extend critical deterrence initiatives to check       our adversaries.        Last year, a seminal report from the United States Studies       Centre (USSC) at the University of Sydney provided one of the       clearest explanations of why the need for the Pacific       Deterrence Initiative is both real and urgent. The report       shows how China is attempting to ``undercut America's       military primacy'' and ``sowing doubt about Washington's       security guarantees in the process.'' In the face of this       development, the report describes an ``increasingly worrying       mismatch between America's strategy and resources,''       especially in the Indo-Pacific. Even as ``America's military       services have started to implement much needed changes,'' the       report warns, it's not clear that America will have the       ``budgetary capacity or strategic focus to deliver these in a       robust and timely way.'' We share these concerns, and the       Pacific Deterrence Initiative is designed explicitly to       address them.        First, the Pacific Deterrence Initiative will enhance       budgetary transparency and congressional oversight by       organizing our defense budget around critical Indo-Pacific       priorities. The initiative will make it easier to translate       regional priorities into budget priorities, and ensure that       security requirements are being matched with the necessary       resources.        Second, the Pacific Deterrence Initiative will focus       resources on key capability gaps to give U.S. forces       everything they need to compete, fight, and win in the Indo-      Pacific. The initiative would focus new resources in many of       the areas recommended by the USSC report, including a more       distributed regional defense posture, resilient logistics       networks, fuel and munitions storage, missile defenses for       U.S. bases, and more experimentation to test and prove new       operational concepts.        Third, consistent with ARIA provisions, the Pacific       Deterrence Initiative will  [[Page S4521]]       prioritize cooperation with allies and partners across the       Indo-Pacific. The initiative will increase security       assistance for our regional allies and partners, and invest       in interoperability. In the future, we expect the initiative       will provide resources to support new mechanisms for       deepening regional defense cooperation, including       multinational fusion centers and joint training and       experimentation.        Fourth, and finally, the Pacific Deterrence Initiative will       help preserve peace in the Indo-Pacific by bolstering       credible deterrence. The initiative will focus resources on       efforts to deny our adversaries the possibility of a quick,       easy, or cheap victory. By injecting uncertainty and risk       into the calculations of our adversaries, we can discourage       them from choosing the path of aggression.        The Pacific Deterrence Initiative is by no means a cure-      all. After all, achieving credible deterrence in the Indo-      Pacific region is not America's task alone. It can only be       realized through a collective effort with our allies and       partners such as Australia. Moreover, the challenges we face       today are not limited to, or even primarily, military in       character. As ARIA emphasized, we must also step up our       diplomatic and economic security efforts while remaining true       to our values. Nonetheless, we hope the Pacific Deterrence       Initiative will serve as another demonstration to our mates       in Australia, as well as our other allies and partners in the       Indo-Pacific, that America's commitment to the region remains       bipartisan and enduring.     I would also like to thank my colleagues for their  bipartisan work on the Defense bill. We had a number of bipartisan  amendments included and provisions that improve the use of secure  facility space and make sure military communities have access to clean  and safe drinking water--an incredibly important issue facing Colorado,  Colorado Springs, the Fort Carson area, and others as they address the  PFAS issues this Nation has dealt with.   I think it is important to remember that when one member of the  family serves our country in uniform, the entire family serves, and  this legislation supports military families in Colorado and truly all  over the world. It provides a much needed pay increase for our military  members and continues to support military spouses seeking employment.   The NDAA addresses the challenges servicemembers and their families  face living in privatized housing. It expands resources to continue to  address PFAS water contamination in our military communities.   In Colorado, we are proud to play a very key role in defending the  United States. Our military installations are critical to national  security and supporting operations in space. This year's defense  authorization includes language to ensure there is transparency when it  comes to selecting the final home for the headquarters--the permanent  basing decision of U.S. Space Command--and that Space Command's  critical mission drives the decisionmaking process. That is what we  ensured through the Defense Authorization Act.   The bill also supports the ongoing standup of our Nation's newest  military branch, the U.S. Space Force, to include my legislation  establishing the Space Force Reserve. The Space Force Reserve will  mirror its sister military service branches, and as a result, the Space  Force will better organize the military to handle Space Force's  operations and bring all military members working in the space domain  under the same organizational umbrella.   General Raymond is working hard to make sure the U.S. Space Force is  agile and prepared to respond to national security threats in the space  domain.   As we continue to work in establishing the U.S. Space Force, Colorado  is proud to continue its support of our Nation's military operations in  space. That is why in the coming weeks I will be working with my  colleagues in the Senate to establish the U.S. Space Force Caucus, led  by bipartisan co-leads and chairs. The caucus will provide my  colleagues and their staff the opportunity to learn more about military  space operations and the critical threats we face in the space domain.  I welcome my colleagues' support and participation in the establishment  of this caucus.   Again, I thank my colleagues, Chairman Inhofe and Ranking Member  Reed, for their work on this important bill, and I am proud to support  legislation that authorizes $268 million for military construction  projects in Colorado and provides a 3-percent pay raise for the men and  women serving our Nation in uniform.   With that, I yield the floor.
