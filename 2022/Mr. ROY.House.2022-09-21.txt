 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Florida for his  service to this country. We should all be down here engaging with our  colleagues more often to learn more about them. I did not know that  about your father. God bless you. Godspeed. Thank you for serving in  this Chamber.   Madam Speaker, much has been made in the last week over the actions  of two Governors; in particular Governor Greg Abbott of the State in  which I live and where I am a Congressman--Texas--as well as the  Governor of Florida, Ron DeSantis.   Much is being made of the fact that these Governors transported  certain individuals who had come to this country and were released into  this country by this administration--I believe contrary to law, I  believe in direct violation of both the text and the spirit of the  law--that they were released into this country by the thousands.   Governor Abbott of Texas and Governor DeSantis of Florida transported  some of these individuals to particular locations. Now, it was very  clear that they did so in significant part to make a point. That point  is that our States are bearing the brunt of an administration's  policies that are purposefully allowing our border to be operationally  controlled by cartels to the detriment of the American people. That is  what is happening.   So kudos to Governor DeSantis, kudos to Governor Abbott for bringing  to light a problem which is being ignored by the leftist press that  refuses to bring the truth to the American people.   So 50 people get transported to Martha's Vineyard, and the entire  wine-and-cheese circuit loses their collective mind. Oh, no, what have  you done? Oh, the cries of politicization of using human beings as  pawns. But who is it that is using these individuals as pawns? Could it  be my colleagues on the other side of the aisle or the people in this  administration that are leaving our border wide open, such that 53  human beings died in a tractor-trailer in San Antonio, which I  represent?   So which is it? Which is worse? Fifty people being sent to Martha's  Vineyard to bring attention to a problem so that all of these Americans  on Martha's Vineyard could put their glass of wine down and put their  cheese plate down and suddenly recognize that there are literally  thousands of people being distributed into our country every single day  by this government and by nongovernmental organizations. Every single  day.   My colleagues do nothing about it. Fifty-three human beings died in  an oven that was a tractor-trailer, and my Democratic colleagues don't  say a dadgum word. Nothing.   But they sure say something when suddenly 50 show up to Martha's  Vineyard. Then everybody gathers around for a photo op and brings  sandwiches and pats themselves on the back for their grand compassion  because, oh, we are enlightened leftists in Martha's Vineyard. We love  everybody. So we are going to bring sandwiches, then we are going to  call the National Guard and say haul them out of here.   That is the truth.   But why isn't anybody talking about the 53 human beings that died in  that tractor-trailer in San Antonio, Texas? One example of the  thousands.   There is a cemetery that has been created in south Texas with PVC  crosses for bodies of migrants pouring across the Rio Grande in south  Texas. That is what is happening to these people, getting sold into the  sex trafficking trade, being abused by cartels, bodies littering  ranches, dying in the Rio Grande River, dying in trucks.   All while here in Washington, D.C., the Mayor of D.C. complains  about, oh, we are now a border city; or the city councilwoman who said,  well, we don't have the infrastructure for this. Well, welcome to the  party.                                time  1845    Well, welcome to the party, because that city councilwoman declared  D.C. a sanctuary city, and that city councilwoman called for the  abolition of ICE. And prior to the individuals being delivered to D.C.  by Governor Abbott to the steps of the Vice President's home--who  supposedly is in charge of securing the border but can't find her way  to the border if you gave her a map and a plane ticket to get there--73  human beings were found in the Nation's Capital in a stash house right  here within a couple of miles of this building, 12 of whom were kids.   Where are my Democratic colleagues?   They are burying their heads in the sand because it is not  politically expedient to acknowledge that open borders results in dead  migrants, dead Americans, empowerment of cartels, empowerment of China,  and a danger to the American people and our national security, while  almost 100 individuals associated with terrorist countries or terrorist  organizations have now been apprehended coming across our border not  even dealing with the million people who were got-aways.   I have given this speech so many times, but I keep having to update  it. I keep having to come down to the floor and talk about what is  happening in Texas and what is happening to our people.   Now let's talk about what is happening to Americans. These are the  faces of the individuals and the lost voices of people who have died  from fentanyl. I showed these to the Secretary of Homeland Security,  and he scoffed. There are 72,000 lost voices and 72,000 dead Americans  in 1 year. That is more than we lost in the entirety of the Vietnam war  right here.   Where are my colleagues on the other side of the aisle?   Where is the President of the United States?   These individuals are dead. Their mamas found them in their house  dying and tried to resuscitate them. They left their home in a body bag  because they took a pill that was laced with fentanyl that was cooked  up in the backyard of a cartel. Fentanyl is coming in from China, and  they are dead. That is what is happening, and my Democratic colleagues  are nowhere to be found. They are nowhere to be found.   At the same time that we have got wide-open borders and our country  is getting destroyed, we have vaccine mandates in place that are  absolutely decimating our ability to maintain, control, and to hold our  servicemembers in the military. It is an absolute abomination. We are  losing hundreds and thousands of servicemembers at a time when our  recruiting levels are at historic lows. The Army is having trouble  recruiting. They are at 50 percent of their goals.   I have met with members of the United States Marines, the Navy, the  Air Force, and the Army, and they are all coming in under their  recruiting levels.   Meanwhile, we are firing people. They are losing their jobs. It is  happening as we speak right now; members of the United States military  are getting fired and having to leave service.   Why?   Because of a vaccine mandate, a vaccine mandate being carried out by  the administration with complete and total disregard for the fact that  that vaccine does nothing for transmission and which the CDC wholly  recognizes is totally useless for the individuals in question.   In fact, now the President of the United States says the pandemic is  over.   The pandemic is over, so why are we firing our men and women in  uniform?   I will take a moment to recognize my good friend from Pennsylvania  (Mr. Perry), who is a veteran himself who served his country, to see if  he has any thoughts on this matter.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.  Perry).    As the gentleman probably knows, and I am sure he has talked  to his own constituents, I have had people coming into my office  saying, I don't know what to do. I have served my whole life wearing  the uniform, but I don't think it is in my best interest, I don't think  it is helping the military, I am not going to do it, and I am getting  fired.   They have discharged 5,000 Active Duty servicemembers for refusing to  take the COVID-19 vaccine while the Army's recruiting levels, as I have  said, are at 52 percent of the 2022 recruiting goal. Forty percent of  men 18 to 24 are unvaccinated, the prime recruiting demographic.  Service academy applications are down 10 to 30 percent depending on the  service academy, and now DOD comes in and says, hey, we need more money  for recruiting.   Well, how about you stop screwing up?   How about you not tuck tail and run from Afghanistan and leave $85  billion behind?   How about you stop pumping out woke garbage into the men and women in  uniform? And how about you not fire them because they dare to say that  they don't want a vaccine?   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.  Perry).    It makes absolutely no sense.   One might question why would this Congress and why would this body  give more money to the Department of Defense and this administration to  continue to fire men and women in uniform?   Madam Speaker, why would we not attach to a continuing resolution  refunding bill in 9 days a requirement that our men and women in  uniform not be fired for not taking a vaccine for a pandemic the  President says is over?   Madam Speaker, $6 billion, by the way, goes to Fauci's NIAID, and $9  billion goes to the CDC.   Why are we funding this?   Why are we funding an open border?   Why are we funding $60 billion to the Department of Homeland Security  which is causing Americans to die from fentanyl and causing migrants to  die on people's ranches, endangering the American people and allowing  people known to be associated with terrorists in our country, and at  the same time we are funding vaccine mandates to fire men and women in  uniform when our recruiting levels are at an all-time low?   It begs the question.   But that is not the only problem. That is not the only thing we are  dealing with. We are dealing with an energy crisis. We are dealing with  a reality that energy prices are up.   Why would that be?   A tsunami of shutoffs the headlines say, 20 million U.S. homes are  behind on energy bills, Federal oil leases slow to a trickle under  Biden. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warns that gas prices could  spike again this winter.   We are decimating the ability of the American people to be able to  fund their lives, heat their homes, and drive their cars to work all in  the name of choosing to pursue unicorn energy policies which are  destroying our country.   My colleagues on the other side of the aisle and this administration  are purposely driving up the cost of gas, purposely driving up the cost  of electricity, and purposely making our grid less reliable all so they  can pat themselves on the back for pursuing a ``green'' agenda that is  doing nothing but empowering China, making our country worse, and not  doing a dang thing for CO2, by the way, nothing.   While China has 1,100 coal-fired plants and is building one new coal- fired plant a week, we have 250, and we are building zero. We are  adding no new gas plants. We are adding no new nuclear plants to speak  of.   We are adding wind and solar, making our grid less reliable. We are  reducing our ability to produce liquified natural gas to the world. And  we are decimating our strategic advantage and undermining the health  and well-being of the American people so my Democratic colleagues can  pursue a leftist, radical agenda to appease their leftist base.   The American people have had it.   Here is another point.   Why would we fund it?   Why would we continue to fund a government that is doing that to the  American people?   I know my colleague here cares a lot about energy policies from his  home State of Pennsylvania.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.  Perry).    Electricity, one in six families are behind on their bills.  Gas prices are $1.66 higher in this administration. Energy prices are  six times higher than last year in Germany which just banned fracking  and phased out nuclear which is a telltale warning for where we are  heading. They are nationalizing their gas companies. Germans are  stockpiling wood to heat their homes.   Madam Speaker, you never met a set of policies that you could  possibly imagine where you could do more to undermine and damage your  own country than the policies that this administration and the  colleagues on the other side of aisle are adopting.   So the question is: Will my GOP colleagues, will my Republican  colleagues give $14.1 billion to the Department of the Interior to  continue to lease fewer Federal acres for oil and gas? Will we do that?   Will we give $9 billion to an EPA that is imposing a methane fee and  taxes on the oil and gas industry that will be crippling my friend's  constituents, my constituents, and every American across the country,  or the EPA that is targeting the largest U.S. oil field or proposing  rules to shut down half of Texas' coal-fired plants?   They want to weaken our grid even further while also giving $10  billion for Federal wind subsidies that are destroying our grid. That  is the question.   How about $5 million for climate czar John Kerry to fly around in his  private jet talking about how great he is advancing a Green New Deal  agenda?   That is the reality.   So here is the question--and this is really what I want to engage my  colleague, my friend from Pennsylvania: What do we do?   What do we do in the face of an administration and colleagues who are  at war with the American people, who are endangering America with open  borders while people die of fentanyl, who are at war with the American  people and their ability to afford energy, have gas in their car, have  a job, have electricity, and have a strong grid; and at war with the  members of our military, making them lose their job if they don't take  a mandatory jab because Dr. Fauci says so?   What do we do about an administration that is at war with the people,  targeting them, defining them as domestic terrorists by the FBI, if you  are challenging the school board, targeting them with 85,000 new IRS  agents to go audit them to raise revenue?   Madam Speaker, what do you do in the face of an administration that  is doing that every single day?   Madam Speaker, I will tell you what you do if you are a Republican or  if you are a Democrat who actually believes in Article I of the United  States Constitution.   I give you James Madison. I give you the father of the Constitution.   In Federalist No 58 it says, ``The House of Representatives cannot  only refuse, but they alone can propose, the supplies requisite for the  support of government. They, in a word, hold the purse. . . .   ``This power over the purse may, in fact, be regarded as the most  complete and effectual weapon with which any constitution can arm the  immediate representatives of the people, for obtaining a redress of  every grievance, and for carrying into effect every just and salutary  measure.''   That, Madam Speaker, is what the Founders gave us to push back on an  executive branch that is out of control and operating in direct  detriment to the American people or a Senate that refuses to do its  job.   The people's House has this tool, and we should use it. I think my  friend from Pennsylvania agrees.                                time  1900     Madam Speaker, I want to say to my friend from Pennsylvania  how proud I am to serve with him and how proud I am to serve with him  in the House Freedom Caucus. People like to malign the Freedom Caucus  on the other side of the aisle--heck, even a little bit on our side of  the aisle--for daring to want to stand up for freedom, the belief in  the individual, the belief in civil society, the belief in Federalism,  and the belief in free enterprise. The belief that not all answers come  from this town; it doesn't come from this government.   In fact, if you empower people, empower States, and empower civil  society, than human beings prosper, their lives are made better. They  are able to go carry out the greatest things that you could possibly  imagine to bring freedom to the rest of the world as this country has  done for almost 250 years.   That is why we are here. That is why I am in the Freedom Caucus. That  is why I am pushing forward, along with my colleague, my friend from  Pennsylvania, and my other colleagues. Forty-two of us have signed a  pledge and put out a letter, a letter that says that we are going to  reject any continuing resolution that expires before the next Congress.   Then we are going to reject any appropriations package put forward by  my colleagues on the other side of aisle this year, whether it is  before or during any lame-duck session, because the American people  should speak on November 8 about the atrocities that have been carried  out against them by an administration that cares more about their  political dynamics than they do about the American people every day.  The American people should speak, and then we should spend taxpayers'  money on the priorities that they choose.   Right now, I can tell you that those priorities are not continuing to  carry out open borders, endangering them. It is not firing our men and  women in uniform for daring not to take a vaccine. It is not continuing  energy policies that are undermining our national security and stable  grid. It is not hiring IRS agents to go after the American people.   We are just simply saying we should use the power of the purse. My  message to my Republican colleagues: Use the power of the purse. Use  the power of the purse to check the executive branch. Join us. Why are  there only 42 people who have signed that letter? It should be all 218  who are saying no. No to an administration. No to my colleagues on the  other side of the aisle who are at war with the American people and  their well-being.   Stand up in defense of the people you represent. Don't fund the  government you campaign against every day. Hold that funding and demand  change. Hold that funding and demand that you stand up for the people.  Stand up for America. Stand up for energy freedom. Stand up for the  ability of our men and women in uniform to serve. Stand up  [[Page H8061]]  for a secure border. Stand up for the ability to carry out your  business without being targeted by armed FBI and IRS bureaucrats and  agents.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania.    Madam Speaker, I want to credit our leader, Mr. McCarthy,  for yesterday saying that he also believes that it would be wrong for  my Republican colleagues to support a continuing resolution that does  not address the damage being done to this country by open borders. He  is right to say that. He is correct to say that.   We should demand that we change how we are dealing with the border  because it is an absolute abomination; endangering Americans,  endangering migrants in the false name of compassion. We should change  that because we can.   Madam Speaker, I thank our leader, the gentleman from California (Mr.  McCarthy) for saying that because it is correct. We should not fund a  government that is continuing to allow open borders to endanger the  American people. We should fund a government that demands change. That  is what the power of the purse is and that is what you use it for.   My friend, Senator Mike Lee from Utah, in the Senate, has circulated  a similar letter demanding the same thing in the Senate. This is the  time for the people's House and for the Senate to stand up. We should  demand change. If we don't get change next week, and we get a  continuing resolution into December, we should demand change in  December.   If we don't get change in December, we should demand change in  January or February or March, but we should demand change every day. We  should be down here fighting on the floor of the House, not out at  steak dinners; not out doing all the business of this town, but here  doing the business of the American people who sent us here to change  this place; to stand up for them, to stand up for America, to stand up  for a better future.   On July 2, 2026, when we turn 250 years old, we can look proudly at  our kids and grandkids and pass down a great country to them, instead  of leaving it bankrupt, which is what this administration is currently  doing. We can take that back. That is our calling. That is our calling  today. And that is why I am proud to be in the Freedom Caucus with my  friend, Mr. Perry, and I will give him the last minute.    Madam Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman. Not one more  penny. Not one more penny for a government running at odds with the  American people. Let's use the power of the purse. Let's stand up for  America.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
