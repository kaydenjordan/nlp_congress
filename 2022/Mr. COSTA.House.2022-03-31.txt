 Mr. Speaker, I want to begin by taking a moment to  remember one of my constituents who lived an extraordinary life, Major  Nhia Long Vang, who recently passed away.   Major Vang was a longtime leader in the Fresno Hmong community and  bravely served alongside American soldiers in Laos during the Vietnam  war. This conflict also is known as the secret war in Laos. Major Vang  was recruited at the age of 19 by the Central Intelligence Agency to  serve in the Special Guerilla Unit, otherwise known as the SGU, during  the secret war to help the U.S. fight against the North Vietnamese  Communist Army and the Pathet Lao Communist troops.   In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Major Vang led intelligence  missions on the Ho Chi Minh Trail to gather surveillance on the  Communist forces. He also oversaw missions that rescued American pilots  during the Vietnam war when their planes were shot down.   By 1980, Major Vang's family received asylum to come to the United  States, where he would settle in Fresno in 1983. Once in the United  States, Major Vang worked tirelessly to support the families of  soldiers whom the secret war in Laos impacted.   Major Vang was a leader and advisor to organizations like the Lao  Veterans of America and the Special Guerilla Units Veterans and  Families. Major Vang was also instrumental and a partner in helping my  efforts to secure burial rights in national cemeteries and other  benefits for Special Guerilla Unit veterans who fought alongside with  American soldiers.   It has been an honor in my career to get to know a hero like Major  Vang and work with him as an advocate for the SGU veterans and get them  the recognition they so deserve.                            Women's History Month     Mr. Speaker, I want to turn now to recognize Women's  History Month. While it is the end of March now, we so honor always the  contributions that women make in our country and in our valley. Across  the world they make a difference every day, as we know.   I would like to take this opportunity to recognize just some of the  so many talented and incredible women that I interact with and I get a  chance to work with:   Dora Westerlund is president and CEO of the Fresno Area Hispanic  Foundation. Dora has changed the lives of more than 15,000 Hispanic and  non-Hispanic-owned businesses to become economically self-sufficient  and add to the vibrancy of our economy in the San Joaquin Valley.   Sara Bosse serves as the public health director for Madera County.  During this pandemic she has been incredibly responsive and led the  county's response to combat COVID-19 by expanding testing,  vaccinations, and managing the outbreaks in Madera County.   Mr. Speaker, I also want to recognize Gammelah Mohammed of Merced who  founded the Merced County Freedom Coalition, which fosters  collaboration between law enforcement, government agencies, and other  community partners in the fight against human trafficking. As co-chair  of the Victims Rights Caucus, I know her efforts are very important.  She has provided essential resources to support survivors and victims  of crime.                        America's Supply Chain Issues     Mr. Speaker, I now want to turn to an important issue that  is affecting our economy, and that is the supply chain issue. Congress  can take effective action by cracking down on foreign-owned shipping  companies that have monopolized the industry and that are creating  inflationary pressures.   My bill, the Ocean Shipping Antitrust Enforcement Act, subjects  foreign-owned ocean shipping carriers to American antitrust law, as  they should be. This builds on provisions in the Ocean Shipping Reform  Act that Representative Garamendi and I and others are supporting that  has already passed the House.   Together, these pieces of legislation protect American exporters from  unfair trade practices like container rate increases, sudden change in  shipping schedules, unreasonable fees by shipping companies, and ships  leaving ports with empty containers after they have offloaded their  goods here in America.   Agricultural producers in California are suffering. A University of  California study found that in the fall of 2021, an empty container  leaving California ports hit almost 80 percent, pre-pandemic it was  about 30 percent. This is an unfair trade practice.   President Biden said in this very Chamber during the State of the  Union--on the topic of ocean shipping reform--that capitalism without  competition is exploitation. It is. We must answer the President's call  to get this meaningful ocean shipping reform legislation to his desk.                              God Bless Ukraine     Mr. Speaker, let me close by saying, God bless the people  of Ukraine and the suffering during this horrific war taken on by the  pariah Putin, who is a war criminal and must be punished for it. God  bless them.                            ____________________
