 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate  the Ghost Town Trail that runs between Ebensburg and Blairsville,  Pennsylvania. The Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural  Resources recently named the Ghost Town Trail the Pennsylvania Trail of  the Year.   As a lifelong Pennsylvanian and avid outdoorsman, I am proud the 15th  District is leading the way in developing and growing Pennsylvania's  extensive trail network. It is important we cultivate an appreciation  of the outdoors.   We know trails are environmentally friendly, but they also are  economically friendly. Trails boost real estate values. They present  new business opportunities and bolster tourist-related revenue. The 44- mile long Ghost Town Trail provides all of these benefits.   According to some experts, if it continues on its current trajectory,  it will be the first trail in the East to connect in a full loop.   The Trail of the Year award is well deserved for the Ghost Town  Trail, and I am proud to recognize it here today.                            ____________________
