 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Illinois.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the motion to recommit because I  think it is important we remember President Trump has always wanted a  shutdown. He boasted a year and a half ago that what the government  needs is a good government shutdown. There is no such thing, as we now  know.   On December 11--not ancient history--he sat in the Oval Office,  getting red in the face, shouting: ``I will be the one to shut it  down.''   He then followed through on that promise by torpedoing a government  funding agreement that passed the Senate with unanimous support.   Once again, Federal employees and Federal contracts were being held  hostage by this President, all because of a broken campaign promise. He  said Mexico was going to pay for his wall. Now he needs a bailout from  the American taxpayer. Fortunately, the new Democratic majority in this  House is going to stand up to this President and has offered a sensible  plan to fund the government.   The bill that passed in the Senate is part of a four-bill package  and, by a vote of 92-6, provides a 1.9 percent badly needed pay  increase for all Federal employees and guarantees backpay to the  Federal employees furloughed during this unnecessary Trump shutdown.   I support the underlying bill because we can and should end this  Trump shutdown now.
