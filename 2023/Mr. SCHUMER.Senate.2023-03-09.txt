 Madam President, first, a little housekeeping, and then  I will give my remarks.   I understand that there is a bill at the desk that is due for a  second reading.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the bill by title  for the second time.   The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:         A bill (S. 701) to protect a person's ability to determine       whether to continue or end a pregnancy, and to protect a       health care provider's ability to provide abortion services.     In order to place the bill on the calendar, under the  provisions of rule XIV, I would object to further proceeding.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection having been heard, the bill will  be placed on the calendar.                            ____________________     Madam President, first, my thoughts this morning are  with my good friend Leader Mitch McConnell, who is recovering in the  hospital after an accident last night.   This morning, I offer a prayer of strength and healing for the leader  and his family. I called the leader this morning and spoke briefly with  his staff to extend my prayers and well wishes. My thoughts are also  with Leader McConnell's family and his team.   I join every single one of my colleagues in wishing Leader McConnell  a speedy and full recovery.                            ____________________     Madam President, on the President's budget, today, as we  all know, President Biden will release his budget for fiscal year 2024.   As promised, the President's budget is set to be a bold, optimistic,  and serious proposal for strengthening our economy and creating  opportunities to climb into the middle class as well as helping people  stay there once they get in the middle class.   The President's budget succeeds where Republicans have failed by  presenting a realistic blueprint for lowering the deficit without  cutting benefits tens of millions of Americans rely upon. Unlike the  Republicans, the President's plan actually protects Social Security,  Medicare, and Medicaid while building on Democrats' work to lower  prescription drug costs and save taxpayer dollars.   Again, Republicans love to talk about deficit cuts and saving tax  dollars, but Democrats are the ones actually getting it done.   The President's budget prioritizes a strong defense. It offers robust  support for Ukraine, which, after last night's brutal missile barrage,  remains as urgent as ever.   Unlike Republicans, the President's plan invests in America instead  of starving it. The President's budget invests in advanced  manufacturing and high-tech jobs and scientific research, job training,  education, and apprenticeships.   The President's budget asks the wealthiest Americans to pay just a  little more of their fair share in taxes so that programs like Medicare  remain solvent for decades. Just about all Americans think this is just  plain fair because there is no justification for the ultrawealthy to  have a lower tax burden on a percentage basis than teachers and nurses  and cabdrivers and firefighters.   I want to thank President Biden for laying down an optimistic,  forward-thinking vision for our country. This is what Americans want.  They want real stuff. They want positive thinking about the future,  help for those in the middle class to stay there, and for those  struggling to get to the middle class, to make it a little easier to  get there.  [[Page S728]]    But I really want to thank my Republican colleagues who have done a  great job in highlighting all of the ways they want to cut health  programs and give the ultrarich yet another payday. I am impressed at  how effectively Republicans are making the argument on Democrats'  behalf because, while Democrats want to help average Americans, a group  of House Republicans is working right now with former Trump Budget  Director Russell Vought to carry out a budget outline with drastic cuts  that would harm tens of millions of people. Vought is a hard-right guy.  He hates government even when it helps people.   According to the New York Times, Republicans in the House are  considering proposals that would cut hundreds of billions from  everything from the FBI to things like Pell grant eligibility and even  Medicaid.   I recently saw--catch this, Madam President. I recently saw one House  Republican frame spending cuts as a matter of courage. That is what one  House Republican said. Well, there is nothing courageous about taking  SNAP benefits away from hungry kids. There is nothing courageous about  cutting national security or constricting Pell grant eligibility. There  is nothing courageous about cutting housing and funding for police and  firefighters while doing nothing--nothing--to get wealthy Americans to  pay their fair share. How dare Republicans say it is courageous to make  those cuts.   Finally, the ball is now in Speaker McCarthy's court. Today is March  9, and there is still one big question all of us are asking: Speaker  McCarthy, where is your plan?   The debt ceiling must be raised soon. House Republicans say they  won't do it without painful cuts to our country, which Democrats  fiercely reject, but to this day, Americans have no idea where  Republicans truly stand on Federal spending cuts, whether it is dealing  with the debt ceiling or proposing a budget itself. All we have are  various proposals like Mr. Vought's, which, if passed, would wreck our  country and do huge damage to working families.   Speaker McCarthy, again, where is your plan? Where is your plan in  regard to the debt ceiling? Where is your plan in regard to the budget?   The President has done his job by showing where Democrats stand.  Speaker McCarthy needs to come clean with the American people and spell  out precisely what cuts he plans and explain how these cuts will put  the pain on average families.                            ____________________     Now, Madam President, in terms of FOX News, most Members  of this Chamber were present the day the insurrectionists attacked the  Capitol on January 6. We saw it with our own eyes. I was within 20, 30  feet of these hooligans. One of them allegedly screamed out ``Let's get  him,'' pointing at me. Thousands of Trump supporters broke through  police barricades, assaulted officers, and smashed through windows to  enter the building. Our offices were ransacked. Staffers hid behind  closed doors and beneath conference tables, trembling in fear for their  safety.    My point is this: Those of us who were here on January 6 know the  attack was a violent insurrection, including Speaker McCarthy. The  Speaker has now had multiple chances to denounce FOX News for lying to  the American people about January 6, but instead of speaking out  against FOX's lies, the Speaker is sticking his head in the sand,  saying he hasn't watched Tucker Carlson's broadcast.   McCarthy gives Carlson the tapes. He knows how inflammatory and  dishonest Tucker Carlson is. He knows how dangerous this is. And he  doesn't even take the time to watch the segment? That is unacceptable.  It is outrageous. For Speaker McCarthy not even to watch the spoiled  fruits of his labor shows a callousness and unconcern far beneath the  dignity of the Speaker's office.   Senators, thankfully, from both sides of the aisle have called out  FOX News for lying. Leader McConnell has acknowledged FOX News's lying.  The Capitol Police chief, in sticking up for his own officers, has  called out FOX News for lying. Every leader on Capitol Hill has done  the right thing by calling out FOX News's lies except for Speaker  McCarthy.   By remaining silent, Speaker McCarthy is empowering Tucker Carlson's  lies. The Speaker is outing himself as a January 6 denier, in complete  accord and in line with Tucker Carlson. It is a shame.                            ____________________     Madam President, on the railroads, this morning, Norfolk  Southern's CEO, Alan Shaw, will testify before the Environment and  Public Works Committee, where he will be held to account for his  company's pattern of negligence when it comes to safety regulations.   My questions to Mr. Shaw remain the same: Why did Norfolk Southern  spend years lobbying for looser regulations to prevent accidents like  this, particularly when Donald Trump was President? Despite seeing a  record $3.3 billion in profits last year, why did Norfolk Southern  prioritize billions in stock buybacks instead of investing in safety  equipment or in their workers? What is Norfolk Southern doing to  prevent future accidents like the one in East Palestine? And God forbid  another one happens, how will Norfolk Southern ensure communities get  the resources they need to respond to them?   I expect Mr. Shaw to answer these questions. The American people  expect Mr. Shaw to answer these questions. And we expect a candid,  frank, and honest discussion about the dangers of rail companies like  Norfolk Southern maximizing profits at the expense of everything else,  even people's safety.                            ____________________     Madam President, finally, on the nominations front,  today will be a busy day on the Senate floor.   Later this morning, we will confirm Daniel Werfel to serve as  Commissioner for the IRS. Mr. Werfel's confirmation will bring  important benefits to the American people because when the IRS is  better staffed, more Americans can benefit from the tax credits-- significant tax credits--we approved last year through legislation like  CHIPS and Science and the IRA and other legislation as well.   First, Republicans wanted to cut IRS agents, which hurts the American  people because they have to wait longer in line to get help with filing  their taxes, and it lets the rich get away without paying their fair  share of taxes.   No ultrawealthy American should ever pay less on a percentage basis  than a nurse or a cabdriver. This nomination, plus the addition of IRS  agents in the bill, will make it far more likely the wealthy will pay  their fair share. As we know, under Donald Trump, auditing the  ultrawealthy went way down, while people on the EITC, the earned income  tax credit, who were making about $40,000 a year, were being audited  over and over again.   It also makes it more likely that when Americans need help, they  won't have to wait hours or days or weeks to get in touch with an IRS  agent.   We will also confirm today two more exceptional judges: James Edward  Simmons, Jr., to serve as district judge for the Southern District of  California, and Maria Kahn to serve on the Second Circuit Court of  Appeals. Both Mr. Simmons and Ms. Kahn are remarkable legal minds, with  impressive resumes. Their confirmations will strengthen our Federal  courts and help restore Americans' trust in an independent and  impartial judiciary.   I look forward to getting these three nominees confirmed, and I thank  my colleagues from both sides of the aisle for their bipartisan  support.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Madam President, I move to proceed to legislative  session.
