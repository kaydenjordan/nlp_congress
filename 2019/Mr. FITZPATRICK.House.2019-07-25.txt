 Mr. Speaker, I rise today as a former FBI  supervisory special agent and Federal prosecutor and as a strong  advocate for civility to speak on a topic that must be addressed.   In our country, political discourse has disintegrated to a degree  that is completely unacceptable. Political opponents label each other  as enemies, and differences of opinion are met with slander and,  oftentimes, with violence.   I have never remained silent on this issue. When White supremacists  murdered a 32-year-old protestor in Charlottesville, Virginia, I  expressed my outrage. When violent clashes erupted in Berkeley,  California, in 2017, I also spoke out.   Recently, in Portland Oregon, a journalist was assaulted by Members  of the militant antifa movement. This journalist was covering an  ongoing protest and suffered a brain hemorrhage, requiring overnight  hospitalization.                                time  1045    Mr. Speaker, violence and hatred by any actor on any level is  completely unacceptable. What is deeply troubling is antifa's history  of provoking and stoking political violence, along with encouraging  civil unrest, to dissuade those who do not share their beliefs from  exercising their First Amendment rights.   In addition to the incident in Portland, antifa has tried to insight  riots in Washington, D.C., following President Trump's inauguration,  and several antifa members in Philadelphia, right outside of my  district, were arrested following an assault on Marine reservists. The  charges they face include aggravated assault, ethnic intimidation, and  conspiracy, among others.   Antifa has no desire to protest peacefully, no desire to learn from  other people's experiences, and no desire to be receptive to fair and  rational ideas outside of their own. They resort to violence and eschew  peaceful demonstration at every turn.   I recently sent a letter to Attorney General Bill Barr, demanding the  Department of Justice initiate proceedings to designate antifa as a  domestic terrorist organization to protect the welfare of journalists  and also the general public. I have asked my former colleagues at the  FBI to do the same.   Political violence has no place in our society. In my career in law  enforcement, I have seen firsthand how violence erodes civil society.  We must not give a pass to any organization that perpetuates a vicious  cycle of hatred and ignorance.   Antifa must be designated as the domestic terrorist organization that  it is.                            ____________________
