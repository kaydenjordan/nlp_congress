 Mr. Chairman, I thank my friend from Pennsylvania for  yielding me time.   Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the Resilient Federal Forests Act  of 2017. The National Forest System is governed by the principle of  multiple use--conferring maximum sustainable benefits in the form of  wildlife habitat, recreation, clean air and water, and timber harvests.   Sadly, government red tape and the constant threat of litigation has  caused paralysis by analysis at the Forest Service leading to a  decrease of public recreation activities and a reduction of timber  output.   In the counties surrounding the Apalachicola National Forest in  Florida's Second District--Franklin, Leon, Liberty, and Wakulla--the  lack of timber management not only means fewer jobs, but it also  creates a smaller tax base which means fewer resources to provide basic  services like law enforcement and good schools.   Under the Resilient Federal Forests Act of 2017, forest management  will be driven by forest health and not by fear of litigation. This  improves stewardship and strengthens communities. I encourage all of my  colleagues to support this important legislation.
