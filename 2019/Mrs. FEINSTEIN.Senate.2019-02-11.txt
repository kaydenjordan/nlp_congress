 I thank my colleague from Alaska and appreciate her  help with this measure. Yes, her characterization of this provision is  exactly right. There is no intent that this designation will have any  impact on water rights or water-related management decisions. The  general protections and limitations, along with the inclusion of  language specific to Delta water operations, makes certain that the  designation of the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta National Heritage Area  will not affect or influence water operations of the Central Valley  Project, State Water Project, or other water supply facilities within  the Bay-Delta watershed, including a reduction in water exports from  the Bay-Delta. I am pleased that we have included additional language  to dispel any such concerns and make absolutely certain that no one  reads anything into the legislation that is not there and was never  intended.   I thank her for including this designation in S. 47 and for all of  her work to move this historic public lands package forward. The public  lands package includes a number of provisions that will benefit  California, and I appreciate her leadership in building bipartisan  agreement to steer it through the Senate.
