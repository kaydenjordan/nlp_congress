 Mr. Chair, I thank the chairman, and I certainly  thank the ranking member for being present here today. I hold up in my  hand pages and pages of mass shootings, which I will include in the  Record.              List of Mass Shootings Since Columbine Massacre                      (By Zayed Abdalla, Feb 20, 2018)         Below is a list of all mass shootings in the United States       which occurred after the Columbine High School Massacre.

Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, Parkland,       Florida--February 2018: 17 Dead        According to The Washington Post, since 1966, 1077       individuals have been fatally shot and wounded as a result of       mass shootings in which more than four people perished;       Children and teenagers compose about a tenth of these       fatalities. Almost 300 guns have been obtained by authorities       in these shootings, and over half of them were obtained       legally. The AR-15 rifle has been increasingly used in such       shootings, with the latest being in this month's most recent       high school shooting in Florida. It is estimated that more       than 8 million of these weapons are owned in American       households. The trend in mass shootings has been rising       notably since 2006-07.     Mr. Chair, I thank Moms Demand Action, and I thank  all those who have offered themselves in this fight. I thank our chair,  Mr. Thompson, for his constant and persistent work.   Through my tenure as ranking member of the Crime, Terrorism, Homeland  Security, and Investigations Subcommittee, and now third in seniority  on the Judiciary Committee, it has given me a picture that many have  not seen, and that is that we have been fighting for gun safety  legislation for almost three decades.   It seems that even though Mr. Cohen is in a hearing right now where  facts are being disputed, there are no facts to dispute the fact that  people die from guns. And those who get guns are never regulated.   By no means do I want you not to have a handgun to protect yourself,  or to enforce gun trafficking laws, or to make sure that prosecutors  prosecute those for gun possession, but it begs the question. What is  the question? The interpretation of the Second Amendment is no one  should prohibit the right to bear arms. As I stand here today, there is  nothing in the underlying bill that is prohibiting that.   It is simply common sense and giving dignity to those who died at the  Columbine High School shooting, the Atlanta shooting, the Wedgwood  Baptist Church shooting, the Lockheed Martin shooting, the Living  Church of God shooting, the Red Lake High School shooting, the Northern  Illinois University shooting, the Santa Fe shooting in Texas, the  Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, and the Sutherland  Springs church shooting in Texas.   It says that you have to have a check, a background check. It closes  the gun show loophole. It gives exemptions for the issues of domestic  violence and sexual assault. It allows families to transfer, and  ranchers, farmers, and fishers to transfer.   My God, what more do we want? People have died. Are we not going to  show that we are committed to saving lives, not to abuse the Second  Amendment, to misuse it? We can bear arms. But the question is whether  or not we will recognize that there are 350-plus million Americans, and  there are more guns in this country than there are citizens.   I beg of my colleagues: Stop the violence. Vote for this bill.   Mr. Chair, as a senior member of the Judiciary Committee and an  original co-sponsor, I rise in strong of H.R. 8, the ``Bipartisan  Background Checks Act of 2019,'' legislation that strengthens the  background check system that is already in place to purchase a firearm.   A 2013 study found that approximately 80 percent of all firearms  acquired for criminal purposes were obtained from sources who were not  required to run a background check and that 96 percent of inmates who  were not prohibited from possessing a firearm at the time they  committed their crime obtained their gun this way.   This loophole exists largely because unlicensed sellers need not  conduct any background check under current law, even if the sellers  sell a large number of guns.   H.R. 8, the ``Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2019,'' would make  it illegal for any person who is not a licensed firearm importer,  manufacturer, or dealer to transfer a firearm to any other person who  is not so licensed without a background check.   Individuals seeking to transfer a firearm under this measure would be  required to visit a licensed firearms dealer to run the necessary  background check before the transfer could be finalized.   H.R. 8 is intended to provide an accurate and speedy means of  ensuring firearms do not end up in the wrong hands.   An internal assessment by the Federal Bureau of investigation (FBI)  demonstrated that the National Instant Criminal Background Checks  System (``NICS'') yields results that are approximately 99.3 percent to  99.8 percent accurate, and in 90 percent of cases, are processed within  90 seconds.   We must be constructive and proactive in our response to the  countless mass shootings and gun violence in our country that continue  to claim so many innocent lives.   Newly released data from the Centers for Disease Control and  Prevention (``CDC'') found firearm-related deaths rose for the second- straight year in 2016, largely due to spikes in gun violence.   In 2016, the new CDC report on preliminary mortality data shows that  there were more than 38,000 gun-related deaths in the U.S.--4,000 more  than 2015.   An Associated Press analysis of FBI data shows there were about  11,000 gun-related homicides in 2016, up from 9,600 in 2015.   Congress must act to keep our country safe through gun safety and  violence deterrence.   There is nearly one mass shooting per day in the United States--355  mass shootings in 2015.   In December 2012, a gunman walked into Sandy Hook Elementary School  in Newtown, Connecticut, and killed 20 children, 6 adults, and himself.   Since December 2012, there have been at least 1,518 mass shootings,  with at least 1,715 people killed and 6,089 wounded.   On the night of October 1, 2017, a gunman opened fire on a large  crowd of concertgoers at the Route 91 Harvest Music Festival on the Las  Vegas Strip, leaving 58 people dead and 527 injured.   On November 5, 2017, a mass shooting occurred at the First Baptist  Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, where the gunman, 26-year-old  Devin Patrick Kelley, killed 26 and injured 20 others.   Every day, on average, 92 Americans are victims of gun violence,  resulting in more than 33,000 deaths annually.   States with higher gun ownership rates have higher gun murder rates-- as much as 114 percent higher than other states.   A recent study by the CDC looking at 30 years of homicide data found  that for every 1 percent increase in a state's gun ownership rate,  there is a nearly 1 percent increase in its firearm homicide rate.   Gun death rates are generally lower in states with restrictions such  as safe storage requirements or assault weapons bans.   Mass shootings stopped by armed civilians in the past 33 years: 0.   This is why legislation put forward to arm teachers is not the  solution.   Stronger legislation is needed to prevent guns from getting into the  wrong hands because unfortunately, more than 75 percent of the weapons  used in mass shootings between 1982 and 2012 were obtained legally.   We must look at gun violence in its totality to determine what are  the root causes of these alarming rates of lives cut short.   We are elected by our constituents to lead in resolving the issues  that plague our country, and the issue of gun violence is a definite  plague across the nation.   My good friend, Houston Police Chief Art Acevedo, gave a statement  after four of his officers were shot while on duty.   He rightfully admonished us elected officials who, so far, have  accomplished absolutely nothing about the public-health epidemic of gun  violence.   Thanks to the new Democratic majority in Congress, we had a long  overdue Gun Safety Hearing in the Judiciary Committee.   That hearing is the first step in the legislative process of  addressing the epidemic.  [[Page H2250]]    Chief Acevedo was a witness at that hearing, testifying that if the  proposed legislation on background checks is enacted and saves at least  one life, then it is worth it.   I want to take this opportunity to thank my colleague, Congressman  Mike Thompson, for his leadership of the Gun Violence Prevention Task  Force and for introducing this timely and important legislation.   Congressman Thompson sat in the audience during the entirety of the  Gun Safety Hearing on February 13, 2019, demonstrating his longstanding  commitment to the issue.   Also helping to bring us to this point today is Congresswoman Robin  Kelly of Illinois, who represents one of the most affected districts  when it comes to gun violence.   She is a valiant leader who will not rest until the Congress finds  solutions for communities like hers and others all over this country.   I want to thank Aalayah Eastmond, a survivor from the Parkland School  Shooting, for testifying as a witness at the House Judiciary Gun Safety  Hearing.   Her heartfelt and vivid testimony was met with a standing ovation by  the crowded audience in the hearing.   Back in my state, despite incident after incident of rampant gun  violence, Texas Governor Greg Abbott and Attorney General Ken Paxton,  both prominent Republican opponents of gun control, issued the usual  statements offering the usual thoughts and prayers.   Chief Acevedo said, ``I appreciate your prayers . . . but the  question is, what are policymakers willing to do, besides prayers, to  address a public-health epidemic?''   I want to answer his question--``what ARE we going to do?''   We are going to overcome the fierce opposition from House minority  members.   We are going to overcome a recalcitrant and reluctant Senate.   And finally, we are going to overcome the opposition of the President  and the gun lobby.   I am a defender and supporter of the Constitution.   I appreciate the Second Amendment and the right that it provides our  citizens.   However, I am also a defender of the right to live, the greatest  divine right of all.   I want all Americans to enjoy their Second Amendment right, but not  at the expense of the lives of our children, students, communities, and  law enforcement officials.   Imagine going to grade school in this day and age and having to  undergo ``active shooter'' drills.   Imagine having children in grade school today.   Imagine the anxiety parents feel knowing that any day the precious  lives of their children may be interrupted by someone with an AK-47 or  AR-15.   Imagine a brighter future for America's children, one that does not  include active shooter drills and funerals for adolescents.   We can help make that future a reality and we can start by voting to  pass H.R. 8, the ``Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2019.''
