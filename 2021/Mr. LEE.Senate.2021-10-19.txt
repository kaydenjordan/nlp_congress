 Mr. President, I will be speaking in a moment. I had planned  to deliver my remarks prior to making a unanimous consent request, but  in deference to my friend and colleague from Washington, I will be  making the consent request first, and then proceed to my prepared  remarks.                      Unanimous Consent Request--S. 2847    Mr. President, as if in legislative session, I ask unanimous consent  that the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation be  discharged from further consideration of S. 2847, and that the Senate  proceed to its immediate consideration. Further, I ask unanimous  consent that the bill be considered read a third time and passed, and  that the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the  table.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        On page S7059, October 19, 2021, first column, the following  appears: UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--S. 2988 Mr. President, as if  in legislative session, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee  on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions be discharged from  further consideration of S. 2988,      The online Record has been corrected to read: UNANIMOUS CONSENT  REQUEST--S. 2847 Mr. President, as if in legislative session, I  ask unanimous consent that the Committee on Commerce, Science, and  Transportation be discharged from further consideration of S.  2847,    ========================= END NOTE =========================       Mr. President, I have come here to the Senate floor six  times now to oppose President Biden's unconstitutional actions, using  the Federal Government and using the Oval Office, in particular, in  order to force Americans to get the COVID-19 vaccine.   Now, as I have said before, as I have said each and every time I have  spoken on this issue, I am not opposed to the COVID-19 vaccine. I have  been fully vaccinated, as has every member of my family, with my  encouragement. I encouraged my family, I have encouraged friends,  everyone I know, to get vaccinated.   I think the vaccine is a blessing, and it is one that has helped a  lot of people. And I think it is one for which society, as a whole, has  benefited.   I have had and recovered from COVID-19 before I got vaccinated, and I  can tell you that contracting COVID is not an experience that I would  like to repeat, and it is not an experience that I want others to have.  That is why I have had the vaccine and why I have encouraged others to  do the same.   I, nonetheless, raise my hand in this very Chamber each time I have  been sworn into the office. Pursuant to the Constitution, I stood right  there on those steps and I swore an oath to uphold and protect and  defend the Constitution of the United States.   That inspired document limits the powers of government. It does so  because government power is sacred. Government power is dangerous.  Government power always involves the actual or threatened use of  coercive force. It is what government is--the ability and the authority  to use coercive force and to do so on an official basis through law. It  is for that reason that the Constitution carefully contains the power  of government and does so in a way that reflects its immense capacity  for harm.   There are lots of other things that are useful that we have to be  careful when handling. You know, fire, electricity, oxygen, water,  these are all things that are necessary, that we depend upon, that we  need; and things that, if left uncontrolled, can inflict all sorts of  harm, can hurt people, can kill people, can destroy life and property.   So that is why the Constitution goes to great lengths to draw  boundaries and assign authority not only to different branches of  government, but also different levels of government. In fact, every  single provision of the U.S. Constitution is itself a form of  limitation on government power.   These protections were designed to prevent government from  excessively burdening the American people, because we have seen over  time the tendency of governments to abuse that power and, in  particular, the tendency of governments to become abusive when there is  a dangerous accumulation of power at the hands of a few.   Tragically, and under the direction of Senates and Houses of  Representatives and White Houses of every conceivable partisan  combination, we have strayed far from the design of our government--the  design put in place by the Constitution, the very same Constitution to  which we have all sworn an oath.   And as a result of that, Americans are now forced to work many months  out of every year just to pay their Federal tax obligations only to be  told after the fact, by the way, that is not nearly enough because we  are now nearly $30 trillion in debt in closing.   The monetary printing presses are pumping out tsunamis of fiat  currency that eats away at Americans' savings and earnings. Government  regulations cost trillions of dollars a year as a hidden back door,  invisible, and highly regressive tax on American productivity and on  American development.   And this is a tax that is borne disproportionately by poor and  middle-class Americans who find that everything they buy--goods and  services alike--become more expensive. And we find that they also pay  for it with diminished wages, unemployment, and underemployment.   Almost every aspect of American life is now inappropriately  restricted, directed, or taxed by the Federal Government. President  Biden's recent mandate adds yet another roadblock to millions of  Americans just trying to get by, forcing them to choose between getting  vaccinated on the one hand and having a job on the other hand.   What it is doing is it is saying: Look, you don't agree with the  government position on this? Fine. You are going to lose your job. You  are going to pay. You are going to lose your job. You are going to be  rendered unemployed and effectively unemployable. Not only that, but we  are going to do it in a way that many instances will render it  basically impossible for you to recover unemployment benefits.   One of the things that is particularly devious about this one is that  the mandate itself hasn't been issued, and yet it has been now a month  and a half or so since President Biden gave the speech announcing his  intention to create it.   Had he created it, we would at least know what we were dealing with.  We would know the precise source of authority in the law that he was  claiming. We would know the contours of how it would be enforced. We  would know the contours of any exceptions to the mandate.   And because we would have an order, there would be something that  people could challenge in court, where necessary. But as of right now,  we have none of those things. We have only this Damoclean sword hanging  over the American people, who are forced to guess.  [[Page S7060]]    And in the meantime, we have corporate America--we have employers  with more than 99 workers, understandably, scrambling in an effort to  get ahead of this thing because they know that the penalties for  noncompliance with this are likely to be significant. So many of them  are trying to get ahead of it so they are not caught flat-footed and  unable to comply.   As a result, many of these have just tried to guess at what the  mandate will say and adopted those policies, sometimes knowing that  their policies might be more aggressive than what the Federal  Government will require.   But in the meantime, this leaves no one accountable. The corporations  have the Federal Government to blame. And the Federal Government  responds by saying there is no policy yet; there is nothing to sue on  yet; there is nothing for the Federal courts to enjoin as unlawful, as  unconstitutional, as an improper exercise of Federal power generally-- keeping in mind that the Federal Government is one of few and defined  powers, as James Madison described them in Federalist No. 45. The  powers reserved for the States are numerous and indefinite. We flipped  that on its head here. There is nothing that gives the Federal  Government this power.   My friend and colleague from Washington moments ago made the argument  that vaccines are nothing new and that vaccine requirements are nothing  new. Well, you know, they are new when it comes to a general mandate  issued by the Federal Government to do this. Yes, there have been  mandates in the past, but insofar as they deal with the general  population as opposed to military personnel or certain government  workers. These are not Federal law issues. These have been State law  issues. The Federal Government has no general police powers.   Even if there were power within the Federal Government to do this,  which I assure you there is not, we know for certain that one person  acting alone--even if that person is the President of the United  States--has not the power to do this.   This is, I believe, perhaps the most egregious example of  Presidential overreach, the most shameless executive branch power grab  since President Harry Truman seized all steel mills in the United  States in the 1950s in order to support the Korean war effort.   Now, President Truman did not get away with that. The Supreme Court  appropriately struck that down as well outside Presidential powers. You  see, nothing in the Constitution and nothing in Federal statute gave  President Truman the power to seize steel mills simply because he  deemed them an important part of the war effort.   Here, that hasn't happened. Here, that can't happen--at least not yet  because we don't have an order. The President, after making this  announcement about 6 weeks ago, hasn't had the decency to even tell us  what the source of his authority is.   And I will let you in on a secret: He has none. He has not a single  scintilla, not a shred of authority--not statutorily, not  constitutionally--to do this. He does haven't the power to do it.   Now, lest you be deceived into thinking that this is an academic  infringement of some esoteric liberty, it is not. Let's be honest about  what we are doing here. We are telling hard-working American moms and  dads: If you do not succumb, if you do not heel, if you don't obey the  Presidential dictate at issue here, you are going to lose your job.   We are making them decide between getting a vaccine to which they may  have a medical or a religious or some other legitimate exemption on the  one hand and on the other hand becoming unemployed and  unemployable. And in many instances, they are unable to even attain  unemployment benefits because you know what a lot of these companies  are doing--again, in order to get ahead of the mandate--they are  adopting their own draconian and aggressive policies. They are already  firing people. In some cases, they are not firing them. They are  putting them on unpaid administrative leave, making it impossible for  them to get unemployment. Is that really what we want to do?    Look, I understand the COVID-19 vaccine is a good thing. I consider  it a medical miracle of sorts. What do you say to somebody whose  religious beliefs make this an unacceptable choice for them? What do  you say to someone with a genuinely serious medical condition, someone  who has been told by his or her board-certified medical doctor, ``Don't  get this vaccine. You, in your case, you shouldn't get it because of  medical condition X, Y, or Z''? What do you say to that person? Do you  really want to tell that person that them being brought to heel with  the Federal directive issued by one person, in the absence of any  statutory or constitutional authority to do that, that is more  important; that is so compelling, that they have to be rendered  unemployed, unemployable and ineligible, in many instances, even to  collect unemployment? Is that really what we have sunk to? I hope not.  I don't believe we have.   The American people know better. They know that is not how we resolve  disputes in this country. It is certainly not how we treat religious  minorities or people with medical conditions that make them have a  different set of concerns than other people. That is not how we act.   By the way, it is also a good reason why we don't make law in this  country through one person because, of course, Mr. President, a law  like that would never pass. It would never pass here in the Senate or  in the House of Representatives. It couldn't withstand that kind of  scrutiny, not the way it has been laid out--not a chance.   Deep down, the President of the United States perhaps knows this. I  can only assume--of course, I can't read another human being's  subjective mindset--but I can only assume that he would have brought it  to Congress and given us the opportunity to consider it and adopt it.  He cut out the people's elected representatives, the people's elected  lawmakers whose constitutional obligation and authority it is to make  the law so we can only make assumptions from them.   But it is not as though he didn't have time to do it. Six weeks have  elapsed since he made the announcement. Meanwhile, I am hearing from  countless people across America, including 300 or so people from the  State of Utah who are themselves being put in impossible positions.   Now, look, mind you, for most people, this isn't a big deal. Most  people in America have chosen to get the vaccine, and I am glad they  have, but there are a lot of people whose stories are heart-wrenching.   Just this week, I heard from a flight attendant who works with a  major U.S. airline. She has religious beliefs that make her opposed to  getting this vaccine or any vaccine. She is a hard-working employee.  She has been a faithful flight attendant, and it is a job that she has  loved and she has enjoyed throughout her entire adult professional  career. It is a job that has benefited her and her family, allowed her  to make a living, put food on the table. She is now being faced with  this awful choice between, on the one hand, betraying her religious  beliefs--which she is unwilling to do--and, on the other hand, losing a  job which is her only means of earning a living, of feeding her family.  How is this fair? How is this just? How is this constitutional? It is  not.   Troublingly, there are now signs that the White House isn't satisfied  with just making Americans who haven't received the vaccine unemployed  and unemployable. The administration is reportedly also considering a  medical mandate for interstate travel. Such a move would be deeply  constitutionally concerning, but it would also revoke yet another  freedom and make yet another group of American citizens solidly second  class.   The privileges and immunities clause of the 14th Amendment, of  course, protects the right to interstate travel. There is no precedent  in our Nation's history of a requirement of this nature for interstate  travel.   Even if those considerations were somehow untrue--they are not, but  even if they were--Congress has certainly not granted such authority to  the President of the United States to act unilaterally, nor would we  ever.   A mandate requiring people to get the COVID-19 vaccine in order to  have the privilege, the benefit, which is actually just a right, one  that the American people ought to be able to rely on to travel  interstate within the United States, is truly unthinkable.   But many of the Federal Government's actions over the last year have  [[Page S7061]]  shown Americans the real threat it poses to freedom and simply to  common sense. Remember, this is the administration that has forced our  2-year-olds to wear masks for hours at a time on airplanes, buses,  trains, and in bus depots, train stations, and airports--2-year-olds.  For any parent out there or for anyone who has ever actually interacted  with a 2-year-old human, you can certainly understand how absurd this  is, especially when our peer nations have recognized there is no need  to mask a 2-year-old.   But back to the mandate for a minute. If we think through this  disturbing possibility of forced medical treatment as a condition  precedent for visiting family in another State or traveling for  business reasons or traveling for any reason at all from one State to  another, the impacts are clear, and they are devastating. Businesses  already hard-hit by the pandemic--the travel and hospitality sectors-- would, of course, be further strained; collateral damage, I suppose, on  the part of those who would push such an oppressive move.    Individuals could be marooned in States or they couldn't work,  couldn't go to restaurants, and couldn't leave. And the social capital  built from face-to-face interactions would be further set back.   I believe vaccines are generally safe, and they help protect people  from the harms of contracting COVID-19. I have in the past and I still  now continue to encourage people to get the vaccine, but we must ask  what ends this administration is willing to go to to cudgel Americans  to this state-sponsored health edict.   I am personally uncomfortable with such sweeping mandates, but, more  importantly, I am required by my oath to protect the Constitution of  the United States to oppose this action. That is why I brought forward  my latest iteration of my efforts against this unlawful,  unconstitutional, and still inchoate mandate. My Let Me Travel America  Act would clarify the law and prohibit the Federal Government from  mandating that Americans receive shots against COVID-19 as a  prerequisite for interstate travel.   I am grateful that my colleagues, Senators Tuberville, Braun, and  Sullivan, have joined me as cosponsors of this bill.   This is a commonsense, practical, reasonable bill, one that would  simply provide assurance and protection to millions of Americans whose  rights are under attack.   Moments ago, I came here, and I asked unanimous consent that we pass  this bill today with the understanding that I am going to continue to  come back day after day, as long as it takes, to address what the  President is doing.   The Senate had a chance to protect the American people from yet  another unconstitutional overreach. It is disappointing to me, really,  that my friend and colleague, the Senator from Washington, chose to  object to its adoption.   This shouldn't be controversial. It is really not controversial among  the American people. I guarantee you, you take a poll asking people  should the Federal Government ever be able to tell you that you can't  travel interstate unless you receive a particular medical treatment,  there is no way the American people would think that is a good idea  because it is not, because it is absurd, and because it violates  everything that we believe in.   Now, my friend and colleague, the distinguished Senator from  Washington, made the point that such measures can't be enacted because,  according to her, they supposedly undermine vaccine efforts. Do you  know what undermines the vaccine effort? What undermines the vaccine  effort is when you try to use the overpowering cudgel of coercive  force, a type and a level of coercive force that no other entity on  planet Earth can wield more strongly than the Federal Government--you  use that cudgel to tell people who haven't gotten it yet: You must get  this.   Look, a lot of people have been getting the vaccine. Yes, there are  some holdouts, and they have their reasons for being holdouts. There  are a lot of ways that you can convince someone to do something that  they don't currently want to do. One of the things that is going to  make it far less likely that they get the vaccine is for them to be  told that they are being threatened with their jobs. It is not how you  win. Even if it were that we could somehow chalk this up as a win here,  that is not who we are; that is not how we play.   And this is unprecedented. Make no mistake, the Federal Government  has never undertaken anything like this. States and political  subdivisions of States--meaning cities, towns, counties, so forth-- States and their subdivisions have general police powers, meaning broad  power to protect health, safety, and welfare; to protect life, liberty,  and property in whatever manner they deem appropriate, subject, of  course, to such limitations as may be placed on them either by their  State Constitution or by the U.S. Constitution.   But States and their subdivisions have the ability to enact  legislation like this--health, safety, welfare legislation--in a way  that the Federal Government doesn't. We have to act pursuant to one of  the enumerated powers in the Constitution.   I challenge anyone to identify what source of authority can fairly be  said to give the Federal Government this kind of power. It doesn't  exist. We have never exercised this power with respect to the U.S.  population at large. It is a different thing entirely to point to  vaccine requirements that we have had for certain Federal personnel,  including our military servicemembers. We have never done anything like  this. If we were to ever consider something like this at a Federal  level, I would have grave concerns with it because I don't think it is  the prerogative of the Federal Government.   But I can tell you one thing, I am darn certain we would never give  one person the authority to impose such a mandate. No, that is not how  our constitutional system works. There are a lot of reasons why we no  longer fly the Union Jack. A lot of them had to do with what happens  when you have a dangerous accumulation of power in the hands of a few.  That is one of the reasons why we put in place a rigid set of  requirements saying that before you change the legal status quo, before  you pass a law, you have to run it through Congress. Any Federal law,  assuming it is acting in an area within the Federal Government's power  and authority and jurisdiction, it can't become law, Federal law, until  you run it through the House, run the same language through the Senate.  Then you present it to the President for an opportunity for veto,  signature, or acquiescence. Without going through that process, you  have not made a Federal law.    Look, Harry Truman's effort to seize the entire steel industry in the  United States was unlawful. It was unconstitutional. And, mercifully,  the courts were able to dispense of that in a relatively short period  of time.   We don't even have the luxury of going to court in this instance  because the President hasn't had the decency to show us his work, to  tell us what he is actually doing.   Meanwhile, he is bullying corporate America to do his dirty work for  him. Corporate America is dutifully complying in some cases, perhaps  out of allegiance or a desire to appear compliant with the President's  wishes; in other instances, just for more practical reasons. They don't  want to be stuck with the heavy fines that may be levied against them  if they are caught flat-footed and unprepared for what may be coming.  So they are doing the President's dirty work for him. They are doing  the firing, rendering people unemployed, unemployable, and in some  cases ineligible even to receive unemployment.   Shame on him and shame on us if we don't call this out for what it  is, which is an aggressive, unconstitutional, baseless power grab.   My friend and distinguished colleague, the Senator from Washington,  also pointed to what she referred to as tailored exemptions to the  vaccine mandate.   What exemptions?   There is no mandate. There are no exemptions. Yeah, he has spoken in  aspirational terms about certain exemptions that would be available,  but corporate America doesn't know what they are. And so corporate  America, acting on the advice of counsel, is understandably being very  aggressive, erring on the side of firing more people and rendering more  people unemployed and unemployable, and in many cases rendering them  incapable of receiving unemployment.  [[Page S7062]]    So, no. No. Don't tell me these are tailored exemptions, when there  aren't even exemptions. In order for it to be an exemption, you have  got to have a mandate. There is no mandate. There is just the  threatened use of the mandate that is making corporate America decide  that it is in its best interest to do the President's dirty work for  him, and in a way that protects him from being questioned on legal,  meritorious grounds in court.   And if we can't muster the legislative will to defend that power  which is rightfully ours--not ours in the sense that we personally own  it, but it has been given to the people, the power to make sure that  laws are passed only by their elected Representatives and Senators--we  can't stand up for this, shame on us.   And if we can't stand up for even a further encroachment on that  power and on the corresponding right that the American people have long  come to depend upon, to be able to travel interstate without undue  hindrance or interference from their government, it is a sad outcome,  one that I can't countenance. That is why I am going to be back day  after day, as long as it takes. The American people expect more. The  American people deserve better.
