 Madam President, ``border, border, border''--I just had  lunch with Speaker   Mike Johnson. He is a great friend and a  classmate. We came in together. That is what he said. He said he wishes  he could get all of us a T-shirt that said ``border, border, border.''   In my office, this week, no matter what the question is, the answer  is ``Secure the border.'' In fact, I think Speaker Johnson has been  talking to some of the same people I have been talking to.   I had the great time of my life these past 7, 10 days back home in  Kansas. I got to spend time with my grandchildren, teaching them how to  hunt and fish and sled in a very welcome 10-inch snow. I got to see a  lot of friends and family members and share what is going on in their  lives and get caught up. But no matter where I went, the No. 1 worry  people had was about the concern for the safety and security of their  own family.   In Kansas--the heartland, the middle of the country, the middle  State--people are concerned about their own safety and security, and  why wouldn't they be?   Since Joe Biden was sworn into office, over 10 million immigrants  have come into our border, and over 1.5 million ``got-aways'' have  occurred--10 million people crossing our border illegally, 1.5 million  ``got-aways.''   This crisis at our Nation's border is the No. 1 most immediate threat  to our safety and security. This is a true, clear, and present danger  to our Nation.   Just think about these numbers. Fentanyl is now the No. 1 killer of  young adults in America. It kills a Kansan every day. Nearly 300 young  Americans are dying every day from fentanyl poisoning, not to mention  what is going on with human trafficking, the growth of the cartel, and  the violence. As my dad the police officer taught me, the violence  always follows the drug trafficking.   But it seems like these numbers are falling on deaf ears at 1600  Pennsylvania Avenue. Just look at September, October, and November.  These look like they are all going to be record-setting months for the  number of people crossing our border illegally in these months. But  yet, for some unknown reason, the White House wants to take border  security off the table in the supplemental bill.   Why? That is what people are asking me back home. Why? That is the  question Americans want to know.   They point out the facts that we know well up here. Under this  administration, we have seen 279 known terrorists try to cross our  border, more than 24,000 Chinese nationals, not to mention some 80,000  aliens of interest from countries like Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, and  Syria who have breached our border. This is indeed an invasion of our  border, and every American is now paying for it.   As a matter of fact, it is now costing Americans nearly $500 billion  a year--let me say that again, $500 billion a year--to house and take  care of these illegal immigrants. Can you imagine how many Border  Patrol officers, how much technology, how many drug dogs, and, yes, how  much fence we could build for half a trillion dollars a year?   Again, that is what Americans are asking me back home.   It is time for this Chamber to step up to the plate and do what is  right for the American people. For such a time as this, we need  leadership. I am grateful, I am proud, and the American people are glad  to hear that the leadership on this side of the aisle are saying we  will deny cloture on this supplemental bill if there is not meaningful  border security.   This concept of a supplemental bill without taking care of our  national security, of sending over $100 billion to foreign lands  without addressing our own national sovereignty, well, it actually  reminds me of what Abraham Lincoln once said:         You can fool all the people some of the time and some of       the people all the time, but you cannot fool all the people       all the time.    Let my message today be clear. Let's bring on the hard work, late  nights, and weekends. That is what Kansans do. We work hard. We have  those values of a hard work ethic. I am certainly willing to do just  that, to work hard to get to border security.   Look, on this side of the aisle, we are not going to waver. We are  not going to quit. This is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to secure  our border and to get this right for once.   I urge every Republican to vote down cloture of this outrageous  supplemental package unless we see true, meaningful border security  included.   We have got solutions that this body can send to the President's desk  today that wouldn't cost a dime. Changing  [[Page S5658]]  the asylum policy alone can result in as many as 75 percent less people  entering our Nation illegally--75 percent. If we just turn off the  siren of asylum, we can cut back on those crossing our borders some 75  percent. That would free up the Border Patrol officers to do the job  that they were hired to do: catching the bad guys, stopping the  fentanyl, stopping the human trafficking, rather than playing a  nursemaid to nearly 10,000 illegal people every day.   And also from a policy standpoint, we have to limit the President's  abuse of his parole powers, which has enabled over 1.5 million  immigrant parolees to enter our Nation under his watch.   Our insistence that these measures be included in the supplemental  bill are not partisan. They are not hard-right distractions, as has  been alleged. But it is an attempt to protect the lives and well-being  of the Americans who elected us and their families and to ensure the  sovereignty of this great Nation.   This is a national security issue, not an immigration issue. It is  imperative. It is a must that any supplemental bill include provisions  to address these border issues. Any package agreed upon by all or some  of the Senate Republican conference must actually be effective at  controlling our borders.   A measure that is advertised as stopping the torrent of illegal  migration but does not in practice would be a devastating blow to the  credibility of Republican Senators on this issue, over the long term,  and unacceptable to the people we represent. This is why I urge every  Republican in this body to vote no on cloture on any bill that does  not, at a minimum, include policy changes that meaningfully address the  flood of illegal immigration at our southern border.   I yield the floor.
