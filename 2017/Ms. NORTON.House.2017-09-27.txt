 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, this bill is full of provisions that could pass in  regular order, and I am afraid of using the FAA reauthorization,  running out of time, again, because the planes can't fly if controllers  are not in the air.   The FAA bill contains a lot of important provisions that our  constituents are crying out for. Among them, airplane noise, which is  ruining communities across the United States. A study of the health  impact of that noise is as important as DACA, which we should pass, and  I think could pass. And there are other provisions which would pass on  regular order.   The FAA reauthorization bill is not the bill to fool around with. We  have had too many near misses by letting these short-term extensions  pile up on us. Pass a straight FAA reauthorization bill.
