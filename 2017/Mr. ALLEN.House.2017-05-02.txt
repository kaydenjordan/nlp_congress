 Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of H.R. 1108, the  Working Families Flexibility Act.   Many Americans can relate to the difficulties of balancing work  duties with family obligations. It is not always easy to attend a  parent-teacher conference, care for an aging parent, or stay home with  a newborn when outdated Federal laws create constant barriers to  workplace flexibility.   H.R. 1180 will amend the outdated Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938  and bring much-needed reform to the workplace. It will give employers  the freedom to offer employees a choice between cash wages and comp  time for overtime hours worked.   I emphasize this is a voluntary option, which means that employees  who want to receive cash wages can continue to do so; and if they  choose to accept comp time and change their mind, it allows workers to  withdraw and receive cash wages whenever they choose.   By passing this bill, American workers will gain more flexibility in  the workplace, allowing them to have more time to spend with the people  they love.   I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense legislation that  supports our American workers.
