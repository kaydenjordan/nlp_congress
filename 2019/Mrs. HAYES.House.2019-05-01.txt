 Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the 57 State teachers of  the year from around the country who have convened in Washington.   These educators illuminate what is working in our education system.  Their unique and important achievements fill me with pride and  inspiration about what teachers can do for our communities when we put  students first.   I welcome these outstanding teachers to Washington this week and to  Capitol Hill this Thursday as part of a celebration of excellence.   I would like to congratulate the 2019 National Teacher of the Year,  Rodney Robinson, who is a committed advocate for all his students and  has made it his mission to bring a voice to the voiceless and to those  who feel unseen or undervalued by their communities.   Mr. Robinson has been teaching social studies for 19 years to  students at Virgie Binford Education Center inside the Richmond  Juvenile Detention Center, teaching some of our Nation's most  vulnerable students.   Every student deserves a high-quality, equitable education. Mr.  Robinson and all these educators work every day to fulfill that promise  to their students.   Equity and empowerment are at the core of Mr. Robinson's work and  should also be at the core of our work here at the Federal Government.   I also want to thank the Council of Chief State School Officers, or  CCSSO, which, since 1952, has focused on excellence in public  education. They are the oldest and most prestigious national honors  program for teachers, and their work to celebrate and elevate the  voices of teachers should be commended.   It is, likewise, our job as Members of Congress to continue to  elevate the profession of teachers, elevate the voices of students, and  work together to make sure their dreams are recognized.                            ____________________
