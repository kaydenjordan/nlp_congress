 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the five Sullivan  brothers of Waterloo, Iowa, as well as those who are working to  preserve their legacy by saving the USS The Sullivans.   On January 3, 1942, a month after the bombing at Pearl Harbor,  George, Frank, Joe, Matt, and Al Sullivan of Waterloo, Iowa, enlisted  in the Navy.   At the time, Navy policy separated brothers, but they enlisted under  the condition that they could serve their country together, and they  did until November of that year when a Japanese torpedo sunk their  ship, the USS Juneau.   Nearly all the sailors aboard the USS Juneau died, including all five  of the Sullivan brothers.   The Sullivans weren't just heroes in Iowa; their story was told  nationwide. In 1943, less than 3 months after their passing, a  Fletcher-class destroyer was named in their honor. The ship's motto is  ``We Stick Together,'' a permanent symbol of the Sullivan brothers'  commitment to each other and our country.   But earlier this month, a leaky hull caused the ship to start sinking  at its berth in the Buffalo Naval Park. So, Mr. Speaker, I am rising  today to thank those who are working to refloat and repair the ship to  ensure that the Sullivan brothers' legacy continues. Their service and  sacrifice are emblematic of the shared experience and patriotism of  those in the Greatest Generation.   Freedom is fragile. We know that we must always honor those like the  Sullivan brothers of Waterloo who fought and died for our freedoms and  for our country.                            ____________________
