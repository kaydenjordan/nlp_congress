 Madam President, I call up my motion to instruct conferees,  which is at the desk.    Last year, the Senate unanimously adopted my amendment to  prevent taxpayer dollars from being used to finance gain-of-function  research conducted in China. My motion to instruct asks that this  language be incorporated into the final bill.   Gain-of-function research enhances the severity or transmissibility  of existing viruses that may infect humans. The dangers are so acute  that from 2014 to 2017, the NIH suspended funding for all gain-of- function research projects.   While we may never know whether the pandemic arose from a lab in  Wuhan or occurred naturally, the emergence of COVID serves as a  reminder that dangerous research conducted in a secret and totalitarian  country is simply too risky to fund. Congress must ensure that taxpayer  dollars will not be used to fund gain-of-function research in China.   I urge a ``yes'' vote.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.
