 Madam President, even as the Senate works through a  grouping of appropriations bills on the floor this week, the Republican  leader has been falsely accusing Democrats of delaying the overall  process. He just seems to be in a box and pulls things out of thin air.   The crux of the issue, as everybody knows, is that the Republican  leadership in the Senate and on the Appropriations Committee has  refused to sit down and negotiate with Democrats on bipartisan  allocations to the various agencies. This has always been how we have  done the appropriations bill when we have succeeded--Democrats and  Republicans sitting down together and negotiating the 302(a)s and (b)s,  but, here, the Republicans, without consultation of the Democrats, just  unilaterally proposed taking over $12 billion from critical health  programs and military families to pay for the President's border wall-- a wall President Trump promised Mexico would pay for.   Democrats, of course, are not going to proceed to a defense bill that  steals from our troops to pay for a border wall the American people  don't want and aren't supposed to pay for, but in this Republican hall  of mirrors, that means Democrats are ``delaying a pay raise for our  troops,'' as the leader charged yesterday, even though that is not  true, and I believe he knows very well that the pay raise is strongly  bipartisan.   The truth is simple. As the leader knows, the annual pay raise will  go into effect regardless of whether we pass Defense appropriations or  the NDAA.   In fact, the Department of Defense just confirmed to the Senate  Democratic appropriators yesterday that the pay raise for our troops  will take effect on January 1, without requiring any further  legislation. The troops and their families will see a 3.1-percent pay  raise in January. I know the President ties the majority leader in a  box, in a knot, and he sort of flails around and doesn't know how to  get out of it because he is afraid to tell President Trump what he is  doing will not pass, but instead he blames Democrats--that  [[Page S6208]]  seems to be his wont these days--but it is just totally false. It is  not according to just me but according to the Department of Defense.   He even went a step further. In the Republican hall of mirrors,  Democrats might even be ``delaying military assistance for Ukraine.''  Can you believe the majority leader would say something like this? The  comments are laughable. It was the Trump administration that delayed  hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of already appropriated,  urgently needed military assistance to Ukraine earlier this year--a  fact now being investigated by the House impeachment inquiry.   The fact is, the only purported delay in the appropriations process  is Republicans insisting on taking money from our military to spend on  a border wall--something Democrats will not countenance. That is it.   If the Republican appropriators dropped that request and sat down  with Democrats, the negotiated bipartisan way forward--which is the  only way appropriations can proceed--I am sure we could line up the  rest of the bills for the year. So let's cut the nonsense.   Leader McConnell, have the honor and decency and courage to tell  President Trump that he is going to bolix up the whole process again,  just as he did the last time. We can roll up our sleeves and get to  work if he would do just that.   We are already working on the noncontroversial bills, and we could do  it for the rest, if and when our Republican friends decide to meet us  halfway.                                  Healthcare    Mr. President, tomorrow, Senate Democrats will use a provision of the  Congressional Review Act to force a vote on one of the most crucial  policy questions we have faced all session--the future of healthcare  protections for Americans with preexisting conditions. The Trump  administration has tried several different ways to undermine these  protections and sabotage our healthcare system.   One of the most damaging efforts is this rule that gives the States  the green light to use taxpayer dollars to push junk health insurance  plans. These plans are hardly worth the paper they are printed on. Many  don't cover maternity care, prescription drugs, mental health, or  preventive services. Many could offer insurance companies a way around  the requirement to pay for your treatment if you develop a preexisting  condition.   Just imagine signing up for one of these plans and then you discover  that your child's heart condition or cancer or lifesaving prescriptions  drugs were not covered when you need it most? That shouldn't be allowed  to happen. Republicans and this administration are trying to allow it  to happen.   As you can imagine, many insurance companies love the idea. Data from  the National Association of Insurance Commissioners shows that the top  three companies that issue these junk plans spend barely 40 percent of  premiums on healthcare--just 40 percent. Just think about that.  Republicans want to use taxpayer dollars to fund these junk plans. Is  that money going toward paying for people's healthcare? No. It is going  to pad insurance company profits.   Tomorrow, the Senate will face a simple choice on whether or not to  defend protections for Americans with preexisting conditions. My  Republican friends can either stand with the Trump administration and  use taxpayer dollars to pad profits for insurance companies or stand up  for American families who struggle to afford healthcare.                                Climate Change    Mr. President, finally, on climate, last week, I announced a bold new  plan to rapidly phase out gas-powered vehicles for clean vehicles. We  need a plan of this scale and ambition to reduce one of the largest  drivers of carbon emissions--transportation--while at the same time  creating tens of thousands of new jobs and reinvigorating American auto  manufacturing.   Predictably, the deep-pocketed special interests in Big Oil and Gas  are already lining up to oppose this plan. Over the years, Big Oil and  Gas have spent millions of dollars in lobbying to kill climate-friendly  legislation and protect their bottom lines. A headline ran yesterday  announcing: ``Big Oil gears up to fight Schumer electric vehicle  plan.''   Well, I have three words for Big Oil: Bring it on. Bring it on,  because this fight is too important. Climate change is happening right  now, and it is resulting in more severe weather, sea-level rise, and  drastic changes to our agriculture.   As we speak, California is suffering from some of the worst wildfires  it has ever seen. Scientists tell us that if we do not take drastic  action to alter our current path, we will not be able to avoid the most  damaging consequences of climate change.   Bring it on, because this plan is supported not only by the  environmental community and climate action groups but by labor unions  like the UAW, the IBEW, the AFL-CIO, and by large automakers like Ford  and GM. They all know that the future is moving toward clean cars, and  we ought to get there before China and create tens of thousands of new  good-paying jobs right here in the United States.   Bring it on. If the special interests of Big Oil and Gas want to  oppose thousands of good-paying jobs for American workers, if they want  to oppose America's leading the world in the industries of the future,  if they want to oppose protecting our planet for our children and  grandchildren, then, they are on the wrong side of history, and we will  fight them every single step of the way.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
