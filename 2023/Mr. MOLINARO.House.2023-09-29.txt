 Mr. Speaker, after pouring trillions of dollars into  the American economy, after ignoring the crisis at our southern border,  after closing schools and forcing kids to learn from home, after  denying life-affirming services to young people with disabilities, we  have been lectured about how great these last 2 years have been for the  American people.   We have, in this very moment, the ability to avert a government  shutdown and, at the same time, finally take some responsibility for  reckless, wasteful Federal spending.   There is no excuse to pick the pockets of hardworking American  families who are already overburdened because of inflation, the high  cost of gas, the high cost of groceries, the inability to access or  find a job, and running up their credit cards.   We have the ability now to avert a government shutdown, control  Federal spending, and secure the border, an open border that is taking  too many American children's lives because of fentanyl and destroying  communities all across this country.   The mayor of New York is saying the President has ignored his call  and that inaction at the border is destroying the city of New York. We  have, in this very moment, the ability to avert a shutdown, respect  American taxpayers, and secure the American borders.
