 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak out against the  dangerous proposal that is being put forth by leadership on the other  side of the aisle, the Democratic proposal to place an artificial and  arbitrary cap on ICE's detention capacity.   ICE is outstanding at arresting gang members, felons, drug dealers,  and human traffickers, but now Speaker Pelosi and Minority Leader  Schumer want to limit how many they catch. This represents a breakdown  in law and order and will only make our broken border less secure.   It does not make sense to tell a State trooper that he can only pull  over 10 people and then must stop, or a city cop saying: once you catch  your second thief, she must stop.   Does the next person committing an illegal act get a free pass  because we have hit some magic number?   Our country embraces the rule of law. We do not get to pick and  choose, especially when it pertains to our national security.   I urge the Democratic leadership to withdraw this ludicrous proposal  and come to the negotiating table. It is about time we work together,  but we will not and cannot undermine our national security and the  safety of our communities.                            ____________________
