 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, the past few weeks in the Senate have  been extremely productive. Senate Democrats delivered on our promise to  pass bold COVID relief legislation, and we have now confirmed 16  Cabinet-level officials. Today, we will continue moving the ball  forward on the President's nominees by confirming Representative Deb  Haaland to serve as President Biden's Secretary of the Interior.   Representative Haaland has already made history as one of two Members  to become the first Native American woman to serve in the House of  Representatives. She is a citizen of the Laguna Pueblo nation, and her  family's roots in New Mexico can be traced back 35 generations. By her  own account, she grew up poor, moving frequently. Her mother served in  the Navy, and her father spent a 30-year career in the Marines. While  the Federal Government has often mistreated and neglected Indigenous  Americans, the Haaland family has proudly and bravely served this  country. Now Representative Haaland is making history twice over as the  first Native American Secretary of the Interior and as the first Native  American Cabinet official in American history.   Representative Haaland's confirmation represents a gigantic step  forward in creating a government that represents the full richness and  diversity of this country because Native Americans were, for far too  long, neglected at the Cabinet level and in so many other places.   Representative Haaland will have an important task ahead of her. She  must refocus the Interior Department on preserving and protecting  almost 500 million acres of public lands, combating climate change and  environmental degradation, and upholding the Federal Government's  obligations to Tribal nations. The Trump administration did more to  undermine the relationship between the Federal Government and the  sovereign Tribes than many have in decades--from desecrating sacred  burial sites to build a border wall to neglecting the desperate  situation of Native Tribes during the pandemic. Shame on them.   In elevating Representative Haaland to lead the Department of the  Interior, we reset the relationship between the Federal Government and  Tribal nations to one of cooperation, mutual respect, and trust, which  is so different  [[Page S1510]]  from the last administration's attitude. I greatly look forward to  voting in favor of Representative Haaland's nomination in a few short  hours.   Throughout the week, the Senate will process even more of President  Biden's highly qualified Cabinet nominees, including Xavier Becerra to  serve as the next Secretary of Health and Human Services; Isabella  Guzman to serve as the SBA Administrator; and Katherine Tai to serve as  the U.S. Trade Representative.   As President Biden continues to fight the COVID pandemic and begins  implementing the American Rescue Plan, he deserves to have his team in  place ASAP, as soon as possible.                            ____________________     Madam President, now on the American Rescue Plan, late  last week, President Biden signed the American Rescue Plan into law.  The most significant Federal recovery effort in decades is now underway  as $1,400 checks are heading out the door to 85 percent of American  households. Relief for schools, businesses, families, and State and  local governments is starting to arrive. Shots are going into the arms  of Americans from coast to coast. More than 135 million doses of the  vaccine have now been delivered, and over 100 million doses have now  been administered. That is one-third of the population and much more  quickly than had been previously projected.   And our economy is poised for its own shot in the arm. As the  American Rescue Plan begins to take effect, economists are projecting  that American economic growth could more than double as a result of  this bold, strong legislation.   Already, Americans are more optimistic about businesses being able to  reopen, jobs coming back, and the national economy taking off. As one  headline read over the weekend, ``Americans see better days ahead in  pandemic and economy.''   After the American Rescue Plan passed through the Senate, a little  over a week ago, I have been highlighting parts of the bill that may  have escaped notice, and there are so many. We all know about the  $1,400 checks. We all know about the shots in the arm. But, today, I  want to take some time explaining how it helps our Nation's students.   First of all, the American Rescue Plan provides substantial emergency  relief to colleges and universities, weighted toward those colleges and  universities without million-dollar endowments. Fully half of that  funding must be used for emergency financial aid grants to students--at  least $20 billion nationwide. And, of course, many students will  benefit from the $1,400 checks. Any student with a young family will  benefit from the historic expansion of the child tax credit. But these  emergency financial aid grants are another way that students with  exceptional need can access relief.   That is not all. The American Rescue Plan also sets the stage for  President Biden to deliver incredibly meaningful student loan  forgiveness by making all types of student loan forgiveness tax free  through December.   At the moment, debt cancellation is usually treated as taxable  income. So without this provision, forgiving a student's debt would  stick them with a tax bill--giving with one hand and taking away with  the other. This would apply to more than 100,000 students who are  already in repayment programs that offer some student loan forgiveness.  Crucially, this tax provision would apply to future efforts to forgive  student loans as well.   I believe the current administration has the legal authority to  forgive up to $50,000 in Federal student loan debt, a life-changing  policy decision that would boost our economy and help close the racial  wealth gap.   Twenty years after starting college, the median White borrower will  owe 6 percent of their debt, while the median Black borrower owes 95  percent of their debt. Canceling up to $50,000 in student debt would  close the racial wealth gap by 28 percentage points among those  households. That is just one of the many reasons Senator Warren and I  have been advocating this policy to cancel $50,000 of student debt.  And, as I mentioned, it has become an issue of racial justice as well.   President Biden, to his credit, has already proposed some student  loan forgiveness--up to around $10,000. But now, one of the objections  that some in the administration have had, that students with forgiven  debt will have to pay taxes, is gone, gone, gone because of the ARP.   I particularly want to thank Senators Menendez and Warren for their  work on these provisions. For much of American history, education has  been the ladder up. For too many these days, student debt has become  the anchor weighting them down, making it harder to start a family, buy  a home, plan a career, and so much more. The pandemic has stressed  student finances even closer to the breaking point.   Thankfully, the American Rescue Plan not only delivers short-term  relief but clears the way for long-term relief for American students by  saying: When we forgive your debt, you don't have to pay taxes on it.   American students collectively bear more than $1.7 trillion in  student debt. When you think of young people and they are starting out  their lives, and there is so much excitement and enthusiasm, and then  they have $1.7 trillion of debt on their shoulders weighting them down,  that is not the American way of sunny optimism and can-do. This system  sprung out of control in many ways. Going after the for-profit  colleges, making sure they don't take advantage, is one way we are  trying to curtail it. But for the students who have this debt, future  actions won't do any good in terms of changing the way we finance  colleges and how we deal with the for-profits. The best way is  canceling $50,000 in student debt, and the good news is that the ARP  makes sure no taxes are owed on any of that cancellation.   So no matter how their team performs during March Madness this  weekend, the American Rescue Plan gives every student something to  cheer about.   Go Syracuse.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, just a word about the history-making  nomination that was just approved by the Senate. We have now made  history twice in the last few minutes. We have made history twice  because we have nominated the first Native American Secretary of the  Interior and the first Native American Cabinet official in American  history.   The confirmation of Deb Haaland is amazing. It is a huge step  forward, and now it creates a government that more embodies the full  richness and diversity of this country. We have known for so long the  Native American community was treated badly, and we have a long way to  go but we have begun with the ARP. And now with the approval of Deb  Haaland to be the Secretary of the Interior, we are moving forward, and  she will do a great job as Interior Secretary. She represents a  turnaround because the Trump administration did more to undermine the  relationship between the Federal Government and Tribes than has been  done in a long time. Deb Haaland will reverse that and move much  further along. So we are proud of what the Senate has done.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to legislative session.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session to  consider Calendar No. 37.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to legislative session.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session to  consider Calendar No. 17.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory quorum calls  for the cloture motions filed today, March 15, be waived.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  resume legislative session for a period of morning business, with  Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  now proceed to the en bloc consideration of the following Senate  resolutions, which were submitted earlier today: S. Res. 110, S. Res.  111, S. Res. 112, and S. Res. 113.    I ask unanimous consent that the resolutions be agreed  to; that the preambles, where applicable, be agreed to; and that the  motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table, all  en bloc.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m., Tuesday,  March 16; that following the prayer and pledge, the morning hour be  deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the  time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day,  and morning business be closed; that upon conclusion of morning  business, the Senate proceed to executive session and resume  consideration of the nomination of Isabella Guzman to be Administrator  of the Small Business Administration; further, that the cloture motion  with respect to the Guzman nomination ripen at 12 noon; finally, that  the Senate recess following the cloture vote until 2:15 p.m. to allow  for the weekly caucus meetings.    For information of the Senators, we expect three  rollcall votes during Tuesday's session of the Senate in relation to  the Guzman and Tai nominations.                            ____________________     Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the  [[Page S1530]]  previous order, following the remarks of Senator Ernst.    I yield the floor.
