 Mr. President, as I stated repeatedly before the  Presidential election of this past year, we stood, and continue to  stand, at a very pivotal time in our Nation's history.   After 8 years of using the judicial and regulatory systems to push  through its legislative agenda, the balance of power had shifted from  what our Founders intended. Our Founders intended the Congress to make  the laws and write the laws, the executive branch to implement the  laws, and the judiciary to be guardians of the Constitution, not to  make the laws.   That is why we said that the next President of the United States,  whether they be Democrat or Republican, would have the opportunity to  fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court, following the Biden rule--the  edict that there wouldn't be a confirmation hearing for a Supreme Court  nominee until after that year's Presidential election--to allow the  American people to make their decision, giving the American people a  say in the direction of this country for years to come. In return, they  have given us this nominee.   It is with great pride that I rise today to talk about the nominee  today--a fellow Coloradan, Judge Neil Gorsuch, President Trump's  nominee to the Supreme Court. Judge Gorsuch comes to the Court with  that unique western perspective that the Presiding Officer and I share.  Our States of Utah and Colorado obviously like to see that western  perspective shared at the Tenth Circuit Court, where it is housed in  the West, but at every level of our courts and to the Supreme Court-- adding to Justice Kennedy's background and to others who share that  same perspective and history in the Supreme Court.   Born in Denver, Judge Gorsuch is a fourth-generation Coloradan,  coming from a long line of individuals who have dedicated their life to  service not only to the State of Colorado but to the Nation. His  mother, Ann Gorsuch, served in the Colorado House of Representatives  and, during the Reagan administration, she was the first female  Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. His grandfather,  John Gorsuch, founded one of Denver's largest law firms, Gorsuch  Kirgis, where both he and Neil's father, Dave, practiced throughout the  firm's successful 60-year-old history. His stepfather, Robert Buford,  was a former speaker of the Colorado House of Representatives who went  on to become the head of the Bureau of Land Management.   Judge Gorsuch is also one of our country's brightest legal minds,  with a sterling reputation, and significant experience as a Federal  judge and a private litigator. He has impeccable academic credentials  and is a widely respected legal scholar. He received his bachelor's  degree from Columbia University, graduated from Harvard Law School, and  was a Marshall scholar at Oxford University, where he obtained a  doctorate in legal philosophy.   Of course, I cannot forget the summer he spent at the University of  Colorado as well. Judge Gorsuch clerked for two Supreme Court  justices--Byron White, a Colorado native as well. In fact, in his  comments last night after the announcement of his nomination, Judge  Gorsuch mentioned that he worked for the only Coloradan to serve on the  Supreme Court and also the only leading rusher in the NFL to ever serve  on the Supreme Court.   He also clerked for Justice Anthony Kennedy, as well as for Judge  David Sentelle on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit.  Following his clerkships, Judge Gorsuch went into private  [[Page S558]]  practice, eventually rising to the rank of partner in the elite  litigation law firm of Kellogg Huber, leaving practice in 2005 to serve  as a high-ranking official in the Bush administration Justice  Department. A year later, President George W. Bush nominated Gorsuch to  serve on the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals, a position for which he  was confirmed by a unanimous vote. I think it is very telling that not  only was he confirmed by a unanimous vote, but roughly 11 or 12 members  of the Democratic conference were there to vote for Judge Gorsuch.  There are people serving today who voted for Judge Gorsuch. I believe  SCOTUSblog recently reported that when Judge Gorsuch was nominated to  the Tenth Circuit Court, then, Neil Gorsuch's confirmation hearing was  sparsely attended. I believe it mentioned that only a few people  attended. I think Senator Lindsey Graham, our colleague from South  Carolina, was one of the Senators to attend his confirmation hearing. I  believe Senator Leahy, our colleague from Vermont, submitted questions  for the record. But as SCOTUSblog cited, very few people attended his  confirmation hearing because of the high caliber and high quality of  the nomination. He was introduced by my predecessor from Colorado, Ken  Salazar, and was praised from Senator Salazar's perspective for being  impartial, fair, and the having the kind of temperament that we need in  the circuit court.   Judge Gorsuch is an ardent faithful defender of the Constitution and  has the appropriate temperament, as then-Senator Salazar noted, to  serve on the Nation's highest Court. Of course, he was then talking  about the Tenth Circuit Court. Judge Gorsuch recognizes that the  judiciary isn't the place for social or constitutional experimentation,  and efforts to engage in such experimentation delegitimizes the Court.  He has said:         This overweening addiction to the courtroom as the place to       debate social policy is bad for the country and bad for the       judiciary. . . . As a society, we lose the benefit of the       give-and-take of the political process and the flexibility of       social experimentation that only the elected branches can       provide.    Here we see his understanding that certain debates are to take place  where debate is held by those elected directly by the people--in the  Congress.   Judge Gorsuch believes in the separation of powers as established by  our Founding Fathers in the Constitution. As he rightly stated, ``a  firm and independent judiciary is critical to a well-functioning  democracy,'' understanding the value of three branches of government,  the value of an independent judiciary, understanding that there are  certain things dedicated exclusively to the judiciary, to the  legislative branch, and to the executive.   Judge Gorsuch is not an ideologue. He is a mainstream jurist who  follows the law as written and doesn't try to supplant it with his  personal policy preferences. He said: ``Personal politics or policy  preferences have no useful role in judging; regular and healthy doses  of self-skepticism and humility about one's own abilities and  conclusions always do.''   Judge Gorsuch understands the advantage of democratic institutions  and the special authority and legitimacy that come from the consent of  the government. He said: ``Judges must allow the elected branches of  government to flourish and citizens, through their elected  representatives, to make laws appropriate to the facts and  circumstances of the day.''   Judge Gorsuch appreciates the rule of law and respects the considered  judgment of those who came before him. He said:         Precedent is to be respected and honored. It is not       something to be diminished or demeaned.    This morning, I had the opportunity to meet with Judge Gorsuch--of  course, knowing him from Colorado and the town of Boulder, where he  lives today, and also where I received my law degree. We spent a lot of  time talking about our favorite passions in Colorado, whether it is  fly-fishing, whether it is paddle-boarding. Of course, he spends a lot  of time out on the Boulder Reservoir, enjoying recreation--just like  every other person in Boulder does and every other person in Colorado  does--as somebody who understands the great outdoors. We talked about  the rule of law. We talked about the separation of powers, his concern  over originalism and textualism, and following in the footsteps of  other great Justices on the Supreme Court.   We talked about something he said last night when his name was put  forward for nomination by President Trump. We talked about a statement  he made to this effect: If a judge likes every opinion that they have  written, every decision that they have reached, they are probably a bad  judge. I think this goes to his insistence that, as a judge, you must  put your personal beliefs, your personal policies aside to rule as the  rule of law requires and to rule as the Constitution and the statutes  require.   We discussed in our meeting decisions he made of which he didn't like  the outcome but believed that the rule of law required a certain  outcome--whether it was a felon who possessed a handgun or whether the  Federal Government had misspoken to the accused and he believed that  the government had done the accused wrong.   While Judge Gorsuch personally believed that perhaps he would have  liked to have found a guilty decision or agreed with a guilty decision,  he couldn't do it because of the standards that were applied in the  case--the grammatical gravity that had to be ignored in order to reach  the conclusion the lower court had reached.   His ability to put personal opinions aside, I think, is what makes  him an ideal candidate for the U.S. Supreme Court. Over the coming days  and months, we are going to have many opportunities to talk about the  qualities of Judge Gorsuch, but we have already heard many people  complain that perhaps they didn't pay enough attention to Judge Gorsuch  10 years ago. They talked about their concern, this newfound concern  that was not available--that apparently wasn't there 10 years ago when  this Senate unanimously supported Judge Gorsuch.   I have even heard complaints that they didn't like the way that his  nomination was announced--a complaint about how the President announced  the nomination. Those are the kinds of concerns we are hearing about  Judge Gorsuch today because they didn't like the way he was announced.   We are going to have a lot of opportunity to talk about his  temperament, those things he believes are important as a judge, those  things he believes are important to make decisions. I look forward to  having a conversation about what I believe is a brilliant legal mind-- someone of a brilliant legal mind, someone with a sterling reputation,  someone who has been known as a feeder judge of clerks to the highest  Court in the land, someone who rules on the law and not on his personal  beliefs, someone who believes in the Constitution and not in the role  of legislator from the bench.   I am grateful I had this opportunity to support a Coloradan, a man of  the West, to Nation's highest Court, and I look forward to working to  place Judge Gorsuch as Associate Justice to the U.S. Supreme Court.   Mr. President, I yield back my time.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  be in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak  therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I understand an appointment was made  during the adjournment of the Senate, and I ask it be stated for the  Record.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that not  withstanding the resolution of the Senate of January 24, 1901, the  traditional reading of Washington's Farewell Address take place on  Monday, February 27, 2017, at a time to be determined by the majority  leader in consultation with the Democratic leader.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 40, submitted earlier  today.    I further ask unanimous consent that the resolution be  agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or  debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 41, submitted earlier  today.    I further ask unanimous consent that the resolution be  agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or  debate.    Mr. President, I understand there is a bill at the desk,  and I ask for its first reading.    I now ask for a second reading and, in order to place  the bill on the calendar under provisions of rule XIV, I object to my  own request.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 11 a.m.,  Thursday, February 2; that following the prayer and pledge, the morning  hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date,  and the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the  day; further, that following leader remarks, the Senate resume  consideration of H.J. Res. 38; finally, that there be 6 hours of debate  remaining, equally divided in the usual form.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order, following the remarks of Senator Whitehouse.
