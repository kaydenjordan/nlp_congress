 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   I rise in strong support of H.R. 582, the Raise the Wage Act. It has  been more than a decade since working people got a raise in this  country. Americans are working harder than ever, and labor productivity  is overperforming expectations.   However, the profit of this increased productivity is not being felt  in the checkbooks of working people. In fact, American workers have  experienced a 20 percent pay cut in real income due to inflation and  the government's failure to raise wages.   It is unconscionable that people working full time in the wealthiest  nation in the history of the world are unable to afford basic  essentials or live in poverty. That is why it is critical that we pass  the Raise the Wage Act.   Here are the facts: The bill will increase wages for nearly 34  million American workers. About 28 percent of workers in my district in  Rhode Island will get a raise of about $2,100 a year. It will lift 3.1  million Americans out of poverty, including 600,000 children, and it  will stimulate economic growth. And  [[Page H5931]]  we know that when workers earn more, they spend more money.   While the top 1 percent of Americans continue to amass Gilded Age  amounts of wealth, working men and women have been left behind. It is  time to reaffirm our commitment to hardworking Americans and pass this  critical legislation. Americans deserve a raise, and that is what this  bill does.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter signed by many LGBTQ  organizations and human rights organizations in strong support of this  legislation.                                                      July 16, 2019.        Dear Member of Congress: We, the undersigned organizations,       write to express our strong support for the Raise the Wage       Act (H.R. 582). As lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and       queer (LGBTQ) and allied organizations, we believe raising       the minimum wage is a critical LGBTQ issue. Raising the       federal minimum wage would benefit LGBTQ people by helping to       reduce poverty and increase stability and economic security       for LGBTQ people and their families.        Because of discrimination in employment, housing,       education, and other areas, LGBTQ individuals are more likely       to be jobless, homeless, and poor than the general       population. Nearly 40 million workers, including LGBTQ       people, would receive increased wages from the Act. In light       of the disproportionate rates of poverty among LGBTQ people,       passing this measure is a critical priority for our       community.        The Raise the Wage Act would raise the federal minimum wage       to $8.55 this year and increase it gradually over the next       six years until it reaches $15 an hour in 2025. After 2025,       the minimum wage would be adjusted annually to keep pace with       growth in the typical worker's wages. In addition, the Act       would phase out the outdated subminimum wage for tipped       workers, which has been stagnant at $2.13 since 1991. It       would also sunset the ability for employers to pay a       subminimum wage to workers with disabilities and phase out       the subminimum wage for workers under the age of 20.        An increase in the federal minimum wage would help the       LGBTQ community, especially its most marginalized members.       Incomes would rise above poverty level for nearly 30,000       people in same-sex relationships. Raising the minimum wage to       $15 would decrease poverty by almost 50% among female same-      sex couples and by 35% among male same-sex couples.        Transgender people would be particularly impacted by this       bill. Almost one-third of transgender people live in poverty,       which is more than twice the rate of the U.S. general       population.        The bill would also have a profound impact on LGBTQ youth,       who make up between 30% and 40% of homeless youth. 47% of       these LGBTQ homeless youth are persons of color. Since 55% of       homeless LGBTQ youth were forced out by their parents or ran       away because of their sexual orientation or gender identity,       more than 50% of LGBTQ homeless youth remain homeless for       longer periods of time than non-LGBTQ homeless youth. Raising       the wage and phasing out the subminimum wage for workers       under age 20 will help reduce homelessness among LGBTQ youth       by helping them afford housing and achieve economic security       independent of their families.        Additionally, the Act will have enormous impacts on LGBTQ       people of color and LGBTQ women. 37% of the LGBTQ community       identify as people of color. Under the Act, 40% of Black       workers and 34% of Latino/a workers will benefit. Women       account for nearly 56% of the workers benefiting from an       increased minimum wage. Women also account for \2/3\ of the       country's tipped workers, who are more than twice as likely       to live in poverty than the rest of the workforce. LBTQ women       are more likely than their non-LBTQ counterparts to receive       public assistance, be unemployed, and be near or under the       poverty level.        Critics of the bill have argued against raising the federal       minimum wage, proposing instead that minimum wages should be       established by region. However, a minimum wage of $15 by 2025       is not unrealistic in any part of the U.S. In addition, rural       communities have a strong incentive to support the Act       because they are experiencing a housing affordability crisis       in part due to flat incomes for low- and moderate-income       workers in those communities.        Additionally, the Act's plan to phase in the $15 wage over       six years allows for lower-wage states and regions to adjust       to the new wage. Opponents of the bill also contend that       small businesses do not benefit from raising the wage.       However, 61% of American small business owners support       raising the minimum wage.        For these reasons, we support the Raise the Wage Act and       urge you to consider the enormous benefits the bill will       bring to the LGBTQ community. LGBTQ workers need jobs that       allow them to have security and take care of themselves and       their families.

Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to support S.J. Res. 36 and the other measures  related to arms sales being considered this afternoon, which will  prevent three sets of arms sales to Saudi Arabia and the UAE without  undergoing the proper congressional notification process.   We are here today because rather than come and make their case to  Congress, the administration invented a phony emergency to bypass the  legal process for approving arms sales. There is no justification for  this decision, other than the administration knew that these sales  would be met with scrutiny from Congress and didn't want to deal with  it.   Well, they were right. Congress is concerned about these proposed  sales, and we should not sit back and allow the administration to  continue with the charade of claiming an emergency exemption for them.  I am glad that these measures of disapproval have bipartisan support  and have already passed the Republican-led Senate. I urge all of my  colleagues to support them today.   The administration briefed this body on Iran just days before the  supposed emergency was declared and never mentioned an emergency. We  are supposed to believe that, within a matter of days, the situation  escalated so quickly that they were forced to bypass Congress. Most of  the weapons included in the emergency sales are offensive weapons, and  much of the sale will be delivered months or years from now, further  evidence that no emergency exists.   The egregious and legally questionable move to put more weapons into  the hands of regimes who are responsible for perpetrating horrific  civilian casualties in Yemen comes as no surprise from an  administration that has cozied up to the Saudi Crown Prince, even as we  have credible evidence that he and his government are responsible for  the cold-blooded murder of an American resident and journalist.   Just because you don't like the process doesn't mean you get to  ignore it. This action has implications far beyond the current sale. If  Congress doesn't reassert our proper role in the process, we risk  giving up the authority in the arms sale process entirely.   This isn't and shouldn't be a partisan issue. It is our job, as  Congress, to represent the American people in matters of war. If we let  this action go without a strong congressional response, the  repercussions will be wide-ranging and longstanding.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support these resolutions of  disapproval and block these arms sales once and for all.
