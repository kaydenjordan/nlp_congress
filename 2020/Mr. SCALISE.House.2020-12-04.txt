 Mr. Speaker, I rise for the purpose of inquiring to the  majority leader the schedule for next week.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), my  friend and the majority leader of the House.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman.   There are a few items relating to legislation that I want to bring up  with the gentleman, but before that, I did want to mention that it is  my understanding that the floor director for the majority leader, Ms.  Shuwanza Goff--the last thing I would want to do is embarrass her here  on the House floor, but it is my understanding she may be leaving.    Mr. Speaker, I would be happy to yield time to her if  she would like to deny that rumor, but while that may create some  issues, I would like to say that, if this is the last time that we do  this colloquy before the end of this year, it has been a true pleasure  to work with Shuwanza Goff.   My whole staff has enjoyed working with her, and especially on those  areas where we agree--the CARES Act and USMCA come to mind as recent  major accomplishments that this legislative body has done together,  Republicans and Democrats--and she, I know, has been that conduit who  works with our staff on the Republican side. We considered it a true  joy to work with her. She doesn't schedule every bill I ask her to  schedule, but I will blame that on the majority leader, not on  Shuwanza.   Mr. Speaker, if I can, in all seriousness, say, it has truly been a  treat and a joy, and she is one of the people who makes this place work  when it does work.   We can always talk about the things that we would like to achieve  that we can't, but there are many important things we achieve, like  those important pieces of legislation I talked about and many others  that don't get that same kind of attention, but they wouldn't happen  without the work and the great leadership that Shuwanza has  demonstrated here. She will be missed here, and I just wanted to  mention that.   I know the gentleman feels probably even stronger, because she has  worked for him for the whole time I have been in leadership, but, I  think, going back to maybe 2008.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, I will give this assurance to the majority  leader, that if you are looking for a replacement, I would be happy to  provide recommendations and even participate in the interview process,  if that would be helpful to the gentleman from Maryland.  [[Page H6844]]         I think the generosity probably ends there with today's  colloquy. I am sure we will have that opportunity next week to have a  longer conversation, but I truly do want to pass that on to Shuwanza,  and not just on behalf of myself, but on behalf of the minority leader,  Mr. McCarthy, and his staff, as well as mine, and all of us in  leadership who get to work with her.   Mr. Speaker, I do want to mention, on the schedule next week, one of  the items that I know we have worked on together and talked about that  I believe the gentleman has scheduled for next week is S. 578, which is  the ALS Disability Insurance Access Act, something that we have worked  on, a number of these items, for people with ALS.   The Steve Gleason Act was one of those items we worked on a few years  ago, passed to help people with ALS, and has been a tremendous,  tremendous benefit to people struggling with ALS.   Steve Gleason is a constituent and a dear friend, somebody whom we  have worked with on many things. He received earlier this year--it  seems like years ago, but just January of this year, he was the  recipient of the Congressional Gold Medal, and deservedly so.   He and I were communicating earlier this week about this legislation,  which I am a cosponsor of, and I just want to thank the gentleman for  scheduling that for the floor next week.   One of those areas, as you were talking about earlier, that might not  get a lot of attention but an issue that both Republicans and Democrats  have worked on is to help people with ALS who, right now, under current  law, even after the diagnosis with ALS--as we know, it is just a  devastating diagnosis--have to wait 5 months to get the normal benefits  that they are entitled to. And time is very, very critical to people  with ALS. This eliminates that 5-month gap where they would have to  wait, one of those additional occasions where it takes an act of  Congress to fix this.   The Senate acted, and quickly, now, the House will be acting to  address this deficiency that needs to be fixed. I think you will see  both sides come together with a very large vote, but I thank the  gentleman for scheduling that for the floor next week.   I yield to the gentleman, if you have anything to add on that.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman.   Mr. Speaker, as relates to the schedule next week, as well as the  schedule we have had this week, I want to bring up a piece of  legislation that we have talked about here in this colloquy and in  other venues for months now, and that is the bill by Congressman  Chabot, H.R. 8265, which is the Paycheck Protection Program Extension  Act.   We have seen over these last few months our small businesses have  struggled tremendously. Some industries have done better during this  pandemic where they have seen increased sales for various reasons, but  we have mostly seen and heard from so many of those businesses and  industries that have been devastated, some harder than others, but so  many devastated to the point of bankruptcy. Daily, we see stories of  businesses that closed their doors for good.   Mr. Speaker, in the State of New York alone, it was reported that  one-third of all small businesses--one-third--will never open again. We  came together to do the CARES Act, to pass that lifeline to so many  small businesses--saved probably 50 million jobs in America, saved  millions of small businesses--but it expired; and when it expired, we  learned a lot more about where our economy was at that time.   When we passed it, it was at the very beginning of the pandemic. We  now saw over those months which businesses were doing better, which  weren't, and came back in September with a piece of legislation that  would free up money that is not going to have to be borrowed, money  that is actually sitting in that account, frozen, $137 billion that we  already appropriated. But the program expired so it can't be used  anymore unless we change the law.   So, we are not talking about creating a new program. We are talking  about going back to a program that was maybe one of the most successful  things that we have done to help people in need--not just those small  businesses, but the millions, 50-plus million people whose livelihoods  depend on those jobs.   The bill was brought forward, had a lot of bipartisan interest, but  for various reasons hasn't been scheduled on this House floor. And  there were reports that maybe it was tied to waiting on the election or  whatever other things.   In fact, the Speaker of the House, just today, made a comment that  one of the reasons a certain relief package bill wasn't brought to the  House floor is because she was waiting on a ``new President.'' I hope  that was a quote that was made out of context or maybe needs to be  revised.                                time  1330    There are millions of people that are literally facing the  elimination of their livelihoods, and we have a bill that, if it was  put on the floor today, yesterday, or September, when we first had this  conversation, there would be hundreds of thousands of businesses still  open today that are now bankrupt, that will never open again. Every day  we wait, more businesses don't reopen.   Clearly, we are negotiating to try to get an agreement on bigger  issues. We are not there. We weren't there last month; we weren't there  the month before. The Senate has tried to take up votes on things. It  wasn't the Republicans; it was the Democrats that blocked those bills  coming up. This, by the way, was one of those in the package that would  have been voted on by the Senate, if not for Senate Democrats blocking  even the debate on the Senate floor. So they never had that debate.   On this floor, just today, we saw a bill to legalize marijuana. You  saw items in there where it would give additional money to people in  the marijuana industry. This is something that Congress, I am sure,  will continue to debate.   But there is a pandemic where, today, we have businesses that are  shutting their doors. Tomorrow, businesses will go bankrupt forever,  small businesses. We can help them. Not with a new program that we need  to negotiate the details over, but something we already did that was so  highly successful that we have a track record to show what it can do.   Our small banks, local community banks, were part of that process and  are ready to go again. Again, we don't need to reinvent the wheel here.  This is an existing program that has got existing, remaining money, but  the program is frozen and expired. This bill just renews it and could  pass on the suspension calendar, and it still hasn't been brought up.   While we are negotiating other things, why not release this hostage  and let this bill pass. It could have been done today. It wasn't a lack  of time. When we are debating legalizing marijuana instead of saving  small businesses, that is a misplaced priority of this Congress. We  should have come together months ago. September 16, it was introduced.  September 17, I brought it up to the majority leader at this colloquy.  The following week brought it up again.   Then we filed a discharge petition. You had, I think, 23 Democrats  sign a letter saying they would sign that discharge petition if we  didn't get a bipartisan agreement, recognizing that the Heroes Act is  not a bipartisan agreement. Unfortunately, not one of those Members who  signed the letter saying  [[Page H6845]]  they would sign the discharge have signed the discharge. Talk is cheap  around here.   Livelihoods are being lost. Businesses are shuttering for good. Why  can't this bill be scheduled for the floor while we work on the other  things that we are not in agreement on? This is something we are in  agreement on. But it won't be scheduled for the floor.   Maybe we can get an agreement to schedule that Monday when we are  coming in at 2 o'clock to vote on other items. This would be something  that would get 400-plus votes, if it was just scheduled.   I yield to the gentleman.    Let me remind the gentleman that in the CARES Act, we  addressed many of those issues that the gentleman already brought up,  starting with the States.   In fact, I don't know of a single State in this country who has spent  all of the money we sent them. Educational opportunities for schools to  reopen safely and educate kids are being denied in some places but not  in others, but it is not from a lack of money. There is not a single  school system I have heard from, where we sent them the money--and by  the way, they still have millions, and in some cases, billions of those  dollars sitting in their account, idle, that can be used today to  safely reopen schools.   If the State chooses not to do it or if the school system chooses not  to do it, that is on them. But they are denying those kids  opportunities. We are seeing report after report, scientific studies,  the American Academy of Pediatrics, talking about the damage that is  being done to our young children by being denied the opportunity to go  back to school in classroom and learn. It is devastating to those kids.   Suicides are up and opioid abuse is up, because of all of these  things, and it is the small businesses that are paying the biggest  price.   If you look, people that are getting unemployment insurance at the  State level--we did enhanced unemployment insurance for a period of  time, and in most cases we were paying people more money not to work  than they were making before they lost their job.   What they ask me is not that they want to stay on unemployment. They  want to go back to work. They want their business to be alive when they  go back to work. But if a small business closes for good, the cost to  us is going to be dramatically higher.   If we can right now throw that lifeline, again, to those businesses-- not with a new program, not with things that we don't agree on, like  $900 billion to bail out failed States, which is the Heroes Act. We  already spent hundreds of billions of dollars that we gave to States.  Like I said, I think every single State has some of that money left.  Some have billions of dollars of that money left.   So the idea that we are going to hold up relief to small business,  who are closing every day, hundreds of thousands--a third of every  small business in the State of New York is gone for good. How many more  need to die before this problem is recognized by this Congress?    So those States are sitting on money, and the gentleman wants to hold  up relief to small businesses to give another  [[Page H6846]]  $900 billion to bail out States, not for the COVID damage, but the  problems they had before. That is what the Heroes Act disagreement was  about. We agreed on giving States money. They still have some of that  money, and it can be used to reopen schools safely, still today.   What is not there right now is relief for those small businesses. So  when you look at all of these different things--the vaccine, they are  not waiting on approving a vaccine based on more money coming in. We  put money in the CARES Act, and President Trump spent it effectively on  Operation Warp Speed to get us to the point where we have not one, but  two--Pfizer and Moderna--ready to go.   The FDA is about to approve two different vaccines, and it is being  mass produced today. We are not waiting on money to mass produce it.  The Department of Defense is actually involved in helping distribute  it. Airlines have already been contracted to get it out. Some need to  be air-conditioned more than others. All of that is put in place.   If we need more money, we will come together and get more money. But  a vaccine is not waiting on us to send them more money. We need to get  it out. We need the FDA to follow their process, which they are doing.  They are the gold standard in the world for approving vaccines, and it  is unheard of, in the history of mankind, for a virus, that we didn't  even know of until a year and two days ago in the world, to now be on  the brink of not one, but two FDA-approved vaccines. That is happening  because of what we did coming together with the CARES Act and then  President Trump's Operation Warp Speed.   These aren't items that are waiting on our relief. What is waiting is  relief for small businesses.   Now, the Heroes Act, again, it was a partisan exercise, not because  it was mostly like the CARES Act. It was very different from the CARES  Act. In the Heroes Act, there are billions of dollars in that bill to  give checks to people here illegally. That wasn't part of any  agreement. It wasn't in the CARES Act. That is new policy that is not  going to be signed into law.   If you want to negotiate and hold small businesses hostage on that,  we may never get relief for small businesses. But that was one of the  items in the Heroes Act where we had no agreement.                                time  1345    But the areas where we had agreement, can we at least agree to pass  the things we have agreement on?   And what did we have more agreement on than anything? The PPP, proven  to be so successful that literally every day we hear from small  businesses that say they would not be alive today if not for the PPP.  But we also hear from small businesses every day who are about to  close.   Some States are talking about shutting their whole State down again.   We know that is going to lead to businesses that will never come  back. And we have a bill ready to go that would get massive bipartisan  support without a new dime of money, money sitting frozen in an account  that would help those small businesses. The criteria is you have to  have at least 25 percent loss.   So your small businesses that are doing well today--again, we know  there are some that are doing better today than they were a year ago,  but we also know some are about to close for good. We can help them,  not with new policy that we are not in agreement on. That is where the  negotiations are continuing to go back and forth on.   But if there is something we all agree on, do we really need to hold  that hostage, when that means that many of those businesses will never  come back?   We could have done this in September. It was brought up in September.  It is not a new item.   How many thousands of businesses died from the day that that bill was  introduced to today and will die again between now and Monday?   It can be put on the schedule Monday. It is not going to stop the  negotiations on the other things. There are other things that we are  both in agreement on that aren't part of that bill. Bring that as a  stand-alone. Let's bring each of those items that we are in agreement  on.   But the idea that we hold everything hostage to things that aren't  going to happen, hundreds of billions to failed States, giving checks  to people who aren't here legally, is that really a priority?   Is that really the things we are getting called on every day?   The folks that are on unemployment want to be able to go back to  their job. If the company is dead and gone, there will be nothing to go  back to. And so we are working on so many items that we are in  agreement on. We have given money to our health experts to continue to  focus on the virus, to continue to get the vaccine, and we may have  another two--could be four--vaccines by the end of this year. That is  something we all ought to applaud because of what we did when we came  together.   But here is an area where we already came together. It was so  successful that that money now is frozen, and those businesses that did  well are still doing well. The ones that aren't will or will not be  alive in a month from now, based on whether or not we confront this. It  is not new policy. It is something we already agreed on, and something  we already celebrated as a success. Let's do that one more time while  we negotiate on the things we are in disagreement with.   Mr. Speaker, I would just suggest that, and I yield to the gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman, too. In terms of our  children, we know sending them back to school safely, the protocols are  out there. Child nutrition programs are administered in our schools.  That is not happening because the kids are in those systems where they  are not safely reopened. Those kids aren't able to get the school lunch  programs.    I yield to the gentleman from Maryland.    Mr. Speaker, those schools already have access to the  $150 billion that we sent the States that they haven't even already  spent. If I gave you money to do something and you haven't even used  all that money, you can't use that as an excuse for not doing it, and  saying: I am waiting for you to give me more money, when you still have  money remaining.   And I agree with the gentleman on the school lunch program. The thing  there is that we don't give a supplement to schools in normal times.  These are not normal times. But in normal times, schools feed kids at  lunch with the existing budgets they have. They don't wait for us to  send extra money to them to feed the kids.   If they are not educating the kids in the classroom, they are still  taking that money. I haven't seen them rebate the money to those  families in communities.   So what are they doing with that money?   If you bring the kids back and educate them safely in the classroom,  which the protocols allow for in any community, high risk, low risk, if  you have got a high outbreak, there are different ways to handle each  community. The CDC has given them guidelines. The Academy of Pediatrics  have given them guidelines. Some school systems have chosen not to  follow them and leave the kids at home, but they are still taking the  money.                                time  1400    There has never been a better argument for school choice and letting  parents choose. If one school system is willing to educate your child  safely and the other is not, why shouldn't you be able to take that  money and send your child to the place that is willing to do it safely  for you?   It is not a question of the money. It is a question of the will to do  it.   But when we talk about those businesses and what was in the CARES Act  and what wasn't, the CARES Act was not the Heroes Act. I think the  gentleman knows some of the differences. I will tell the gentleman a  few of the differences.   What is in the Heroes Act that is not in the CARES Act that we all  voted for was letting thousands, an unknown number of thousands, of  criminals out of prison. I have never gotten a straight answer on how  many thousands of criminals would be let out of prison or why that even  needs to be in a COVID relief package. But that is in the Heroes Act,  which was not in the CARES Act, and we are completely in disagreement  on that.   Why it hasn't been dropped out, who knows, but that is a choice the  majority made. Again, sending direct checks, billions of dollars in  direct checks, to people that are here illegally was not in the CARES  Act; it is in the Heroes Act. If we wanted to make it bipartisan, drop  those things out. But they haven't been dropped out by the majority,  and here we have a program that we agree on.   But in terms of the small businesses, the small businesses are dying  on the vine because some States are giving  [[Page H6848]]  mixed signals, changing rules, going backward, forward. In States like  California, they are saying you can operate as a liquor store or as a  strip club but not as a church. Even the Supreme Court stepped in and  said that is ludicrous and that you can't keep doing it.   But you go to New York and so many of these States where they are  saying for safety protocols you have to shut down and you can't go to a  restaurant, and then you see the Governor of the State at a restaurant  without a mask. But you can't go. You see mayors in communities telling  businesses they can't stay open or it is not safe to have Thanksgiving  with your family, and you find out they are flying to other States to  have Thanksgiving with their family.   This blatant hypocrisy by some of these leaders who are telling you  that you have to live your life one way and they are living their lives  a different way, and hiding behind protocols that don't exist, that is  driving people nuts. The businesses are dying because of it.   The trust in government gets depleted in those places because they  are watching. And it is not isolated. I wish it was just once or twice.  I wish it was never going on. But it is over and over again, yesterday  and today another story comes out of a local leader or a governor  telling you that you can't do something, and they are doing it. They  didn't think they were going to get caught doing it. My God, that has  to end. The hypocrisy has to end.   Let's get back to saying things that make sense, working with the  protocols, working with the experts and the scientists. But don't use a  scientist selectively and say something that is not really true and  you, yourself, know it is not true because you are doing it. That is  what some of those folks are doing. It is driving people nuts, and it  is driving their businesses under. They will never come back.   Those families that are struggling and the kids that are going to  have trouble eating are having that trouble because the businesses that  their families work for are being bankrupted by crazy, radical policies  that have to end. We can help them in the short term. We ought to help  them in the short term.   Some of the stuff I mentioned that we are not in agreement on ought  to get dropped out. But in the meantime, don't hold them hostage. Let's  bring those things that we agree on to the floor and save the  businesses that we can because every day we don't, more will never come  back.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, if we wanted to pass another CARES Act-type  piece of legislation, as we have seen in both other CARES Act bills,  you have a lot of willingness and interest on this side of the aisle,  which was there on both of those votes. Clearly, there are things in  Heroes that there is no bipartisan consensus on.   So, our party is willing and ready to go another round on those items  we agree on, and not months from now, not months ago, as it should have  been done. It should be done today. Hopefully, it will be done when we  return. I would be happy to work with the gentleman on those items.   If the gentleman has nothing else, then I would be happy to yield  back.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
