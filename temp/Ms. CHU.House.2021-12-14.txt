 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of today's bill  to help monitor and combat Islamophobia.   Targeting someone because of their religion is discriminatory and it  is dangerous. Yet, across the world anti-Muslim prejudice is spreading.  As a result, innocent people are being attacked, their mosques  vandalized, and their rights curtailed. All of this is the deliberate  result of anti-Muslim fearmongering, often from the highest levels of  government.   The violence and repression would not be possible without the  propaganda that paints all Muslims as dangerous. We have seen that even  in our own country, where a lie that Muslims are dangerous was used to  justify a Muslim ban. This hate speech continues to echo in the halls  of Congress today, even against our own Members of Congress. This must  stop.   The more these hateful lies spread, the more people will follow the  words of their leaders and take action, leading to more violence like  the shootings in Christchurch and around the world.   With this bill we can help stop the spread of this Islamophobia and  stop the violence these words cause. Let's ensure that everybody,  regardless of race or religion, can feel safe in this country and  around the world for being who they are.
