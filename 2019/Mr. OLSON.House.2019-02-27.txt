 Madam Speaker, we all know an iconic Texas song: ``The  stars at night are big and bright, deep in the heart of Texas.''   The sky of Texas has a new star, the brightest star ever. Her name is  Marlee Hope Pack. She is glowing right beside me.   After a courageous fight with childhood cancer, God called Marlee  home on February 23. Marlee's cancer would not be stopped. Her dad,  Bill, kept asking Marlee: What is your wish with Make-A-Wish?   After a few weeks, sweet Marlee answered: ``Dad, if I have to think  about it this hard, I don't need a wish.''   Marlee turned Make-A-Wish into make a gift. She opened Marlee's Bear  Workshop and partnered with Build-A-Bear to give kids with cancer teddy  bears and hope.   Thank you, Bill and Shelly, and all who loved Marlee for giving us  such a special person. She made our world better.                            ____________________
