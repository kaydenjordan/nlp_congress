 Mr. Chair, I missed rollcall 130 due to distraction.  Had I been present, I would have voted ``aye'' on rollcall No. 130.    Madam Speaker, the President is once again using the  Department of Defense to advance the far-left agenda and pro-abortion  policies.   The new policy to give servicemembers and their families paid  administrative leave for up to 3 weeks and travel reimbursement to  obtain out-of-state elective abortions is yet another extreme example.   The law is clear and vetted. No Federal funds are to be used for  elective abortions. The military mission is equally clear: to be a  lethal force to defend the innocents and to defeat those who would do  them harm. This flies in the face of that mission.   I call on the President to reverse this policy, which is in violation  of law and counter to the military mission.                            ____________________
