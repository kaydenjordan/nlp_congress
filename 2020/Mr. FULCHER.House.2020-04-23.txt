 Madam Speaker, a month ago we stood on the floor and we  authorized a $2.2 trillion stimulus package. Today, we will authorize  another $480 billion to keep it going. By law, the U.S. economy is  mostly shut down. As long as that is the case, we have an obligation to  facilitate relief. So with anxiety, I will support an extension of the  Paycheck Protection Program.   Madam Speaker, most of the Members have not been here the last month.  We have been working, but we have been working from home due to health  concerns. And by most of Congress not being here, that means only a few  negotiate the deals, and these are very big deals.   Madam Speaker, our job is here. No more bypassing of regular order.  This virus may threaten our health, but when all of us aren't involved  in the work of Congress, our Republic is threatened.
