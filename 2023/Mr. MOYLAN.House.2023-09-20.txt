 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to share the introduction of  my bill, the CHILD Act of 2023.   This bill seeks to amend chapter 77, section 1591 of title 18, United  States Code, by raising the mandatory minimum years of imprisonment for  engaging in the trafficking of any person under the age of 18.   The current law states that if convicted of trafficking a victim  under the age of 14, there is a minimum of 15 years imprisonment. If  convicted of trafficking a victim between the ages of 14 and 17, the  minimum sentence is 10 years imprisonment.   Child sex trafficking remains a pressing issue in the United States.  In 2021, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children  received over 17,200 reports of child sex trafficking in all 50 U.S.  States, affecting every type of community, including cities, rural  areas, and Tribal land.   According to an NCMEC report from 2021, out of the 25,000 missing  runaway children, 1 out of 6 are likely to be victims of sex  trafficking.   Offenders often target vulnerable children who are of lower income,  live in dangerous circumstances, and seek out better lives for  themselves. Victims come from all backgrounds and become trapped in a  never-ending cycle  [[Page H4417]]  of threats, abuse, false promises, isolation, shame, and debt.   These victims are deprived of something every child deserves--a  future.   If enacted, this legislation would make the sentence for traffickers  exploiting victims under the age of 18 the same regardless of their  age. A child is still a minor, and there should be no differentiation  at all.   It would also increase the minimum sentence to 25 years for those who  are convicted of child trafficking. This will convey the serious nature  of their crime and ensure that traffickers know that they will be  punished if they continue to exploit minors.   By enacting more stringent penalties, this bill aims to bring justice  for the victims and families affected by child trafficking and issues a  strong statement to traffickers, who leave a lifetime of scars on  innocent children.   My message is clear: Sex trafficking is a heinous crime that will not  be tolerated.   Current laws are too soft on these criminals, and I am committed to  ensuring stricter laws and harsher punishments to anyone who harms  innocent children.   Lastly, I urge my colleagues in Congress to support this crucial  piece of legislation to protect all children.   I also thank my co-leads--Congressman Don Davis, Congressman Buddy  Carter, Congresswoman Diana Harshbarger, Congressman Don Bacon, and  Congresswoman Amata Radewagen--for cosponsoring the CHILD Act of 2023.                            ____________________
