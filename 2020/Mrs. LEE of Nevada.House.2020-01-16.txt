 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 790, I  call up the joint resolution (H.J. Res. 76) providing for congressional  disapproval under chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, of the rule  submitted by the Department of Education relating to ``Borrower Defense  Institutional Accountability'', and ask for its immediate consideration  in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the joint resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and to insert extraneous material on H.J. Res. 76.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am here today for one reason: to ask that my  colleagues in this House stand with me to make clear to the American  people that we care more about defending students than enriching  predatory schools. That is what my joint resolution, H.J. Res. 76, is  all about.   In 1992 Congress added a rule known as borrower defense to the Higher  Education Act to give students a legal right to seek forgiveness on  their Federal student loans because of fraud by their schools.   Predatory school misconduct in the eighties was so rampant it was  painfully clear to Democrats, Republicans, and everyone in between that  we need protections in place for students who are scammed and cheated  by their institution, and that is just as true today.   Corinthian Colleges, ITT Tech, University of Phoenix, and Dream  Center--350,000 students have filed claims alleging they were defrauded  by these schools. They were lied to about the job prospects they would  get from these schools, they were lied to about the transferability of  their credits, and they were lied to about the quality of education  they would receive. The only thing they got was a useless degree and a  mountain of debt after these schools abruptly closed because of rampant  misconduct.   The most painful part is that these are mostly students from low- income communities, people of color, and veterans. These are Americans  we should be standing up for, not taking advantage of.   In 2016 the last administration created a new borrower defense rule  to streamline the process to help these students.   It sounds pretty good, right?   Not to Betsy DeVos. She then rewrote the borrower defense rule to  make it almost impossible for a defrauded student to get relief on  their student loans. Even in cases where schools clearly violated the  law, the burden of proof on the defrauded student is so absurdly  unrealistic that a student would need to hire a team of lawyers to have  a shot at proving intent and misconduct from the school.   But the point made by proponents of this borrower defense rule that  is most insulting is that the new rule saves taxpayer dollars. That is  simply false. The new rule severely weakens the early warning system  that ensures predatory schools, not taxpayers, cover the cost of debt  relief. As a result in the few cases where relief is rewarded under the  DeVos rule, taxpayers will be the ones to foot the bill. Beyond that,  the only reason you can say that this rule actually saves money is  because we are denying relief to every legitimately defrauded student.   Let me be clear: if Betty DeVos' 2019 borrower defense rule goes into  effect, more students will become victims of fraud with no way to climb  out of the hole that our government dug for them.   This puts my colleagues in Congress on the record. Members have a  choice to make, and if they choose to vote against this resolution,  then they will have to go back home and tell thousands of students,  veterans, and their constituents in their district that they choose to  be on the side of predatory schools over them.   I think the choice is clear.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman  from California (Mrs. Davis).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Levin).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Virginia (Mr. Scott).    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time I  have remaining.    Mr. Speaker, before I yield, I would like to  clarify for the record that this example that was just included by Ms.  Foxx was an example that was included in the rule in 2016, and in fact,  there were no claims filed under that example.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Oregon (Ms.  Bonamici).                                time  0945     Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from California (Mr. Takano).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I would like to, first, clarify the record that the 60 students who  filed claims in the past 20 years is because students didn't understand  they had the right to file those claims.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman from  Washington (Ms. Jayapal).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. Wild).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman  from Georgia (Mrs. McBath).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman  from Minnesota (Ms. Omar).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I would like to clarify that the comments that were just quoted were  on the proposed rule, and those issues were fixed.    I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Trone).    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time remains  on each side.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman  from Massachusetts (Mrs. Trahan).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman  from California (Ms. Waters).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Lowey).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman  from Michigan (Mrs. Dingell).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Levin).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro).    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time remains  on my side.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time  and would inquire through the Chair if my colleague has any remaining  speakers on her side.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, I would like to correct some misinformation  about the 2016 rule that my colleagues on the other side have stated  today.   First of all, the law, the Higher Education Act, entitles borrowers a  right to relief. This applies to all institutions, not just a few.   The reason the 2019 rule saves money is because meritorious claims  will be denied. Under this new rule, students will see only 3 percent  of their loans discharged, and predatory institutions will pay only 1  percent of their fraud.   The 2019 rule sets an impossibly high bar for students to prove  relief, inconsistent with State law.   The 2016 rule allowed for arbitration. It just banned predispute  arbitration and class action waivers.   The 2016 rule was closely negotiated with institutions, including  HBCUs, that struck a balance that was fair to institutions and  students.   The Department of Education predicts that by 2021 over 200,000  borrowers will face this type of fraud. This is not about borrowers in  the past; this is about borrowers moving forward. This number will only  continue to grow if we don't pass the reforms in the College  Affordability Act.  [[Page H313]]    Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record three letters: a letter from The  American Legion; a letter from 20 State attorneys general; and a letter  from a coalition of groups, including Student Veterans of America,  supporting our effort to overturn the Secretary's harmful borrower  defense rule.                                                The American Legion,                                Office of the National Commander,                                  Washington, DC, December 18, 2019.      Hon. Richard Durbin,      Washington, DC.        Dear Senator Durbin: On behalf of the nearly 2 million       members of The American Legion, I write to express our       support for Joint Resolution 56, providing for congressional       disapproval of the rule submitted by the Department of       Education relating to, ``Borrower Defense Institutional       Accountability.'' The rule, as currently written, is       fundamentally rigged against defrauded borrowers or student       loans, depriving them of the opportunity for debt relief that       Congress intended to afford them under the Higher Education       Act. Affirming this position is American Legion Resolution       No. 82: Preserve Veteran and Servicemember Rights to Gainful       Employment and Borrower Defense Protections, adopted in our       National Convention 2017.        Thousands of student veterans have been defrauded over the       years--promised their credits would transfer when they       wouldn't, given false or misleading job placement rates in       marketing, promised one educational experience when they were       recruited, but given something completely different. This       type of deception against our veterans and servicemembers has       been a lucrative scam for unscrupulous actors.        As veterans are aggressively targeted due to their service       to our country, they must be afforded the right to group       relief. The Department of Education's ``Borrower Defense''       rule eliminates this right, forcing veterans to individually       prove their claim, share the specific type of financial harm       they suffered, and prove the school knowingly made       substantial misrepresentations. The preponderance of evidence       required for this process is so onerous that the Department       of Education itself estimated that only 3 percent of       applicants would get relief.        Until every veteran's application for student loan       forgiveness has been processed, we will continue to demand       fair and timely decisions. The rule that the Department of       Education has promulgated flagrantly denies defrauded       veterans these dignities, and The American Legion calls on       Congress to overturn this regulatory action.        Senator Durbin, The American Legion applauds your       leadership in addressing this critical issue facing our       nation's veterans and their families.            For God & Country,                                       James W. ``Bill'' Oxford,       National Commander.                                   ____           The Commonwealth of Massachusetts, Office of the Attorney             General,                           Boston, Massachusetts, January 14, 2020.      Senator Dick Durbin,      Washington, DC.      Representative Susie Lee,      Washington, DC.        Dear Senator Durbin and Representative Lee: We, the       undersigned Attorneys General of Massachusetts, California,       Delaware, the District of Columbia, Hawai'i, Illinois, Iowa,       Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico,       New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Vermont,       Virginia, and Washington write to express our support for the       resolution of disapproval that you have introduced regarding       the U.S. Department of Education's (``Department'') 2019       Borrower Defense Rule (``2019 Rule'') pursuant to the       Congressional Review Act. In issuing the 2019 Rule, the       Department has abdicated its Congressionally-mandated       responsibility to protect students and taxpayers from the       misconduct of unscrupulous schools. The rule provides no       realistic prospect for borrowers to discharge their loans       when they have been defrauded by predatory for-profit       schools, and it eliminates financial responsibility       requirements for those same institutions. If this rule goes       into effect, the result will be disastrous for students while       providing a windfall to abusive schools.        The 2019 Rule squanders and reverses recent progress the       Department has made in protecting students from fraud and       abuse. Three years ago, the Department completed a thorough       rulemaking process addressing borrower defense and financial       responsibility, in which the views of numerous schools,       stakeholders, and public commenters were considered and       incorporated into a comprehensive set of regulations. The       regulations, promulgated by the Department in November 2016       (``2016 Rule''), made substantial progress toward achieving       the Department's then-stated goal of providing defrauded       borrowers with a consistent, clear, fair, and transparent       process to seek debt relief. At the same time, the 2016 Rule       protected taxpayers by holding schools accountable that       engage in misconduct and ensuring that financially troubled       schools provide the government with protection against the       risks they create.        The Department's new rule would simply rescind and replace       its 2016 Rule, reversing all of its enhanced protections for       students and its accountability measures for for-profit       schools. The Department's 2019 Rule provides an entirely       unfair and unworkable process for defrauded students to       obtain loan relief and will do nothing to deter and hold       accountable schools that cheat their students. Among its       numerous flaws, the Department's new rule places       insurmountable evidentiary burdens on student borrowers with       meritorious claims. The rule requires student borrowers to       prove intentional or reckless misconduct on the part of their       schools, an extraordinarily demanding standard not consistent       with state laws governing liability for unfair and deceptive       conduct. Moreover, even where a school has intentionally or       recklessly harmed its students, it is difficult to imagine       how students would be able to obtain the evidence necessary       to prove intent or recklessness for an administrative       application to the Department. The rule also inappropriately       requires student borrowers to prove financial harm beyond the       intrinsic harm caused by incurring federal student loan debt       as a result of fraud, and establishes a three-year time bar       on borrower defense claims, even though students typically do       not learn until years later that they were defrauded by their       schools. Compounding these obstacles, the rule arbitrarily       eliminates the process by which relief can be sought on a       group level, permitting those schools that have committed the       most egregious and systemic misconduct to benefit from their       wrongdoing at the expense of borrowers with meritorious       claims who are unaware of or unable to access relief.        We are uniquely well-situated to understand the devastating       effects that the 2019 Rule would have on the lives of student       borrowers and their families. State attorneys general serve       an important role in the regulation of private, postsecondary       institutions. Our investigations and enforcement actions have       repeatedly revealed that numerous for-profit schools have       deceived and defrauded students, and employed other unlawful       tactics to line their coffers with federal student-loan       funds. We have witnessed firsthand the heartbreaking       devastation to borrowers and their families. Recently, for       example, state attorneys general played a critical role in       uncovering widespread misconduct at Career Education       Corporation, Education Management Corporation, the Art       Institute and Argosy schools operated by the Dream Center,       ITT Technical Institute, Corinthian Colleges, American Career       Institute and others, and then working with the Department to       secure borrower-defense relief for tens of thousands of       defrauded students. Though this work, we have spoken with       numerous students who, while seeking new opportunities for       themselves and their families, were lured into programs with       the promise of employment opportunities and higher earnings,       only to be left with little to show for their efforts aside       from unaffordable debt.        A robust and fair borrower defense rule is critical for       ensuring that student borrowers and taxpayers are not left       bearing the costs of institutional misconduct. The       Department's new rule instead empowers predatory for-profit       schools and cuts off relief to victimized students. During       the comment period on the 2019 Rule, we submitted these and       other objections to the Department. Rather than engaging with       our offices, the Department ignored our comments and left our       concerns unaddressed. We commend and support your efforts to       disapprove the 2019 Rule to protect students and taxpayers.       Congress must hold predatory institutions accountable for       their misconduct and provide relief to defrauded student       borrowers and, by enacting your resolution of disapproval,       ensure that the 2016 Rule remains the operative borrower       defense regulation.

Senator Dick Durbin,      Washington, DC.      Representative Susie Lee,      Washington, DC.        Dear Senator Durbin and Representative Lee: As 57       organizations representing and advocating for students,       families, taxpayers, veterans and service members, faculty       and staff, civil rights and consumers, we write in support of       your efforts to disapprove the 2019 Borrower Defense to       Repayment rule pursuant to the Congressional Review Act.        The purpose of the borrower defense rule as defined by the       Higher Education Act is to protect students and taxpayers       from fraud, deception, and other illegal misconduct by       unscrupulous colleges. A well-designed rule  [[Page H314]]       will both provide relief to students who have been lied to       and cheated, and deter illegal conduct by colleges.        However, the final rule issued by the Department of       Education on September 23, 2019, would accomplish neither of       these goals. An analysis of the Department's own calculations       estimates that only 3 percent of the loans that result from       school misconduct would be cancelled under the new rule.       Schools would be held accountable for reimbursing taxpayers       for just 1 percent of these loans.        The DeVos Borrower Defense rule issued in September imposes       unreasonable time limits on student borrowers who have been       deceived and misled by their schools. It requires applicants       to meet thresholds that make it almost impossible for wronged       borrowers to obtain loan cancellation.        The rule eliminates the ability of groups of borrowers to       be granted relief, even in cases where there is substantial       compelling evidence of widespread wrongdoing. It prohibits       the filing of claims after three years even when evidence of       wrongdoing emerges at a later date. It requires borrowers to       prove schools intended to deceive them or acted recklessly,       although students have no ability to access evidence that       might show this intent. And the rule stipulates that student       loans taken by students under false pretenses are       insufficient evidence of financial harm to allow the loans to       be cancelled.        Additionally, the 2019 rule eliminates the promise of       automatic loan relief to eligible students whose school       closed before they could graduate. Instead, the Department       would force each eligible student impacted by a school       closure to individually find out about their statutory right       to relief, apply, and navigate the government's bureaucracy       to have their loans cancelled.        Many of us wrote to the Department in August 2018 in       response to the notice of proposed rulemaking and offered       carefully considered recommendations. However, the Department       rejected our recommendations that would have provided a fair       process that protects students and taxpayer dollars. Instead,       the new rule would do little to provide relief to students       who have been lied to, and even less to dissuade colleges       from systematically engaging in deceptive and illegal       recruitment tactics. Moreover, a borrower defense rule that       fails to adequately protect students harms the most       vulnerable students, including first-generation college       students, Black and Latino students, and military-connected       students, who are targeted by and disproportionately enroll       in predatory for-profit colleges.        Meanwhile, the Department refuses to take action on a       massive backlog of over 200,000 pending borrower defense       claims, having failed to approve or deny a single claim in       over a year. We fully support your effort to repeal the 2019       borrower defense rule, and look forward to restoration of the       2016 rule, which took major steps to provide a path to loan       forgiveness for the hundreds of thousands of students who       attended schools where misconduct has already been well       documented.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.J.  Res. 76 and to reject Secretary DeVos' harmful rule that makes it  nearly impossible for borrowers to seek the relief that they have the  right to seek.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
