 Mr. Speaker, I would like to recognize the life and  service of 99-year-old Second Lieutenant B. Louise Boddie Dawson, a  driven, strong, and remarkable constituent.   A graduate of Freedman Hospital Nursing School in Washington, D.C.,  Louise proudly served our country during World War II as a nurse in the  Army. For her dedicated service, she earned the American Campaign Medal  and the World War II Victory Medal.   It was through the Army that Louise met her husband, Lieutenant  Colonel Emmett C. Dawson, Jr. The Dawsons married on September 3, 1949,  and moved to Sewickley, Pennsylvania, where Louise worked as a nurse  until the start of the Korean war.   Always caring for people and wanting to serve better, Louise worked  as a head nurse at the former Dixmont State Hospital in Kilbuck  Township, while studying psychology at La Roche College.   Louise led an exemplary life of hard work and selfless service  towards others. She instilled this work ethic in her daughters, telling  them you never fail until you quit and by setting an incredible example  for them to follow.   God only knows how long Louise will remain with us, but we always  remember her extraordinary life witness to serve, be kind, and  persevere.                            ____________________
