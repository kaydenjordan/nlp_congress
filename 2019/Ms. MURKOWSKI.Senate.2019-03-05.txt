 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, last week, I announced my intention  to vote in favor of H.J. Res. 46. This is a resolution expressing  disapproval of the President's February 15 proclamation of a national  emergency. At that same time, I joined with my colleague, the Senator  from New Mexico, along with the Senator from Maine, Ms. Collins, and  the Senator from New Hampshire, Mrs. Shaheen, in the introduction of  the Senate companion, S.J. Res. 10.   I want to take just a few moments this afternoon and speak to my  rationale not only for my statements but for my support for terminating  the national emergency. It is, certainly, not based on disagreement  over the issue of border security on our southern border. I recognize  full well, along with, I believe, all of our colleagues here, the  situation on the border and the humanitarian issues that face us. The  issue that faces us with the level of those coming across our borders  is not a sustainable situation, and, certainly, the influx of drugs  that we are seeing in this community must be addressed.   Rather, my concern is, really, about the institution of the Congress  and the constitutional balance of powers that, I think, are just  fundamental to our democracy. In my view, it really comes down to  article I of the Constitution. Article I, section 7, clause 8 reads:  ``No  [[Page S1649]]  Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in consequence of  Appropriation.''   This provision and the necessary and proper clause of article I,  section 8, clause 18 and the taxing and spending clauses--article VIII,  clause 1--are just generally regarded as the basis for the notion that  the power to spend resides in the Congress. We say it around here--that  the power of the purse rests with the Congress.   Of all of these three clauses that I have just articulated, the  admonition that no money shall be drawn from the Treasury but in  consequence of appropriation is probably the clearest expression of the  Framers' view that the executive has no power to spend money in a  manner that is inconsistent with the intentions of the Congress.   Justice Story, in his 1883 Commentaries on the Constitution,  characterized that clause as an important means of self-protection for  the legislative department.   He went on to write:         The [legislature] has, and must have, a controlling       influence over the executive power, since it holds at its       command all of the resources by which the executive could       make himself formidable. It possesses the power of the purse       of the nation and the property of the people.    Again, he just very clearly articulates where these lanes of  authority--these lanes of jurisdiction--reside.   This past weekend, on Sunday, a local newspaper, the Fairbanks Daily  News-Miner, published an editorial. In that editorial, it was argued  that our colleagues here in the Senate should vote for the resolution  of disapproval. The editorial is entitled: ``A dangerous course:  Congress shouldn't cede power to president in border funding dispute.''   Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the editorial be  printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:            [From the Fairbanks Daily News-Miner, March 3, 2019]     A Dangerous Course: Congress Shouldn't Cede Power to President in                           Border Funding Dispute                             (Editorial Board)         Two reasons for alarm exist regarding President Donald       Trump's declaration of a national emergency at the U.S.-      Mexico border so that he can reallocate funds approved by       Congress for other purposes.        First is the problem of potential precedent. Is building a       wall at the border the type of situation envisioned by       Congress when it approved the National Emergencies Act in       1976? Or is the president simply declaring a national       emergency as a way to overcome a political dispute over a       funding allocation?        If it is political dispute and is upheld by the U.S.       Supreme Court, where the issue is almost certainly headed,       how will Republicans in Congress who support the president's       emergency declaration react when--not if--a Democrat occupies       the White House and uses the same national emergency logic to       force actions on climate change that Republicans find       objectionable?        That is one concern.        Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski earlier indicated she would       support a disapproval resolution and Thursday joined fellow       GOP Sen. Susan Collins, of Maine, and two Democratic senators       to introduce the resolution in the Senate. Sen. Dan Sullivan,       Alaska's other Republican senator, has not stated publicly       how he will vote.        The Senate resolution is similar to one approved by the       House on Tuesday. Rep. Don Young voted against the       resolution. The National Emergencies Act requires that the       Senate vote on the House resolution; a vote is expected       within the next two weeks.        There is also an issue that is greater than that of border       security. It is the issue of guarding against encroachment by       one branch of government on the power of another.        Members of Congress should be asked these questions: Do you       believe the president is properly exercising authority       granted by Congress under the National Emergencies Act? Or do       you think his emergency declaration is an unacceptable       overreach by the executive branch?        Encroachment by one branch on another and the consolidating       of power in one branch worried some of the Founders as they       crafted our system of independent yet interlocking government       branches. The Federalist Papers, the series of 85 writings       that aimed to convince the public to support ratification of       the Constitution, contain references to that concern.        James Madison wrote in Federalist No. 48, published Feb. 1,       1788, that ``It will not be denied, that power is of an       encroaching nature, and that it ought to be effectually       restrained from passing the limits assigned to it. After       discriminating, therefore, in theory, the several classes of       power, as they may in their nature be legislative, executive,       or judiciary, the next and most difficult task is to provide       some practical security for each, against the invasion of the       others.''        ``Will it be sufficient to mark, with precision, the       boundaries of these departments, in the constitution of the       government, and to trust to these parchment barriers against       the encroaching spirit of power?''        The concern appears again in Federalist No. 51, written by       Madison and Alexander Hamilton and published Feb. 8, 1788:       ``The great security against a gradual concentration of the       several powers in the same department, consists in giving to       those who administer each department the necessary       constitutional means and personal motives to resist       encroachments of the others. . . . Ambition must be made to       counteract ambition.''        Congress, as a co-equal branch of government, should stand       up for itself.        President Trump has said he will veto the resolution if it       comes to his desk. And at this stage it appears unlikely that       there are enough votes in Congress to override that veto.        What each member of Congress says and does in this funding       dispute will reveal clearly how they view the law and the       relationship between the legislative and executive branches.    Madam President, in support of the argument outlined  in that headline, the News-Miner's editorial board wrote the following:         Encroachment by one branch on another and the consolidating       of power in one branch worried some of the Founders as they       crafted our system of independent yet interlocking government       branches. The Federalist Papers . . . contain references to       that concern.    The editorial board goes on to refer to Federalist No. 51, which  reads:         The great security against a gradual concentration of the       several powers in the same department, consists in giving to       those who administer each department the necessary       constitutional means and personal motives to resist       encroachments of others. . . . Ambition must be made to       counteract ambition.    When you translate that into just plain old English, it basically  means Congress is a coequal branch of government, and, as such,  Congress should stand up for itself. That really is the reason--the  root--of why I have announced my support for this resolution of  disapproval. I think it is fair to say that we all have disagreements  around here about all sorts of things that are part of the  appropriations process, and, certainly, the issue of border funding or  just border security is no exception.   Even if the fiscal year 2019 appropriations process had run smoothly,  which it certainly did not, think about how we got to where we are  right now. The President submitted his budget last year. He requested  money for barriers on the border and other aspects of border security.  The request went through the appropriations process. I serve on that  subcommittee. In the Senate subcommittee, we advanced out of the  committee the President's request. After 3 months of continuing  resolutions, we ended up in a stalemate with the other body last year,  calendar year 2018. In January, control of the other body changed. The  stalemate continued until the lengthy negotiations concluded, which  allowed both bodies to pass and for the President to agree to sign an  appropriations package just several weeks ago in February.   Again, that appropriations package was, I think it is probably fair  to say, the result of a great deal of back-and-forth between the House,  the Senate, and the White House, but it was clearly something that did  help to advance the priorities that the President had outlined with  regard to the southern border.   I am quoting from a White House fact sheet here, which reads:  ``Secured a number of significant legislative victories that further  the President's effort to secure the Southern Border and protect our  country.'' Chief among those victories was ``the bill provides $1.375  billion for approximately 55 miles of border barrier in highly  dangerous and drug smuggling areas in the Rio Grande Valley, where it  is desperately needed.''   So we are where we were on February 15 when the administration  recognized that significant gains had been made, but I think we all  know that the President believes very, very strongly that there is more  that should be done, that must be done, and that will be done to  address that.   Clearly, there was a disagreement between the Congress and the  President about how much could be spent on border security in 2019. I  think, in fairness, sticking up for Congress's power of the purse  doesn't necessarily mean that it comes at the expense of border  security. I believe very strongly we can  [[Page S1650]]  address the President's concerns--the very, very real and legitimate  concerns that need to be addressed--but that we don't have to do it at  the expense of ceding that authority, of ceding that power of the  purse, of ceding that article I power that we have here.   There are ways that the President can advance his issues, and he has  done so. He, certainly, has the prerogative to ask for supplemental  appropriations. He has identified additional funding that is outside of  the national emergency designation, or declaration, if you will.   He has identified additional funding--close to $3 billion--from other  statutory authorities. These are the authorities under 10 U.S.C.  284(b), which is the counterdrug account, counterdrug funds. That will  require a level of reprogramming through the appropriating committees,  but that can be done outside of the national emergency. The other  source of funding is the Treasury Forfeiture Fund through the Secretary  of the Treasury under 31 U.S.C. 9705. So I think it is clear that there  are avenues to enhance the funding opportunities to address the  situation at the border.   The concern that many of us have raised is the designation in this  third account--the designation of a national emergency--that would tap  into funds that have already been designated for military construction  projects, important construction projects that have been designated  around the country. We certainly have many in my State of Alaska. We  haven't seen the list that would perhaps outline with greater  articulation where the Secretary of Defense might think it would be  appropriate to delay some of these projects. But, again, I would just  remind--these are projects that have perhaps already been delayed  because of the Budget Control Act that has been in place for several  years, so I think further delay for many of these projects would cause  most concern.   So I come to the National Emergencies Act. I think there is a  recognition that when this was adopted, was put into law, it was  initially intended to rein in the President's ability to declare  emergencies. But at the same time it authorized the President to  declare national emergencies, it didn't ever clearly define the extent  of that power. So that is an issue that I think we are dealing with  right now. Implicit in this grant is the trust that the power will be  used sparingly. I think that if you look back over the history, the 59  previous times these powers have been utilized, you can say they have  been used sparingly. But also explicit is the authority for the  Congress to terminate an emergency if the Congress believes it was  imprudently declared, and that is basically where we are today.   Because Congress did not explicitly constrain the President's power  to declare an emergency, many of the constitutional scholars--those who  are trying to game this out--believe the President will ultimately  prevail in the litigation that we are entirely certain will be seen in  the courts.   The question for us to consider in this body is not whether the  President could have declared an emergency but whether he should have  and, again, the question relating to the redirection of military  construction funds from our bases around the country to the southern  border. These are the questions we are currently debating. But in the  final analysis, I look at the issue we have in front of us, and this is  really a very challenging place for us as a Congress, to be debating  the constitutional powers of the Congress against a legislative  agenda--a strong legislative agenda and an important one that the  President has. But I have come to be quite concerned about where we are  when it comes to precedent and the precedent that we may see unleashed.  In many ways, I view this as an expansion of Executive powers by  legislative acquiescence.   If we fail to weigh in, if we fail to acknowledge that this  designation has gone beyond that which has previously been considered,  if we go around, effectively, the will of Congress, where will it take  us next? I think we need to think about that because it is so easy to  get focused on where we are in the here and now and the situation we  are dealing with today, but when we are pushing out those lanes of  congressional authority, I think we need to be thinking clearly about  what that may mean for future administrations and for future  Congresses.   As the chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, my  focus is very often on the energy sector, on the energy space, and so I  have asked, if we were in a situation with a new President, what could  be invoked if a new President should decide to exercise his or her  emergency authorities as they relate to energy? It is entirely possible  that a future President could declare a national emergency related to  global climate change, speaking to a humanitarian crisis and what it  might mean for national security. In fact, one of our colleagues from  Massachusetts has already said as much--that a national emergency could  be declared as relates to global climate change.   You have to ask the question. What would stop a future President from  declaring an emergency and then directing the military to spend  billions of dollars on renewable projects or refugee assistance? What  is to stop a future President from targeting the Nation's oil and gas  supply by cutting off exports and shutting down production on the Outer  Continental Shelf?   I think we would all say: Well, we don't need to worry about that  happening with our current President; he is not going to do any of  those things. But the authorities technically would exist for all of  them, and so it is concerning. It is concerning to me that a future  President could use that to drive their agenda--again, without the  consent of the Congress.   So I repeat--I am concerned that, as a Congress, as a legislative  body, we would stand back and we would acquiesce in the use of a  national emergency to resolve a disagreement between the executive and  the legislative branches over the appropriate level of funding for a  situation that likely exceeds what can be spent in our current fiscal  year.   I know there will be continued discussion not only here in the  Senate, in the Congress, but certainly around the country about these  matters. I know some of my colleagues are interested in revisiting the  scope of the National Emergencies Act, and that is clearly worth  considering. But I firmly believe that one can be strongly for border  security and at the same time question whether the administration has  overreached in using the National Emergencies Act in the way that it  has, and I find myself in that camp. That is why it is with great  resolve that I support the adoption of the resolutions of disapproval.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
