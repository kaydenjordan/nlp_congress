 Mr. Speaker, tragically, I receive correspondence  every week like this. I heard from Rita in east Texas, who writes me:         Since ObamaCare took effect, my insurance no longer covers       my colonoscopies as  [[Page H2435]]       preventative care. I now pay $1,000 and more out of pocket       versus $100 outpatient fee.    I heard from Frances in the Dallas area near where I live. A few  years ago she was tragically diagnosed with tonsil cancer. The good  news is she had a good policy; $600-a-month premium and a maximum out  of pocket of $3,500. But thanks to ObamaCare, her insurance company  dropped her twice, and she wrote:         They dropped me again because they are leaving the Dallas       market.    Her premiums and deductibles doubled. She lost her oncologist, and  she writes that this is all because of ObamaCare, the Affordable Care  Act.   I heard from Tonya in Van Zandt County, in my district:         We had five family members covered by insurance at around       $800 a month until ObamaCare. Our insurance premiums       skyrocketed to $1,500 a month, equivalent to a house payment,       with a $15,000 deductible, and we cannot see the doctors that       know our medical history. Repeal it. I should not be forced       to pay for something I cannot use. This has been a nightmare.    Mr. Speaker, ObamaCare has been a nightmare. It is collapsing as we  speak. People are losing their coverages. Insurance plans are pulling  out of States and counties. Tens of millions of our fellow countrymen  have been forced to buy health insurance plans they cannot afford, they  do not want, and that do not work for them.   Right here, right now, we have a choice: failed ObamaCare or the  American Health Care Act that begins the process of providing Americans  with guaranteed access to quality, affordable, patient-centered health  care.   It clearly advances the cause of freedom, and all Members should  support it and end the nightmare of ObamaCare.
