 Madam Speaker, I remember standing in your chair over  these last couple of Congresses reading out that very same card at the  end. Whether the Obama administration or the Trump administration,  folks come down to the floor, they get caught up in the passions of the  moment, and we do have opportunities to come together.   I had not planned on coming down. I was actually in the Cloakroom  making some telephone calls, and I heard my colleague speaking. I heard  her with sincerity implore the President to come to his senses, come to  the negotiating table, and end this shutdown. Then I heard her with  sincerity implore the leaders of the Senate to come to the negotiating  table, to come to their senses, and to end this shutdown. Then in about  an hour and a half, I will be down here leading the debate on the rule  for the minority, and we will bring yet another of the exact same bills  we have brought to the floor that have gone absolutely nowhere in an  effort to reopen the government.   I would say to my friends that the secret to finding common ground  isn't to ask everybody else to come to where you are standing. That is  the new definition of compromise in this town. I have seen that, that  gravitate in the five terms that I have been here.   The definition of compromise is: Well, why don't you agree with me?   The truth is the only movement I have seen in this debate over these  last 32 days is the President this past weekend when he said: Do you  know what? We have called on every single Member in every single  Chamber to find a solution to the young men and women trapped in a DACA  status, those families who come here with temporary protective status,  and they are uncertain about their future--folks on both sides of the  aisle have called for that--he said: Do you know what? Maybe we can  broaden this debate, Madam Speaker. Maybe we can broaden the definition  of what success looks like, and maybe we can break this logjam.   Madam Speaker, I would just say to my colleagues: I will come back  down to the House floor as often as you all want me to come back down  to the House floor, and we can do exactly the same thing every single  day knowing we are going to get exactly the same result from the White  House and the Senate. Or, we can try to do something different.   Candidly, my constituents didn't send me here to do the same thing  over and over and over again with the same failed result. They sent me  here to get success. They don't care if I win. They care if I succeed  on their behalf. They don't care about Republican and Democratic  priorities. They care about their family priorities.   And I have to believe--though I don't know all of my freshman  colleagues as well as I would like--I have to believe that even with  all the new Members in this institution there is still more that unites  us than divides us in this country. I love that about this institution.  I love that about the men and women who are here.   So, Madam Speaker, I ask this: Let's try to do a little more  listening and a little less talking. Here in the rank and file, golly,  I have to believe if I could pick out a few colleagues here, I am  pretty sure that we could sit down at the table and solve this. I  confess it is beyond our reach as we sit here today. This is a White  House decision. This is a Mitch McConnell decision. And this is a Nancy  Pelosi decision. We ought to all as rank-and-file Members be outraged  when it does rise to that level because we lose control.  Our constituents lose their voice.    I am encouraging my leadership to be as open and honest and to be as  flexible and creative as they possibly can in finding a solution. Every  single one of us bears responsibility in this Chamber of what is going  on.   If Senate Democrats had let these appropriations bills move last  fall, then we wouldn't be in this mess. If Republicans had passed a  continuing resolution in December, we wouldn't be in this mess. There  are 1,000 different decisionmaking points where we could have done  things differently. We cannot change those, but we can change what is  happening here today.   I tell my constituents back home: If you want to understand what is  happening in Congress, listen to the 5 minutes in the morning, listen  to the 1 minutes at noon, and find out if the folks who are coming to  the floor are celebrating opportunities for success or simply  condemning their colleagues for not being invested in solutions.   I believe in the men and women of this Chamber. I believe in the U.S.  House of Representatives. I believe in self-governance in this Nation.  Failing the American people, Madam Speaker, undermines that confidence.  We have an opportunity to succeed, and I hope we will say yes to that  opportunity.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend from Massachusetts for  yielding me the customary 30 minutes, and I appreciated the first 60  seconds of his comments where he went through that kind of policy work  and that kind of procedural work, the work that we do.   We are on opposite sides of this issue. The Rules Committee is the  single most partisan committee on Capitol Hill, and, yet, we always  find a way to come together and share the debate to move forward. But  after that first 60 seconds of process, we went into 4 minutes of the  President and accusations, one after another after another.   Now, I have only been in this institution for five terms, Mr.  Speaker, but that is long enough to understand that there is only one  way to turn a bill into a law, and that is if Congress proposes it,  Congress passes it, and the President signs it. Now, my good friend  from Massachusetts knows as well as I do the President has not vetoed  one single spending bill that the Congress has sent to him. The  government is not shut down because the President is rejecting bills  that Congress has passed. The government is shut down because Congress  hasn't passed a bill.    Mr. Speaker, if you would just listen to that opening statement, your  blood pressure probably gets as high as mine does: failure after  failure after failure, disappointment after disappointment after  disappointment, embarrassing event after embarrassing event. I will  remind my colleagues that we are where we are because we came together  and passed more spending bills on time before the end of the fiscal  year than any other Congress in 22 years.   Now, we could have gotten them all done. My Democratic friends in the  Senate didn't want to move those along. They had perfectly legitimate  policy reasons for doing that. I am not going to question their  motives; I will question their wisdom.   We have got more done together than we ever have before, and we could  build on that, I tell my friend. We could build on that or we could go  into our corners, we could put on our jerseys, and we can throw  accusations out as fast as we can invent them in our head. That is  where we are.   It is the month of January, Mr. Speaker, the very first month of this  new Congress. We have new leadership. It has been more than a decade  since I have seen a face like yours in the Speaker's chair. We have  spent 338 hours in this Chamber--338 hours in this Chamber--this month  working on appropriations bills. Not one has gone to the President's  desk for his consideration.   My friend from Massachusetts is right when he talks about pain in  American families. My friend from Massachusetts is right when he talks  about the expectations folks have of Congress and how we should do  better. My friend from Massachusetts is right when he says that this is  not what any one of us was sent here to do. We were sent here to solve  problems.   I promise you, unless your family is different from mine, Mr.  Speaker, unless your relationships are different from mine, I have  never solved a problem in my family by telling my loved ones how much  it is their fault, how much they need to change, how much they are on  the wrong side of an issue and we are not going to do anything until  they come around to my way of thinking. It hasn't been a particularly  successful method for me.   Now, I look back over these last 33 days. The President sent the Vice  President to Capitol Hill. He came with the OMB director, Mick  Mulvaney.   He said: I told you what I needed to pass the bill. I told you what I  needed and what I thought was important for America and for national  security. But I will tell you what; I don't have to have exactly that.  I can come off that. I can negotiate down from that. I can move away  from that. Let's talk about what the other options may be.   No response.   The President this past weekend: I want to break this impasse; I want  to find a way we can move forward; it is not about who wins. We all  need to win as Americans. We all want to do better as Americans. I am  going to offer to do something that no President has been able to do. I  am going to offer to put into statute protection for the young men and  women in the DACA program. I am going to offer to put into statute  protections for those men and women in temporary protected status that  has since expired. I am going to put that into statute for the first  time.   As the press release is dated, Mr. Speaker, Speaker of the House  Nancy Pelosi rejected that offer 7 minutes before it was made.   I am not saying that that is the right answer. I am not saying that  that is the best we can do. I am not saying that is where the  conversation ends. I am asking my friends: When does the conversation  begin?   More than 300 hours we have spent talking amongst ourselves and  produced nothing to go to the President's desk. Sadly, I know that this  issue has elevated beyond where my friend from Massachusetts, even as  chairman of the powerful Rules Committee--and it is the powerful Rules  Committee, it can move absolutely any measure through this House, and  the Rules Committee has been incredibly successful. The House is moving  appropriations bills like nobody's business, Mr. Speaker, because when  you are in the majority you can do that. You can do my way or the  highway.   That is the way my friend described President Trump's attitude. I  will just remind my friend that is actually what we have today in this  bill. My ranking member asked if we could consider some amendments to  this bill, and he was told no. My friend didn't say: Let's just come  down here and have amendments willy-nilly. We will have a preprinting  requirement, we will do what we call a modified open rule, just so some  of our new Members can have their voices heard, their constituents'  voices heard in some way.   The answer was no; straight party-line vote. All the Democrats said:  no, we are not going to allow any other voices to be heard; and all the  Republicans said: yes.   I don't fault my friend for that. That is not a personal slight of  any kind, Mr. Speaker. The Rules Committee is the Speaker's committee.  It does the work of the Speaker. As powerful and talented as my friend  from Massachusetts is, it is his job to implement the Speaker's will.  Now, to his credit, he has been very bold in terms of trying to open  that committee up. He has been very bold in trying to make sure more  voices have been heard. But we find ourselves trapped in this  appropriations cycle. We haven't actually gotten to where my friend is  going to be able to do his very best work. We are still trapped in  trying to do the business of last year.   But my friend's pointing out that the President's my way or the  highway--which is inaccurate--is not helpful. My pointing out that this  bill is Speaker Pelosi's way or the highway may be accurate, but it  still isn't helpful. We have got to have a conversation with one  another. I can go down the list of the ways that the President has said  he is willing to come to the table, but he is sitting at the table  alone.   I am a vote counter, Mr. Speaker. I know how to count votes in this  Chamber. I have no doubt that the rule that my friend from  Massachusetts is proposing is going to pass this floor today. I have no  doubt that the underlying appropriations bill is going to pass this  floor. This rule includes something called martial law, Mr. Speaker,  which means they can bring up anything they want to any time they want  to, no preprinting, and no opportunity to review it, none of those  activities that we would say bring out the very best in transparency  here. If any of those bills come up, they are going to pass.   There is no confusion in this Chamber about who has the votes to win.  The confusion in this Chamber is how it is we get from where we are to  where our constituents want us to be and doing the same thing over and  over and over again isn't going to get it done.   It is my first time carrying a rule in the minority, Mr. Speaker. I  knew when I walked down here this morning my job was to lose. I don't  mind losing.  [[Page H1015]]  But I do mind when the American people lose, and the American people  are losing right now. There are no winners right now.   I know the men and women of this Chamber. There are some talented  orators here. We can absolutely trade insults and accusations until the  sun goes down. But there are some talented policymakers here, too.  There are some talented negotiators here, too. As long as the President  is sitting at that negotiating table alone, we are not going to get to  a solution. But he doesn't have to be there alone. I appreciate his  making the invitation, and I hope, as my friend from Massachusetts  said, we will learn to take yes for an answer.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1245     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume,  and I appreciate that admonition from the Chair.   I was looking aggressively at all the words my friend had to say for  what that thing was that was going to break this logjam, what that  thing was that was going to bring people together, what that olive  branch was that he was extending to succeed where others had failed.   I heard that if we only come together and do it his way, that we  could all just get along, and I have no doubt that that is true. That  is not what a negotiation is. That is not the way this Chamber works.   We have got to send a bill to the President's desk. When the  President starts vetoing bills, then start accusing the President of  being the grit in the cog in this legislative wheel. We don't have  agreement amongst ourselves.   We were up in the Rules Committee last night, Mr. Speaker, and one of  my appropriator friends was celebrating the bills that were coming to  the floor today and celebrating how pleased she was that so many of the  pro-life provisions had been stripped out, celebrating that so many of  the dollars that we would be sending overseas would no longer be  encumbered by pro-life provisions, that folks would be able to use them  in any way that they wanted.   Well, I have no doubt that she was pleased by those things, but we  are not all pleased by those things, Mr. Speaker. This doesn't  represent the compromise solution that everybody is on board with, as  my friend would have you believe.   The financial services language in this bill, that never made it  through conference. We couldn't agree, not amongst ourselves in the  House and the Senate, not in a bicameral way.   My friend who is the ranking member of the Financial Services and  General  [[Page H1016]]  Government Appropriations Subcommittee, Mr. Speaker, shared last night  that there were 20 different pieces of bipartisan legislation that were  in the original bill, 6 pieces of bipartisan legislation that had been  signed off on by the then-ranking member and, now, chairwoman of the  Financial Services Committee that we could have moved forward, that we  could have made a difference--again, stripped out for reasons beyond my  understanding.   This isn't complicated if folks are sincere about coming together  around the table. It is impossible if folks would rather trade insults  than solutions.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr.  Mitchell), a friend who has been dedicated entirely to solutions in his  short time in the House.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Michigan an  additional 2 minutes.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I wasn't kidding when I said I was looking for the olive  branch in what my friend had to say. I genuinely believe, if you lock  me and the gentleman from Massachusetts in a room together for 24, 48,  maybe 72 or 96 hours, we could come to a solution and get us out of  this box. But it does take sitting down with people that you trust to  get a hard negotiation done.   I shared in the Rules Committee the other night, Mr. Speaker, and I  will share with you today, the story of one of my constituents. His  name is Doug Jenkins, and this is his story:   Jeanette Jenkins, age 76, of Lawrenceville, Georgia, passed away on  Saturday, April 28, 2018. Jeanette was a member of Hebron Baptist  Church for over 25 years and currently a member of First Baptist Church  of Atlanta. Jeanette had a passion for serving in many capacities of  the ministry, as a Sunday school teacher and volunteering in various  activities. She was an avid reader and enjoyed sewing. She is survived  by her loving husband of 57 years, Doug.   Jeanette didn't die of natural causes on April 28, Mr. Speaker. She  was just running out to pick up some drugs at the drugstore. Her  husband stayed at home. She was leaving the subdivision, waited for the  light to turn green, and pulled out, when a van full of gentlemen who  should not have been in this country, who were not in this country  legally, ran that red light and killed her. She never recovered  consciousness; died in the hospital later on that evening.   We can describe the President of the United States and his commitment  to border security as a temper tantrum, but it is not true. We can  describe the President of the United States and his commitment to  border security as some sort of political fixation, but it is not true.   The stories that my friends tell about Federal employees missing  paychecks, those are painful, those are hard, and we can do better. But  the stories that each and every one of us have about members in our  community who have lost loved ones, not for a week, not for 2 weeks,  but forever, because we didn't do our job protecting American borders-- I want to do better.   I was pleased to see the President talk about agricultural visas and  how he wanted to expand those programs. It is important to us in  Georgia. I am excited about EB visas, trying to get more investment in  this country. We need more. I come from a community of immigrants.  America's history is founded in immigration, and our future is founded  there, too.   But nobody else could have protected Jeanette Jenkins. Nobody. My  local law enforcement can't do it. My governor can't do it. That  responsibility falls to the national government and the national  government alone. The President campaigned on it; the President was  elected on it; and we have an opportunity to come together and do it.   I don't want to kick the can down the road for another year. I don't  want to kick the can down the road for another decade. I don't want to  have another Jenkins family come into my office and say: Rob, where  were you? What did you do when you had an opportunity to make a  difference?   I regret that we are in the box that we are in. It is a box of our  own making. But we can get out of it, and we can make America better as  a result of it. It doesn't have to be a lose-lose. It can be a win-win.   Nobody is winning today. Nobody has benefited by the shutdown today.  I cannot negotiate by myself. The President cannot negotiate by  himself. We need folks to say ``yes'' to the invitation. Take the  gentleman from Michigan's advice: Ask your leadership, as we have asked  ours, to lock yourself in that room together and don't come out until  you have an answer.   My friend from Massachusetts says he has no preexisting stipulations  about what the package has to look like. I hope that is true. It has  not been my experience--stripping out all the pro-life provisions, for  example. That was something that your conference wanted. Not working on  the CFPB provisions that the Financial Services Committee had done, not  including those 20 bipartisan bills, there are conditions that folks  have, as they should, because they were elected to this House, and they  are obligated to serve their constituents.   We can get this done, Mr. Speaker, but I commit to you, we are not  going to get it done by pointing the finger of blame at 1600  Pennsylvania Avenue. We are going to get it done by coming together  right here and doing our job, the task the Constitution assigns to us,  and, that is, agreeing on a provision amongst ourselves and sending it  to the President for him to accept or to reject.    I believe in what we can do together, Mr. Speaker, and I hope my  colleagues will again take ``yes'' to an invitation to the negotiating  table as an answer.   Mr. Speaker, with that, I yield back the balance of my time.
