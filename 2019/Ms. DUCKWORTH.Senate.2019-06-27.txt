 Mr. President, amendment No. 861 fully captures the  utter failure of the modern Congress to assert and defend congressional  war powers that the U.S. Constitution solely vests in the legislative  branch. It treats matters of life and death as mere fodder for  political ``gotcha''  [[Page S4622]]  votes and represents an approach to legislating that is ultimately as  simplistic as it is dangerous.   If one asked 10 attorneys to analyze the text of amendment No. 861,  one might very well receive 10 wildly different interpretations of what  the undefined terms in the amendment mean, from the use of the term  ``attack by the government, military forces, or proxies of a foreign  nation or by other hostile forces'' to the phrase ``used to ensure the  ability of the Armed Forces of the United States to defend themselves,  and United States citizens.''   As the authors plausibly argue, the intent of the amendment may very  well be to simply reaffirm existing legal interpretations and norms  that authorize the U.S. Armed Forces to defend itself and our citizens  against attack by a foreign nation or other hostile force. As  supporters argue, the amendment language avoids using the specific  phrase ``authorization for use of military force,'' and thus one may  argue that it is technically not an ``AUMF.''   Yet adopting such an interpretation requires ignoring years of  executive branch overreach when it comes to taking unilateral military  action without seeking an authorization for use of military force or a  declaration of war from Congress.   It requires willfully forgetting the behavior of our current  President and past Presidents of both parties, who have chosen to  define the concept of Commander in Chief under Article II of the U.S.  Constitution to be less a commander and more an emperor while the  legislative branch has sat idly by as its war powers were rapidly  seized by the modem imperial Presidency.   Congress is a coequal branch of government. It is time we started  acting like it. We cannot trust any President to take a blank check and  fill in a reasonable number. I must oppose amendment 861 because, in my  reading, any President of any party would adopt the broadest legal  interpretation possible in defining what constitutes an ``other hostile  force'' or an ``attack'' or what it means to ``ensure the ability of  the Armed Forces of the U.S. to defend themselves.''   This language risks unintentionally authorizing President Trump to  order all types of military strikes against any number of potential  entities that the President deems to be a threat. How would the Trump  administration determine the precise baseline that defines the term  ``ability'' of the military to defend itself? Would allowing the  degradation of any platform or capability qualify as failing to  ``ensure the ability'' of the U.S. Armed Forces to defend itself? If  so, that would authorize the use of funds in the National Defense  Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020 to take unilateral, preemptive  action again a foreign nation or hostile force to preserve the current  capabilities of the U.S. military.   I am confident the author of this amendment would disagree with this  interpretation of his legislative language. However, would the sponsor  argue that such an interpretation is unreasonable or not possible?  Would a Federal Court not defer to the Federal Agency's interpretation  of a vague and ambiguous statute? I do not know the answer to either  question; yet I know this: I am not willing to take that risk.   We are living with the consequences of a previous Congress that  rushed to pass a concise authorization for use of military force that  appeared targeted and limited at first. We have watched as Republican  and Democratic administrations alike subsequently employed creative and  broad legal interpretations of that authorization to continually expand  which parties were connected with the horrific terrorist attacks of  September 11, 2001.   To this very day, the Trump administration cites this authorization  for use of military force as legal justification to unilaterally deploy  Americans all around the world, even though it was authorized in  response to an event that took place before some of these troops were  even born. To be clear, I am not asserting that I oppose the premise or  substantive motivation of every military action that has taken place  under the recent Presidential administrations. I am simply stating that  such actions must be debated and voted on by Congress.   I deployed to fight in a war I personally opposed because it was  ordered by the Commander in Chief, and these orders were pursuant to an  authorization for use of military force that was publicly debated and  passed by a majority of our Nation's elected representatives. Opposing  a vaguely worded amendment whose own author and proponents assert is  duplicative and unnecessary and which I believe may unintentionally  open the door to unlimited unilateral military action, ultimately is a  vote to make our Nation stronger, more accountable, and a more perfect  union in living out the principles contained in our founding document.   Critics may falsely allege that opposing amendment No. 861 is voting  against our national defense and military. I will strongly reject any  such ridiculous claim that slanders me with the accusation that I would  ever risk the security and safety of the Nation I have proudly served  in uniform. In voting against amendment No. 861, I am safeguarding our  military from excessive use without congressional oversight. I am  simply making clear that we, in Congress, must begin exercising the  same care and attention in doing our job as our troops do when  executing their missions downrange.   One of my primary motivations for serving the great State of Illinois  in the U.S. Senate is to help restore congressional war powers. To  remind my colleagues that whether one favors military action or opposes  the use of military force, every Member of Congress should agree that  such matters deserve to be debated and carefully considered by our  Nation's duly elected representatives in the broad light of day. To  remind my colleagues that we must always demand the Commander in Chief  clearly outline our desired strategic end state before authorizing  military action that puts our troops in harm's way.   The bottom line is that only Congress has the power to declare war.  We are the ones tasked with deciding when and how we send Americans  into combat. We are the ones the Constitution charged with that most  solemn duty.   For too long, too many elected officials have avoided the  responsibility and burden of declaring war. Fearing electoral risks and  staring down coming elections, multiple Congresses have shirked their  constitutional responsibility to our troops by refusing to repeal the  existing authorization for use of military force, while avoiding  consideration any new authorizations for use of military force.  Enough--enough of being so worried about political consequences that we  fail to do our own jobs, even as we expect our troops to do theirs  without complaint every day.   We need to do better by our servicemembers. We owe it to them to  honor their sacrifices. Part of that means ensuring that no American  sheds blood in a war Congress has not authorized, or unintentionally  authorized by passing vague language such as in amendment No. 861 that  can be twisted to be read as empowering President Trump to take  preemptive military action.   We should be disciplined in forcing any President who wishes to go to  war to bring their case to Congress and give the American people a vote  through their elected representatives. That is how we truly respect our  servicemembers and military families: by demanding debate that is  honest and clear-eyed about the likely loss of life and the risks of  escalation that accompany any use of force. It is our duty, and it is  the least we can do for those willing to risk their lives in  safeguarding our democracy, our way of life, and our Constitution.   So with the drums of war beating louder and louder by the day, I must  oppose amendment No. 861 and keep my promise to all who served or are  serving now in defense of this country we love. I must continue seeking  to hold all of us who have the honor of serving in Congress accountable  for taking back congressional war powers. Moving forward, I urge the  leadership of the Senate and House Armed Services Committees to work  with me to strike or significantly restrict this language during the  conference negotiations that will take place over the National Defense  Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020.                            ____________________
