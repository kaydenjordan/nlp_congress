 Madam Speaker, while the Members of the United States  Congress exit the Chamber, as they often do after whatever the majority  deems appropriate to have on the floor of the House--which there was  obviously the important National Defense Authorization Act-- nevertheless, in my home State of Texas, the people of Texas are under  siege with wide open borders.   And so right now, as we have Members of Congress, all 400 and  something of my colleagues, who just left the Chamber, they are going  off now to go have a steak dinner, go have a glass of wine, go hang out  with some of their colleagues, meet up with some folks here in the  District of Columbia.   But some 1,500 or maybe more miles away in Texas, we have a State and  a people who are dealing with the consequences of an administration  that fails to faithfully execute the laws of the United States and  leaves Texas wide open to be harmed, endangered, and nobody in this  body on the other side of the aisle seems to care in the slightest bit.   I went down to south Texas a couple weeks ago with my friend, Senator  Ted Cruz. We met with ranchers in Roma, Texas. We met with leaders and  ranchers and law enforcement in Uvalde, Texas. We met with the leaders  of Webb County in Laredo, Texas. We went down to McAllen, Texas. All  places that President Joe Biden has seemingly never been to in his 50  years of public service. Certainly hasn't been there since he has been  President.   The Vice President of the United States, who is allegedly in charge  of the border, hasn't found her way to any of these places that I  visited a mere 2 weeks ago.   The vast majority of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle  haven't found their way. Of course, one of my colleagues, the  gentlewoman from New York, a couple years ago somewhat famously found  her way down to the border to decry, quote, kids in cages.   Where is that colleague today? Wearing perhaps an all-white outfit  with red letters on it.   Where is the concern for the little girls whose legs have been  branded, burned by cartels?   Where is the concern for the 89 dead migrants, bodies found in Brooks  County, Texas? 89. Where is the concern?   My colleagues on the other side of the aisle like to go around  talking about how compassionate they are for those seeking to come to  the United States. They suggest that those of us who believe that the  border should be secure don't want Brown people in the United States.  That is what they not only imply, that is basically what they say.   Meanwhile, there are a hell of a lot of Brown people in south Texas  who are getting pretty ticked off at an administration that refuses to  actually secure the border while their families are in danger.   There are a whole lot of Brown people who work for the Border Patrol  who are feeling pretty darn unappreciated right now, when the White  House press secretary lies to the American people. The White House  press secretary lies on a daily basis to the American people.   Lie number one, perpetuating the lie that Border Patrol was whipping  migrants. It is a lie, and it is being repeated by my colleagues on the  other side of the aisle. It is a lie. The President of the United  States and those in charge of the press secretary are countenancing  this lie about Border Patrol.   This picture I am standing next to is a picture of Border Patrol with  one of their horses, interacting with a young boy, who is one of the  migrants from Haiti who is down in Del Rio.   The young fellow is having a good time with this Border Patrol agent  down on his knees. The Border Patrol agent is a man, probably with a  family. I don't know how old he is.   But I know a lot of Border Patrol agents because I actually go there.  I don't just dismiss Border Patrol agents as some sort of callous  individuals who don't care about human beings. But that is what my  colleagues on the other side of the aisle do every single day, led by  the President of the United States with a voice from a press secretary  who lies every single day about the state of our border, who lies every  single day about the actions of Border Patrol.   And then today, they had the audacity to take away horses, at least  in the Del Rio sector--I haven't been able to look at the entire  order--take away horses and the ability of Border Patrol to actually  try to patrol the border. This coming from people who have never been  to the dadgum border.   There are no navigable roads along the river. My Democrat colleagues  don't care. My Democrat colleagues don't care that Border Patrol can't  run along the river. You would think--at least in their politically  correct nonsense they espouse every day--that they wouldn't want them  to have to use automobiles, that maybe they could use horses to go down  to the river.   Not one of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle goes down and  meets with the ranchers, the Border Patrol agents who are dealing with  the actual outcome, the actual result of an administrative policy to  leave our borders wide open.   In the State of Texas, the Department of Public Safety has caught  over 400 pounds of fentanyl this year, compared to 10 pounds last year.  Dead Texans. Dead Texans as a direct result of this administration's  refusal, flat-out refusal to faithfully execute the laws of the United  States.   A Sweet'N Low packet of fentanyl in pure form would kill every member  of this body in this room. Certainly a few packets would. 10,000 pounds  of fentanyl has been intercepted this year. More than the last 3 years  combined.   Where are my Democratic colleagues? I asked this question when I was  in Laredo 2 weeks ago when I was standing next to the Hispanic county  judge of Webb County. A county judge in Texas is the chief  administrator of the county. I asked, Where is Joe Biden? When he got  up to the podium, he said, That is a great question, Where is Joe  Biden?    Well, if Joe Biden knows where he is, it would be helpful. He sure as  heck is not down at the border. He is sure as heck not down in Laredo,  and his policies are abandoning the people of Laredo and abandoning the  people of Texas.  [[Page H5130]]    The policies of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle leave  Texas dealing with the brunt of a wide open border, and they laugh it  off. They ignore it.   The stash houses in Houston, Texas, the stash houses in Del Rio, the  stash houses in Laredo, the stash houses in McAllen, the stash houses  up and down the border where little girls and little boys are being put  into the sex trafficking trade, my Democratic colleagues, who love to  pat themselves on the back for being compassionate, are nowhere to be  found. MIA.   Joe Biden, nowhere to be found while people die, while people die  from opioid overdoses, almost 100,000 this year in the United States.  When the cocaine problem was a big deal in the 1980s, we were talking  about 10,000. Now we are talking about 100,000.   Just where in the world are my colleagues on the other side of the  aisle?   I will tell you where they are, they are running around preaching  about masks and telling the people of Texas that small businesses in  Texas must force-vaccinate Texans if they have got more than 100  employees.   That is literally not in the Constitution, and it is fully  unconstitutional, unlawful, and I very strongly encourage the people of  Texas to look at the President of the United States and tell him to  pound sand. Do not follow that order. Do not accept it as legitimate.  It is not.   And this is a theme that the people of Texas are going to have to  come to grips with more and more, that when the President of the United  States impeachably refuses to faithfully execute the laws of the United  States, it is incumbent upon a free people in a sovereign State to come  up with the ways that they believe are important to defend their  borders, secure their citizenry, and take action, irrespective of the  orders of a President who fails to faithfully execute the laws of the  United States.                                time  2120    I do not make those statements lightly, because those statements mean  something. But we are under assault in Texas, and this administration  does not care. And worse yet, this administration is taking specific  action and specific inaction to purposely create the situation that we  are having to deal with on the frontlines in Texas.   Purposely reducing the enforcement of Title 42, which enables us to  turn people away at the border during a public health emergency,  pandemic environment where you can have communicable diseases like we  are dealing with right now. Purposely not using the return to Mexico  program, the migrant protection protocols to enables us to work with  Mexico to stem the tide. Where last year we had a few hundred thousand  people that we were apprehending at the border, today this year we have  1.4 million; and the year is not over yet. We will be well over 1.5 to  1.6 million people this fiscal year. Think about that. 208,000 in  August. 212,000 in July before the Haitians arrived in Del Rio.   And, by the way, if we are talking about the Haitians, none of my  colleagues on the other side of the aisle seem to care that along the  Rio Grande are drivers licenses from Chile, passports from Brazil,  because the people from Haiti who came to Del Rio weren't coming  directly from Haiti. We know this. They were in South America. And then  they got word because word is spreading around the globe, ladies and  gentlemen, world is spreading around the globe that this administration  says come to the United States, claim asylum, and walk right in.   Now the problem with that is it is the least compassionate thing you  can do. You endanger them on the journey. You endanger them through the  process so the cartels can abuse them. You harm the countries that they  are leaving from through the drain of their resources, labor, brain  drain, and you endanger the American people when you have a flood of  migrants coming in to a state that then has to deal with it.   Would any of my Democratic colleagues know what to do for the most  part if I airdropped them in to south Texas on a 5,000-acre ranch and  they had to walk through the scrub brush of south Texas running across  a rattlesnake and they go find a migrant dying out there from  dehydration? The vast majority of my latte-sipping, New York living,  condo-living colleagues on the other side of the aisle wouldn't have a  dadgum clue what to do when you run across that situation. But I can  tell you my Texan constituents and friends in south Texas are figuring  out what to do with human beings on their ranches.   Would any of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle like to  deal with the 89 dead bodies in Brooks county? Would they? Do they know  what to do when they walk up to a body that has been picked apart by  vultures and animals because that individual, that human being died on  their ranch? Is this an uncomfortable conversation for my colleagues on  the other side of the aisle when hundreds of human beings are dying in  the hot Texas Sun and county judges have to spend $3,000 per autopsy,  $5,000 for each to then bury them? They are trying to figure out how to  handle their budget when they have got COVID cases exploding.   But oh, no, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, they go  around talking about, oh, horses. Race baiting defines the party of my  colleagues on the other side of the aisle. It is the entire existence  of the party of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle that they  would take a situation that a Democratic President has created  purposefully and then dare to turn it into a race-focused situation.   I would like any of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to  stand and look in the eyes of the 70 percent of Border Patrol who are  Hispanic and tell them that they are racist. Because that is what they  do. My colleagues on the other side of the aisle, they go on TV and  they say they are racist. Al Sharpton flies down to go have a press  conference in Del Rio, Texas, trumpeting out and bringing out the race  card. Maxine Waters wants to compare Border Patrol agents using horses  to deal with a wide-open border and a chaos created by this  administration to slavery. It is absolutely abhorrent. It is  embarrassing. And the people of Texas are up to here with a Union that  is not all that united around the principles upon which we were founded  and that are showing precious little deference to the people of my  State. They are fed up. There is a tinder box, and my colleagues on the  other side of the aisle ignore it at the peril of the future of this  republic.   This is a big deal what is happening. The nine migrants that were in  an automobile in Boerne, Texas, two in the trunk, an American citizen  driving that car who was employed by the Cartel del Noreste heading to  a stash house in Houston, a young man had paid $4,000 to go pick grapes  in California had a rude wake-up call that he was heading to a stash  house; fortunately, law enforcement intercepted them.    This is happening every single day in our State. We know this because  we go down and we look. Senator Cruz and I go down to Laredo. We sit at  a checkpoint. I didn't see any of my Democratic colleagues there. With  the notable exception my friend, Henry Cuellar, who is probably the  lone Democrat who actually acknowledges the crisis that we have along  our southern border. And we watch these trucks go through with  scanners. One out of 10 trucks. And then we go down to the river, and  there are 33 migrants trying to come across the river. And we are  watching them cross the river. And they come out, and they swim, and  they are playing cat and mouse, knowing when we leave they are going to  come across. Then we get a scan on our phone from one of the scans that  came through right after we left the checkpoint with a truck full of 29  migrants in the back.   Every day this is happening. And these people are endangered. But my  Democratic colleagues don't care because of the crass cynicism of  electoral politics. That is what this is about.   The good news is the great Hispanic Texans of south Texas have had  enough. Zapata County went Republican for the first time since 1920.  When I drove through Zapata County just 2 weeks ago, I stopped because  I noticed a flag flying that had a certain colorful metaphor associated  with the President that I will not, of course, repeat here on the floor  of the House of Representatives. It may or may not be in line with a  chant that has been often used in a number of settings around our  country lately. In Zapata County.  [[Page H5131]]    In McAllen, a Republican mayor was recently elected. The fact is,  when people are ignored, when people are endangered, when people are  taken for granted, as Hispanic Americans every single day, and Hispanic  Texans in particular are experiencing every single day, they tend to  take that seriously.                                time  2130    They tend to recognize that an administration that gives lip service  to caring for them but lets them die and lets their businesses implode  and lets their ranches get run over and lets narcotics flow into their  community at will, all in the false name of compassion and pretending  that one cares about somebody because of the color of their skin, they  tend to take offense to that and believe that maybe there should be a  better way.   When I talk to people in Texas, they ask, quite frequently: What  precisely are we getting out of this deal? What does union even mean  anymore? What precisely is united about the United States?   How can one say that we have ``united'' States when the President of  the United States dictates unlawfully to a people that they must  forcefully vaccinate their employees.   Then thousands of their employees say: Hey, I don't want to do that  because I have natural immunity, and science seems to show that natural  immunity may be stronger than that that comes from a vaccine.   They tend to take offense. They tend to want to tell the  authoritarian to pound sand.   When the President of the United States, through his HHS Secretary,  walks in and says: Oh, I am sorry, Texas. I am sorry, Florida. We are  going to cut your monoclonal antibody treatments in half. We are going  to limit your ability to get care. We are going to try to run a  campaign against certain medicines that might actually provide care for  your loved ones, and we are going to do so out of some sort of fealty  to bureaucrats at CDC and NIH and, namely, Dr. Fauci.   The people are then relegated to the corner, trying to figure out how  to care for themselves when a cronyistic healthcare system run by  bureaucrats in government and bureaucrats in an insurance industry that  is, frankly, corrupt, a healthcare system run by corporations in bed  with government bureaucrats, getting taxpayer funds to enrich them and  leaving small businesses and individuals in this country--Texans I  represent--holding the bag, while the President of the United States  limits their ability to get healthcare and then mandates they get a  vaccine and then goes off to parties, like my colleagues on the other  side of the aisle tend to do, maskless, while preaching wearing masks.  Because it is all theater. It is all a show, except that it is very  real, and it is very focused on accruing power in Washington, D.C.   My warning to my colleagues is this: Americans tend to take that sort  of thing seriously. While we watch people in Australia, and we watch  people in Paris, and we watch people in Canada even, and we watch  people around the globe resisting the tyranny of government, the United  States is filled with people who similarly are predisposed to want to  resist the power of the Federal Government. And they tend to take it  very seriously.   My warning to my colleagues is that if this body, the people's House,  expects for this country to be united, then it needs to darn well act  like it and stop trying to force the will of a Federal Government  against the constitutional framework that we agreed to over the people  of the State that I represent because the people of the State that I  represent are not going to sit back and let that happen.   This is where we are. This is the question of our day. Are we going  to agree to disagree and live peaceably together? Or are we going to  force tensions and force conflict, which this Democrat-led government  in the executive branch and the legislative branch is hellbent on doing  and forcing the people that I represent to have to start asking  questions about what we are going to do to preserve freedom for our  children and our grandchildren to go to the doctor of our choice, to go  to the school of our choice, to not have our children being  indoctrinated with critical race theory, with dangerous principles of  race-baiting, teaching our kids that America is evil, restricting the  ability of our people to be able to go to a doctor because they have to  go to a bureaucrat to get permission before getting healthcare, trying  to restrict the ability of the American people to arm themselves while  leaving our border wide open and defunding our police, and then daring  to question why we want to be armed?   That is how the people of Texas are viewing the assault on their  constitutional rights and the structure of government that was designed  to protect liberty and to allow us to agree to disagree.   But my colleagues on the other side of the aisle refuse, on a daily  basis, to allow us to agree to disagree. That is a dangerous position  by my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. It is a dangerous  position by this President.   It is a dangerous position by the administration because there is  going to be a lot of people in at least the State that I represent, and  I speculate a lot more, who are not going to sit by and allow a  Federal Government to run amuck over their liberties and to tell them  how to live their lives.    We are not going to sit back and allow cartels to run over our  border; to have drugs pour into our communities; to have crimes  committed on our streets; to have migrants dying on our ranches, fences  cut, livestock loose; children in the sex trafficking trade, while my  Democrat colleagues march down to Del Rio and cry racism because it is  the only card they can ever pull out of an empty deck, a deck not  committed to the principles of power on which this Nation was founded  or the flag which sits above the dais, but rather a dedication to a  leftist, socialist, Marxist way of thinking and a belief in the all- power of the all-knowing of the authority of those in government to  tell the people what to do.   But that is not the way the American people view their position in a  government whose Constitution starts with three words: ``We the  people.''   We have abandoned those first three words, ``we the people,'' and  that the power of this government is built upon a foundation of the  power coming from ``we the people'' and those Bill of Rights that are  in there to protect the people from the power of government. We are  abandoning those on a daily basis.   I am amazed at the extent to which my colleagues on this side of the  aisle, quite frankly, are just all too often able to just go give a  speech, go get on a news show, put out a press statement about how bad  the border is, and then: Oh, let's move on to the next issue. Let's  move on to the next topic.   When all of these headlines about the Haitians in Del Rio subside,  where will everybody be? Will my colleagues, even on my side of the  aisle, wake up every day like we do dealing with this in Texas and  understand what is happening, understand how bad a fentanyl epidemic is  in this country?   Do the people in this body have the first clue that it is our  policies that are enabling China to use cartels to exploit an open  border to kill Americans? And do they care? Not in the slightest bit.   Then, I watch my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, frankly-- today, we spent all day, almost 12 hours now--I guess probably 8  hours--offering amendments to the NDAA.                                time  2140    Not one of those amendments that we voted on today, not one, allowed  us to address and debate here on the floor of the House of  Representatives the drafting of our daughters, the drafting of our  mothers, the drafting of our sisters, the drafting of our wives. Not  one amendment today was allowed by Democrat tyranny in the Rules  Committee to allow us to have a substantive debate on the floor of the  House of Representatives about an issue as important as having the  United States Government conscript women.   Can you image that? Can you imagine a body that is called the  people's House, having an environment in which we pass legislation as  part of an $800 billion defense authorization bill that had some 400  amendments we didn't even debate on the floor of this House? We didn't  even debate the drafting of women.   And more than half of my colleagues on this side of the aisle said,  Oh, sure, why not? Why? Because they sit there and they say, Well, the  draft will never occur. Well, don't worry, if the draft  [[Page H5132]]  does occur, it will be because we have some real bad conflict with  somebody like China. Well, which is it? You got to have the draft in  order to deal with a bad conflict with China or there will never be a  draft?   Oh, well, okay. There will never be a draft, but if there is, it will  be a bad conflict with China. But trust us. Don't worry, your daughter  won't be drafted into combat.   Really? Trust us? In what universe should I trust the Government of  the United States? Why would I do that? The same government that just  abandoned allies, abandoned Americans, abandoned SIVs in Afghanistan,  left $85 billion worth of equipment for the Taliban to exploit, allowed  China to be able to get access to Bagram Air Base, and walked away from  rare earth minerals.   The same government that is completely ignoring their duty to enforce  the borders, knowingly, when they have a mechanism to secure and  enforce our borders. The same government, when the President's own  press secretary is lying on a daily basis through her teeth about  supposedly horses whipping human beings. Thoroughly debunked.   Is that the same government I am supposed to trust not to draft my  10-year-old daughter when she becomes 18 and is forced by the power of  government to register for Selective Service? Who are we as a people?  What happened to us? Are we such a cold, robotic people that we can't  have an actual debate and discussion about the reality of life? Is that  who we are?   The same doctor, with a cold stare, who looked at my dear friend and  told her she should abort her little boy because of a brain scan that  went a little amok. She was coming up on the term in which you can do  that in the Commonwealth of Virginia, and she chose life. And now her  son is my godson, and he is a healthy little boy. The same coldness  with which that doctor looked at my friend, and said, you should abort,  in front of her two other boys with her husband not there.   Is that what we have become, such a cold country, such a callous  country, that we just blindly say that in the false name of equality or  equity or whatever the word of choice is of the day, that we must draft  our daughters? Let me be clear. Over my dead body will you draft my  daughter. I mean that literally. Over my dead body will you draft my  daughter.   And yet that is precisely what happened today with no debates, no  amendment allowed. And my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, and I  am particularly ashamed of my colleagues on this side of the aisle, for  whispering in closed doors about, well, I would have voted against that  if we would have had it on the floor. I tried to oppose it in  committee, but, you know, it is the NDAA and so, you know, we have got  to support the NDAA, we have got pay raises for troops, and never mind  all the other garbage that is in the bill. We have got to support it.  For 60 straight years, we have got to support it.   You know why the Department of Defense is a complete mess? You want  to know why the brass is completely inept and unable to actually run a  war, unable to actually exit a country when a President gives a  ridiculous order to exit on September 11 for optics? You want to know  why the Department of Defense is completely inept? Because we have been  authorizing it and funding it for decades. And my colleagues on this  side of the aisle are just as guilty, if not more.   And now my colleagues on this side of the aisle say, Sure, draft my  daughters. And I say, as I have said to them, that a vote for this NDAA  today was a vote to conscript our daughters. Let me tell each and every  one of you across this country, that is precisely what it was. And do  not let any Member of this body get away with hiding or running from  the simple fact that today this body voted to conscript our daughters.   Imagine that one day when you are sitting in your house and the  lottery number comes up for your wife and not for you. What are you  going to do? Or for your daughter and not you. What are you going to  do?    The President of the United States has in multiple regards engaged in  what I believe to be impeachable conduct. The President of the United  States has failed to faithfully execute the laws of the United States,  left our borders wide open, endangered our people, endangered the  people of my State.   The President of the United States has failed to carry out his duty  to defend the United States abroad, has in fact aided and abetted the  enemy by leaving billions of dollars of equipment for our enemies to  use against us, leaving Americans behind, leaving allies behind.   The President of the United States has abused the power of his office  to step over the bounds of the Constitution to order people--order  people--to force their employees to get vaccinated when he has no such  authority. He has no such authority, and he knows it. He knows it.   For the exact same reason that the President of the United States  admitted that he didn't have the power to extend the eviction  moratorium. He flat out admitted it and said he was only going to do it  until such time as the courts could hear the case and make a decision.  That same President knows full well that his orders are  unconstitutional, but he does not care. And that is an abuse of power.   That same President knows that the borders are being exploited and  wide open and the cartels are endangering the American people and the  migrants who seek to come here, but he does not care. And that is  faithless execution of the laws. The President of the United States  knows full well.   Heck, my 12-year-old son knows full well, as he said as we were  driving around, he said: Dad, why would you leave the equipment there  for the bad guys to get? Well, son, maybe you should be an advisor to  the President of the United States because he doesn't seem to  understand that concept, and neither does the Chairman of the Joint  Chiefs of Staff, and neither does the Secretary of Defense.                                time  2150    Because they are so focused on chief diversity officers, woke  policies, and critical race theory, they don't give a rat's rear end  about defending the United States of America. It is for that same  reason my Democrat colleagues have gone down to the river and gone down  to south Texas playing the race card and chanting racism and comparing  Border Patrol agents to slaveholders.   Where is the Secretary of Homeland Security defending the people who  work for him and Border Patrol while they are outmanned, exhausted, and  resigning because they are not being given what they need in support  from the top leaders of Homeland Security?   Secretary Mayorkas has the experience to know full well that  abandoning title 42 and abandoning MPP, the migrant protection  protocols, he knows full well that that endangers the people of this  country, and he does not care. He is leaving the people of south Texas  exposed. He is leaving the ranchers who work there endangered with  fences cut down and ranchers having to figure out how to protect their  families and ranchers sending their children out across the ranches  armed to defend themselves. Ranchers are finding the dead bodies of  migrants on ranches, hundreds of them.   That is faithless execution of the laws. That is why the Secretary of  Homeland Security is acting with impeachable conduct.   The American people are getting sick of this. The people of Texas are  getting sick of this.   My admonition to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle is: Be  very careful of walking this perilous journey of authoritarian actions  by a President, authoritarian actions by an administration, and  authoritarian legislating by a Congress that is ignoring our  constitutional framework, ignoring federalism, ignoring separation of  powers, ignoring their duties under the Constitution, and endangering  the people I represent on a daily basis because this will not turn out  well.   The people of Texas are not going to simply sit back and take it. The  Governor of Texas has been deploying Department of Public Safety  personnel to Del Rio. We have more DPS people in Del Rio than Border  Patrol. We have more assets and more aerial activity; and but for the  actions of the Governor of the State of Texas moving DPS down to Del  Rio, the crisis would have truly exploded.  [[Page H5133]]    But that is only a step. The Governor of the State of Texas and the  $3 billion that the Texas legislature appropriated and deployed, and  the DPS is down there working and arresting bad actors and arresting  people for trespass, the State of Texas is going to have to go further  because the Federal Government is refusing to do its job.   At some point the State of Texas is going to force a constitutional  showdown because it will be incumbent upon the people of Texas to do  so. It will be incumbent upon the people of Texas to tell the rest of  the country to get out of our doggone way so that we can defend the  people of our State. This is where we are.   While my colleagues decry the fact that Texans believe that we should  protect life once it has a heartbeat, while my colleagues decry the  fact that we believe we should protect life, and while my colleagues  allow migrants to die, Texans want to simply keep their communities  safe, and Texans are going to do so.   The people's House is supposed to mean something, Madam Speaker. The  people's House is supposed to be a place where we are able to come  together and agree under the Constitution on how to have a more perfect  Union.   But Union doesn't mean anything when the people of my State are being  trampled. Union doesn't mean anything when the rights of the people I  represent are not being respected, when the safety of the people that I  represent is not being protected or secured. And when the blessings of  liberty that are supposed to be secured under the Constitution are not  being secured but being trampled upon, then it will beg questions about  the efficacy of Union.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
