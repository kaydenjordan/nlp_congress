 Madam Speaker, I rise tonight in opposition to the  objection.    Madam Speaker, as a nation, we have endured trying  times and overcome many challenges, and now we face an unprecedented  effort to ignore the will of the American people and the people of  Arizona. Given the facts and the unprecedented events of tonight, this  effort must be finished, and America can be united again. That is going  to take leadership.   We are all leaders.   We are elected to be leaders. And if we are going to do that, we have  to do it from respect to others, the idea that truth is important, that  factual content is important, that we are going to tell the American  people what is going on in this country and not what we hope they hear  from a 30-second sound bite.   I used to be a homicide investigator. My job was to follow the facts,  develop a case, make decisions and recommendations based on where those  facts led me. Following the process means that decisions cannot be made  on rumors and innuendos alone.   I am proud to say that Arizona has used mail-in voting for over two  decades. Both Republicans and Democrats  [[Page H92]]  have long been proud of how our State has administered elections.   In 2020, over 65 percent of eligible Arizonans voted, a record  number. Our Republican Governor, Republican attorney general,  Democratic secretary of state, and our State's election administrators  and volunteers worked with integrity to administer a fair election.   We saw turnout increases in both Republican and Democratic areas,  and, in fact, more Republicans registered in this election than any  other party. I am proud that many of our Tribal, rural, and underserved  communities voted in record numbers, all during a pandemic. In 2020,  Arizonans made their voices heard.   The fact is, multiple Federal and State judges, agencies, and State  elected officials concluded the winner was Joe Biden.   In Arizona, this process was administered and overseen by officials  from both parties. Election officials conducted random, hand-counted  audits of many precincts that confirmed there were no errors that would  change the result of the election.   The fact is that the Republican chairman of Maricopa County, the  largest Republican county in the State, the biggest population county,  stated: ``More than 2 million ballots were cast in Maricopa County, and  there is no evidence of fraud or misconduct or malfunction.''   He concluded: ``No matter how you voted, this election was  administered with integrity, transparency, and in accordance with State  laws.''   The fact is, the President, his campaign, and several Republican-led  groups filed eight election lawsuits, all of which were dismissed. The  Arizona Supreme Court, a body where all justices have been appointed by  Republican Governors, unanimously dismissed the case.                                time  2215    The justices found that the party had ``failed to present any  evidence of `misconduct,' or `illegal votes' . . . let alone establish  any degree of fraud or a significant error rate that would undermine  the certainty of the election results.''   After these judicial rulings, the Governor said: ``I trust our  election system. There's integrity in our election system.''   The fact is, Joe Biden is the certified winner of Arizona's 11  electoral votes. Arizona's elected and appointed officials from both  parties followed the facts and came to this conclusion. I urge my  colleagues to do the same.   To my colleagues across the aisle, I know we may disagree on who we  want as President, but what we personally want is not what matters  here. Rather, the people's influence, as reflected in the certified  electoral college results, is what matters. Facts matter.   Undermining faith in our election process by attempting to mislead  the American public only serves to weaken us and make us vulnerable to  foreign actors who do us harm. For the good of our country, this must  stop. Now is the time to come together to preserve our democracy and to  protect our national security.   I know my constituents are looking to Congress to move past its  divisions, find common ground, and pass legislation to improve the  lives of struggling families. We must stay focused on fighting the  pandemic. We must work to ensure all Americans can be vaccinated as  soon as possible so we can save American lives, safely reopen schools,  get people back to work, and visit loved ones again. I urge my  colleagues to follow this.
