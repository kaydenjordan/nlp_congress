 Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules  and pass the bill (S. 1872) to award a Congressional Gold Medal,  collectively, to the United States Army Rangers Veterans of World War  II in recognition of their extraordinary service during World War II.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 1872         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``United States Army Rangers       Veterans of World War II Congressional Gold Medal Act''.       SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.         In this Act--        (1) the term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary of the       Treasury; and        (2) the term ``United States Army Rangers Veteran of World       War II'' means any individual who--        (A) served in the Armed Forces--        (i) honorably;        (ii) in an active duty status; and        (iii) at any time during the period beginning on June 19,       1942, and ending on September 2, 1945; and        (B) was assigned to a Ranger Battalion of the Army at any       time during the period described in subparagraph (A)(iii).       SEC. 3. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) In World War II, the Army formed 6 Ranger Battalions       and 1 provisional battalion. All members of the Ranger       Battalions were volunteers. The initial concept of Ranger       units drew from the British method of using highly trained       ``commando'' units and the military tradition of the United       States of utilizing light infantry for scouting and raiding       operations.        (2) The Ranger Battalions of World War II consisted of--        (A) the 1st Ranger Infantry Battalion, which was activated       on June 19, 1942, in Northern Ireland;        (B) the 2d Ranger Infantry Battalion, which was activated       on April 1, 1943, at Camp Forrest, Tennessee;        (C) the 3d Ranger Infantry Battalion, which was--        (i) activated as provisional on May 21, 1943, in North       Africa; and        (ii) constituted on July 21, 1943, and concurrently       consolidated with the provisional unit described in clause       (i);        (D) the 4th Ranger Infantry Battalion, which was--        (i) activated as provisional on May 29, 1943, in North       Africa; and        (ii) constituted on July 21, 1943, and concurrently       consolidated with the provisional unit described in clause       (i);        (E) the 5th Ranger Infantry Battalion, which was activated       on September 1, 1943, at Camp Forrest, Tennessee;        (F) the 6th Ranger Infantry Battalion, which was--        (i) originally activated on January 20, 1941, at Fort       Lewis, Washington, as the 98th Field Artillery Battalion; and        (ii) converted and redesignated on September 26, 1944, as       the 6th Ranger Infantry Battalion; and        (G) the 29th Ranger Infantry Battalion, a provisional Army       National Guard unit that was--        (i) activated on December 20, 1942, at Tidworth Barracks,       England; and        (ii) disbanded on October 18, 1943.        (3) The first combat operations of Army Rangers occurred on       August 19, 1942, when 50 Rangers took part in the British-      Canadian raid on the French coastal town of Dieppe.        (4) The 1st Ranger Battalion, under the leadership of Major       William O. Darby, was used in full strength during the       landings at Arsew, Algeria, during the North African       campaign. Due to the success of the Rangers in several       difficult battles, particularly at El Guettar in March and       April of 1943, 2 additional Ranger Battalions were organized       in North Africa.        (5) During the North African campaign, the 1st Ranger       Battalion was awarded battle honors for its actions in       Tunisia. On March 20, 1943, the Battalion penetrated enemy       lines and captured the position Djebel el Ank in a nighttime       attack, taking more than 200 prisoners. Two days later, the       battalion was attacked by the 10th Panzer division of the       German Afrika Korps and, despite heavy losses, continued to       defend its position. The following day, the 1st Battalion       counterattacked to clear high ground overlooking the       positions held by the Armed Forces. These actions       demonstrated the ability of the Rangers to fight in difficult       terrain and the courage to endure despite being outnumbered       and exposed to heavy enemy fire.        (6) The 29th provisional Ranger Battalion was formed from       volunteers drawn from the 29th Infantry Division stationed in       England in the fall of 1942. The Battalion was activated on       December 20, 1942, and accompanied British commandos on 3       small-scale raids in Norway. Nineteen members of the 29th       Ranger Battalion conducted a raid on a German radar site in       France on the night of September 3, 1943. After that raid,       the 29th Ranger Battalion was disbanded because new Ranger       units, the 2d and 5th Battalions, were being formed.        (7) During the summer and fall of 1943, the 1st, 3d, and       4th Ranger Battalions were heavily involved in the campaign       in Sicily and the landings in Italy. The 1st and 4th Ranger       Battalions conducted a night amphibious landing in Sicily and       secured the landing beaches for the main force. The 3d       Battalion landed separately at Licata, Sicily, and was able       to silence gun positions on an 82-foot cliff overlooking the       invasion beaches.  [[Page H4739]]         (8) During the invasion of Italy, the 1st and 4th Ranger       Battalions landed at Maiori with the mission of seizing the       high ground and protecting the flank of the remainder of the       main landing by the United States. Enemy forces in the area       were estimated to outnumber the Rangers by approximately 8 to       1. Despite these odds, the Rangers took the position and held       off 7 enemy counterattacks.        (9) After the invasion of Italy, Rangers continued to be       used, often in night attacks, to seize key terrain ahead of       the advancing Allied forces. At the Anzio beachhead, the       majority of the 1st, 3d, and 4th Ranger Battalions sustained       heavy casualties after being cut off behind German lines. The       Rangers had planned to infiltrate German positions under the       cover of darkness and make a dawn attack on a critical road       junction but were pinned down by enemy tanks and an elite       German paratrooper unit. After 12 hours of desperate fighting       and a failed relief attempt, the majority of the Ranger force       was killed, wounded, or captured. Only 6 Rangers from the 1st       and 3d Battalions, out of more than 767 men, returned to       friendly lines. The 4th Battalion, which had been in reserve,       also suffered 60 killed and 120 wounded out of 550 men. These       3 battalions were inactivated and the survivors were       transferred to other units.        (10) In the United States, and later in Scotland, the 2d       and 5th Ranger Battalions were formed to undertake operations       in Western Europe. Those Battalions were engaged on D-Day,       assaulting German positions at the Pointe du Hoc coastal       battery, and remained in combat through September of 1944.       Specifically, Rangers in the 2d Battalion, under the command       of Lieutenant Colonel James E. Rudder--        (A) overcame mines, machine gun fire, and enemy artillery       while scaling the 100-foot high cliffs at Pointe du Hoc;        (B) held against intense German efforts to retake the       position; and        (C) after reaching the top of the cliffs, moved inland       roughly 1 mile and sustained heavy casualties while searching       for, and ultimately destroying, a German heavy artillery       battery.        (11) During June, July, and August of 1944, the 2d and 5th       Ranger Battalions were engaged in the campaign in Brest,       which included close-range fighting in hedgerows and numerous       villages. Later, in operations in Western Germany, the       Battalions were frequently used to attack in darkness and       gain vital positions to pave the way for the main Army       attacks.        (12) During the final drive into Germany in late February       and early March 1945, the 5th Ranger Battalion was cited for       battle honors for outstanding performance. Under the cover of       darkness, the unit drove into German lines and blocked the       main German supply route in the sector. The Germans attacked       the position of the Rangers from both sides, resulting in       heavy Ranger casualties during 5 days of fighting. As a       result of the actions of the Rangers, the main Army attack       was able to overcome German defenses more easily, occupy the       vital city of Trier, and reach the Rhine River.        (13) The 6th Ranger Battalion operated in the Pacific. In       the most notable exploit of the 6th Ranger Battalion, in       January and February of 1945, the Battalion formed the       nucleus of a rescue force that liberated more than 500 Allied       prisoners, including prisoners from the United States, from       the Cabanatuan prisoner of war camp in the Philippines. With       the help of local Filipino guerillas, the Rangers, led by       Lieutenant Colonel Henry A. Mucci, demonstrated extraordinary       heroism by infiltrating Japanese-held territory to reach the       prisoners of war and prevent them from being killed by the       Japanese. After a 25-mile march at night through the jungle,       the unit killed all Japanese sentries with no loss of life of       the prisoners of war. The unit successfully returned to       American lines having lost only 2 soldiers killed and having       another 2 wounded.        (14) The 1st Ranger Infantry Battalion--        (A) participated in the campaigns of--        (i) Algeria-French Morocco (with arrowhead);        (ii) Tunisia;        (iii) Sicily (with arrowhead);        (iv) Naples-Foggia (with arrowhead);        (v) Anzio (with arrowhead); and        (vi) Rome-Arno; and        (B) for its contributions, received--        (i) the Presidential Unit Citation (Army) and streamer       embroidered with ``EL GUETTAR''; and        (ii) the Presidential Unit Citation (Army) and streamer       embroidered with ``SALERNO''.        (15) The 2d Ranger Infantry Battalion--        (A) participated in the campaigns of--        (i) Normandy (with arrowhead);        (ii) Northern France;        (iii) Rhineland;        (iv) Ardennes-Alsace; and        (v) Central Europe; and        (B) for its contributions, received--        (i) the Presidential Unit Citation (Army) and streamer       embroidered with ``POINTE DU HOE''; and        (ii) the French Croix de Guerre with Silver-Gilt Star,       World War II, and streamer embroidered with ``POINTE DU       HOE''.        (16) The 3d Ranger Infantry Battalion--        (A) participated in the campaigns of--        (i) Sicily (with arrowhead);        (ii) Naples-Foggia (with arrowhead);        (iii) Anzio (with arrowhead); and        (iv) Rome-Arno; and        (B) for its contributions, received the Presidential Unit       Citation (Army) and streamer embroidered with ``SALERNO''.        (17) The 4th Ranger Infantry Battalion--        (A) participated in the campaigns of--        (i) Sicily (with arrowhead);        (ii) Naples-Foggia (with arrowhead);        (iii) Anzio (with arrowhead); and        (iv) Rome-Arno; and        (B) for its contributions, received the Presidential Unit       Citation (Army) and streamer embroidered with ``SALERNO''.        (18) The 5th Ranger Infantry Battalion--        (A) participated in the campaigns of--        (i) Normandy (with arrowhead);        (ii) Northern France;        (iii) Rhineland;        (iv) Ardennes-Alsace; and        (v) Central Europe; and        (B) for its contributions, received--        (i) the Presidential Unit Citation (Army) and streamer       embroidered with ``NORMANDY BEACHHEAD'';        (ii) the Presidential Unit Citation (Army) and streamer       embroidered with ``SAAR RIVER AREA''; and        (iii) the French Croix de Guerre with Silver-Gilt Star,       World War II, and streamer embroidered with ``NORMANDY''.        (19) The 6th Ranger Infantry Battalion--        (A) participated in the campaigns of--        (i) New Guinea;        (ii) Leyte (with arrowhead); and        (iii) Luzon; and        (B) for its contributions, received--        (i) the Presidential Unit Citation (Army) and streamer       embroidered with ``CEBU, LUZON''; and        (ii) the Philippine Presidential Unit Citation and streamer       embroidered with ``17 OCTOBER 1944 TO 4 JULY 1945''.        (20) The United States will be forever indebted to the       United States Army Rangers Veterans of World War II, whose       bravery and sacrifice in combat contributed greatly to the       military success of the United States and the allies of the       United States.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend  their remarks and insert extraneous material thereon.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Today, I rise in strong support of S. 1872, the Army Rangers Veterans  of  [[Page H4740]]  World War II Congressional Gold Medal Act. This bill honors the service  of the men of the U.S. Army Rangers whose courageous actions in the  European, North African, and Pacific theaters during World War II were  essential to ensuring victory for the Allied Powers.   At the onset of World War II, there were no U.S. Army units capable  of performing highly specialized raiding missions like that of their  British Commandos counterparts. To resolve this, Brigadier General  Lucian K. Truscott, Jr., proposed the creation of Army Ranger  Battalions to General George Marshall. These small, highly specialized,  and independent units drew upon existing American expertise, using  light infantry units for raids and scouting.   Captain William O. Darby was selected as the 1st Ranger Battalion  commander due to his experience in amphibious training and operational  experience in both cavalry and infantry. Darby immediately went about  recruiting volunteers, 473 of whom became the 1st Ranger Battalion.   Thereafter, the 2nd through 6th Ranger Battalions were formed, along  with the 29th provisional Ranger Battalion, comprised of members of the  Army National Guard.   The 1st Ranger Battalion was given the initial mission of taking part  in the British and Canadian raid in Dieppe in France, making them the  first American troops to see ground combat in Europe. Following this  raid, the 1st Ranger Battalion operated primarily throughout North  Africa and Italy, where they and members of the 3rd Ranger Battalion  played a crucial role in the operational success of the Battle of  Anzio.   The 29th provisional Ranger Battalion participated in several smaller  raids in Norway and France and was then disbanded due to the new  formation of the 2nd and 5th Ranger Battalions, who took part in  campaigns in France, Belgium, and Central Europe, including Alsace,  Brest, and most famously, the invasion of Normandy on D-day.   The 3rd and 4th Ranger Battalions conducted missions across Italy,  while the 6th Ranger Battalion engaged in combat in the Pacific  theater, primarily in the Philippines and New Guinea. The 6th Ranger  Battalion is best known for its part in the rescue of more than 500  prisoners of war in the raid of the prison camp at Cabanatuan, which is  the largest rescue operation in American history.   Following the war, all seven Ranger Infantry Battalions received the  Presidential Unit Citation for their extensive contributions to the  Allied war effort, and I believe their heroism ought to be recognized  and rewarded further still.   I urge my colleagues to support S. 1872, and I reserve the balance of  my time.    Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers,  and I am prepared to close.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time until Mr. Hill yields  back.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of  my time.   Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Iowa, Senator Ernst, for  sponsoring S. 1872, along with my colleague, the gentleman from  Colorado, Congressman Crow, for introducing its companion version in  the House.   The Army Rangers veterans of World War II deserve this accolade for  their tireless courage, grit, determination, and dedication to their  country. The heroism they demonstrated throughout the war made an  incalculable contribution to the Allied victory. They are truly the  embodiment of their motto: ``Rangers Lead the Way.''   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on S. 1872, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules  and pass the bill (H.R. 5911) to amend the Federal Deposit Insurance  Act and the Federal Credit Union Act to expand employment opportunities  for those with a previous minor criminal offense, and for other  purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5911         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Fair Hiring in Banking       Act''.       SEC. 2. FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE ACT.         Section 19 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C.       1829) is amended--        (1) by inserting after subsection (b) the following:        ``(c) Exceptions.--        ``(1) Certain older offenses.--        ``(A) In general.--With respect to an individual,       subsection (a) shall not apply to an offense if--        ``(i) it has been 7 years or more since the offense       occurred;

and        ``(ii) does not include probation or parole where an       individual was restricted to a particular jurisdiction or was       required to report occasionally to an individual or a       specific location.        ``(C) Bad check criteria.--In setting the criteria for de       minimis offenses under subparagraph (A), if the Corporation       establishes criteria with respect to insufficient funds       checks, the Corporation shall require that the aggregate       total face value of all insufficient funds checks across all       convictions or program entries related to insufficient funds       checks is $2,000 or less.        ``(D) Designated lesser offenses.--Subsection (a) shall not       apply to certain lesser offenses (including the use of a fake       ID, shoplifting, trespass, fare evasion, driving with an       expired license or tag, and such other low-risk offenses as       the Corporation may designate) if 1 year or more has passed       since the applicable conviction or program entry.'';

SEC. 5. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend  their remarks on this legislation and to include extraneous material  thereon.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 5911, the Fair Hiring  in Banking Act. I thank the chair of our Subcommittee on Diversity and  Inclusion, Congresswoman Joyce Beatty, for this important piece of  legislation and the Members of both sides of the aisle who came  together to support this bill.   For far too long, American citizens, especially people of color, who  have paid their debt to society have continued to face unnecessary  barriers to employment within the financial services industry.   Black and Latinx people are over-policed and face harsher prosecution  and sentencing than their White peers for the same crimes. Arrest  records for such convictions often prevent individuals from securing  employment, putting them at higher risk of homelessness and recidivism.   Until recent changes by the FDIC and the NCUA, if a bank or credit  union wanted to hire an individual who is highly qualified but happens  to have a couple of minor drug possession violations on their record  from 30 years ago, they would need to go through a cumbersome process  for filing for a waiver from the FDIC or NCUA to allow them to hire  this highly qualified individual. This is true whether the job that  they are applying for is a janitor or a bank teller.   These kinds of policies created entirely unnecessary and unjustified  barriers to employment for highly qualified individuals who have done  their time and who deserve to be given a second chance to reintegrate  into society.   This bill would codify and expand on these recent changes from the  FDIC and NCUA to break down these barriers. In particular, this bill  reduces the lookback period for certain criminal charges from an  indeterminate timeline to 7 years, or 5 years from the time a person is  released from incarceration.   The bill also makes it clear that criminal offenses that have been  expunged, sealed, or dismissed are not included in the FDIC or NCUA  review of eligibility to work for an insured bank or credit union.   This bill also would build on the administrative changes that FDIC  and NCUA have made by providing statutory clarity and the definition of  certain crimes of dishonesty that receive special treatment under their  rules.   We must ensure that those who have successfully paid their debt to  society are not arbitrarily denied job opportunities that they  otherwise are qualified to do.   Again, I thank Chair Beatty for introducing this important bill, and  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting it.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Ohio (Mrs. Beatty).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of  my time.   H.R. 5911 is just the next step toward addressing employment barriers  for justice-involved individuals. More must be done, and I am glad that  we can agree in a bipartisan manner to provide this opportunity with  fair access to employment opportunities at banks and credit unions.   I thank Chair Beatty for this bill, and I again urge my colleagues to  join me in supporting this important H.R. 5911.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules  and pass the bill (H.R. 5914) to amend the Investor Protection and  Securities Reform Act of 2010 to provide grants to States for enhanced  protection of senior investors and senior policyholders, and for other  purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5914         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and  extend their remarks on this legislation and to insert extraneous  material thereon.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise to voice my support for H.R. 5914, the  Empowering States to Protect Seniors from Bad Actors Act. I thank Mr.  Gottheimer for introducing this legislation that provides grants to  State securities regulators to support programs that protect senior  investors. I also thank Mr. McHenry, the minority spokesperson, for  working with us on this important bill.   Madam Speaker, seniors are particularly vulnerable to investment  frauds, scams, and deceptive practices. In October of last year, in its  annual report on elder fraud and abuse, the Department of Justice  reported that in 2020 alone, seniors suffered over $1 billion in  financial losses due to fraud.   State securities and insurance regulators are on the front lines of  protecting our investors. The SEC, with the support of its Investor  Advocate and Division of Enforcement, is well placed to evaluate and  administer grant programs to bolster State regulators' efforts to  better protect senior investors.   This bill is widely supported by investor advocates and State  securities regulators, including the North American Securities  Administrators Association, the Consumer Federation of America, Public  Citizen, and the CFA Institute.   Madam Speaker, I, again, thank Members on both sides for coming  together on this bill, and I urge its passage.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Garcia).  [[Page H4746]]         Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of  my time.   Madam Speaker, this is a strongly bipartisan bill aimed to strengthen  senior investment protection programs at our States' securities and  insurance regulators. It will help protect millions of seniors who are  vulnerable to scams and fraudsters.   I thank Mr. Gottheimer for his leadership on this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules  and pass the bill (H.R. 935) to amend the Securities Exchange Act of  1934 to exempt from registration brokers performing services in  connection with the transfer of ownership of smaller privately held  companies, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 935         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and  extend their remarks on this legislation and to include extraneous  material thereon.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today to urge passage of H.R. 935, the Small  Business Mergers, Acquisitions, Sales, and Brokerage Simplification Act  of 2021. I thank its lead sponsors, Congressman Huizenga, who serves as  the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Investor Protection,  Entrepreneurship and Capital Markets, as well as Congresswoman Maloney  who served as the chairwoman of the same subcommittee last Congress.   Congressman Huizenga and Congresswoman Maloney have come together to  put forth a commonsense bill, which provides relief for small and  midsize businesses who are looking to merge or sell their companies.   Generally, mergers and acquisitions brokers act as intermediaries who  conduct negotiated sales of privately held small- and medium-sized  companies. These so-called M&A brokers essentially help facilitate the  transfer of ownership and control of such companies to a buyer.   The Securities and Exchange Commission, which oversees brokers, can  become involved in these transactions because M&A brokers facilitate  securities transactions when they connect a selling company to a buyer.   In 2014, the SEC, via a no-action letter, permitted M&A brokers to  effect securities transactions with the transfer of ownership of  privately held companies without registering as a broker-dealer. This  no-action letter helps to account for the fact that small and midsize  businesses have fewer resources to pay for the services of registered  broker-dealers, and ultimately do not pose the kinds of potentially  systemic risks that larger companies may pose.   H.R. 935 would codify the SEC 2014 no-action letter and will further  clarify and simplify the registration regime for M&A brokers, which  will reduce costs for buyers and sellers.   H.R. 935 is consistent with the North American Securities  Administrators Association's model State regulation for M&A brokers,  which exempts M&A brokers from State securities legislation.   Madam Speaker, I again thank Members on both sides for coming  together on this bill, and I urge its passage, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers and  I am prepared to close.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time until Mr. Hill yields  back.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of  my time.   Madam Speaker, I certainly hope the third time is the charm, as the  sponsor of the bill has reiterated. H.R. 935 will provide legal  certainty to certain financial intermediaries who serve and support  small business owners and buyers.   The bill would codify a longstanding no-action letter by the  Securities and Exchange Commission. I thank its sponsors, Mr. Huizenga  and Mrs. Maloney.   Madam Speaker, I urge the speedy passage by the House, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules  and pass the bill (H.R. 7066) to require United States financial  institutions to ensure entities and persons owned or controlled by the  institution comply with financial sanctions on the Russian Federation  and the Republic of Belarus to the same extent as the institution  itself, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 7066         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Russia and Belarus Financial       Sanctions Act of 2022''.       SEC. 2. REQUIREMENTS.         (a) In General.--A United States financial institution       shall take all actions necessary and available to cause any       entity or person owned or controlled by the institution to       comply with any provision of law described in subsection (b)       to the same extent as required of a United States financial       institution.  [[Page H4749]]         (b) Provision of Law Described.--A provision of law       described in this subsection is any prohibition or limitation       described in a sanctions-related statute, regulation or order       applicable to a United States financial institution       concerning the Russian Federation or the Republic of Belarus,       involving--        (1) the conduct of transactions;        (2) the acceptance of deposits;        (3) the making, granting, transferring, holding, or       brokering of loans or credits;        (4) the purchasing or selling of foreign exchange,       securities, commodity futures, or options;        (5) the procuring of purchasers and sellers described under       paragraph (4) as principal or agent; or        (6) any other good or service provided by a United States       financial institution.        (c) Penalty.--A United States financial institution that       violates subsection (a) shall be subject to the penalties       described in the applicable statute, regulation or order       applicable to a United States financial Institution.        (d) United States Financial Institution Defined.--In this       section, the term ``United States financial institution''       means any U.S. entity (including its foreign branches) that       is engaged in the business of accepting deposits, making,       granting, transferring, holding, or brokering loans or       credits, or purchasing or selling foreign exchange,       securities, futures or options, or procuring purchasers and       sellers thereof, as principal or agent. It includes       depository institutions, banks, savings banks, money services       businesses, operators of credit card systems, trust       companies, insurance companies, securities brokers and       dealers, futures and options brokers and dealers, forward       contract and foreign exchange merchants, securities and       commodities exchanges, clearing corporations, investment       companies, employee benefit plans, dealers in precious       metals, stones, or jewels, and U.S. holding companies, U.S.       affiliates, or U.S. subsidiaries of any of the foregoing.       This term includes those branches, offices, and agencies of       foreign financial institutions that are located in the United       States, but not such institutions' foreign branches, offices,       or agencies.       SEC. 3. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and  extend their remarks on this legislation and include extraneous  material thereon.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 7066, the Russia and Belarus  Financial Sanctions Act, sponsored by Congressman Brad Sherman.   Within days of Russia's unjustified and inhumane invasion of Ukraine,  President Biden demonstrated strong leadership when he brought our  allies together to impose the toughest set of sanctions ever against a  major world economy.   The effectiveness of these sanctions will depend in large part on  strong enforcement of these restrictions and prohibitions by the U.S.  and by our allies.                                time  1615    U.S. financial institutions, including banks, credit card companies,  broker-dealers, money service businesses, cryptocurrency exchanges, and  mobile wallets, play a pivotal role in the implementation of U.S.  sanctions. There is some ambiguity, however, as to whether compliance  by U.S. financial institutions extends to foreign entities that they  own or control.   Congressman Sherman's bill will clarify that all foreign operations  of U.S. financial institutions, including any subsidiaries domiciled  outside the United States, must fully comply with all existing  sanctions imposed in response to Russia's brutal war against Ukraine.   I thank Congressman Sherman for his good work on this bipartisan  bill, as well as Congressman Hill for partnering with him. This is a  commonsense clarification to ensure that we are doing all that we can  to degrade the Russian economy until it is no longer able to fund its  incursion into Ukraine and to show Russia that there are consequences  for its actions. For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to support  this bill.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                           House of Representatives,                                        Committee on Agriculture,                                        Washington, DC, May 6, 2022.      Hon. Maxine Waters,      Chairwoman, Committee on Financial Services, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairwoman Waters: This letter confirms our mutual       understanding regarding H.R. 7066, the Russia and Belarus       Financial Sanctions Act. Thank you for collaborating with the       Committee on Agriculture on the matters within our       jurisdiction.        The Committee on Agriculture will forego any further       consideration of this bill so that it may proceed       expeditiously to the House floor for consideration. However,       by foregoing consideration at this time, we do not waive any       jurisdiction over any subject matter contained in this or       similar legislation. We request that our Committee be       consulted and involved as this bill moves forward so that we       may address any remaining issues in our jurisdiction. The       Committee on Agriculture also reserves the right to seek       appointment of an appropriate number of conferees to any       House-Senate conference involving this or similar legislation       and ask that you support any such request.        We would appreciate a response to this letter confirming       this understanding with respect to H.R. 7066, and request       that a copy of our letters on this matter be published in the       Congressional Record during Floor consideration.            Sincerely,                                                       David Scott,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                 Committee on Financial Services,                                        Washington, DC, May 9, 2022.      Hon. David Scott,      Chairman, Committee on Agriculture,      Washington, DC.        Dear Mister Chairman: I am writing to acknowledge your       letter dated May 9, 2022, regarding the waiver by the       Committee on Agriculture of any jurisdictional claims over       the matters contained in H.R. 7066, the ``Russian and Belarus       Financial Sanctions Act.'' The Committee on Financial       Services confirms our mutual understanding that your       Committee does not waive any jurisdiction over the subject       matter contained in this or similar legislation, and your       Committee will be appropriately consulted and involved as       this bill or similar legislation moves forward so that we may       address any remaining issues within your jurisdiction.        The Committee on Financial Services further recognizes your       interest in appointment of outside conferees from the       Committee on Agriculture should this bill or similar language       be considered in a conference with the Senate.        Pursuant to your request, I will ensure that this exchange       of letters is included in the Congressional Record during       Floor consideration of the bill. I appreciate your       cooperation regarding this legislation and look forward to       continuing to work with you as this measure moves through the       legislative process.            Sincerely,                                                     Maxine Waters,                                                        Chairwoman.     Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Sherman).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of  my time. The Russia and Belarus Financial Sanctions Act was passed by  our committee with bipartisan support. It provides an important  clarification to ensure financial institutions follow the law and  implement sanctions on Russia and Belarus.   Madam Speaker, I urge Members to support this bill, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules  and pass the bill (H.R. 7081) to seek immediate bilateral,  multilateral, and commercial debt service payment relief for Ukraine,  as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 7081         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Ukraine Comprehensive Debt       Payment Relief Act of 2022''.       SEC. 2. SUSPENSION OF MULTILATERAL DEBT PAYMENTS OF UKRAINE.         (a) United States Position in the International Financial       Institutions.--The Secretary of the Treasury shall instruct       the United States Executive Director at each international       financial institution (as defined in section 1701(c)(2) of       the International Financial Institutions Act) to use the       voice, vote, and influence of the United States to advocate       that the respective institution immediately suspend all debt       service payments owed to the institution by Ukraine.        (b) Official Bilateral and Commercial Debt Service Payment       Relief.--The Secretary of the Treasury, working in       coordination with the Secretary of State, shall commence       immediate efforts with other governments and commercial       creditor groups, through the Paris Club of Official Creditors       and other bilateral and multilateral frameworks, both formal       and informal, to pursue comprehensive debt payment relief for       Ukraine.        (c) Multilateral Financial Support for Ukraine.--The       Secretary of the Treasury shall direct the United States       Executive Director at each international financial       institution (as defined in section 1701(c)(2) of the       International Financial Institutions Act) to use the voice       and vote of the United States to support, to the maximum       extent practicable, the provision of concessional financial       assistance for Ukraine.        (d) Multilateral Financial Support for Refugees.--The       Secretary of the Treasury shall direct the United States       Executive Director at each international financial       institution (as defined in section 1701(c)(2) of the       International Financial Institutions Act) to use the voice       and vote of the United States to seek to provide economic       support for refugees from Ukraine, including refugees of       African descent, and for countries receiving refugees from       Ukraine.       SEC. 3. REPORT TO THE CONGRESS.         Not later than December 31 of each year, the President       shall--        (1) submit to the Committees on Financial Services, on       Appropriations, and on Foreign  [[Page H4751]]       Affairs of the House of Representatives and the Committees on       Foreign Relations and on Appropriations of the Senate, a       report on the activities undertaken under this Act; and        (2) make public a copy of the report.       SEC. 4. WAIVER AND TERMINATION.         (a) Waiver.--The President may waive the provisions of this       Act if the President determines that a waiver is in the       national interest of the United States and reports to the       Congress an explanation of the reasons therefor.        (b) Termination.--The preceding provisions of this Act       shall have no force or effect on or after the date that is 7       years after the date of the enactment of this Act.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks  and to insert extraneous material thereon.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 7081, the Ukraine  Comprehensive Debt Payment Relief Act which I introduced earlier this  year. Ukraine needs significant financial resources to sustain its  defense against Putin's brutal invasion, so my bill would provide  Ukraine with urgently needed relief from crushing debt payments to  international financial institutions like the International Monetary  Fund, or IMF, and the World Bank.   Let me provide some context. This year alone Ukraine owes $4.6  billion--more than $20 billion in total--to international institutions.  And even as it is under siege from the invading Russian Army, Ukraine  still owes payments on that debt. For example, the IMF imposes  additional surcharges on countries that already have high levels of  debt or are behind on their payments.   Ukraine is one of those countries. So while it fights a war against  Russia, Ukraine also owes an estimated $14 million in surcharges to the  IMF each month--money that Ukraine desperately needs to defend itself  and to provide vital services to its citizens, and, once the war is  over, to focus on reconstruction. These surcharges, along with loans  and debt payments, will hold Ukraine back not only during this war but  for years to come.   Now is not the time for development institutions to come collecting  debts, and that is exactly why I introduced the Ukraine Comprehensive  Debt Payment Relief Act. My bill would direct U.S. representatives at  these institutions to support the immediate suspension of Ukraine's  debt payments, direct our government to coordinate comprehensive debt  relief for Ukraine from government and commercial creditors, and direct  U.S. Representatives to support additional financial assistance for  Ukraine on generous terms.   I would also like to note key language that was put forth by  Representative Beatty which was included in the bill. The language  makes clear that the financial assistance called for in the bill should  include economic support for refugees from Ukraine for countries  receiving refugees. It specifically includes support for refugees of  African descent. African refugees from Ukraine have been experiencing  discrimination in the current crisis. According to press reports, there  have been incidences where African refugees from Ukraine have been  stuck at the border, unable to cross safely while suffering through the  cold without food or shelter. By adopting this bill, we will send a  strong statement of support to these refugees.   I thank Chair Waters, Ranking Member McHenry, and all those on the  Financial Services Committee who helped get this bill to the House  floor in a timely manner.   Madam Speaker, I urge support for H.R. 7081, a simple but urgent  measure to let Ukraine focus its limited resources on defense, aid, and  reconstruction, and I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1630     Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Ohio (Mrs. Beatty).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   The debt service payment relief for Ukraine called for in H.R. 7081  would be a quick and efficient way to provide financial support for a  country that we all want to do everything we can to help. I urge my  colleagues to support this legislation, and I yield back the balance of  my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules  and pass the bill (H.R. 6891) to exclude government officials of the  Russian Federation from certain international meetings, and for other  purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 6891         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Isolate Russian Government       Officials Act of 2022''.       SEC. 2. EXCLUSION OF GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS OF THE RUSSIAN                     FEDERATION.         (a) Policy of the United States.--It is the policy of the       United States to seek to exclude government officials of the       Russian Federation, to the maximum extent practicable, from       participation in meetings, proceedings, and other activities       of the following organizations:        (1) Group of 20.        (2) Bank for International Settlements.        (3) Basel Committee for Banking Standards.        (4) Financial Stability Board.        (5) International Association of Insurance Supervisors.        (6) International Organization of Securities Commissions.        (b) Implementation.--The Secretary of the Treasury, the       Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and the       Securities and Exchange Commission, as the case may be, shall       take all necessary steps to advance the policy set forth in       subsection (a).        (c) Termination.--This section shall have no force or       effect on the earlier of--        (1) the date that is 5 years after the date of enactment of       this Act; or        (2) 30 days after the date that the President reports to       Congress that the government of the Russian Federation has       ceased its destabilizing activities with respect to the       sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine.        (d) Waiver.--The President may waive the application of       this section if the President reports to the Congress that       the waiver is in the national interest of the United States       and includes an explanation of the reasons therefor.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend  their remarks and include extraneous material thereon.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6891, the Isolate Russian  Government Officials Act, sponsored by the Congresswoman from Missouri  (Mrs. Wagner). I commend her for her work on this bill, and I  appreciate that she worked with Chairwoman Waters to improve the bill.   The Russian Government participates, along with the U.S., in a wide  range of international organizations that are intended to promote  collaboration and harmonize global standards on critical issues like  financial stability. However, Russia shattered any notion of  international harmony by violating the sovereignty of Ukraine and its  people with Putin's unlawful invasion.   As such, Russia should no longer have a seat at a table of meetings  of a wide range of important bodies, including the Basel Committee and  the International Organization of Securities Commissions.   I applaud the Biden administration for securing the suspension of  Russia from the Bank for International Settlements and the Financial  Stability Board. It is time to kick the Kremlin out of every other room  and pass H.R. 6891.   Madam Speaker, for these reasons, I urge my colleagues to support  this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.                                           House of Representatives,                                    Committee on Foreign Affairs,                                        Washington, DC, May 9, 2022.      Hon. Maxine Waters,      Committee on Financial Services,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chair Waters: In an effort to work cooperatively and       to expedite consideration of H.R. 6891, Isolate Russian       Government Officials Act of 2022, the Committee on Foreign       Affairs agrees to waive formal consideration of the bill as       to the provisions that fall within the Rule X jurisdiction of       the Committee on Foreign Affairs.        The Committee on Foreign Affairs takes this action with the       mutual understanding that the Committee does not waive any       jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in H.R. 6891       or similar legislation, and the Committee will be       appropriately consulted and involved as the bill or similar       legislation moves forward. The Committee also reserves the       right to seek appointment of Committee on Foreign Affairs       conferees during any House-Senate conference convened for       this legislation with your support for any such request.        Finally, I would appreciate your response to this letter       confirming this understanding and ask that a copy of our       exchange of letters on this matter be included in the       Congressional Record during Floor consideration of H.R. 6891.            Sincerely,                                                  Gregory W. Meeks,      Chair.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                 Committee on Financial Services,                                        Washington, DC, May 9, 2022.      Hon. Gregory Meeks,      Chairman, House Committee on Foreign Affairs,      Washington, DC.        Dear Mister Chairman: I am writing to acknowledge your       letter dated May 9, 2022, regarding the waiver by the       Committee on Foreign Affairs of any Rule X jurisdiction       claims over the matters contained in H.R. 6891, ``Isolate       Russian Government Officials Act of 2022.'' The Committee on       Financial Services confirms our mutual understanding that       your Committee does not waive any jurisdiction over the       subject matter contained in this or similar legislation, and       your Committee will be appropriately consulted and involved       as this bill or similar legislation moves forward so that we       may address any remaining issues within your jurisdiction.        The Committee on Financial Services further recognizes your       interest in appointment of outside conferees from the       Committee on Agriculture should this bill or similar language       be considered in a conference with the Senate.        Pursuant to your request, I will ensure that this exchange       of letters is included in the Congressional Record during       Floor consideration of the bill. I appreciate your       cooperation regarding this legislation and look forward to       continuing to work with you as this measure moves through the       legislative process.            Sincerely,                                                     Maxine Waters,                                                        Chairwoman.     Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Connolly), who is a member of the  Committee on Foreign Affairs.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of  my time.   I, again, thank Representative Wagner, her staff, as well as Ranking  Member McHenry and his staff for working with us on this legislation.   I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me in  supporting H.R. 6891, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules  and pass the bill (H.R. 6899) to prohibit the Secretary of the Treasury  from engaging in transactions involving the exchange of Special Drawing  Rights issued by the International Monetary Fund that are held by the  Russian Federation or Belarus, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 6899         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Russia and Belarus SDR       Exchange Prohibition Act of 2022''.       SEC. 2. SPECIAL DRAWING RIGHTS EXCHANGE PROHIBITION.         (a) In General.--The Secretary of the Treasury may not       engage in any transaction involving the exchange of Special       Drawing Rights issued by the International Monetary Fund that       are held by the Russian Federation or Belarus.        (b) Advocacy.--The Secretary of the Treasury shall--        (1) vigorously advocate that the governments of the member       countries of the International Monetary Fund, to the extent       that the member countries issue freely usable currencies,       prohibit transactions involving the exchange of Special       Drawing Rights held by the Russian Federation or Belarus and        (2) direct the United States Executive Director at each       international financial institution (as defined in section       1701(c)(2) of the International Financial Institutions Act)       to use the voice and vote of the United States to oppose the       provision of financial assistance to the Russian Federation       and Belarus, except to address basic human needs of the       civilian population.        (c) Termination.--The preceding provisions of this section       shall have no force or effect on the earlier of--        (1) the date that is 5 years after the date of the       enactment of this Act; or        (2) 30 days after the date that the President reports to       the Congress that the governments of the Russian Federation       and Belarus have ceased destabilizing activities with respect       to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine.        (d) Waiver.--The President may waive the application of       this section if the President reports to the Congress that       the waiver is in the national interest of the United States       and includes an explanation of the reasons therefor.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend  their remarks on this legislation and to insert extraneous material  thereon.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Madam Speaker, I commend the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Hill) for  his leadership on H.R. 6899, the Russia and Belarus SDR Exchange  Prohibition Act of 2022.   Mr. Hill's legislation would codify the Biden administration's  current position against exchanging any Special Drawing Rights, or  SDRs, held by Russia or Belarus for U.S. dollars.   SDRs are a special reserve asset created by the International  Monetary Fund to supplement the official reserves of its members. SDR  allocations are distributed to all IMF member countries in proportion  to their shareholding in the fund, and countries can hold their SDRs as  part of their precautionary reserve balances or convert them for hard  currency to finance balance of payments needs, pay for imports, adjust  the composition of their reserves, or pay back IMF loans.   In August of 2021, the IMF issued a $650 billion general allocation  of SDRs, of which $275 billion went to emerging market and developing  countries to help transform the global pandemic crisis into a fair and  resilient economic recovery.   Given the recent sanctions placed by the G7 group of nations against  Russia's central bank and other Russian financial institutions, as well  as the international sanctions against the banking sector in Belarus,  it would be difficult for Russia or Belarus to find any country willing  to convert their SDRs, especially since such a transaction would be  viewed by the rest of the world as a hostile action.   Even if the central bank of Russia were able to acquire a key freely  usable currency, such as U.S. dollars, euros, yen, or pounds, as a  result of an SDR transaction, current sanctions would effectively  immobilize those assets.   I think it is useful for Congress to reinforce the administration's  position against the conversion of SDRs held by Russia or Belarus, and  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, we have no further speakers, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   In closing, I thank the bill's author, Representative Hill, for  giving the Members of the House the opportunity to act together against  Russia and Belarus and their war against the free world. I urge Members  on both sides of the aisle to join me in supporting H.R. 6899.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 6015) to award a Congressional Gold Medal to  Benjamin Berell Ferencz, in recognition of his service to the United  States and international community during the post-World War II  Nuremberg trials and lifelong advocacy for international criminal  justice and rule of law, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 6015         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Benjamin Berell Ferencz       Congressional Gold Medal Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.          Congress finds the following:        (1) Benjamin ``Ben'' Berell Ferencz was born on March 11,       1920, in Transylvania, now modern day Hungary.        (2) In 1920, Ben and his family fled anti-Semitic       persecution and emigrated to the United States. Ben grew up       in New York City, and in 1940, was awarded a scholarship to       Harvard Law School where he graduated with honors.        (3) After the onset of World War II, Ben enlisted in the       United States Army in 1943, and joined an anti-aircraft       artillery battalion preparing for the invasion of France. As       an enlisted man under General Patton, he fought in most of       the major campaigns in Europe.        (4) As Nazi atrocities were uncovered, Ben was transferred       to a newly created War Crimes Branch of the Army to gather       evidence of war crimes that could be used in a court of law       to prosecute persons responsible for these crimes. Ben       documented the horrors perpetrated by Nazi Germany, visiting       concentration camps as they were liberated.        (5) At the end of 1945, Ben was honorably discharged from       the United States Army with the rank of Sergeant of Infantry.       He had been awarded five battle stars.        (6) In 1946, the United States Government recruited Ben to       join the team working on the Nuremberg tribunals, a novel       independent court established to try top-ranking Nazi       officials for crimes perpetrated during the course of the       war, including those crimes we now call the Holocaust. Mr.       Ferencz was sent to Berlin to oversee a team of 50       researchers investigating official Nazi records, which       provided overwhelming evidence to implicate German doctors,       lawyers, judges, generals, industrialists, and others in       genocide.        (7) By 1948, at age 27, Ben had secured enough evidence to       prosecute 22 SS members of Nazi killing squads charged for       the murder of over 1,000,0000 Jewish, Roma, Soviet, and other       men, women, and children in shooting massacres in occupied       Soviet territory. He was appointed chief prosecutor in the       Einsatzgruppen Trial, in what the Associated Press called       ``the biggest murder trial in history''. The court found 20       Nazi officials  [[Page H4756]]       guilty of war crimes, crimes against humanity, and membership       in a criminal organization for their roles in the murder of       over a million people. An additional two defendants were       found guilty for membership in a criminal organization.        (8) After the Nuremberg trials ended, Ben fought for       compensation for victims and survivors of the Holocaust, the       return of stolen assets, and other forms of restitution for       those who had suffered at the hands of the Nazis.        (9) Since the 1970s, Ben has worked tirelessly to promote       development of international mechanisms to outlaw and punish       aggressive war and the crimes of genocide, crimes against       humanity and war crimes. His efforts contributed to the       establishment of the International Criminal Court and to the       recognition of aggression as an international crime.        (10) Ben is a tireless advocate for international criminal       justice and the conviction that the rule of law offers the       world a sustainable path to stem conflict and reach peaceful       conclusions to geopolitical disputes. His unwavering goal has       been ``to establish a legal precedent that would encourage a       more humane and secure world in the future''.        (11) Ben, at age 101, is still active, giving speeches       throughout the world about lessons learned during his       extraordinary career. He is compelled by the imperative to       ``replace the rule of force with the rule of law'', promoting       judicial mechanisms that can resolve conflict. He often tells       young people to ``never give up'' because the fight for peace       and justice is worth the long struggle ahead.       SEC. 3. CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL.         (a) Presentation Authorized.--The Speaker of the House of       Representatives and the President pro tempore of the Senate       shall make appropriate arrangements for the presentation, on       behalf of the Congress, of a gold medal of appropriate design       to Benjamin Berell Ferencz, in recognition of his service to       the United States and international community during the       post-World War II Nuremberg trials and lifelong advocacy for       international criminal justice and rule of law.        (b) Design and Striking.--For purposes of the presentation       referred to in subsection (a), the Secretary of the Treasury       (referred to in this Act as the ``Secretary'') shall strike a       gold medal with suitable emblems, devices, and inscriptions,       to be determined by the Secretary.       SEC. 4. DUPLICATE MEDALS.         (a) In General.--The Secretary may strike and sell       duplicates in bronze of the gold medal struck pursuant to       section 3 under such regulations as the Secretary may       prescribe, at a price sufficient to cover the cost thereof,       including labor, materials, dies, use of machinery, and       overhead expenses.

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Today I will share with my colleagues the incredible life story and  mission of Benjamin Ferencz, the chief prosecutor at the Einsatzgruppen  Trial in Nuremberg, Germany, the man who brought to justice the  individuals responsible for orchestrating the horrific war crimes  committed during World War II.   I thank the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Frankel) for sponsoring  H.R. 6015, this bill, honoring Mr. Ferencz's life and legacy. Benjamin  Ferencz and his family immigrated to the United States when he was an  infant, fleeing the persecution of Hungarian Jews in Romania.   He grew up poor in New York, but his perseverance, intellect, and  yearning for justice earned him a scholarship from Harvard Law School.  He joined the Army shortly after graduation and was tasked with  gathering evidence on Nazi war crimes against the Jewish people and  other marginalized groups, a fate that his own family could have met  had they not fled.   At the age of 27, he was appointed chief prosecutor for the United  States Army for a case involving war crimes and crimes against humanity  committed by 22 individuals from Einsatzgruppen, a Nazi secret police  death squad operating in Nazi-controlled Eastern Europe. He declared in  his opening statement that the purpose of this case was ``to affirm by  international penal action man's right to live in peace and dignity,  regardless of his race or creed . . . a plea of humanity to law.''   The 22 defendants were charged with the murder of over one million  people, including Jews, ethnic minorities, political dissidents,  persons with disabilities, and members of the LGBTQ community, those  who the Third Reich deemed to be different and, therefore, lesser. Mr.  Ferencz secured conviction for all 22 defendants.   He spent the following decade advocating for the institution of an  international criminal court and the international rule of law to  prevent something like the Nuremberg trials from ever being necessary  again. As Ferencz stated, ``If law is to be respected it must apply  equally to everyone everywhere. If a permanent international criminal  court had already existed, these ad hoc tribunals would not have been  necessary.''   Throughout his life, Mr. Ferencz sought to make the world a safer,  more equitable, and more peaceful place through his denunciations of  war and his advocacy for the institution of international criminal law.   For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 6015, which  would grant Mr. Ferencz the highest congressional honor for his  tireless efforts to advance justice.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend  their remarks on this legislation and to insert extraneous material  thereon.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Lois Frankel), the sponsor of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. Manning).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues, the gentlewoman from Florida,  Congresswoman Frankel, for her leadership in sponsoring H.R. 6015, and  for working so hard to ensure that Mr. Ferencz receives the recognition  that he so clearly deserves.   Through his prosecutorial work, his teaching, his written works and  his advocacy, for the establishment of the International Criminal  Court, he has directly and indirectly brought countless criminals to  justice and left a lasting humanitarian legacy.   The recent reports of Russian atrocities being committed against the  people of Ukraine are a reminder that war crimes are far from being a  relic of a past.   Now more than ever, we must act to honor and uplift those who have  dedicated their lives to advancing justice, peace, and giving a voice  to the voiceless.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 6015, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
