In this Act, the term ``Suicide Prevention Lifeline'' means       the suicide prevention hotline maintained pursuant to section       520E-3 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 290bb-      36c).    Mr. Speaker, it is appropriate that we stand and speak on  behalf of the law enforcement community of our country. As the former  chief of the Orlando Police just said, it is because of them that we  have law and order.   Democracy cannot survive without law and order. So, I want to thank  the gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. Demings) for leading this Special  Order hour and for so many Democrats and Republicans participating. She  is, as so many Americans now know, not only an outstanding Member of  the Congress but also a former chief of police for the city of Orlando,  Florida, and, I might say, a serious candidate considered by President  Biden for Vice President of the United States.   She is not the only one in our Caucus who has worked in law  enforcement or overseen police departments as mayor, but certainly one  of the most experienced.   As we observe National Police Week this year, we do so at a time when  we are engaged in a critical national conversation about justice in  policing. Tonight, we want to make it clear: This important dialogue  does not detract one iota from the deep and abiding respect that all of  us--Democrats, Republicans, independents, Americans--have for the men  and women who dedicate their careers in law enforcement to protecting  their communities, their neighbors, their friends.   I do not believe, I want to make it clear, in defunding police. That  is neither my view nor my party's platform. Indeed, we honor law  enforcement.   Over the years, I have been proud to join my Democratic colleagues as  a strong supporter of law enforcement and to raise awareness of the  very serious dangers that police officers face while doing their jobs.   Officer Chestnut and Detective Gibson, in 1998, were slain, one in my  office and one outside the door of my office. They were brave and good  people who lost their lives defending the Capitol of the United States.   In my State of Maryland and the Fifth District, I have worked closely  with police chiefs, sheriffs, and departments to ensure that their  needs are being met. Together, we have worked to make certain that the  families of those who fell in the line of duty received the benefits,  help, compassion, and appreciation they deserve.   Every year--until it became virtual, and now I do it virtually--I  have gone down to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial.  22,611 Americans, law enforcement officers, have lost their lives  keeping the peace.   Last year, Mr. Speaker, America lost 295 police officers in the line  of duty. It is a dangerous duty, but it is a critical duty.   Here in the Capitol, we will remember those who have given their  lives to protect this institution, including Officer Chestnut,  Detective Gibson, Officer Howard Liebengood, Officer William Evans,  and, of course, Officer Brian Sicknick.   The actions just laid out are ones that Congress, House Democrats,  believe are important to protecting those who keep us safe every day.  But I believe, Mr. Speaker, it is equally essential for the efficacy  and safety of law enforcement to take positive and proactive steps to  ensure accountability and rebuild trust in our departments.   That is true of our institution, Mr. Speaker. When we hold  accountable one of our Members, as we have done, it does not besmirch  the rest of our Members. No one ought to simplify that one is like all.   To do that, we must continue the important national conversations  about justice in policing and rooting out racial bias that corrodes  effective police work.    The majority, Mr. Speaker, of principled police officers are among  those most concerned about ensuring that those who cannot properly and  responsibly carry out their work of policing are held accountable. That  is why we passed the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act.   Congress has a responsibility to deal with this challenge not only  for the sake of justice and public safety but also in order to help  police departments better carry out their missions and to raise the  respect and support they receive from the American public.   Such a policy is not designed to defund police or to lessen the  impact of the vital function that law enforcement officers perform.   So, as we join in observing Police Week this year, let us remember  all those 22,000-plus, those 295, the brave men and women protecting us  and the peacefulness of our communities. Let us continue to support law  enforcement by striving to help police officers and departments face  this moment head-on and emerge stronger, safer, more trusted, and  better equipped to keep all Americans safe.
