 Mr. President, I rise today to honor the service of Todd  Crouch, my director of state operations, who retired from my office and  the U.S. Senate on June 30, 2021.   Todd has spent nearly 22 years as a valued member of my staff. A  graduate of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, Todd first joined my  State assembly staff in 1997 as an intern. By a stroke of luck on both  of our parts, Todd was assigned to my office to complete his  coursework. He would later tell me that he didn't know much about me  and my work in the assembly but had heard that I was smart, hard- working, and a good listener. I quickly learned that I could say the  same about Todd.   After my election to the U.S. House of Representatives in late 1998,  Todd joined my office as a field representative. Todd worked directly  to serve constituents in our Madison area district, visiting  organizations and businesses and serving as my representative at  countless community events. He set up listening sessions through the  district and staffed me at those events. Some listening sessions  presented special and occasionally dramatic challenges. Todd nimbly  navigated us through the occasional unexpected attendee with creativity  and good humor.   In 2001, Todd transitioned to a role as our district office manager  and district scheduler. This dual role highlighted some of Todd's  greatest skills. An organized and methodical scheduler, he handled  sticky situations with great care, including delayed flights, last  minute cancellations, and many competing demands on limited time. He  ran our district offices with a close attention to detail, ensuring  their smooth operation and providing our State staff with a steady hand  to turn to when trouble arose.   Todd remained in this dual role until my election to the U.S. Senate  in 2012. I was fortunate to have Todd continue on my U.S. Senate staff.  Initially serving as my Madison office director, which had expanded far  beyond the size of our district office, Todd's role eventually grew to  encompass all of our State operations. He managed our offices in  Madison, Milwaukee, La Crosse, Eau Claire, and Green Bay, as well as  our mobile office, affectionately known to us as The Beast. Todd later  added several additional support roles, including two short stints as a  pinch-hitter State scheduler, as well as coordinating our Grants and  Special Projects portfolio.   Outside of the office, Todd is a devoted husband and father. He and  his husband James Bond are the proud parents of their energetic young  sons, Derrion and SJ. Todd and James are also longtime committed foster  parents who have an open door to a welcoming and loving home.   I am fortunate to have had Todd as a valued member of my staff for  these past many years, and I know that my staff, both past and present,  feel the same. He has a sneaky and delightful sense of humor, which  often helps relieve a tense or difficult situation. He is diligent in  his approach to his work and to public service and leads by example.  Along with my entire U.S. Senate staff, I wish him all the best as he  begins a new chapter with his well-deserved retirement.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today to honor the 150th  anniversary of GLC Minerals, a fifth-generation, family owned company  that has contributed to the growth and success of the city of Green Bay  and Northeast Wisconsin since 1871.   Wisconsin's indigenous Tribes lived in this area for thousands of  years and recognized the strategic importance of the bay of Green Bay.  The confluence of river and lake contributed to the success of their  thriving communities.   In 1634 the first European explorer, Jean Nicolet, arrived on the  shores of Green Bay, and the development of this city on our country's  western frontier was launched. As the community of what is now greater  Green Bay grew, eager, hard-working settlers with an entrepreneurial  spirit arrived to build an economy rooted in iron smelting, timber, and  cheesemaking. Fred Hurlbut, Sr., was one of these industrious settlers  and in 1871 established the Hurlbut Calcium and Chemical Company.   The generations that followed honored the vision of Fred Hurlbut,  Sr., and as the economy grew and changed, so did the company. In 1940,  the company moved to the shores of the Fox River. In 2015, the business  received its final name change to GLC Minerals. And today, as we  celebrate the 150th anniversary, GLC Minerals remains an anchor of our  Green Bay community as a successful manufacturer of calcium and  magnesium carbonate products used in animal feed, mineral fillers,  pollution filters, and soil conditioners.   Mr. President, in Wisconsin, we make things. We are known for our  brats and  [[Page S4825]]  cheese and paper, but our economy is so much more diverse. GLC Minerals  represents that diversified economic base that has propelled our State  forward as a great place to work, live, and raise a family. As a custom  manufacturer of minerals and applications, GLC Minerals contributes to  our dairy, poultry, glass, paper, construction, and agricultural  sector. I applaud fifth-generation family member Wesley Hurlbut Garner,  II, for his wise stewardship of this vital Wisconsin business and wish  GLC Minerals and the Garner family great success in the next 150 years                            ____________________
