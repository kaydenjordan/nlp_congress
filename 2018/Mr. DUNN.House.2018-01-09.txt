 Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Panama City  Beach Fire Chief John Daly on his retirement.   Chief Daly served the people of Panama City Beach for 33 years and  willingly took up the responsibility to run into the fire, putting his  life on the line to save others countless times.   When he began his career with Panama City Beach Fire and Rescue in  1985, there were only seven career firefighters. Today that number has  grown to 35 as our city has grown and thrived. John was promoted to  chief in 2002 and has remained an outstanding leader ever since. He  considers the firefighters under his watch to be family, and he knows  that they will continue to do great things under the leadership of the  new fire chief, Larry Couch.   Madam Speaker, please join me in saying thank you to Chief Daly, his  wife, Joan, and their daughters for their years of service and  sacrifice, and wish them luck as they enjoy a new chapter in life.                            ____________________
