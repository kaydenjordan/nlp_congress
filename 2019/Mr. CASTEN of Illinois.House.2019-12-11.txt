 Mr. Speaker, prescription drug prices are out  of control. Year after year, we see prices rise. Old drugs become  unaffordable, and new drugs may cost more than a house.   That is why I support H.R. 3, the Elijah E. Cummings Lower Drug Costs  Now Act. This bill would change the lives of the 89,000 seniors on part  D in my district and over 600,000 people on private health insurance  plans in my district.   One of those, in particular, is Liz Phelan. Liz lives in Algonquin,  Illinois, and retired after 38 years of public service. In 2007, she  had a double transplant: a kidney and a pancreas. She is alive today  for two reasons: One is the generosity of a donor, and, the second, the  antirejection drugs that she has to take to keep her alive.   Those drugs alone cost $662 every 3 months, out of pocket, but  because she needs additional medication, she hits the Medicare coverage  gap, where she is on the hook for the balance of her costs.   H.R. 3 would be a game changer for Liz. It would lower her  prescription drug costs to $2,000 because H.R. 3 would create, for the  first time, a cap on how much seniors need to pay out of pocket in  Medicare. It would make sure that the drugs she needs to survive do not  increase above the rate of inflation.   For Liz and for the millions of other Americans who face high-priced  medicines, we must pass H.R. 3.                            ____________________
