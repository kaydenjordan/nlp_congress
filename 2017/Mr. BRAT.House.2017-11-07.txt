 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to enthusiastically support H.R.  3441, the Save Local Business Act. This bill will return clarity and  certainty to all businesses. Small-business owners all around  Virginia's Seventh Congressional District have been asking for tax and  regulatory relief that will free them from the tyranny of government  control.   Take, for example, two employers in my district: a home care  franchisee called BrightStar Care of Richmond, and a daycare center  called Rainbow Station at the Boulders.   Mark Grasser, president of BrightStar Care, had this to say to me  about the unworkable joint employer standard: ``We have a franchisor  who wants to work with a franchisee to provide services. Unfortunately,  that is not possible because that would violate the current joint  employer standard. This ends up hurting everyone in the process. This  standard is forcing employers and employees to make decisions that are  not best for everyone involved, but what is best to satisfy  government.''   John Sims, the owner of Rainbow Station at the Boulders, similarly  said this: ``Having the proposed standard reversed allows small  businesses like mine to thrive, knowing exactly where everyone  stands.''   I am happy to report that the House is taking a bold step forward on  defending businesses and workers today. The vague and convoluted joint  employer scheme enacted in the Browning-Ferris decision under the Obama  administration's National Labor Relations Board has caused employers  and employees harm.   Decades before the radical NLRB overturned what worked, businesses  and employees knew the rules and thrived. It is time to roll the  government back and return to what worked. Mr. Speaker, I urge my  colleagues to vote in favor of this legislation.
