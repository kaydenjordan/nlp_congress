 Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor Fire Control Seaman Second  Class Robert L. Luttrell, an American hero who served during World War  II to fight the evil empire of Japan.   Luttrell graduated from Central High School in Knoxville and enlisted  in the Navy in 1943. He was assigned to patrol gunboat PGM-18.   In March 1945, the PGM-18 was sent to Okinawa to protect minesweepers  and destroy mines as they floated to the surface. Oddly enough, Okinawa  is one of the islands my father served on.   On April 8, 1945, his ship struck a mine, and the blast lifted the  280-ton ship out of the water and ripped a giant hole in the starboard  hull.   Seaman Luttrell was able to launch a life raft and help nine other  sailors into the raft, including his commanding officer, but the raft  was still tied to the ship and couldn't be untied.   Fortunately, Luttrell was able to cut the raft loose with a knife he  had made from a hunk of metal he found in Hawaii.   He saved the lives of fellow servicemembers and showed true courage  and quick thinking in the face of danger.   Too many times, Mr. Speaker, we call people heroes, and maybe they  dribble a basketball, throw a football, or catch a baseball, but our  true heroes are the men and women who wore our country's uniform and  continue to do so like yourself, Mr. Speaker.   It is my honor to recognize Fire Control Seaman Second Class Robert  Luttrell as Tennessee's Second District May 2023 Veteran of the Month.                            ____________________
