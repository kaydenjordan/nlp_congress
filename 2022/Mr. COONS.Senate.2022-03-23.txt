 Mr. President, I rise to offer some brief remarks about a  dear friend, someone upon whom I have relied as a mentor, someone who  has served our Nation across many decades, and someone whose passing  earlier today is a moment of great significance for our Nation and our  place in the world.   I happen to have been a Truman scholar; some of my best friends are  Truman scholars; and the person whose passing we mourn today I first  met because she was the chair of the Truman Scholarship Foundation  Board.   I am speaking of the former Ambassador to the United Nations, the  former Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright, whom I first got to know  decades ago, but whom, in my dozen years here in the Senate, I got to  know as a mentor and a friend, someone whose lilting humor, whose  brilliant insights, whose force of personality, and whose charisma were  unmatched.   One of the greatest memories I will have in my life was a dinner I  got to enjoy last year with former Secretary and Chairman of the Joint  Chiefs, Colin Powell, and former Secretary of State and Ambassador to  the United Nations, Madeleine Albright, and the Ambassador to the  United Kingdom.   We sat in her garden and talked for hours about the world, about  conflict, about Russia and China, about Putin, about the Balkans, about  a whole range of things, and I learned so much.   Madeleine never lost her love for this institution, for the Senate.  It was here that she, as a relatively young staffer, cut her teeth on  politics and on being engaged in policymaking.   And one of the things that always amused her was that this desk--the  desk of Senator Biden and Senator Kennedy--was also the desk of Senator  Ed Muskie, a Senator from Maine for whom she worked for a number of  years. She was his chief LA from 1976 until 1978 and then went to work  for Zbigniew Brzezinski on the National Security Council.   I will simply say this. Today, we have lost one of our best and one  of our brightest, one of the most passionate in her dedication to  democracy.   As someone who was born overseas in Prague, Czechoslovakia, and who,  along with her family, fled communism to come to the United States, she  never stopped offering her insights, her advice, her passionate  dedication to democracy. In the books that she read, in the pins that  she wore, in the speeches that she gave, in the students that she  mentored, Madeleine Albright touched so many lives.   Yet she on occasion was gracious enough to give me just a few minutes  of her time. Through her, her daughter Alice and her grandson David  became great and dear friends. David's service in my office was an  enormous blessing to me and my team.   I just wanted to ask for prayers for them, for their family, and for  all  [[Page S1736]]  whose lives were touched by Madeleine Albright.                          Tribute to Tom Mancinelli    Mr. President, I rise today to make some comments about a truly  bittersweet moment in my career of service.   I have been an elected official for 22 years. I have had the  opportunity to work alongside dozens--actually hundreds of dedicated,  capable, and hard-working staff. None have earned my trust and my  confidence, driven my agenda, set my priorities, and been so central to  my service and my life like my national security adviser, Tom  Mancinelli.   Like me, a Truman scholar, Tom is someone who decided early on to set  his sights towards a life in public service. In the 7 years he has been  a member of my team, he has been an incredible mentor, a great leader,  and someone upon whose advice I have always been able to rely.   I hired him from service at the Department of State, where he was  chief of staff of the Bureau of Political-Military Affairs. He was a  Presidential Management Fellow before that, but most importantly, he is  a Naval Academy graduate and was an officer in the Marine Corps. I note  that brings a smile to his face even now.   As I had a chance just last week to say to the Commandant, I have  seen, through Tom's service in my office, a gentleman, an officer who  has lived the values of the Corps with honor and courage and  commitment; someone who has lived his life with an uncompromising code  of integrity, respect for human dignity, respect for others, and an  intense commitment to his service and a joyful and whimsical spirit.   As a result of our years together traveling around the world and our  time here in the United States, a number of phrases and terms have  become a part of my lexicon that I did not know before:   ``Once a Marine, always a Marine.''   ``Every Marine a rifleman.''   ``No plan survives contact with the enemy.''   ``Officers eat last.''   Tom has been an exemplar of the sort of servant leadership embodied  in the phrase ``Officers eat last.'' It means you take care of your  team, of your squad, of the men and women entrusted to you. In his two  tours in Iraq and in his 7 years with me, Tom has shown that exemplary.   I have celebrated the Marine Corps' birthday with him. I have heard  him talk about Tun Tavern. I have seen him brighten the days of  countless marines deployed as parts of security detachments at  Embassies around the world with a hearty ``Semper Fi.'' He has always  made sure that we respected and paid attention to the lives and the  service of the men and women of our Armed Forces.   Although it is with great regret that I congratulate him on this, I  congratulate him today on his next tour, which will be at the  Department of Defense.   Through our time together, we have traveled to 54 countries. That is  nearly a third of the countries on Earth. We have pressed dictators and  autocrats for democratic progress and human rights. We have visited  refugee camps in some of the toughest places on Earth to hear those  fleeing persecution and civil war. We trekked to see mountain gorillas  in Virunga National Park in Rwanda, and I have watched him with, just  over the rise, an elephant in the near distance. We carried out a  Presidential mission to go to Ethiopia in the middle of a civil war,  and we helped deliver vaccines to our partners, from Guatemala to  Taiwan. We visited American troops stationed abroad more times than I  can count.   Tom has helped me write and introduce and get marked up and pass  bills that would invest in our strategic competition with China,  advance electrification across Africa, combat wildlife trafficking,  address the root causes of violence and extremism--the Global Fragility  Act--and support young Palestinian entrepreneurs. There is a long, long  list. But the one of which I am proudest for him and I hope something  of which he is proud as well is the huge amount of effort he dedicated  to leading the BUILD Act, signed into law in 2018, to establish the new  U.S. Development Finance Corporation--$60 billion in capability  deployed to do everything from vaccine manufacturing to sustainable  agriculture, from women's empowerment to deploying solar energy in the  developing world. The DFC will have a remarkable impact for a very long  time to come.   As I have said, it is not just the hard work of policymaking but the  inside-the-room work of mentoring and guiding fellows and staff  members, becoming the sort of person upon whom I can rely to execute a  flawless congressional delegation trip overseas, or codel.   Frankly, I think one of our most recent trips, among the most  memorable, was also among his most successful. We crisscrossed the  world with a constantly shifting constellation of Members of the House  and Senate, leaving from Andrews Air Force Base, flying overnight to  Brussels for visits with the EU, NATO, and Belgium, and then continued  that same day on to Scotland. We spent time at both the COP26 global  conference on climate change and in Edinburgh, looking at new means of  generating electricity and power, and capped off that day with a  celebration with the Scottish Government at Edinburgh Castle.    We then loaded back on the plane and went all the way to Qatar, had  dinner with the Emir, breakfast with the Foreign Minister, and visited  Afghan refugees and an Air Force base at which Americans were deployed.   We went on from there to Jerusalem, to Tel Aviv, to Ramallah, to meet  with the Prime Minister, Foreign Minister, and Defense Minister of  Israel and the Prime Minister of the Palestinian Authority.   Not yet done, we got on a plane and went to Berlin to meet with the  now-Chancellor central to our response to Russia's aggression in  Ukraine and members of the Bundestag before flying home.   All of this was in 1 week--no mess, no fuss, flawless, excellently  executed, perfectly planned.   Tom takes the time in the course of a codel like that, rather than  being frenetic or self-important, to make sure that the other staffers  on the trip are learning about how they will lead future codels, that  all the Members are attended to and supported, and that it is a  purposeful investment of the time and resources of the American people,  all while taking a little bit of time to go celebrate with the marines  who helped execute that fantastic codel.   Most impressively to me, Tom has found a way to excel at his career  in my office while still being a great father to his children George  and Ruth and a husband to his accomplished wife Sarah. On a few  occasions, I have had to chase him out and say: Don't miss that. Often,  he has already gone to a parent-teacher conference, to a baseball game,  understanding that is his first mission and something to which he is  tirelessly dedicated.   He will continue his record of public service as the Principal Deputy  Assistant Secretary of Defense for Legislative Affairs, and I have  warned him, dealing with Congress is a really miserable duty. But there  is no one--no one--they could have hired who would carry this duty out  better or more thoroughly, with more character and competence, than Tom  Mancinelli.   Hiring Tom was one of the best choices I have ever made. For as many  years as he will return my calls, I will continue to call on him for  advice and counsel. I very much look forward to his next chapter in  public service.   As I was talking with my own children just this weekend, my youngest  said to me that of all the people she has gotten to know in my office,  he most exemplified to her what it means to be an American, a patriot,  and public servant. I can offer no greater compliment than that--well  deserved, well performed, well served.   To my favorite marine, thank you.   With that, I yield the floor.
