 Mr. Speaker, it was with a heavy heart yesterday that  we learned of the passing of Richard M. DeVos, Sr.   Rich, along with his wife, Helen, who passed away in October of 2017,  dedicated their lives to transforming west Michigan and making our  community an even greater place to call home. Frankly, it is hard to  imagine what west Michigan would look like without Richard DeVos and  his leadership.   Through his philanthropic activities, Rich led by example. He put a  premium on supporting educational institutions across west Michigan,  such as Grand Rapids Christian High School, Calvin College, and Grand  Valley State University.   He was equally passionate about west Michigan residents having access  to high-quality, specialized medical care.   He also worked to enrich the arts across Michigan, including by  supporting his grandson, Rick, in establishing ArtPrize, which has  opened up so many opportunities for Grand Rapids.   He was also very involved with many projects at Hope College in  Holland, Michigan. Generally, anything that helped make the community  thrive, Rich was fully behind.   As significant as those achievements are, his impact on west  Michigan's economy was even greater and simply cannot be understated.  Through his business sense, passion, and servant's heart, he created  economic opportunities for countless west Michigan residents.   Despite his monumental influence, Rich was as approachable and down  to earth as they come. Rich generally cared about his community and the  people he shared it with.   Thank you for all you have done for west Michigan, Rich; and while  your legacy will live on, know that your leadership and friendship will  be deeply missed.   Rest well, Rich. Rest well, knowing you ran a race well done.                            ____________________
