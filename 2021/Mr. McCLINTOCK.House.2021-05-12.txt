 Mr. Speaker, racism is the practice of according  rights and privileges to an individual not based on equality under the  law, but, rather, according to what race that person was born. It is  antithetical to every principle our country was founded upon, from the  promise of our Declaration of Independence that all men are created  equal to the equal protection clause of our Constitution. It was a  malignancy we fought a civil war to remove. For generations, it has  been denounced by every American of goodwill for the evil that it is.   Yet, this dangerous social pathology is now rampant in this House.  The Judiciary Committee recently adopted a measure on a party-line vote  to establish a commission with the avowed purpose of enshrining racism  into law under the guise of slavery reparations.   The biased composition of this commission--there is not a single  Republican appointment--lays its intent bare for all to see. It is  designed to reach into the dead past, revive its most malevolent  conflicts, and reintroduce them into our age.   I cannot imagine a more divisive, polarizing, or unjust measure than  one that would use government force to require people who never owned  slaves to pay reparations to people who never were slaves--based not on  anything they did, but solely because of what race they were born.   History offers us an inexhaustible supply of grievances and  injustices that are powerful enough to stoke hatreds and resentments  that can tear any society apart. That is what this movement is all  about. It is evil in its effect, if not in its intent.   Lincoln often pointed out that our country was born into a world  where slavery was an established institution. The American Founders  reviled it, and they placed principles in our founding documents that  they were confident would ultimately place that wicked institution upon  the course of ultimate extinction and would lead to a republic where  men and women of every race and background could, together, enjoy the  blessings of liberty. Equal justice under law means a colorblind  society where race simply becomes irrelevant, and until recently, we  had made tremendous progress toward that vision as a nation.   Martin Luther King expressed the gold standard of racial harmony:  that we should be judged by the content of our character and not the  color of our skin. It is the equal protection of the law and the vision  of a colorblind society stretching from the American Founders to  Lincoln and King that is now under attack by the racist left.   Yes, there are racists in our society. There are racists of all  colors in every society; it is the baser side of human nature. But no  nation has struggled harder to transcend that nature and isolate and  marginalize its racists than have Americans.   Yes, extremely damaging and foolish policies have disproportionately  impacted Black communities in recent decades. Union-dominated schools  that have failed to educate our children in inner cities, welfare  programs that have destroyed families, and the withdrawal of police  protection from crime-plagued neighborhoods are certainly among them.  But these policies devastate every community where they are practiced,  regardless of race. The answer is to change those policies, not to  excuse them because they are ideologically pleasing to the left.   The racist left is content to ignore all of these current ills. It,  instead, attempts to set neighbor against neighbor and American against  American on the basis of their race. They say this is healing. It  is precisely the opposite. They know it. Indeed, they count on it.    I think all Americans of goodwill and of every race and creed have  had enough of this. We are tired of seeing our children taught to hate  themselves and to hate each other. We are tired of seeing our country  demonized as racist by those whose first and solitary focus is on race.  We are tired of the lie that our Nation is systemically racist when it  has done more to produce a civil and tolerant multiracial society than  any people in the history of civilization.   It is long past time that every American of every heritage denounces  this evil for what it is and to extirpate from our civil discourse  those race-baiters of every persuasion who have polluted our national  dialogue and corrupted our national heritage.                            ____________________
