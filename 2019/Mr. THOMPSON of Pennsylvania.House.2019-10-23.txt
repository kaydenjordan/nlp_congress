 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss  the importance of telemedicine.   Recently, I had the pleasure of participating in a roundtable  discussion at Saint Francis University in Cambria County, Pennsylvania.  Representatives from the university, Better Care America, University of  Pittsburgh Medical Center, and Highmark, among others, gathered to  share their expertise on telemedicine and its impact on rural health.   Telemedicine is an incredibly important tool for millions of  Americans, but particularly for those who live in rural communities.  With telemedicine, we can increase access to care for those who live  far away from a doctor's office or hospital.   Of course, this benefit extends beyond rural communities.  Telemedicine is crucial in ensuring older Americans and those with  limited mobility are able to access quality medical care by eliminating  roadblocks like finding transportation to a doctor's appointment. By  increasing convenience and flexibility for patients, it encourages  individuals to take a more proactive approach in managing their health.   Telemedicine can also have a positive impact on the health and well- being of our veterans. Their sacrifice and willingness to dedicate  their lives to serve our country is a debt that we can never truly  repay. The least we can do, however, is to ensure that they have access  to quality healthcare. This includes mental health.   Many of our men and women in uniform are suffering privately with  post-traumatic stress, depression, anxiety, brain injuries, and more.  The Department of Veterans Affairs estimates that roughly 20 veterans  commit suicide a day. We must do our part to prevent tragedies like  this from happening.   That is why I introduced H.R. 2123, the Veterans E-Health and  Telemedicine Support Act--or the VETS Act, as we call it--in 2017,  alongside Congresswoman Julia Brownley. This bipartisan legislation  reduces barriers for veterans seeking healthcare by removing burdensome  location requirements, increasing access to care regardless of where  the healthcare professional or the patient is located.   Prior to the VETS Act's enactment, VA doctors could only provide  telehealth services across State lines if both the veteran and the  doctor were located in Federal facilities. Undoing this restriction was  successful under the VETS Act's adoption, and it is just one way that  we can improve access to telehealth for millions of veterans  nationwide.    Prior to the VETS Act, we were able to do that successfully a number  of years ago with the STEP Act, the Servicemembers' Telemedicine and E- Health Portability Act, and it did the same thing for 1.1 million  American heroes who are members of our Active-Duty military, Reserve,  and Guard. The act lifted those same bureaucratic barriers to expand  better access through telemedicine.   Through innovation and bipartisan support, we can continue to  strengthen telemedicine care for all Americans.                            ____________________
