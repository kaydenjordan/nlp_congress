 Madam Speaker, I am here to let you know that the people  of Texas stand ready. I represent the 27th District of Texas which  includes a number of ports including the Port of Corpus Christi, our  Nation's number one energy export port.   Texans stand ready to help American families struggling with  inflation, including high gas prices. We stand ready to help ensure  that Europe is not beholden to tyrants for their energy supply. We  stand ready to help restore our economy and support the energy  byproducts like fertilizer, pesticides, and even tractor tires that  help produce our food supply.   How insulting and arrogant it is for the American worker that the  Biden administration would rather go to dictators to fill the energy  vacuum than the American people, in spite of the fact that the American  workers produce energy much more clean and responsibly than these other  nations.   To the casual observer this may seem like a tragic miscalculation. In  2017, as Vice President Biden said, ironically, in a speech he gave in  the Ukraine, he said this: We are trying to create a multipolar world.  In other words, he envisioned a world where the United States was not  the premiere influence in the world. Well, tragically, that is the  world we see forming before us day-by-day in the news.   Madam Speaker, I have no idea what the carbon footprint of a missile  going into a Ukrainian's home is, but I do know that the human toll is  tragic, and that it is the result in part of acceding American energy  dominance.   We must stop in this Nation selling away generations of progress made  by American workers and innovators and restore American energy  dominance.
