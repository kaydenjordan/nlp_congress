For his service, Lieutenant Castro earned the National Defense  Service Medal, the Distinguished Flying Cross, and the Air Medal with  an Oak Leaf Cluster.

This bill honors  their skill and service to the Nation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New York for  bringing up this bill.   The State of Alabama takes immense pride in the Tuskegee Airmen for  their skill and courage.

Rivers, Jr. Post Office Building''.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4646         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. LANCE CORPORAL THOMAS E. RIVERS, JR. POST OFFICE                     BUILDING.         (a) Designation.--The facility of the United States Postal       Service located at 1900 Corporate Drive in Birmingham,       Alabama, shall be known and designated as the ``Lance       Corporal Thomas E.

Rivers, Jr.       Post Office Building''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4646. This bill names  the post office at 1900 Corporate Drive in Birmingham, Alabama, after  Lance Corporal Thomas E. Rivers, Jr.   Corporal Rivers was a resident of Hoover, Alabama, and a graduate of  Briarwood Christian School.   Both of Rivers' grandfathers served in the military, and he desired  to follow in their footsteps. Corporal Rivers wrote in a high school  essay that he ``wanted to be a marine since he was 10 years old,'' and  that he believed ``joining the Marines would be a good experience for  him because it would teach  [[Page H1350]]  him to rely on God to make it through.''   Two weeks after graduating from high school, Thomas fulfilled his  dream by joining the Marines. He was known by his fellow marines as a  man of devout faith who was always looking for ways to serve his fellow  marines.   In the early morning hours of April 28, 2010, while deployed in  Helmand province, Afghanistan, Rivers ordered his men to take their  positions. However, the marine assigned to stand watch was exhausted.  As a patrol leader, Rivers was never required to stand post, but Thomas  had been reading in the Bible about how love isn't an emotion but is  demonstrated in laying your life down for your friends. Rivers told the  weary marine: ``I'll stand post for you; you rest.''   Tragically, while replacing the exhausted marine, Rivers activated an  improvised explosive device. Rivers gave his life for his country and  exemplified the attitude in John 15:13:         Greater love has no one than this, that he should lay down       his life for his friends.    This bill pays tribute to Corporal Rivers' sacrifice. Mr. Speaker, I  urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate very much the comments from the  gentleman from Missouri. I know the family does.   I knew Corporal Rivers. He attended the same high school as my  children. I know his mom and dad very well. He is another example--as  we have heard time and time again on this floor--of young men and women  willing to sacrifice their lives not only for their country, but for  their fellow soldiers and marines. It is an honor to stand here with my  friend, the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Clay) to urge passage of this  bill.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to make the gentleman from Missouri aware  that I have no further speakers, and I am prepared to close.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4685) to designate the facility of the United States Postal  Service located at 515 Hope Street in Bristol, Rhode Island, as the  ``First Sergeant P. Andrew McKenna Jr. Post Office''.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.

In August 2015, First Sergeant McKenna was killed in action while  defending Camp Integrity in Kabul, Afghanistan, against insurgents.
