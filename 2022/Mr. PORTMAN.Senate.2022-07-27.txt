 Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Bishop  Timothy J. Clarke on 40 years of servant leadership to the congregation  at First Church of God in Columbus, OH, as well as to the broader  Columbus community and the State of Ohio.   Bishop Clarke came to Columbus in 1982 after serving as associate  minister at First Church of God in his hometown of Far Rockaway, NY,  and as pastor at York Avenue Church of God in Warren, OH. He has grown  First Church of God into one of the largest ministries in Ohio and is  known across Ohio and the Nation for his spiritual leadership and  ability to help bring people together to address many of the challenges  facing our communities.   Bishop Clarke is also the founder and chief prelate of the Berean  Fellowship, an international assembly that partners and mentors pastors  of small to mid-size churches and those who are new to the ministry.   I have had the pleasure of working with Bishop Clarke for a dozen  years. I have benefited from his spiritual guidance and worked with him  on efforts to battle addiction and human trafficking. He has also  provided valuable counsel on our efforts to reduce recidivism and help  people exiting our criminal justice system get jobs and get their lives  back on track.   My wife Jane and I have had the privilege of joining Bishop Clarke  and First Lady Clytemnestra Clarke at First Church of God, where we  always leave inspired and rejuvenated from his powerful and practical  Sunday sermons.   I thank Bishop Clarke for his friendship and counsel, congratulate  him on reaching this impressive 40-year milestone, and wish him and  First Church of God the best in the years to come.                            ____________________
