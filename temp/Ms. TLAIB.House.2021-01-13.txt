 Madam Speaker, in Michigan's 13th, we proudly speak truth  to power, even in the face of a racist in chief.   Those who incited an attack on the people's House do not get to talk  about healing and unity. They have torn this country apart. They have  stoked the fire and then handed the gasoline to Donald Trump.   Dr. King once said: ``True peace is not merely the absence of  tension; it is the presence of justice.''   Today, we must embody those words, and we must understand that peace  must be centered in truth and action.   We cannot, Madam Speaker, sit idly by after a violent attempted coup  and allow lies and hate to continue. Today, we stand up for our  constituents, who continue to be harmed by Donald Trump.
