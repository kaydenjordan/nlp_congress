 Mr. Speaker, as a young farmer, I knew of James R. Cash at  an early age. He was a legend in the agriculture community and a  household name in west Kentucky. His farm auctions were always the  highest grossing sales anywhere and regularly attended by farmers from  six States.   As an aspiring politician, James R., Cindy, and Caroline took me in  and were instrumental in the development of my organization in west  Kentucky. James R. always put my campaign signs up all over my very  large Congressional district--especially en route to Fancy Farm. He  hosted events, donated money, offered advice, and always allowed me to  stay in his guest house.   James R. Cash was extremely successful in business and life. His  great legacy will live on in his three children. I am extremely pleased  to work in Washington with Caroline, who definitely inherited her  father's intelligence, patience, and management skills. West Kentucky  has lost a great entrepreneur, father, husband, and role model.   James R. Cash will be deeply missed by everyone who ever knew him.                            ____________________
