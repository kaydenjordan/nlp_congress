 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 3628) to reauthorize the National Flood Insurance Program.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 3628         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``National Flood Insurance       Program Extension Act''.       SEC. 2. REAUTHORIZATION OF NATIONAL FLOOD INSURANCE PROGRAM.         (a) Financing.--Section 1309(a) of the National Flood       Insurance Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C.  [[Page H10582]]       4016(a)) is amended by striking ``November 30, 2018'' and       inserting ``May 31, 2019''.        (b) Program Expiration.--Section 1319 of the National Flood       Insurance Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 4026) is amended by striking       ``November 30, 2018'' and inserting ``May 31, 2019''.        (c) Retroactive Effective Date.--If this Act is enacted       after November 30, 2018, the amendments made by subsections       (a) and (b) shall take effect as if enacted on November 30,       2018.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, this is an unfortunate day where we are once again  extending the National Flood Program for--I don't know how many times  we have done this. We have been unable to get to the basic reforms that  this program demands.   But, Mr. Speaker, there are 140 million Americans who live in coastal  counties, millions of whom depend on this program to protect them from  flood risk. Without this program, they cannot buy or sell homes. If  their policies lapse because we allow the program to lapse, they will  not be able to buy a new policy, and if, God forbid, a storm like Sandy  or like the storms that ravaged the Southeast recently, if one of those  storms comes along during that lapse, those people will have no  coverage. We simply cannot allow our failure to so negatively affect so  many millions of Americans.   So, today, we are here to extend the program for another 6 months to  give a new Congress time to get to some reasonable bipartisan reforms  that will put this program on a solid footing for the future.   I am asking that we pass this bill, this extension. It is not  perfect, obviously, but it is better than the alternative, and we need  to get this done before this Congress recesses.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I agree with everything the ranking  member said except she turned me into an Irishman. It is ``MacArthur''  like the general, not ``McCarthy'' like the majority leader.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr.  Graves), who has been keenly focused on this issue.                                time  1745     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to  the concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 148) directing the Secretary of  the Senate to make a correction in the enrollment of the bill S. 3628.   The Clerk read the title of the concurrent resolution.   The text of the concurrent resolution is as follows:                              H. Con. Res. 148         Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate       concurring), That in the enrollment of the bill S. 3628, the       Secretary of the Senate shall make the following correction:       Strike ``November 30, 2018'' each place such term appears and       insert ``December 7, 2018''.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, this is a simple technical correction to fix a date  error in the suspension bill that we just debated. I don't think it  requires any discussion, other than if we want that bill to pass and  have effect, we need to change the date, and that is what this bill  accomplishes.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
