 Mr. Speaker, we, in Michigan, have been devastated by  this virus. We were third for the number of cases in the country for  weeks and, until this week, remained third in the number of deaths.   Two million people are unemployed, and lives have been forever  changed.   The Chair of the Fed said this week that if we don't want this  economy to be ruined, we need to invest now, and that is what this bill  does. It is not perfect, but the people of my district need help and  they need it now.   There are pension provisions in here that are not perfect, that help  some and not others, but I urge my colleagues to vote for this bill.
