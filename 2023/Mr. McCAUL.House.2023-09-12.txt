 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 3152) to impose sanctions with respect to countries,  individuals, and entities that engage in any effort to acquire,  possess, develop, transport, transfer, or deploy Iranian missiles and  related goods and technology, including materials and equipment, and  for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3152         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Fight and Combat Rampant       Iranian Missile Exports Act'' or the ``Fight CRIME Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress makes the following findings:        (1) Annex B to United Nations Security Council Resolution       2231 (2015) restricts certain missile-related activities and       transfers to and from Iran, including all items, materials,       equipment, goods, and technology set out in the Missile       Technology Control Regime Annex, absent advance, case-by-case       approval from the United Nations Security Council.        (2) Iran has transferred Shahed and Mohajer drones, covered       under the Missile Technology Control Regime Annex, to the       Russian Federation, the Government of Ethiopia, and other       Iran-aligned entities, including the Houthis in Yemen and       militia units in Iraq, without prior authorization from the       United Nations Security Council, in violation of the       restrictions set forth in Annex B to United Nations Security       Council Resolution 2231.        (3) Absent action by the United Nations Security Council,       certain missile-related restrictions in Annex B to United       Nations Security Council Resolution 2231 will expire in       October 2023, removing international legal restrictions on       missile-related activities and transfers to and from Iran.       SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY.         It is the policy of the United States--        (1) to urgently seek the extension of missile-related       restrictions set forth in Annex B to United Nations Security       Council Resolution 2231 (2015);        (2) to use all available authorities to constrain Iran's       domestic ballistic missile production capabilities;        (3) to combat and deter the transfer of conventional and       non-conventional arms, equipment, material, and technology       to, or from Iran, or involving the Government of Iran; and        (4) to ensure countries, individuals, and entities engaged       in, or attempting to engage in, the acquisition,       facilitation, or development of arms and related components       and technology subject to restrictions under Annex B to       United Nations Security Council Resolution 2231 are held to       account under United States and international law, including       through the application and enforcement of sanctions and use       of export controls, regardless of whether the restrictions       under Annex B to United Nations Security Council Resolution       2231 remain in effect following their anticipated expiration       in October 2023.       SEC. 4. REPORT.

(2) An analysis of how the expiration of missile-related       restrictions set forth in Annex B to United Nations Security       Council Resolution 2231 would impact the Government of Iran's       arms proliferation and malign activities, including as the       restrictions relate to cooperation with, and support for,       Iran-aligned entities and allied countries.        (3) An assessment of the revenue, or in-kind benefits, to       be accrued by the Government of Iran, or Iran-aligned       entities, as a result of a lapse in missile-related       restrictions set forth in Annex B to United Nations Security       Council Resolution 2231.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include extraneous material on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, Iran poses an existential threat to the global balance  of power, threatening our national security, as well as those of our  allies, and regional stability.   General Kurilla, the commander of the U.S. Central Command, who I met  with at the Munich Security Conference, testified to Congress this year  that Iran possessed both the largest and most diverse missile arsenal  in the Middle East and the largest and most capable unmanned aerial  vehicle, or drone, force in the region, which is why the passage of the  Fight and Combat Rampant Iranian Missile Exports Act is so vital.   For years, we have seen Iran and its terrorist proxies use these  weapons against the United States as well as our partners and allies  throughout the Middle East.   In January 2020, Iran launched a missile attack on U.S. troops in  Iraq. Iranian UAVs are frequently used to attack U.S. servicemembers  and personnel in the Middle East. These UAVs are a deadly threat that  have killed and wounded Americans.   Iranian UAVs have also been used in destructive strikes on Saudi- and  Israeli-linked targets. Iran frequently provides these deadly weapons  to its proxies, including Hezbollah, the Houthis, and Iraqi militia  groups.   Now, Iran's lethal drones are wreaking havoc outside the Middle East.  Hundreds of these drones have been deployed by Vladimir Putin against  civilian and civilian infrastructure in Ukraine, becoming a key element  in his unprovoked war of aggression and war crimes.   For years, Iran's missile and drone proliferation to its terror  proxies and to Russia has taken place in outright violation of the  United Nations international embargo on Iran's missile and drone  programs.   We note that the Ayatollah, Vladimir Putin, and Iran's terrorist  proxies don't care about violating U.N. resolutions, but other  countries do. Next month, these international restrictions on Iran's  lethal missile and drone programs will expire after 15 years. I am  deeply concerned that the marketplace for Iran's missiles and drones  will expand. Dangerous autocrats, war criminals, and terrorists around  the world will turn to Iran for missiles and drones, just as we saw  them doing following the expiration of the U.N. arms embargo on Iran in  2020.   That is why it is urgent that the House pass my bipartisan bill, the  Fight and Combat Rampant Iranian Missile Exports, or Fight CRIME, Act.  The bill, which I was proud to introduce with Ranking Member Meeks,  imposes strict mandatory sanctions on Iran's missile and drone  capability to fill the gap left by the expiration of the U.N.  restrictions.   Everyone must know that if they purchase Iran's weapons of war, they  will be frozen out of the U.S. financial system, denied use of the U.S.  dollar, and denied access to the United States. For years, Iran and its  proxies have rained hell on the Middle East from the sky with their  attack UAVs. Now Iran's dangerous arsenal is enabling Russian war  crimes and the devastation of Ukraine.   We cannot wait to act until the U.N. restrictions expire. We need to  prevent these weapons sales now before these deadly missiles and drones  are on the battlefield. In fact, Iran is working with Russia inside of  Russia to make these very drones.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.                                                  September 1, 2023.      Hon. Michael McCaul,      Chairman, Committee on Foreign Affairs,      House of Representatives, Washington, D.C.        Dear Chairman McCaul: I write regarding H.R. 3152, the       Fight and Combat Rampant Iranian Missile Exports Act.       Provisions of this bill fall within the Judiciary Committee's       Rule X jurisdiction, and I appreciate that you consulted with       us on those provisions. The Judiciary Committee agrees that       it shall be discharged from further consideration of the bill       so that it may proceed expeditiously to the House floor.        The Committee takes this action with the understanding that       forgoing further consideration of this measure does not in       any way alter the Committee's jurisdiction or waive any       future jurisdictional claim over these provisions or their       subject matter. We also reserve the right to seek appointment       of an appropriate number of conferees in the event of a       conference with the Senate involving this measure or similar       legislation.        I ask that you please include this letter in your       committee's report to accompany this legislation. I       appreciate the cooperative manner in which our committees       have worked on this matter, and I look forward to working       collaboratively in the future on matters of shared       jurisdiction. Thank you for your attention to this matter.            Sincerely,                                                        Jim Jordan,      Chairman.                                   ____                                                 September 11, 2023.      Hon. Jim Jordan,      Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,      Washington, D.C.        Dear Chairman Jordan: Thank you for consulting with the       Foreign Affairs Committee and agreeing to be discharged from       further consideration of H.R. 3152, the ``Fight and Combat       Rampant Iranian Missile Exports Act,'' so that the measure       may proceed expeditiously to the House floor.        I agree that your forgoing further action on this measure       does not in any way diminish or alter the jurisdiction of       your committee, or prejudice its jurisdictional prerogatives       on this measure or similar legislation in the future. I would       support your effort to seek appointment of an appropriate       number of conferees from your committee to any House-Senate       conference on this legislation.        I will seek to place our letters on this bill into the       Congressional Record during floor consideration. I appreciate       your cooperation regarding this legislation and look forward       to continuing to work together as this measure moves through       the legislative process.            Sincerely,                                                 Michael T. McCaul,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Dean for her strong  support of this measure and her leadership.   Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers. I reserve the right to  close, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Despite what you may hear about partisan divides, our committee, I  think, stands apart. This bill to impose sanctions on those doing  business with Iran's missile and drone program was introduced by myself  and Ranking Member Meeks of the Foreign Affairs Committee. It passed  our committee unanimously. It has over 225 cosponsors, with a mix of  Republicans and Democrats.   Congress and the American people are keenly aware of the destructive  power of Iran's drones, and we are absolutely committed to reining in  this threat. We are united in delivering a bipartisan message to  countries around the world: Do not buy or acquire Iranian drones and  missiles. Do not associate yourself with the IRGC, Vladimir Putin, or  Iran's terrorist proxies.   Putin and the Ayatollah may try to ramp up their military  cooperation, but we will do everything in our power to stop them, and  in doing so, safeguard free democracies around the world.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan measure,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 589) to impose sanctions on the Supreme Leader of Iran and  the President of Iran and their respective offices for human rights  abuses and support for terrorism, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 589         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Mahsa Amini Human rights and       Security Accountability Act'' or the ``MAHSA Act''.       SEC. 2. IMPOSITION OF SANCTIONS ON IRAN'S SUPREME LEADER'S                     OFFICE, ITS APPOINTEES, AND ANY AFFILIATED                     PERSONS.         (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:        (1) The Supreme Leader is an institution of the Islamic       Republic of Iran.        (2) The Supreme Leader holds ultimate authority over Iran's       judiciary and security apparatus, including the Ministry of       Intelligence and Security, law enforcement forces under the       Interior Ministry, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps       (IRGC), and the Basij, a nationwide volunteer paramilitary       group subordinate to the IRGC, all of which have engaged in       human rights abuses in Iran. Additionally the IRGC, a United       States designated Foreign Terrorist Organization, which       reports to the Supreme Leader, continues to perpetrate       terrorism around the globe, including attempts to kill and       kidnap American citizens on United States soil.        (3) The Supreme Leader appoints the head of Iran's       judiciary. International observers continue to criticize the       lack of independence of Iran's judicial system and maintained       that trials disregarded international standards of fairness.        (4) The revolutionary courts, created by Iran's former       Supreme Leader Ruhollah Khomeini, within Iran's judiciary,       are chiefly responsible  [[Page H4243]]       for hearing cases of political offenses, operate in parallel       to Iran's criminal justice system and routinely hold grossly       unfair trials without due process, handing down predetermined       verdicts and rubberstamping executions for political purpose.        (5) The Iranian security and law enforcement forces engage       in serious human rights abuse at the behest of the Supreme       Leader.        (6) Iran's President, Ebrahim Raisi, sits at the helm of       the most sanctioned cabinet in Iranian history which includes       internationally sanctioned rights violators. Raisi has       supported the recent crackdown on protestors and is a rights       violator himself, having served on a ``death commission'' in       1988 that led to the execution of several thousand political       prisoners in Iran. He most recently served as the head of       Iran's judiciary, a position appointed by Iran's current       Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, and may likely be a potential       candidate to replace Khamenei as Iran's next Supreme Leader.        (7) On September 16, 2022, a 22-year-old woman, Mahsa       Amini, died in the detention of the Morality Police after       being beaten and detained for allegedly transgressing       discriminatory dress codes for women. This tragic incident       triggered widespread, pro-women's rights, pro-democracy       protests across all of Iran's 31 provinces, calling for the       end to Iran's theocratic regime.        (8) In the course of the protests, the Iranian security       forces' violent crackdown includes mass arrests, well       documented beating of protestors, throttling of the internet       and telecommunications services, and shooting protestors with       live ammunition. Iranian security forces have reportedly       killed hundreds of protestors and other civilians, including       women and children, and wounded many more.        (9) Iran's Supreme Leader is the leader of the ``Axis of       Resistance'', which is a network of Tehran's terror proxy and       partner militias materially supported by the Islamic       Revolutionary Guard Corps that targets the United States as       well as its allies and partners.        (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--        (1) the United States shall stand with and support the       people of Iran in their demand for fundamental human rights;        (2) the United States shall continue to hold the Islamic       Republic of Iran, particularly the Supreme Leader and       President, accountable for abuses of human rights,       corruption, and export of terrorism; and        (3) Iran must immediately end its gross violations of       internationally recognized human rights.        (c) In General.--        (1) Determination and report required.--Not later than 90       days after the date of the enactment of this Act, and       annually thereafter, the President shall--        (A) determine whether each foreign person described in       subsection (d) meets the criteria for imposition of sanctions       under one or more of the sanctions programs and authorities       listed in paragraph (2);        (B) impose applicable sanctions against any foreign person       determined to meet the criteria for imposition of sanctions       pursuant to subparagraph (A) under the sanctions programs and       authorities listed in subparagraph (A) or (F) of subsection       (c)(2) and pursue applicable sanctions against any foreign       person determined to meet the criteria for imposition of       sanctions pursuant to subparagraph (A) under the sanctions       programs and authorities listed in subparagraph (B), (C),       (D), or (E) of subsection (c)(2); and        (C) submit to the appropriate congressional committees a       report in unclassified form, with a classified annex provided       separately if needed, containing--        (i) a list of all foreign persons described in subsection       (d) that meet the criteria for imposition of sanctions under       one or more of the sanctions programs and authorities listed       in paragraph (2); and        (ii) for each foreign person identified pursuant to clause       (i)--         (I) a list of each sanctions program or authority listed in       paragraph (2) for which the person meets the criteria for       imposition of sanctions;        (II) a statement which, if any, of the sanctions authorized       by any of the sanctions programs and authorities identified       pursuant to subclause (I) have been imposed or will be       imposed within 30 days of the submission of the report; and        (III) with respect to which any of the sanctions authorized       by any of the sanctions programs and authorities identified       pursuant to subclause (I) have not been imposed and will not       be imposed within 30 days of the submission of the report,       the specific authority under which otherwise applicable       sanctions are being waived, have otherwise been determined       not to apply, or are not being imposed and a complete       justification of the decision to waive or otherwise not apply       the sanctions authorized by such sanctions programs and       authorities.

SEC. 3. SEVERABILITY.         If any provision of this Act, or the application of such       provision to any person or circumstance, is found to be       unconstitutional, the remainder of this Act, or the       application of that provision to other persons or       circumstances, shall not be affected.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include extraneous material on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, we all know that Iran has committed brutal human rights  violations. This regime silences dissent and suppresses the truth, and  those who dare speak out face severe consequences, including death.   Mr. Speaker, 1 year ago, 22-year-old Mahsa Amini was murdered by the  Iranian regime, the so-called morality police, while in police custody.  Iran's morality police had detained her for a false crime unthinkable  to most of us here in this Chamber.   What was the crime?   It was failing to properly cover her hair.  [[Page H4244]]    The people of Iran were outraged by her brutal murder and by the  range of injustices that the Ayatollah subjects Iranians to day in and  day out. This outrage led the great people of Iran to rise up in  peaceful protest, demanding change.   Sadly, but not surprisingly, the regime responded with a violent  crackdown against the protesters. They detained tens of thousands of  their own citizens and killed hundreds more. The regime choked off  access to the outside world by blocking the internet. Disturbingly,  violence and isolation are how they deny their own people their freedom  and their voice.   The international community has failed the people of Iran by failing  to compel their oppressors to stop this abuse. We have many sanctions  laws designed to address the Iranian regime's human rights violations.  However, it is clear that many officials and institutions in Iran have  not yet been sanctioned for their role in these abuses. That is why it  is so important that we pass this bipartisan bill that was authored and  introduced by Representative Banks from Indiana.   We must require the President to formally determine whether specific  high-ranking regime officials and institutions meet the criteria for  imposition of our sanctions and then act based on those determinations.   The Biden administration has its own political agenda when it comes  to Iran. This administration wants to broker a bad nuclear agreement  with Iran and has made it clear that it is willing to sacrifice  leverage in the form of sanctions enforcement to do so.   My longstanding concerns only grew when we learned that the  administration's chief negotiator, Rob Malley, was being investigated  for problems with his security clearance. This administration must be  transparent about these allegations and how they have impacted the last  2 years of Iran's policy.   To the administration, I say this: We must not sell out the Iranian  people to reach a bad nuclear deal with Iran.   A nuclear Iran is simply not acceptable. We must fully enforce the  laws on the books that we have in order to stop the grotesque human  rights violations taking place in Iran.   That is why as we approach the 1-year anniversary of Mahsa Amini's  tragic death--it is so fitting that we do it here in this Chamber this  week--Congress must show the world that we have not forgotten Mahsa or  the millions of Iranians who have experienced violence, oppression, and  even death at the hands of the regime.   Mr. Speaker, I urge unanimous support for this measure, and I reserve  the balance of my time.

Sincerely,                                                  Michael T. McCaul                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Banks), who is the author of this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time, and I am  prepared to close.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the Ranking Member Meeks,  Congresswoman Madeleine Dean, and Congressman Lloyd Doggett for their  work on this bill. I also thank Representative Banks for leading this  important bipartisan measure to ensure the United States upholds its  moral responsibility as a beacon of freedom in human rights.   This bill does not create any new sanctions programs. The tools we  are discussing here today already exist. We are simply asking the  administration to enforce them. We must do everything we can to stand  with the people of Iran and prevent more violence and suffering.   I feel for Mahsa's family, seeing her being beaten, tortured, and put  to death for the so-called crime of merely not wearing her hijab  correctly is really unfathomable to Americans and our way of life in a  free society, and it cannot stand.   I look forward to a day when the Ayatollah is out of power and the  people of Iran can be free to express themselves without this kind of  oppression and tyranny. I know it will happen one day, and I hope it  happens in my lifetime.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.  [[Page H4247]]     Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the  resolution (H. Res. 492) condemning the Government of Iran's state- sponsored persecution of the Baha'i minority and its continued  violation of the International Covenants on Human Rights.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                H.

Branch 54 of the Tehran Appeals Court upheld the       decision in August following the destruction of six Baha'i       houses in Rooshankooh;        (3) government officials arrested 14 Baha'is during a       religious study in Ghaemshahr; and        (4) the Government of Iran ``continued its systematic       campaign of Baha'i arrests'' throughout the latter part of       2022;        Whereas, in response to a surge in persecution in June and       July 2022, involving the subjection of over 100 Baha'is to       arrests, arraignments, sentencings, and raids on their homes       and businesses across Iran, including the sentencing in June       of 26 individuals in the city of Shiraz to a combined total       of 85 years in prison, the Department of State's Office of       International Religious Freedom issued a statement on August       2, 2022, indicating that ``[a]mid a continued rise in       arrests, sentences, and imprisonments, the U.S. urges Iran to       halt its ongoing oppression of the Baha'i community and honor       its international obligations to respect the right of all       Iranians to freedom of religion or belief'';        Whereas the Iran section of the Department of State's 2022       Report on International Religious Freedom issued in May 2023       provides, in part--        (1) ``According to the Baha'i International Community       (BIC), Amnesty International, multiple international news       organizations, and the United Nations, in July and August,       security forces in cities across the country conducted       multiple raids of Baha'i homes, confiscated property deemed       `illegitimate wealth,' and arrested Baha'is in their homes or       workplaces on unsubstantiated charges including `causing       intellectual and ideological insecurity in Muslim society.'';        (2) ``In August, a group of UN human rights experts       released a joint statement calling on the government to stop       the increasing arbitrary arrests and enforced disappearances       of members of the Baha'i Faith and the destruction or       confiscation of their properties in what the experts said       `bears all the signs of a policy of systematic       persecution'.''; and        (3) ``In their August 22 statement, the UN experts stated       that as of April, more than 1,000 Baha'is awaited       imprisonment, following their initial arrest and hearings.'';        Whereas, on November 21, 2022, Ms. Mahvash Sabet and Ms.       Fariba Kamalabadi, 2 former members of the disbanded informal       7-person leadership group of the Baha'is of Iran, who each       served 10-year sentences from 2008 to 2018 and have been       detained since July 31, 2022, in Evin prison, were sentenced       to an additional 10 years in prison each after a summary       trial lasting 1 hour; and on February 10, 2023, another       former member of the disbanded leadership group, Mr. Afif       Naimi, who had also served a 10-year sentence from 2008 to       2018, was sentenced on February 10, 2023, to 7 years in       prison, which he began to serve on April 29, 2023;        Whereas, on December 11, 2022, the Baha'i International       Community organization reported that, ``More than 320 Baha'is       have been affected by individual acts of persecution since       the arrest [on July 31, 2022] of Mahvash [Sabet] and Fariba       [Kamalabadi]. Dozens were arrested at various points in       Shiraz, across Mazandaran province, and elsewhere throughout       the country. Homes owned by Baha'is in the village of       Roshankouh were demolished. Government plans to tar the       Baha'is through hate speech and propaganda were also exposed.       And at least 90 Baha'is are currently in prison or subject to       degrading ankle-band monitoring.'';        Whereas, on April 21, 2023, the Department of State's       Office of International Religious Freedom issued a statement       in a tweet indicating that, ``[w]e are deeply concerned       following the news of Mahvash Sabet's injuries sustained       while in prison. No one should be punished for their faith.       We call on Iranian authorities to make sure Mrs. Sabet       receives medical attention immediately and release her.'';        Whereas Iran is a member of the United Nations and a       signatory to both the Universal Declaration of Human Rights       and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,       among other international human rights treaties, without       reservation;        Whereas section 105 of the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions,       Accountability, and Divestment Act of 2010 (22 U.S.C. 8514)       authorizes the President to impose sanctions on individuals       who are ``responsible for or complicit in, or responsible for       ordering, controlling, or otherwise directing, the commission       of serious human rights abuses against citizens of Iran or       their family members on or after June 12, 2009''; and        Whereas the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights       Act of 2012 (Public Law 112-158) amends and expands the       authorities established under the Comprehensive Iran       Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act of 2010 (Public       Law 111-195) to sanction Iranian human rights abusers: Now,       therefore, be it        Resolved, That the House of Representatives--        (1) condemns the Government of Iran's state-sponsored       persecution of the Baha'i minority in Iran and the continued       violation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and       the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights;        (2) calls on the Government of Iran--        (A) to immediately release the imprisoned or detained       Baha'is and all other prisoners held solely on account of       their religion;        (B) to end its state-sponsored campaign of hate propaganda       against the Baha'is; and        (C) to reverse state-imposed policies denying Baha'is and       members of other religious minorities equal opportunities to       higher education, earning a livelihood, due process under the       law, and the free exercise of religious practices;        (3) calls on the President and the Secretary of State, in       cooperation with responsible nations, to immediately condemn       the Government of Iran's continued violation of human rights,       and demand the immediate release of prisoners held solely on       account of their religion; and        (4) urges the President and the Secretary of State to       utilize available authorities to impose sanctions on       officials of the Government of Iran and other individuals       directly responsible for serious human rights abuses,  [[Page H4248]]       including abuses against the Baha'i community of Iran.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, as the Iranian regime continues to violate human rights,  we must condemn the regime's state-sponsored persecution of the Baha'i  minority and its other ongoing abuses.   For the past year, Iran's barbaric human rights violations have faced  renewed scrutiny following the regime's crackdown on peaceful protests  after the murder of Mahsa Amini. Unfortunately, this sickening cruelty  has become characteristic of the Iranian regime's control for over 40  years. The regime has consistently targeted the Baha'i and other  religious minorities with harassment, discrimination, and violence.   For decades, the Iranian regime has terrorized the Baha'i, who face  arbitrary arrest, forced disappearances, property confiscation, and  economic discrimination at the hands of the regime.   Religious persecution in any form is repulsive, and we must condemn  it in the strongest possible terms. That is why I cosponsored this  resolution, which the gentlewoman from Illinois, Congresswoman  Schakowsky, introduced.   This measure details Iran's ongoing crimes against the Baha'i  minority and calls for further action to address these serious human  rights abuses. Congress will continue to stand with all the people of  Iran to defend their rights, including religious freedom.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support for this measure, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time, and I am  prepared to close.    Mr. Speaker, in closing, I thank Ranking Member Meeks,  Congresswoman Dean, and the gentlewoman from Illinois for offering this  bipartisan resolution in support of human rights and religious freedom  for the Baha'i community in Iran.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this  resolution, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
