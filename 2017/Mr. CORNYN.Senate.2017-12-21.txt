 Mr. President, I would like to speak briefly today about  the year we have had here in Washington, DC.   At times along the way, it wasn't easy. There were more than one or  two bumps in the road, and there were times when we got discouraged  because we weren't able to accomplish everything we wanted to  accomplish on the part of the American people. But looking back, I am  proud of what we were able to get done.   The first thing is to notice the speed with which President Trump was  able to nominate and we were able to confirm Federal judges. Everyone  remembers last January when President  [[Page S8194]]  Trump nominated Neil Gorsuch to the U.S. Supreme Court. This was an  excellent choice. He is an experienced Federal judge and accomplished  scholar who understands the proper role of a judge under our  Constitution.   I think the weather and my sinuses are not cooperating here at this  moment.   I will be back later.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.    The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator  from Arizona (Mr. McCain).   The result was announced--yeas 91, nays 8, as follows:                        [Rollcall Vote No. 324 Leg.]                                  YEAS--91       Alexander      Baldwin      Barrasso      Bennet      Blumenthal      Blunt      Booker      Boozman      Brown      Burr      Cantwell      Capito      Cardin      Carper      Casey      Cassidy      Cochran      Collins      Coons      Corker      Cornyn      Cortez Masto      Cotton      Daines      Donnelly      Duckworth      Durbin      Enzi      Ernst      Feinstein      Fischer      Franken      Gardner      Gillibrand      Graham      Grassley      Harris      Hassan      Hatch      Heinrich      Heitkamp      Heller      Hirono      Hoeven      Inhofe      Isakson      Johnson      Kaine      King      Klobuchar      Lankford      Leahy      Manchin      Markey      McCaskill      McConnell      Menendez      Merkley      Moran      Murkowski      Murphy      Murray      Nelson      Perdue      Peters      Portman      Reed      Roberts      Rounds      Rubio      Sanders      Schatz      Schumer      Scott      Shaheen      Shelby      Stabenow      Strange      Sullivan      Tester      Thune      Tillis      Toomey      Udall      Van Hollen      Warner      Warren      Whitehouse      Wicker      Wyden      Young                                  NAYS--8       Crapo      Cruz      Flake      Kennedy      Lee      Paul      Risch      Sasse                               NOT VOTING--1               McCain           The PRESIDING OFFICER.
