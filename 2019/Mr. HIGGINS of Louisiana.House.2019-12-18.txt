 Mr. Speaker, I have descended into the  belly of the beast. I have witnessed the terror within, and I rise  committed to oppose the insidious forces which threaten our Republic.  America is being severely injured by this betrayal, by this unjust and  weaponized impeachment brought upon us by the same Socialists who  threaten unborn life in the womb, who threaten First Amendment rights  of conservatives, who threaten Second Amendment protections of every  American patriot, and who have long ago determined that they would  organize and conspire to overthrow President Trump.   We don't face this horror because the Democrats have all of a sudden  become constitutionalists. We are not being devoured from within  because of some surreal assertion of the Socialists' newfound love of  the very flag that they have trod upon.   We face this horror because of this map. This is what the Democrats  fear. They fear the true will of we the people. They are deep  establishment D.C. They fear what they call on this Republican map,  flyover country. They call us deplorables. They fear our faith, they  fear our strength, they fear our unity, they fear our vote, and they  fear our President.   We will never surrender our Nation to career establishment D.C.  politicians and bureaucrats. Our Republic shall survive this threat  from within. American patriots shall prevail.
