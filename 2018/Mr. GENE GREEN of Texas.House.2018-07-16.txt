 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 490. This bipartisan  legislation, sponsored by Senators Steve Daines, Jon Tester, and Jim  Risch, would reinstate and extend the deadline for the construction of  a hydroelectric project on the Gibson Dam in Augusta, Montana.  Congressman Gianforte of Montana introduced companion legislation last  year.   The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission licensed the project in  2014, but the developer was unable to commence construction before the  statutory deadlines passed.   S. 490 is substantially similar to legislation that, during the  previous Congress, was reported unanimously by the Energy and Commerce  Committee and passed the House with 410 votes. I know of no objections  to the bill on this side of the aisle, and I ask my colleagues to join  me in voting in support of S. 490.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and  I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5333, the Over-the- Counter Monograph, Safety, Innovation and Reform Act.   I am a proud original cosponsor of this legislation that will  strengthen the Food and Drug Administration's ability to oversee the  over-the-counter drug market and establish a user fee program for this  market for the first time.   H.R. 5333 is legislation that enjoys bipartisan support and would  reform the current monograph system that is relied upon by industry to  legally market over-the-counter drugs in response to concerns raised by  both the FDA and the industry that the current system is outdated and  burdensome.   Under current law, the safety and effectiveness of over-the-counter  drugs is established through conformance with a monograph. Monographs  serve as a type of rule book outlining the conditions of use for a  particular drug ingredient, including the dosage form, patient  population, labeling and warnings, and other requirements. This rule  book is established currently through a three-phase rulemaking process  and is very resource and time intensive.   This process has made it difficult for the FDA to finalize, revise,  or update monographs to reflect innovations, changes in science, or to  respond to safety issues.   We also have heard from the industry that the current process  inadvertently discourages innovation, as it is not nimble enough to  respond to evolving science and technology.   The legislation we are considering today would address these concerns  by transitioning the monograph system from rulemaking to administrative  order, create a procedure for the FDA to respond to the needs for  safety label changes, and establish an innovation pathway.  [[Page H6236]]    These reforms can only be successful if it is also accompanied by  stable and reliable funding that more appropriately represents the  growth and science of the over-the-counter industry.   Today, the over-the-counter monograph program oversees more than  100,000 products with a staff of about 30 people and a budget of just  over $8 million. The user fees provided in this bill would help the FDA  transition the monograph program from rulemaking to administrative  order, provide for additional staff capacity, and enable the FDA to  respond to innovation and safety changes in the current market.    I want to thank my colleague from Ohio, Congressman Bob Latta, for  introducing this legislation and for working with me and other members  of our committee. I would like to thank the original cosponsors of the  bill, Representative Diana DeGette, Representative Debbie Dingell,  Chairman Mike Burgess, and Representative Brett Guthrie for their  dedication and hard work on this important issue.   I ask all my colleagues to join me in supporting the Over-the-Counter  Monograph Safety, Innovation, and Reform Act.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. Dingell).    =========================== NOTE ===========================        July 16, 2018, on page H6236, the following appeared:  Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Colorado (Ms. DeGette), my colleague and a member of  our committee.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        July 16, 2018, on page H6237, the following appeared:  Mr. Speaker, I have no other speakers, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        July 16, 2018, on page H6237, the following appeared:  Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        July 16, 2018, on page H6241, the following appeared:  Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Schrader), our colleague from the Energy and  Commerce Committee.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        July 16, 2018, on page H6242, the following appeared:  Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and  I yield back the balance of my time.
