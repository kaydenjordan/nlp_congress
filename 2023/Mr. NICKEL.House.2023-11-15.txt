 Madam Speaker, last week Moody's changed its rating  outlook on the United States Government from stable to negative. This  was a direct consequence of partisan gridlock, continued political  polarization, and the chaos and confusion that we see playing out here  on the House floor with 19 votes for Speaker already.   That is why it was so important that we passed a short-term  government funding bill to keep the Federal Government open through  January. Avoiding a government shutdown will help restore trust in the  United States economy and ensure that working families aren't affected  by the chaos and confusion that we, again, see playing out here in  Washington.   As we look ahead, we must continue to put people over politics and  deliver a real budget that funds critical services, secures our border,  and supports our allies in Israel and Ukraine.   I remain ready to work in a bipartisan way to deliver results for the  American people.                            ____________________
