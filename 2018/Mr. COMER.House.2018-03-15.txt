 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr. James Mooneyhan  and Mr. Steve Thurmond for their contributions to Simpson County in the  First Congressional District of Kentucky.   These two community leaders have not only served as ambassadors for  Franklin-Simpson High School throughout their careers and collectively  witnessed over 33 years of sports history, but have contributed to the  economic development and well-being of their fellow citizens during  their careers in public service.   Off air, Steve Thurmond is the executive director of the Franklin- Simpson Chamber of Commerce, and James Mooneyhan has served as Simpson  County's jailer. From state championship titles to their children's  successes, their commentary continually showcased the fervent pride  Simpson Countians hold for their community.   The excitement and spirit resulting from the unique blend of their  personalities will be extremely difficult to replace, and their  retirement marks the end of an era for this storied program.   Although the voices of Franklin-Simpson athletics will soon be  broadcast throughout the region for the last time, I join with the  entire community to thank them for the laughs and unforgettable  memories they have provided over the last 25 years. I look forward to  seeing these Wildcat fans on the sidelines for years to come.                            ____________________
