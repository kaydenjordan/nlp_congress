 Mr. Speaker, this is a photo of United States Army  Staff Sergeant Ryan Knauss. He was one of the 13 servicemembers killed  outside the Kabul Airport on August 26.   Staff Sergeant Knauss grew up where I live in Corryton, Tennessee. He  always dreamed of joining the American military and did so after  graduating from Gibbs High School.   When the Taliban rapidly took control of Afghanistan last month, it  created a dangerous situation for American citizens and our allies in  the country. In response, our military ramped up its presence at Hamid  Karzai International Airport to assist with the evacuation efforts.  Staff Sergeant Knauss, who previously served a 9-month deployment in  Afghanistan, volunteered to go back for this mission.   Outside that airport was where Staff Sergeant Knauss would selflessly  give his life so civilians could escape to safety. He was there helping  complete strangers, but this wasn't out of character for him. He loved  helping people, and he died doing it.   Following his death, Staff Sergeant Knauss returned home to east  Tennessee for a memorial service on September 11. Hundreds from our  community lined the procession route in honor of his heroism. And this  afternoon, at Arlington National Cemetery, Staff Sergeant Knauss was  laid to rest.   Look one more time at this picture behind me. This is what a true  American hero looks like. It is not somebody who dribbles a basketball  or hits a baseball or throws a football or acts or sings on stage.  Remember the last American military casualty from the war in  Afghanistan. Remember Staff Sergeant Ryan Knauss.                            ____________________
