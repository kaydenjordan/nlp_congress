 If I might lend my voice on this and thank both of my  colleagues. Senator Cantwell has been the leader in so many ways on  innovation in the healthcare system as we debated next to each other in  the Finance Committee on the Affordable Care Act.   I wanted to share that in Michigan, where we expanded Medicaid,  because of changes that have been made and work that is being done in  the budget going forward in the new year, there is now close to $500  million more in the State of Michigan budget than was there before  because of Medicaid expansion and the ability to manage healthcare  risk. People have more healthcare coverage. We actually have 97 percent  of the children in Michigan who can see a doctor today, which is  incredible. At the same time the State is going to save close to $500  million in the coming year's budget.    I thank the Senator very much. I will say this briefly  and then turn to our colleague from Pennsylvania, who has been such a  champion for children.   I would say first--again, as I said a moment ago--that, because of  Medicaid, because of the healthcare expansion, 97 percent of the  children in Michigan now can see a doctor. That means moms who are  pregnant and babies, and moms and dads are less likely to be going to  bed at night and saying: Please, God, do not let the kids get sick,  because they can actually go to a doctor.   It reminds me, though, of the other thing happening on the floor and  the larger question of the nominee for the Centers for Medicare and  Medicaid Services. In the larger context, I asked her about whether or  not maternity care and prenatal care should be covered as a basic  healthcare requirement for women. I mean, it is pretty basic for us.  She wouldn't answer the question. Essentially, she said women can buy  extra if they want it. The new Secretary of Health and Human Services  said that we, as women, can buy extra coverage for basic healthcare  coverage for us. So it all comes together--Medicaid, the nominee on the  floor, and what the House is doing to take away maternity care. It is  really just bad news for moms and babies.    Mr. President, as Senator Wyden's colloquy comes to an  end, I will make a few comments in addition to those of my colleagues,  and I very much appreciate all of their work.   There are so many different things to talk about as it relates to how  healthcare impacts people. As Senator Casey said, this is very  personal; it is not political. There are a lot of politics around this,  but it is very, very personal.   In Michigan, when we are talking about healthcare, in Medicaid alone  we are talking about 650,000 people who have been able to get coverage  now. Most of them are working in minimum wage jobs, and they now are  able to get healthcare but couldn't before, as well as their children.  That adds to the majority of seniors who are in nursing homes now,  folks getting long-term care, folks getting help for Alzheimer's and  other challenges and who are relying on Medicaid healthcare to be able  to cover their costs.   I want to share a letter, as well, from Wendy, a pediatric nurse  practitioner from Oakland County in Michigan. We have received so many  letters--I am so grateful for that--and emails.   She writes:         As a pediatric nurse practitioner, I have seen so many of       my patients benefit from the Affordable Care Act. Physical       exams for the kids are now covered in full, with no co-pay.       This means the kids are in to see us, which means we catch       healthcare issues and early problems with growth or       development that otherwise might be undetected and left       untreated until it became a much bigger problem.    Isn't that what we all want for our children, to catch things early?         Immunizations are covered, which keeps everyone safer.       Screening tests are covered, so potential problems are caught       while they can still be managed. This better care keeps kids       healthier and happier and prevents longer term care costs.    She goes on to write:         The Medicaid expansion means even more kids are covered,       keeping not only those children healthier but keeping       everyone around them healthier. Previously, parents of       children who did not have insurance coverage would not seek       care until the children were so ill that they could not see       another option. Frequently, these children then utilized       emergency room care--    Which, by the way, is the most expensive way to treat health  problems--       [it was] not only a missed opportunity for complete and       preventative healthcare but at a cost passed on to the       community.        On a much more personal level, in 2015, our granddaughter,       at age 3, was diagnosed with epilepsy related to a genetic       condition . . . which made her brain form abnormally. On top       of the epilepsy, she has developmental delays and autism, all       related to her double cortex syndrome. Although our daughter       and son-in-law are fully employed (teacher and paramedic),       she qualifies for Children's Special Health Care (under       Medicaid). This has been a huge blessing for us, and without       it our family would have been financially devastated.        We are hopeful that my granddaughter will continue to have       good seizure control and will develop to reach her full       potential, but without the care that her private insurance       and Children's Special Health Care provides, she would not       have much of a chance of getting anywhere near her potential.       I do not want to even consider how it will affect her future       if insurance companies can refuse to cover her care due to       her preexisting condition.    She concludes:         Please do not let partisan politics take precedence over       doing what is right and what is best for the health of every       U.S. citizen.    I know we are all getting hundreds of thousands of letters and emails  and phone calls of very similar stories because healthcare is personal  to each of  [[Page S1724]]  us--to our children, our grandchildren, our moms, and dads, and  grandpas and grandmas. It is not political.   I am very grateful for my colleagues' being here today. I want to  speak not only about the importance of expansion under Medicaid but  also about the person who would be in charge of that very, very  important set of services. That is the nomination in front of us, that  of Seema Verma to be the Administrator of the Centers for Medicare and  Medicaid Services.   This is a critical position, especially given the ongoing efforts  that we are seeing right now to repeal healthcare--the Affordable Care  Act--and replace it with legislation that would literally rip away  coverage for millions of people and pull the thread that unravels our  entire healthcare system. The decisions of the Administrator, both as  an adviser to the President and as someone with the authority to make  large changes in the implementation of existing law, will have far- ranging consequences for all of us--certainly, for the people whom we  represent and especially for those who need healthcare, have begun  receiving it, and now may very well see it taken away.   In the Finance Committee, when I asked Ms. Verma about Medicaid, I  found that her positions would hurt families in Michigan, would hurt  seniors in nursing homes, and would hurt children. And looking at her  long record as a consultant on Medicaid, we know that Mrs. Verma's  proposals limit healthcare coverage and make it harder to afford  healthcare coverage, putting insurance companies ahead of patients and  families once again.   I am also very concerned about her position on maternity coverage.  During the hearing, I asked Ms. Verma whether women should get access  to basic prenatal care and maternity care coverage as the law now  allows--I am very proud of having authored that provision in the  Finance Committee--or whether insurance companies should get to choose  whether to provide basic healthcare coverage for women. I reminded her  that before the Affordable Care Act, only 12 percent of healthcare  plans available to somebody going out to buy private insurance offered  maternity care--the vast majority did not--and that the plans that did  often charged extra or required waiting periods. Her response indicated  that coverage of prenatal and maternity care should be optional-- optional. We as women cannot say our healthcare is optional.   The next CMS Administrator should be able to commit to enforcing the  law requiring maternity care to be covered and commit to protecting the  law going forward for women. Being a woman should not be a preexisting  condition. Getting basic healthcare should not mean we have to buy  riders or extra coverage because being a woman and the coverage we need  is somehow not viewed as basic by the insurance company. We have had  that fight. Women won that fight with the Affordable Care Act. We  should not go backward.   I followed up with Ms. Verma, along with many colleagues, but have  not received a response.   Over 100 million Americans count on Medicare and Medicaid. They need  a qualified Administrator who puts their needs first, and I cannot vote  for a nominee who does not guarantee that she will fight for the  resources and the healthcare that the people of Michigan count on and  need.
