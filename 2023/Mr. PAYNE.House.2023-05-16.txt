 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss the Colorectal Cancer  Payment Fairness Act. It is a bill that I reintroduced today to include  more colorectal screenings. Everyone knows that cancer screenings save  lives.   My bill provides Medicare beneficiaries with complete coverage for  cancer treatments performed during routine screenings by the end of  this year.   Right now screenings are covered but treatments are not, so patients  can wake up after the procedure with a surprise medical bill upwards of  $2,000.   Colorectal cancer is one of the deadliest cancers that we have, but  it has one of the highest survival rates, if detected and treated  early.   Too many Americans put off routine cancer screenings because they  feel fine and worry about coverage. That can be a life-threatening  decision.   This issue is very personal to me. I lost my father, the honorable  and respected Congressman Donald Payne, Sr., to colorectal cancer in  2012. I don't want other families to lose their fathers and loved ones  because they did not get screened regularly.                            ____________________
