 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the PARTNERS  Act, legislation I am introducing this morning with my friend,  Representative Bonamici from Oregon.   Our bill would establish a grant program to support the creation and  expansion of innovative apprenticeships that prepare our workers for  21st century careers.   In the Third District of Georgia, the CEC in Newnan has led Georgia  by implementing an apprenticeship model, and since then, we have seen  apprenticeships continue to expand across our great State.   I, along with Ms. Bonamici, are introducing the PARTNERS Act today to  bring more programs like this to students and workers across the  Nation.   By funding this grant with already existing H1-B visa fees, which are  collected from foreign visa applicants, we are ensuring that workers  can receive immediate work-based training at no cost to the American  taxpayer.                            ____________________
