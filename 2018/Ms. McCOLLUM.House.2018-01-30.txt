 Mr. Speaker, here we are again. For 4 months, the  Federal Government has been operating under a series of short-term  continuing resolutions. And as we approach yet another deadline to fund  the government next week, the Republican majority is spending time on  the floor today voting a third time on a Defense Appropriations bill  that they know will not pass in the Senate.   The most basic, fundamental responsibility of Congress is to provide  adequate and timely funding for the entire Federal Government, both our  national defense and our domestic priorities, for a full fiscal year.  The fact that this bill is on the floor for a third time highlights the  absolute failure of the Republican majority to advance a responsible  budget process.   Mr. Speaker, voting on the same bill three times is the very  definition of playing political games. The American people deserve  better than this continuing Republican chaos.   Democrats and Republicans agree. We agree that defense spending is  vitally important, but so is funding education, transportation,  healthcare, and all the other Federal programs that all Americans and  our military--their families, included--depend upon.   If anyone doubts the harmful impacts of the endless stopgap spending  bills, perhaps they should listen to our Secretary of Defense: ``For  too long, we have asked our military to stoically carry a `success at  any cost' attitude as they work tirelessly to accomplish the mission  with now inadequate and misaligned resources, simply because the  Congress could not maintain regular order.''   If Republicans are serious about supporting our military, they should  heed the Secretary's warning and work with Democrats on a bipartisan  budget agreement to fund the entire government for the rest of the  year. I have been ready. Democrats have been ready for months to work  across the aisle to advance this process. It is long past time that  Republicans join us.
