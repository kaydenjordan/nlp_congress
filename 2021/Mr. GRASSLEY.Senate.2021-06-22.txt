 Madam President, I intend to object to any unanimous  consent request relating to the nomination of Kenneth Allen Polite to  be an Assistant Attorney General at the Department of Justice, PN423.   Last week, at the Senate Judiciary Committee's Executive Business  Meeting, I noted my intent to object to Mr. Polite's confirmation not  on the basis of his credentials--I happen to find him well qualified  for the position--but on the basis of the Justice Department's failure  to respond to congressional oversight requests.   To date, the Justice Department has failed to provide a full and  complete response to any of my oversight requests.   As one of many examples, on February 3, 2021, and March 9, 2021,  Senator Johnson and I requested information from the Justice Department  relating to Nicholas McQuaid. Mr. McQuaid is Acting Assistant Attorney  General for the Criminal Division, the position Mr. Polite will hold  upon confirmation. In those letters, we raised concerns about potential  conflicts of interest in light of the fact that Mr. McQuaid was  employed at Latham & Watkins until January 20, 2021, and worked with  Christopher Clark, whom Hunter Biden reportedly hired to work on his  Federal criminal case.   This arrangement presents a potential conflict of interest. A core  function of congressional oversight is to ensure that governmental  Departments and Agencies are free of conflicts of interest. That is  especially so with the Justice Department and FBI. If conflicts infect  them, those investigations and prosecutions--the very purpose of the  Department's existence--could be undermined.   As a part of my oversight, I have requested a recusal memo for Mr.  McQuaid. I have also requested to know, as a threshold issue, whether  one even exists.   Attorney General Garland has failed to answer and provide the  requested records. I have noted to the Department that in 2016 I  received from the Department Andrew McCabe's recusal memo to illustrate  precedent exists for such a production to Congress. Still, the Justice  Department refuses to provide the same for Mr. McQuaid.   There is nothing more eroding of public faith than an unresponsive  executive branch that believes it only answers to the President and not  the U.S. Congress and, perhaps most importantly, ``we the people.''   This administration's continued ongoing and blatant lack of  cooperation has forced my hand. Thus, unfortunately, I must object to  any consideration of this nomination. My objection is not intended to  question the credentials of Mr. Polite in any way. The executive branch  must recognize that it has an ongoing obligation to respond to  congressional inquiries in a timely and reasonable manner.                            ____________________
