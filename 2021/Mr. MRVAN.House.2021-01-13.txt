 Madam Speaker, since the events on January 6, I spoke with  a group of ministers from Gary, Indiana. They told me how they are  praying for unity and justice in our Nation.   It reminded me of the moment when those of us who were on the House  floor on January 6 were huddled together in a secure room after the  attack. House Chaplain Kibben led us all in prayer.   Let us remember that moment. Let us rekindle that prayer for those 3  minutes when we were all united to preserve our democracy and justice.   I support the Article of Impeachment so that we can move forward to  do the work that our constituents sent us here to do.
