 Mr. President, the Senate has been digging into the legal  quagmire of drug testing the unemployed. I would like to begin by  saying that no matter where a Senator comes down on the issue of drug  testing, my view is that this measure before us is simply bizarre.   If, like me, you believe that drug testing is ineffective and mean- spirited, you ought to oppose this measure because it simply vilifies  unemployed workers who are actually less likely to use drugs than the  general population.   For those Senators who support drug testing, this measure blows up  what has been a bipartisan compromise and a Labor Department rule  allowing select testing to go forward. The result of this measure  passing would actually be to block testing from going forward.   The fact is that the courts have ruled that suspicionless drug  testing violates the Fourth Amendment's protection against unreasonable  searches and seizures. That is why there is now actually a rule that is  narrow.   We have the courts expressing skepticism about this, and there is  actually a rule that is narrow so that, in effect, States that are  doing this drug testing have what amounts to guardrails to avoid  running afoul of the Constitution. If you pass this measure, you will  throw out the guardrails, opening up, in my view, the possibility of  yet more litigation on Fourth Amendment grounds.   Now, as I touched on in my opening comments, there isn't evidence  that unemployment insurance recipients use drugs any more frequently  than the general population. In fact, studies actually indicate that  they are less likely to use illegal drugs than the general population.  So this idea that somehow there is a presumption of irresponsible  conduct and guilt is just baseless.   To be eligible for unemployment insurance, workers have to have  substantial recent work experience. They have to be unemployed through  no fault of their own. Workers can only collect unemployment benefits  if they are actively searching for work and available to work.   For States that have implemented drug testing policies, there is  evidence that the costs dwarf the potential savings. The costs of  operating drug testing programs are charged to State health and human  services accounts, and I think we all understand that those have been  squeezed mightily by the effort to treat opioid addiction. In my view,  instead of wasting money by drug testing Americans who are looking for  jobs, the States ought to be putting those very same dollars toward  [[Page S1798]]  substance abuse treatment, given the fact that opioid addiction has hit  our country like a wrecking ball.   Moreover, we have said that fighting opioid addiction ought to be a  bipartisan cause. If Republicans wanted to do everything possible to  fight addiction, they shouldn't be going forward with TrumpCare, a bill  that would be a disastrous setback when it comes to fighting opioid  addiction. The fact is that colleagues on the other side of the aisle  here in the Senate--colleagues not from my side but colleagues from the  other side--have expressed their concern about what TrumpCare means for  the fight against opioid addiction.   The hard numbers are actually out now on TrumpCare, and they show  that the majority is going into overdrive to pass a bill that strips  millions of Americans of their access to treatment for substance abuse.  Today Medicaid is strengthening our mental health network, expanding  access to substance use disorder treatment, and is at the forefront of  some promising new work to fight opioid addiction. So TrumpCare hits  the cause of treating opioid addiction in a devastating way. It slashes  the healthcare safety net, and, in my view, it would inflame the  epidemic of drug abuse deaths across the country.   At the same time, there is this partisan effort to slash funding for  addiction treatment. Republicans have dredged up an old head-scratcher  of an argument that drug testing Americans and denying them earned  benefits somehow just magically helps to overcome addiction. This is an  important point.   Just like Social Security, unemployment insurance is an earned  benefit. It is an earned benefit that ought to be there for workers who  fall on hard times.   So what the majority is pushing for in this debate looks to me like  light years away from what was discussed last year when there was  discussion before the election about helping Americans in every part of  the Nation who are struggling with opioid addiction.   You have to ask this question: What earned benefits are my colleagues  on the other side of the aisle going to crusade against next? Is the  drug testing crusade going to turn next to Social Security and Medicare  recipients as an excuse to deny seniors benefits that they have  earned--earned benefits that they worked hard for through a lifetime of  work?   I am going to wrap up by way of saying that, if this measure passes,  I think States are just going to be thrown into bedlam. The current  law, based on a compromise--a bipartisan compromise reached in 2012-- says States can drug test recipients of unemployed benefits in two  cases: first, if the unemployment insurance recipient lost their job  for drug-related reasons and, second, if the unemployment insurance  recipient is applying for a type of occupation that requires drug  testing, as defined by the rules of the Department of Labor.   Let's say, for example, that two unemployment benefits recipients are  specifically applying for jobs as schoolbus drivers or air traffic  controllers. The rule that is on the books now says that States can  drug test those individuals because they are applying for work in  occupations that require drug testing.   Now, as far as I can tell, my colleagues on the other side of the  aisle want to eliminate the rule that defined those occupations. States  would be blocked from performing any occupation-based drug testing for  unemployment recipients, and the States would just be walking into a  legal minefield if they wanted to go ahead with testing programs  anyway.   Make no mistake about it. When this passes--if it does--drug testing  policies go on hold until the Congress passes a new law, rather than  our continuing a carefully put together bipartisan compromise of just a  couple of years ago.   I have been trying to see this from my colleagues' perspective. I  have listened to the arguments from the other side. I just find this a  baffling, bizarre kind of analysis. All this measure does is create a  huge amount of new uncertainty. That doesn't strike me as a good way to  reduce bureaucracy and make government more efficient.   If the majority decides to take another crack at this issue down the  road, I can only guess at what kind of new ideas they might have that  would, again, miss the point of making sure we had a narrow, defined,  and bipartisan approach to deal with this issue.   My view is that this is an ill-conceived campaign against working  people built on a completely false premise. The premise is that if you  are looking for work, you are guilty of drug use until proven innocent.  My view is that we ought to keep trying, as I have said, on major  issues involving health and taxes and infrastructure and trade. When  you are dealing with important questions, we should work to find the  common ground. It is not about taking each other's bad ideas. It is  about taking each other's good ideas.   My view is that what was done a few years ago was a good and narrowly  tailored bipartisan idea. What the Senate may choose to do is basically  to throw that in the trash can, create bedlam, and make it impossible  for States to move because they are in a sort of legal limbo. I don't  see how that meets the test of sound policy.   This measure before us today sets back the cause of strengthening the  unemployment insurance system. It sets back the cause of advocating for  Americans struggling with addiction. I urge my colleagues to vote  against this measure when we vote here in a little bit.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Rubio). The clerk will call the roll.   The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.   Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.               Unanimous Consent Agreement--Executive Calendar    Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that,  notwithstanding rule XXII, following leader remarks on Wednesday, March  15, the Senate proceed to executive session for the consideration of  Executive Calendar No. 23, Daniel Coats to be Director of National  Intelligence; that the time until 10 a.m. be equally divided in the  usual form; and that at 10 a.m., the Senate vote on the motion to  invoke cloture.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?   Without objection, it is so ordered.   The joint resolution was ordered to a third reading and was read the  third time.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The joint resolution having been read the  third time, the question is, Shall the joint resolution pass?
