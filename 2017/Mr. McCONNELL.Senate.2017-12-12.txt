 Mr. President, yesterday the Senate advanced the  nomination of Mr. Leonard Steven Grasz to be a judge on the Eighth  Circuit Court of Appeals. Mr. Grasz has sterling credentials and strong  support from the Nebraska legal community. I proudly voted to advance  his nomination, and the Senate will confirm him soon.   Next, we will vote to advance the nomination of another well- qualified individual, Texas Supreme Court Justice Don Willett, to serve  on the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. Justice Willett respects the  rule of law and our foundational legal principles, and he will be a  strong addition to the Fifth Circuit.   His story is an inspirational one. Adopted at a young age and raised  by a widowed mother in a town of 32 people, he was the first person in  his family to graduate from high school. As our colleague Senator  Cornyn said at the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, ``Justice  Willett's life [reflects] the best of Texas, and the best of America.''   From these humble beginnings, Justice Willett has led a remarkable  career. After graduating from Duke School of Law, he clerked for Judge  Jerre Williams of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, the panel he has  now been nominated to join.   He spent a short time in private practice before entering public  service in then-Gov. George W. Bush's administration as a legal and  policy adviser. When President Bush entered the White House, Justice  Willett joined him as the Special Assistant to the President. In that  role, he helped shape the domestic legal policy of the Bush  administration, especially in the President's efforts to increase  charitable activities in neighborhoods across the Nation.   The next year, he became Deputy Assistant Attorney General in the  Justice Department's Office of Legal Policy. There, he oversaw both  civil and criminal policy initiatives, including what became the  PROTECT Act of 2003, which increased law enforcement's ability to  prevent and prosecute violent crimes against children.   Afterward, Justice Willett returned to Texas to serve as the Deputy  Attorney General for Legal Counsel. As the top legal aide to then- Attorney General Greg Abbott, he advised the office on a wide variety  of legal matters.   In 2005, he was appointed to serve as a justice on the Texas Supreme  Court. Elected to a full term in 2006 and reelected in 2012, Justice  Willett has served with distinction on the Texas high court now for  over a decade. During that time, he has ruled fairly and impartially.   Four of his former colleagues on the Texas Supreme Court wrote a  letter to the Judiciary Committee supporting Justice Willett's  nomination. They wrote, ``His demonstrated belief is that the courts  should enforce both constitutional rights and constitutional  limitations and uphold the rule of law, but not enforce a personal  agenda.''   ``On occasion,'' they continued, ``we did not agree with each other  or with  [[Page S7950]]  him on the disposition of an appeal but we respected Don's opinions and  never doubted his devotion to principle.''   In addition, the retired Texas Supreme Court justice, Wallace  Jefferson, recommended Justice Willett's nomination, writing that he  will be ``a thoughtful, hardworking, diligent, and influential member  of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.''   Justice Willett has also been recognized for his excellence by the  Texas Review of Law and Politics, which named him its Distinguished  Jurist of the Year in 2014.   I would like to commend President Trump for nominating Justice  Willett to the Fifth Circuit. Under Chairman Grassley's leadership, the  Judiciary Committee has done an excellent job processing this  nomination and many others.   By joining the Fifth Circuit, Justice Willett will use his talents to  continue to serve his State and his Nation. I look forward to advancing  his nomination, and I urge my colleagues to join me in doing so.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 274, S. 447.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session for a period of morning business, with  Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, today I wish to commemorate a  groundbreaking program in my home State, the John G. Heyburn II  Initiative for Excellence in the Federal Judiciary at the University of  Kentucky. As I will explain, the initiative, under the leadership of my  dear friend, Dr. Martha Heyburn, is both a testament to its namesake  and a powerful representation of its leader. Through its work, this  program will benefit and educate our citizens, students, and members of  the Federal judiciary.   Judge John G. Heyburn II served on the U.S. District Court for the  Western District of Kentucky for more than two decades. During his  distinguished time on the bench, John excelled as a scholar, a jurist,  and a public servant. He was a man of intellectual curiosity, which  could be seen in his work and his relationships. In addition to his  efforts in the Western District, Chief Justice William Rehnquist  appointed John to serve on the Budget Committee of the U.S. Judicial  Conference in 1994. John eventually became the committee's chairman in  1997, where he was responsible for working with Congress to set the  budget for the Federal judiciary. In 2007, Chief Justice John Roberts  appointed him to chair the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation,  a body tasked with promoting efficiency and consistency in litigation  across the Federal courts.   During his career on the Federal bench, Judge Heyburn lived out a  vision, in his words, ``to ever improve the legal system considered the  envy of the world.'' Through each of his roles, John sought to continue  the development and improvement of the Federal judiciary, understanding  that the quality of justice was inexorably tied to sound  administration.   Throughout his life, I was proud to call John my friend. Like so many  others who knew and cared for him, I was heartbroken by his passing in  April of 2015.   After John's death, his wife, Martha, was left with what she called  ``the unenviable task'' of organizing his judicial papers. She expected  to find his books, his notes, and his memos from a lengthy career on  the Federal bench. What Martha found, however, surpassed even her  grandest expectations.   For many of his most important cases, John maintained meticulous  records of his decisions. For one case in particular, Martha found a  collection of 26 drafted opinions, news clippings, source citations,  and even the biographies of the law clerks who had helped John reach  his final decision. She recalled that, during his career, John would  work tirelessly on his opinions, struggling over individual words or  sentences to ensure he got each and every word just right.   As she examined the vast quantity of research, documentation, and  papers, Martha reached a conclusion that would ultimately inspire the  establishment of the Heyburn Initiative. She knew ``this doesn't belong  in [her] basement.'' Martha recognized the historical importance of the  documents she had found. She knew that these papers should be seen by  wider audiences so future students of the law can learn from them and  understand her husband's decisions and the decision-making of the  broader Federal judiciary. Martha believed that if there were any  chance that John's work could inspire a future student, it was her  responsibility to help make that happen.   With this realization, Martha began to plan the future of the Heyburn  Initiative. By organizing the papers and making them publically  available, they would become the anchor of a national resource  dedicated to understanding the Federal judiciary and its place in our  democracy. Many of us are familiar with Presidential libraries and  congressional centers throughout the country, but this project would be  distinctive in its study of the Federal judiciary.   From an impressive career of service, John had accumulated a wealth  of materials that would be of interest to many students and judicial  researchers. However, Martha knew that, to make this new program  attractive to a broad audience, she would need more papers than just  those of her late husband.   Therefore, as is typical for a groundbreaker like Martha, she  understood the best way to accomplish her goal would be to establish an  archive with an ambitious mission. She wanted to create a repository  for the papers of every article III judge in Kentucky's history that  she could acquire. An undertaking of this size had never been attempted  before in judicial archiving in any State, but Martha knew that, if she  could pull it off, it would be an incredible resource for Kentuckians  and those who study the courts for generations to come. From the  initial planning stages through today, the Initiative has already  obtained the papers of about a dozen Federal judges from Kentucky, and  I expect that number to grow.   Next, Martha decided that, to be of greater benefit to future  generations, the documents in an archive would need to be put in their  proper context. One of the best ways to do that would be to record oral  histories from policymakers, contemporaries, and the judges themselves.  These interviews provide a personal account of the history of our  Commonwealth and our Nation. They are an incredible resource for  students and researchers now and in the future. To date, many of the  Federal judges in Kentucky have agreed to provide their own accounts  for the archive, discussing their opinions, their work, and the  judiciary.   Martha chose to gather oral histories from other members of the  Federal Government as well to show the interactions among the three  branches at any particular moment in time, but to accomplish this feat,  Martha would need resources and a staff to make her vision a reality.   She entered into an agreement with the University of Kentucky to host  this portion of the Heyburn Initiative. Martha chose John's charge,  ``to ever improve the legal system considered the envy of the world,''  to be the initiative's mission statement, and I was proud to stand with  her in Lexington in October of 2016 as she publically unveiled her  vision. The initiative became her effort to enshrine her husband's  legacy and to inspire future generations into public service.   With a permanent home and a vision for the future, the Heyburn  Initiative launched its second component. After the passing of  Associate Justice Antonin Scalia in February of 2016, Martha recognized  a new level of awareness about the importance of the Federal courts  throughout our Nation. That attention sparked her interest in  developing an approachable and programmatic feature to the Heyburn  Initiative by hosting speakers and conferences for the benefit of  students, current judges, and the public.   By hosting these events in the Commonwealth of Kentucky, Martha  sought to make our State a destination for scholars and jurists, and  she has already found great success in her efforts. In its first year,  Martha hosted Chief Justice John Roberts and Associate Justice Neil  Gorsuch at the Heyburn Initiative in Lexington. Both of these renowned  jurists presented their views on the judiciary's particular place in  our system of government.   During each of these visits, Martha ensured that the distinguished  speakers participated in both public events and in meetings with law  students. Her aim for these carefully organized interactions with some  of the most influential jurists in our country was to provide an  opportunity for inspiration and learning. She hoped that the students  would be inspired by the speakers and, in turn, the speakers might be  inspired by the students.   Martha also views Heyburn Initiative events as opportunities to  showcase  [[Page S7974]]  our home State. With a ``uniquely Kentucky'' event, she wanted the  visitors to remember more than just a judicial conference. Martha  wanted the judges and justices to remember the culture of Kentucky.  That is why, for example, when Chief Justice Roberts came to Lexington,  she organized a group to attend a University of Kentucky men's  basketball game, a coveted experience in the Commonwealth.   In the Heyburn Initiative's first year, it has already achieved much  success and has set itself on course for a bright future, and the  credit for all the achievements belongs to Martha. Her vision and  tenacity grew this program from an idea into a national resource for  students, judges, and scholars. I know that the Heyburn Initiative will  continue to be a fitting legacy for John because Martha is leading it.   After so many accomplishments in 1 year, Martha has her sights set on  further growth and success. She sees the Heyburn Initiative as an  example for other States--to develop a home for the judiciary's rich  history and an inspiration for its future. I would like to congratulate  my dear friend and her family on her many achievements, and I look  forward to seeing the great things that Martha will continue to do.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I have 9 request for committees to meet  during today's session of the Senate.
