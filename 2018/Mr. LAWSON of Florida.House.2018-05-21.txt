 Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the  Emancipation Proclamation in Florida.   On May 20, 1865, 11 days after the end of the Civil War and 2 years  after President Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, Union  General Edward M. McCook arrived in Tallahassee and read President  Lincoln's words from the steps of the Knott House.   I was there yesterday for a ceremony. It is very significant.   Slavery is one of the dark sides of American history, but it is a  part that we can never forget. It is important that it will be forever  recorded in the history books.   Today, while African Americans are free, basic humans rights are  still denied to many of them at this time. If all men are equal, then  we must maintain our commitment to treat them equally. We must continue  to move our country forward if we truly wish to be ``one Nation, under  God.''   There are major jobs that we need to create, our children need to be  more protected, their families need to be fed. The time is now to help  build a more perfect Union for all of us.                            ____________________
