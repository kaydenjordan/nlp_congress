 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 616 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows                                H. Res. 616         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 2874) to       achieve reforms to improve the financial stability of the       National Flood Insurance Program, to enhance the development       of more accurate estimates of flood risk through new       technology and better maps, to increase the role of private       markets in the management of flood insurance risks, and to       provide for alternative methods to insure against flood       peril, and for other purposes. All points of order against       consideration of the bill are waived. In lieu of the       amendment in the nature of a substitute recommended by the       Committee on Financial Services now printed in the bill, the       amendment printed in part A of the report of the Committee on       Rules accompanying this resolution, modified by the amendment       printed in part B of that report, shall be considered as       adopted. The bill, as amended, shall be considered as read.       All points of order against provisions in the bill, as       amended, are waived. The previous question shall be       considered as ordered on the bill, as amended, and on any       further amendment thereto, to final passage without       intervening motion except: (1) one hour of debate equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on Financial Services; and (2) one       motion to recommit with or without instructions.        Sec. 2.  Upon adoption of this resolution it shall be in       order to consider the conference report to accompany the bill       (H.R. 2810) to authorize appropriations for fiscal year 2018       for military activities of the Department of Defense, for       military construction, and for defense activities of the       Department of Energy, to prescribe military personnel       strengths for such fiscal year, and for other purposes. All       points of order against the conference report and against its       consideration are waived. The conference report shall be       considered as read. The previous question shall be considered       as ordered on the conference report to its adoption without       intervening motion except: (1) one hour of debate; and (2)       one motion to recommit if applicable.        Sec. 3.  The Clerk shall not transmit to the Senate a       message that the House has adopted the conference report to       accompany H.R. 2810 until notified by the Speaker or by       message from the Senate that the Senate has passed H.R. 4374       without amendment.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Slaughter),  pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During  consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose  of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks.    Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 616 provides for  consideration of H.R. 2874, the 21st Century Flood Reform Act, and the  conference report to accompany H.R. 2810, the National Defense  Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018.   H.R. 2874, the 21st Century Flood Reform Act, reauthorizes the  National Flood Insurance Program for 5 years, introduces great private  market competition, and provides additional reforms to benefit  policyholders and taxpayers.   Mr. Speaker, the Office of Management and Budget has said that the  National Flood Insurance Program, or NFIP, is not fiscally sustainable  in its current form. The 21st Century Flood Reform Act helps transition  it to a more sustainable program.   Importantly, the bill will help foster a robust product market for  flood insurance, which allows private insurers to compete, in turn,  driving down the price of policies while creating greater consumer  choice. This is a win for policyholders and taxpayers alike.   Representing Alabama's Gulf Coast, it is important to me and my  constituents that they have access to affordable flood insurance  through the National Flood Insurance Program or a private insurer.   I appreciate the inclusion of provisions in the 21st Century Flood  Reform Act to protect current policyholders while making the program  sustainable.   I also appreciate Chairman Hensarling's willingness to work with  Members whose constituents, such as mine, rely very heavily upon the  NFIP to address concerns we raised about the initial version of the  bill that passed out of committee.   All in all, this bill is a positive step toward reauthorizing our  Nation's flood insurance program, which is currently set to expire on  December 8. We must take action to ensure coastal homeowners and others  in flood-prone areas have access to affordable insurance.   Mr. Speaker, I look forward to working with my colleagues in the  Senate to get a long-term reauthorization across the finish line and  signed into law by President Trump.   House Resolution 616 also allows for consideration of the final  version of the National Defense Authorization Act that was conferenced  between the House and the Senate, reconciling the differences between  two different versions.   Mr. Speaker, before I go into the substance of the bill, I would like  to take a minute to commend the open and regular order process that has  taken place from start to finish.   As a member of both the Armed Services Committee and the Rules  Committee, I have followed this bill throughout the legislative process  and think we should all be proud of the regular order and the fact that  a wide range of members played a role in crafting the final product.   I applaud Chairman Thornberry, Ranking Member Smith, and the entire  Armed Services Committee staff for their dedication to an open process.  I also appreciate the countless hours they have poured into this  conference report.   Just as a quick reminder, we considered 275 amendments during the  House Armed Services Committee back in June, and another 210 amendments  when the NDAA was considered by the full House in July. In total, 485  amendments have been considered in the House, and, just as important,  there was a clear bipartisan split between the number of majority and  minority amendments.   The conference committee continued this bipartisan and collaborative  process under the leadership of four chairmen and ranking members. Once  again, this year's NDAA is truly a bipartisan and bicameral bill that  provides the best for our military and national security.   Mr. Speaker, this NDAA follows through on our promise to our  servicemen and -women and our constitutional duty to provide for the  common defense of the United States of America.   The FY18 NDAA conference report authorizes a 10 percent increase in  total military spending, reminiscent of the Reagan era defense buildup.  The bill authorizes $626 billion for base budget requirements, $66  billion for overseas contingency operations, and $8 billion for other  defense activities.  [[Page H9192]]  That adds up for a total national defense top line of $700 billion.   I am incredibly proud to support a top-line number high enough to  begin reversing the readiness crisis that has endangered the lives of  our servicemembers and made it harder to defend our country.   Over the past 8 years, and under sequestration, our military has  suffered. We have planes that can't fly, ships that can't sail, and  soldiers who can't deploy, all while the number of threats around the  world keep rising.   I want to acknowledge that this top-line number is significantly  higher than the Budget Control Act cap for defense. I look forward to  continued dialogue with the Appropriations Committee to raise this cap  that has crippled necessary defense spending in recent years.   Every day we operate under a continuing resolution or the BCA caps is  another day we are failing our men and women in uniform. The FY18 NDAA  fulfills the authorization side of the equation, and I am hopeful the  appropriations side will follow.   The FY18 NDAA increases the size of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Army  Guard and Reserve, Naval and Air Reserve, and Air Guard to repair and  restore readiness.   The bill also authorizes construction of 13 new Navy ships, including  three littoral combat ships, as we work to grow toward a 355-ship  fleet.    In a well-deserved benefit for our troops, the NDAA provides for a  2.4 percent pay increase for servicemembers, which is the amount our  troops are entitled to under current law.   Another small but important provision in this bill eliminates the so- called widow's tax, which requires surviving spouses of servicemembers  killed in action to forfeit the survivor benefit pension annuity. The  financial burden of this tax is something our military families should  not bear.   The bill also continues to advance Chairman Thornberry's priority of  reforming and strengthening the military's acquisition process to make  it more effective and efficient.   Importantly, the legislation takes into account the Trump  administration's $6 billion budget amendment to authorize more funding  for missile defense threats against North Korea, Navy ship repairs, and  more troops in Afghanistan.   Our men and women in uniform all over the world are on a mission to  protect and defend the freedoms we hold dear. The way I see it, our  mission in Congress is to give these brave men and women the resources  they need to succeed. The FY18 NDAA does exactly that and is another  step in a multiyear process of restoring our military strength to  further protect our national security. Ultimately, this bill is about  keeping the American people safe and secure.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support House Resolution 616 and  both of the underlying bills, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Wisconsin (Mr. Duffy), the sponsor of H.R. 2874.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from South  Carolina (Mr. Norman).     Mr. Speaker, I just would point out to the gentleman that  the Democrats have highlighted the number of amendments not made in  order during the first session of the 115th Congress; however, in the  111th Congress, their majority blocked nearly 3,000 amendments, with  roughly 2,400 of those occurring in the first session. So, far be it  from the case that Republicans have blocked an inordinate number of  amendments. We blocked far less amendments than our Democratic  colleagues did when they were in control of the House.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Wyoming (Ms.  Cheney), who is my fellow colleague on the Rules Committee and the  Armed Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman from Wyoming an  additional 30 seconds    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Louisiana (Mr. Graves).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Ross), a very happy Auburn Tigers fan.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I represent a coastal area of Alabama, and flood  insurance is extremely important to many of my constituents. It is very  important to me to fulfill my job on their behalf to make sure that we  have a Flood Insurance Program that is there for many years to come.  But we know that it is actuarially insolvent. So we have to make  changes in the program.   As the gentleman from Oregon said, change is hard and reforms are  hard.  [[Page H9197]]  But the gentleman from Florida and, before him, the gentleman from  Wisconsin, the sponsor of the bill, made very good points. The reforms  we are making in this bill for the Flood Insurance Program will allow  it to be successful for years to come and also protect the taxpayers of  America. I think we have a responsibility to do that.   The other bill under this rule, the conference report on the National  Defense Authorization Act, represents a very important inflection  point.   We are now moving to repair the damage we have done to our military  these last several years. This is a 10 percent increase for our  military so that we can help them rebuild their readiness and the  equipment they need to defend us with this ever-increasing matrix of  threats, not the least of which is North Korea. We put even more money  in this authorization to defend against a missile attack from North  Korea.   We are at the beginning of something historic here with this bill,  and that is rebuilding the United States military, much like it was  done 30-plus years ago when President Reagan was in office.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support House Resolution  616 and the underlying bills.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.
