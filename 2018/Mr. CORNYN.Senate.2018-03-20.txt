 Mr. President, this week we are discussing, among other  topics, the sad fact of sex trafficking online. The reason is because  yesterday we voted to advance a piece of legislation called SESTA, or  the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act. The purpose of this legislation  is crystal clear. We want to put an end to this abominable practice,  and we want to stop shielding or protecting those web platforms that  promote it.   I am proud to be a cosponsor of this legislation. Over the past year,  like many of my colleagues, I met with law enforcement and victims'  rights groups across the country who talk about this as a continuing  problem. I met with technology providers who want to end the practice  but want to make sure they maintain their independence from Federal  regulation writ large. I have been in regular contact with my  colleagues over at the House to make sure this bill is considered and  passed in a timely fashion. I think it is fair to characterize the  negotiations as delicate.   A small group of Senators, including our colleague John McCain, the  senior Senator from Arizona, wanted to make sure that everyone  understood what this bill does and what it does not do. What it does do  is to protect our children. It provides justice to victims, and it  makes sure that Federal laws don't protect those who profit from sex  trafficking online. What it does not do is somehow to stymie free  speech. It does not restrict web platforms from publishing  objectionable content.   For example, under the Communications Decency Act, now websites have  to screen for child pornography. That is one of the explicit exceptions  to the Communications Decency Act, which basically provides immunity to  these web platforms from liability. What we are doing is adding to that  human trafficking, and it is appropriate that we do so.   This does not discourage websites that are already taking steps to  proactively remove improper conduct and police their own networks. I  would say to those who do: Keep up the good work.   Today the internet and other forms of technology have made certain  forms of predatory behavior easier to engage in. This bill addresses  this development head-on. It would allow sex trafficking victims to  have their day in court by eliminating Federal liability protections  for technology providers who knowingly facilitate online sex  trafficking. It would allow State and local law enforcement to  investigate and prosecute providers that violate Federal sex  trafficking laws.   This bill was introduced last summer after a 2-year inquiry by the  Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which produced a report. That  report found that not only had sex trafficking run rampant in certain  online spaces but also that some websites had tried to cover it up.   Well, no longer. Last fall, the Senate Commerce Committee unanimously  approved SESTA, the bill on the floor that the House passed last month.  Now it is our turn.   Senator Portman, the junior Senator from Ohio, has been this bill's  greatest champion since its inception. I believe he was one of the  members of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which produced  the report I mentioned. He has been involved in this issue for a long  time. He has been informing us time and again of the ways in which sex  trafficking has morphed from the street corner to the smartphone.   In the committee's investigation, one website in particular came up  time and again, and the name is no stranger to the Senate or the  Congress. It is backpage, a notorious publication now online that is  responsible for three-quarters of all child trafficking reports.   It eventually became clear that even though that site was actually  helping to sell young women for sex, and even the victims and their  families were suing backpage, none of the lawsuits were successful  because of what some people are coming to believe is an outdated  immunity protection for technology providers under the Communications  Decency Act, which I mentioned a moment ago.   The original law was intended to protect free speech online, which is  important. I am a firm believer in the First Amendment, as I know we  all are, but free speech is no license to engage in criminal activity.   At last count, 67 Senators have joined our effort as cosponsors. We  are joined in support of SESTA by anti-human-trafficking advocates, law  enforcement, State attorneys general, the civil rights community,  faith-based groups, and tech companies like Facebook and Oracle.   Our colleague from Oregon has introduced two amendments, which I  strongly urge my colleagues to oppose. The first would appropriate new  money for the Attorney General to investigate and prosecute website  operators that criminally facilitate sex trafficking. The problem is  that this would violate the blue slip rule and subject the bill to a  point of order. In other words, there are constitutional issues raised  about where that sort of legislation would originate. It has to  originate in the House. It would almost certainly guarantee the demise  of this legislation. In other words, it is a poison pill. It is not  that we will not support funding to prosecute traffickers. In fact, we  will provide ample funding through the Department of Justice later this  week. It is that those funds should be appropriated through the usual  process and then handed over to State and local officials who can use  them effectively.   The second amendment that will be offered is the ``Bad Samaritan''  amendment. This would prevent websites from being held accountable for  any efforts to moderate content, even when those efforts are taken in  bad faith or obviously intended to miss their mark and instead protect  sex traffickers. In some States courts have found that websites like  backpage might be held liable when they selectively edit sex  trafficking ads to make them more difficult to be identified by law  enforcement.   The ``Bad Samaritan'' amendment could protect platforms like  backpage.com from liability for bad-faith editing practices, leaving  victims with even less of a recourse than they have today. Simply put,  it could eviscerate the steps we are taking in SESTA. I am confident  that our colleague does not intend this result, but that would be the  consequence of adopting either one of those amendments.   So I hope my colleagues will join me in voting in favor of SESTA this  week and opposing these two amendments. That is the best way we can  ensure that these websites and online platforms can be held accountable  for facilitating sex trafficking.   Mr. President, later today the Senate will be voting on a privileged  resolution that I spoke on yesterday, offered by three of our  colleagues. Simply put, it would direct the President to cut off all  U.S. support for the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen.   Now, some people may be looking at a world map to figure out where  Yemen is and what the import of this conflict may be, but suffice it to  say that this is another proxy war being conducted against the United  States and its allies by Iran, now in Yemen, just to the south of Saudi  Arabia, our ally.   So as to the motion to table, I was interested to hear my friends  from Connecticut and Vermont suggesting that the motion to table would  stop debate. Well, that is not exactly true. What it will do is to  facilitate full debate and full consideration of the merits of the  underlying resolution, starting with the Foreign Relations Committee.  It is very unusual for resolutions like this to come immediately to the  floor, where 100 Senators vote on it, because, frankly, not all of us  are as up to speed on the details of this or what the unintended impact  might be as the Foreign Relations Committee that is set up for the  purpose of examining legislation with regard to our international  relationships in matters like this.   This is an important and timely matter, as high-level Saudi officials  are in Washington this week. The Crown Prince is scheduled to meet with  President Trump today. I met with him this morning, along with other  members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.   Saudi Arabia is an important partner in our counterterrorism  operations and as a counterpoint to Iran. In Yemen, we see both  terrorist operations--that is, ISIS and al-Qaida--and Iran actively  deploying missiles and using Yemen as  [[Page S1808]]  a launching pad to shoot missiles into Saudi Arabia.   I mentioned that this support for our Saudi coalition is narrowly  circumscribed. It takes the form of intelligence sharing, military  advice, and logistical support, including air-to-air refueling. This is  part of a plan that started under the Obama administration and now has  continued under the Trump administration not to put American troops on  the ground--boots on the ground, as we frequently refer to it--but  rather to facilitate for our allies by working by, with, and through  those allies to address the threat not only to them but ultimately to  the United States and to peace in the region.   The role we play in Yemen is clearly a noncombat support role, and it  is meant to minimize civilian casualties by improving the processes and  procedures and increasing compliance with the international law of  armed conflict. In other words, we are trying to help them target the  terrorists and the Iranian-backed rebels and not innocent civilians,  something they are not able to do as well without our assistance.   Contrary to the resolution's sponsors' claims, the United States is  not engaged in hostilities in Yemen, as it has been traditionally  understood, since it is not in direct conflict with the Houthi rebels.  We are not fighting the Houthi rebels. U.S. soldiers are not fighting  the Houthi rebels directly. We are providing support.   Proponents of this legislation rightly point out that there is a  humanitarian crisis in Yemen. Unfortunately, what they sometimes leave  out is that the humanitarian crisis only started when the Iranian- backed rebels overthrew the existing government. Our military  assistance is helping the Saudis with their targeting to help prevent  civilian casualties, to restore law and order, and to create conditions  necessary to provide aid.   Let's remember, too, that it was President Obama who first  implemented the refueling and logistical support policy. This is not a  political matter. There is no real difference in the way that the Obama  administration and the Trump administration provide this support by,  with, and through our allies the Saudis and the Emiratis.   It is clear why this has been the policy of the last two  administrations. Yemen is a place of great geopolitical concern. When I  visited Bahrain recently with our colleagues--the U.S. Fifth Fleet is  housed in Bahrain--we heard concerns about a chokepoint near an area  called the Bab el Mandeb. I probably butchered that pronunciation, but  we have all heard more frequently about the Straits of Hormuz, through  which a lot of the world's commerce and oil flow.   Bab el Mandeb is off to the west of Yemen, only 18 miles at its  narrowest point, connecting the Red Sea to the Indian Ocean. That is  one of the reasons why it is so important geopolitically--because 3.8  million barrels of oil pass through it each day, many of them in route  to the Suez Canal and beyond. Bab el Mandeb shows the geopolitical  importance of Yemen in the surrounding region. When rebels attempt to  shut down shipping in this passage, the impact is global, including on  the United States, and our Nation has every right to be concerned.   I fear the resolution I mention deals with our shared concerns in the  wrong way. We all want to avoid civilian casualties. Most everyone is  aware that Yemen has been suffering from a severe humanitarian crisis  for years, including a terrible cholera outbreak. But if we were to  remove U.S. involvement and logistical support for the Saudi coalition,  the humanitarian crisis would likely get even worse.   The Department of Defense has critiqued the resolution on which we  will be voting on the grounds that it would undermine our ability to  foster long-term relationships with allies in the Gulf region. We also  benefit from increased interoperability, burden-sharing, and strong  security architectures throughout the world. In other words, the  alliances we have in the Middle East fight the common enemy of ISIS and  al-Qaida and try to contain Iran, which has been at war with the United  States since 1979 in the Iranian Revolution in one form or another. All  of these are on the table and all of these should be matters of our  concern, but they are best considered, at least initially, in the  context of the Foreign Relations Committee. They can then make a  recommendation to us, and we can have the sort of fulsome debate that  people have come to expect in the Senate, I hope, on matters of global  importance. So all of the reasons I have mentioned here suggest that  the need for our auxiliary and limited role in Yemen remains important.    Secretary Mattis, the Secretary of Defense, has said that a  withdrawal of our noncombatant support could embolden Iranian-backed  rebels in the area, enable further missile strikes on Saudi Arabia, our  ally, and threaten the shipping lanes in the Red Sea, like the one at  Bab el Mandeb. All this combined could stoke the embers of an even  greater regional conflict in the Middle East.   So I hope our colleagues will vote for a tabling of this resolution,  which does not cut off debate but just moves that debate, at least  initially, to the Foreign Relations Committee, where, under the able  leadership of Chairman Corker and Ranking Member Menendez, I have every  confidence that they will explore every nook and cranny of this issue  and come out with a reasoned and reasonable recommendation to the  Senate and the Congress on how the U.S. Government should conduct  itself.   I believe in a strong congressional role when it comes to wars and  military conflict. This has been a fight, though, that has been going  on for a long time between the executive branch and the legislative  branch. We have the ultimate tool. We can cut off money, but that is a  rather blunt instrument. I think this administration, like previous  administrations, needs to recognize that the Congress is a partner in  making these decisions, not an adversary. It is important that we each  play our respective role, and I am confident that we will play that  role responsibly, which is really what this is all about.   If the Senate takes this vote and passes this resolution, we lose the  chance for that kind of careful, deliberate, informed consideration  that starts in our standing committees. We lose the chance to have the  Senate Foreign Relations Committee issue a thoroughly researched  recommendation.   So I hope our colleagues will vote to table the resolution and not to  close off debate but to insist that this debate take place, at least  initially, where it belongs, in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee,  and that this debate then continue among all 100 Members of the Senate.  We will be better informed, we will be better prepared, and we will be  better able to prevent unintended consequences from taking a rash  action like voting for the resolution today.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a brief moment?    Mr. President, I appreciate the leadership of the  chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, and I agree with his  proposed outcome on this vote. That is not to diminish the importance  of the issues raised by the Senator from Utah and the Senator from  Vermont, but I do agree with him that it is the preferred, careful,  cautious way of dealing with competing interests in a complex world.   I just ask the Senator further to that point whether he can confirm  my understanding that actually using this unique process--is it his  understanding, as it is mine--that there would actually be a vote- arama; that is, we would end up voting on multiple different proposals,  not just this one proposal, and create perhaps some confusion and some  more chaos in what is admittedly a complex and sensitive foreign  relations and national security matter?    The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator  from Arizona (Mr. McCain).    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 2577         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.
