 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the men and  women of Naval Air Station Pensacola on being named Navy Installations  Command's Large Installation of the Year.   I am continuously in awe of the dedication and patriotism our  servicemembers and defense civilians display day-in and day-out to  ensure the defense of our great Nation and advance the cause of  liberty.   The patriots of NAS Pensacola conducted 50,000 operations in fiscal  year 2021 without mishap. An astonishing feat given the inherently  dangerous nature of military training.   The installation established the Emergency Family Assistance Center  to provide relief and aid in the recovery, shelter, and assistance of  267 Hurricane Sally victims. We ask our servicemembers and their  families to sacrifice so much, and the ability to decompress and enjoy  leisure time with family and friends is critical to their well-being  and readiness. To that end, NAS Pensacola's morale, welfare, and  recreation department received a five-star rating and was ranked number  one among large bases.    Mr. Speaker, it is my distinct privilege to serve Florida's First  Congressional District and to represent the brave men and women of NAS  Pensacola. The best is yet to come.                            ____________________
