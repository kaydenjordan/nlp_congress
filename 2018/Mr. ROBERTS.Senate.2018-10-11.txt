 Mr. President, I come to the floor today to recognize  and congratulate Mr. Barry Carpenter, a longtime advocate for American  agriculture, on his retirement from a career that spanned five decades.  Last month, Barry retired his position as president and CEO of the  North American Meat Institute, the Nation's largest and oldest trade  association representing U.S. meat packers and processors. Barry's  retirement concludes a career in both public service and private  industry. His knowledge of the industry and his collaborative, affable  disposition have allowed him to connect with everyone from CEOs to  those just beginning their careers.   Barry's appreciation for U.S. agriculture, his drive to serve, and  his work ethic were developed at an early age, working on his family's  diversified farm in central Florida that produced cattle, hogs, corn,  peanuts, and melons. After graduating from the University of Florida,  Barry began his career as a meat grader with the U.S. Department of  Agriculture. He also enlisted in the U.S. Army, earning the rank  specialist fifth class. Barry carried with him the sense of duty and  discipline learned in these formative years in each role he held.   Over the course of his 37-year career at USDA, Barry provided  reasoned and steady guidance to Secretaries of both parties in multiple  administrations. In his senior role at the Agricultural Marketing  Service, Barry led programs critical to reestablishing U.S. beef export  access following the first U.S. case of BSE in 2003. Barry further  oversaw USDA's adoption of video technology used to assign beef quality  grades, an important tool in identifying those high-quality prime  steaks consumers around the world enjoy.   Upon retiring from USDA, Barry continued to serve American  agriculture when he was named CEO of the National Meat Association in  2007. Barry has since provided steadfast leadership to the meat and  poultry industry as CEO of the North American Meat Association and as  president and CEO of the North American Meat Institute, following the  completion of the merger, which he successfully guided, between the  American Meat Institute and the North American Meat Association in  January 2015.   Barry has earned numerous governmental awards, including Presidential  Rank Awards, honors bestowed to less than 1 percent of senior career  employees throughout the Federal Government, from Presidents Bill  Clinton and George W. Bush. He has also received  [[Page S6811]]  recognition from the livestock and meat industries.   Throughout his career, Barry remained grounded and inspired by his  wife Janet, four children, Mary Catherine, Jane, Michael, and Robert,  and 11 grandchildren.   I feel fortunate to have known many distinguished public servants and  industry leaders like Barry, who have dedicated their careers to  advocating for U.S. agriculture. I thank Barry for his many  contributions to American agriculture, and I congratulate him on a  well-deserved retirement.                            ____________________
