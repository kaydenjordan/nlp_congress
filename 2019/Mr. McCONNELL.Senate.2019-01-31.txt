 Madam President, earlier this week, Senate Democrats  stopped filibustering the important legislation before us. They finally  joined Republicans and voted to advance these measures to renew our  commitment to Israel, deepen our cooperation with Jordan, and deliver  justice for the victims of Assad's brutality in Syria.   But it appears some of my Democratic colleagues are not finished with  their obstruction just yet.   On Tuesday, I offered a straightforward amendment to allow for a  straightforward debate about the Senate's continued commitment to  ongoing missions in Syria and Afghanistan. It is not a partisan  amendment. It is not complicated. There is no poison pill--just an  opportunity for Senators to go on the record about what our country  should be doing in Syria and Afghanistan.   I have been clear about my own views on these subjects. I believe the  threats remain. ISIS and al-Qaida have yet to be defeated, and American  national security interests require continued commitment to our  missions there.   But I guess some Senate Democrats don't want to vote on these  important subjects. Perhaps it could have put some of my colleagues  with aims beyond the Senate at odds with parts of the far left.  Whatever the reason, our colleagues tried to avoid taking a position  and tried to block my amendment from getting a vote.   Make no mistake. Today, the Senate will vote on this amendment.  Members will go on the record for our allies and our partners in the  Middle East.   When Senator Rubio introduced S. 1, which is just a collection of  bipartisan bills, I hoped for an open amendment process so that the  Senate could debate important matters of national security. I am  disappointed that our friends on the other side of the aisle have  chosen to make that impossible.   Another issue I had hoped we could address is America's ironclad  commitment to the transatlantic alliance. NATO has a proud history of  delivering greater security to America and our allies and greater peace  to the world. We stood shoulder to shoulder with our NATO allies  throughout the Cold War; they stood with us following 9/11. NATO's  mission in Afghanistan today is an essential element of bringing peace  and stability to that troubled country.   NATO will continue to be critical to transatlantic security, but it  must adapt to new challenges. The United States has made significant  new investments in our security posture in Europe, most notably through  troop deployments all along the eastern flank and through the European  Deterrence Initiative, which has bipartisan support here in Congress.   Former Secretary Mattis was also instrumental in pushing NATO to  reform, especially in the areas of capabilities modernization,  readiness, and military mobility. These reforms are essential to  ensuring NATO readiness.   President Trump has also reaffirmed our Nation's commitment to NATO.  As recently as just a few days ago, he said the United States will ``be  with NATO 100 percent.''   The President is right to call upon our allies to contribute their  fair share toward our collective defense. As NATO's Secretary General  recently explained, President Trump has ``clearly stated that NATO  allies need to invest more. . . . we agreed to do more . . . and now we  see the results. . . . by the end of next year, NATO allies will add .  . . 100 billion extra U.S. dollars [for] defense.''   Here is how the Secretary General summed it up: ``So we see some real  money, and some real results, and we see that the clear message from  President Trump is having an impact.''   We need to build on this momentum and continue strengthening NATO,  dispelling all doubt--all doubt--about America's commitment to this  alliance, which has reshaped history for the better.   NATO deserves the Senate's support. I believe it has the Senate's  support, and at some point I hope this institution is able to debate  that matter  [[Page S776]]                                ____________________     Madam President, on a totally different matter,  earlier this week I began discussing H.R. 1. This is the House  Democrats' marquee bill for the new Congress.   I have stated this week that it really adds up to one big expensive  partisan power grab, an effort to centralize more control over  America's speech and America's voting here in Washington--the  ``Democratic Politician Protection Act.'' I am pleased that people are  beginning to pay attention to this monstrosity--a monstrosity.   Today I want to focus on how the power grab would affect our  elections because when Washington politicians suddenly decide their top  priority is grabbing unprecedented control over how they get elected  and sent to Washington in the first place, alarm bells should start  ringing all over this place.   After all, article I, section IV of the Constitution clearly gives-- clearly gives--State legislatures primary responsibility for ``the  Times, Places, and Manner of holding Elections for Senators and  Representatives.''   There are times in American history when it has come to that. There  have been times when our Nation has needed the Federal Government to  get involved to expand and protect the franchise or to respond to a  national emergency, for examples, bills like the Voting Rights Act,  which secured the franchise for African Americans, or the Help America  Vote Act, which provided guideposts--guideposts--to prevent a crisis  like the Bush v. Gore recount from occurring a second time.   So what is the alleged crisis now? What is the alleged crisis now, in  2019, that has House Democrats calling for an unprecedented Federal  takeover of elections across our country? Why is this Democratic bill-- which would create more Federal Government mandates over the minutia of  the election process than has ever been done in the past--necessary  now?   The year 2016 saw the most ballots ever cast in a Presidential  election in American history. Now, with population growth, that isn't  entirely surprising, but the turnout rate was the third highest since  1968. So people are voting in great numbers.   Let's look at the 2018 midterms--the highest midterm turnout in 50  years. People voted in the midterms.   Listen to what Americans themselves had to say about their  experience. After the election, 92 percent--92 percent--of surveyed  voters told the Pew Research Center their voting experience was ``very  easy'' or ``somewhat easy''--92 percent--very easy or somewhat easy to  vote. Regardless of when they voted and how they voted, huge majorities  communicated that they had no real trouble--no real trouble--casting  their ballots. No trouble.   My Democratic friends seem to be implying there is a supposed crisis  here that conveniently is not rooted in the facts or in the opinions of  American voters.   There is no objective basis for the sweeping Federal takeover of  elections that House Democrats have dreamed up. There is no emergency.  It is just a Washington power grab for its very own sake.   Decision after decision that our Constitution properly leaves to the  States just melts away in this proposal. Practically every variable of  any consequence to American elections gets a top-down mandate written  by whom? Why, the Democrats, of course.   Could States require a signature to vote under the Democrats' bill?  Only if they accept a computerized mark, making that signature  requirement about as serious as clicking one checkbox on a website.   What if States and localities want to make sure that ineligible  voters under the age of 18 don't end up on the voter rolls or decide  whether or how convicted felons have their voting rights restored?  Well, under the ``Democratic Politician Protection Act,'' States have  no choice in the matter.   How many early days of voting should there be? Do polls need to be  open on Sundays? What is the best way to make absentee ballots  available? When can early voting take place, and how long and where  should the polling places be located?   Different States and communities have come to different legitimate  judgments on all of these questions. It is a core part of our  constitutional system, and the decentralization of our election process  leads to a more democratic system with more direct impact on the  elections of those decision makers.   The United States of America has never been about centralizing all  power in Washington, and Washington should not get to micromanage the  processes that determine who comes to Washington.   But, alas, House Democrats don't seem to care if their partisan power  grab upsets this constitutional balance. These Representatives even-- get this--want the Federal Government to dictate to States how their  very own congressional districts will be drawn. They want the Federal  Government to tell the States how to draw their congressional  districts.   Right now, there is a competition of ideas among the States about the  best way to handle this. Different places arrive at different answers.   Naturally, House Democrats have a different idea. They want to force  every State to use a commission that is designed by them--by Washington  Democrats. Every State will have to use a commission designed by  Washington Democrats whose structure and procedures are prescribed, of  course, by Washington Democrats. If a State doesn't know how to bow to  their will, then the DC Federal court will make the decisions that have  been reserved for the State legislatures going back to our Nation's  founding.   I know it is not fashionable on the far left to praise the wisdom of  our constitutional structure. It seems to be out of fashion. I am sure  that in some corners I will be derided for referencing the Constitution  at all. They will say: How could it still be relevant after all these  years?   Of course, this thinking shows exactly why our founding principles  are so important.   Our Constitution is there to protect our liberties and protect our  form of government from the whim of whoever happens to be currently in  power. These guardrails exist to stop things like a narrow partisan  majority in the House of Representatives grabbing control of election  laws just to benefit themselves politically. We need to stand with  Alexander Hamilton and our Constitution, not with the House Democrats'  partisan power grab.                            ____________________     Madam President, I send a cloture motion to the desk  for S. 1.
