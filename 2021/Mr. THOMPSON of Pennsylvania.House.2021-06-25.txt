 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  June as Alzheimer's and Brain Awareness Month.   With more than 6 million Americans living with Alzheimer's and nearly  50 million people living with Alzheimer's and other dementias  worldwide, it is important to raise awareness. The more we know about  Alzheimer's, the more action we can inspire.   Alzheimer's is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States,  and it is the only one of the top ten causes of death without any  methods for preventing, curing, or slowing it down. Alzheimer's related  deaths increased by 16 percent during the COVID-19 pandemic.   The diagnosis of Alzheimer's is not only devastating to those who are  diagnosed, but also to their caregivers and loved ones. My own mom  lived with Alzheimer's for 10 years. It stole her memories and finally  stole her life.   In 2021, Alzheimer's care will cost our Nation $355 billion, and by  2050, costs are expected to rise to more than $1.1 trillion.   Currently, over 11 million Americans provide unpaid care to family  and friends living with Alzheimer's and other dementias.   Mr. Speaker, the time to act is now. Let's join the fight. Let's take  the pledge to raise awareness about Alzheimer's disease and to never  stop searching for a cure.                            ____________________
