 Madam President, I rise again to read letters from West  Virginians about the concerns and fears they have over the ongoing  lawsuit being led by 20 U.S. attorneys general, including West  Virginia's own attorney general, that threatens to once again allow  insurance companies to deny coverage to West Virginians with  preexisting conditions.   In my State, 800,000 West Virginians, including 90,600 children, have  a preexisting condition. Let me go over some of the things that qualify  as a preexisting condition and insurance companies can rate you on:  organ transplant, anxiety, cancer, heart disease, Alzheimer's disease,  Crohn's disease, Parkinson's disease, cystic fibrosis, pneumonia,  epilepsy, anemia, depression, lupus, obsessive compulsive disorder,  pregnancy, anorexia, diabetes, kidney disease, sleep apnea, obesity,  bipolar disease, multiple sclerosis, cerebral palsy, stroke, bulimia,  asthma, and tuberculosis.   I have always said that our Nation's current healthcare system is in  need of repair, but every West Virginian deserves access to quality,  affordable healthcare, and I am very concerned that our country is at  risk of moving backward instead of forward.   When people ask why I voted against repealing the healthcare law, I  always say that it is because we need to make sure that those with  preexisting conditions don't go bankrupt paying for basic healthcare.   What is happening today is an unfortunate political move. The only  reason this lawsuit is moving forward is because they have failed to  repeal the law through this process here in the Senate. Congress has  voted more than 50 times to repeal, and it has not passed. So what you  are telling us loud and clear is to fix it, repair it. It can be fixed  and made better for everybody.   What makes this worse is that we do have this bipartisan compromise  led by Senator Lamar Alexander, a Republican from Tennessee, and  Senator Patty Murray, a Democrat from the State of Washington, with 12  Republicans and 12 Democrats. I am proud to say that I am one them.   This bill includes important steps that will help to reduce  healthcare costs for West Virginia families, and this agreement shows  what is possible when we put people before politics. Shame on us for  not voting on that.   This is impacting real people. Last week I asked West Virginians to  share their stories with me, and my office has been flooded with  stories. I am going to share just a few of these stories with you  today.   This is Whitney from Morgantown, WV:         Dear Senator Manchin,        Please protect our pre-existing conditions.        In August 2016, my then 15 year old child suffered a stroke       as a result of a brain AVM. He had to have emergency brain       surgery which left him in a medically induced coma for       several months.        When he woke up, he was unable to walk or talk. He had to       have continuous medical care including expensive MRI's and       angiograms.        This doesn't include his multiple therapies. If we did not       have insurance coverage I do not know what we would do.        I cannot afford all these medical bills without the help of       insurance. Due to the extensive medical needs I know if his       pre-existing condition is not protected he will eventually       lose benefits.        I beg you to stand up for my child and all those who       deserve a right to ongoing medical care. Please feel free to       contact [me] with any questions or follow up [concerning our       needs].    This is William from Martinsburg, WV:         Dear Senator Manchin,        It was imperative that insurance companies are not allowed       to screen members for pre-existing conditions.        I am a 20+year Type 2 Diabetic. I am currently taking five       medications for my diabetes. If I did not have coverage I       would be paying over $1000 a month, OUT OF POCKET, for just       my diabetes meds.        If insurance companies are allowed to start screening for       and disallowing pre-existing conditions I would not be able       to afford my medications and my diabetes would not be       controlled which could possibly lead to loss of limbs, loss       of vision and I could die.        How much would I cost the government if I was disabled? How       much would I cost an insurance company then if I had to have       feet, arms, and legs amputated because of my condition?        Bottom line, I cost my insurance company a lot less money       when they help me to keep my diabetes under control.        Thank you for taking a stand for those of us with pre-      existing conditions.    The final letter is from Kevin from Hinton:         Dear Senator Manchin,        I have lived with Crohn's Disease, a severe chronic illness       of the immune system that attacks the digestive system. The       condition is painful and treatments are expensive.        Like many West Virginians, I have dealt with insurance gaps       and few jobs with good pay and benefits.        Though many Americans struggle with the expenses of       healthcare, we remember the unfair practices before ACA [the       Affordable Care Act] was passed and improved the healthcare       system by ridding us of pre-existing conditions clauses,       which allowed insurance companies to overcharge sick people       for care or block them completely from getting coverage.        Please work for us to make sure that the steps taken in the       ACA are improved upon instead of allowing such beneficial       measures to be cut.    Those are just a few of the letters I have received, and I know we  all have these preexisting conditions with people that are scared to  death all over our country.   I hope that we can come together for the sake of America and maybe  get off of this political roller coaster where we are blaming everybody  and trying to find out who we can blame, especially when we can fix it.   What I am asking for is for all of us to work together as Americans,  to forget whether you are a Democrat or a Republican, and to just help  the people you represent.   These diseases don't have a home. They are not just because of a  Democrat or a Republican. That is who they attack. They attack all of  us.   So this needs, basically, the help and the cure from all of us also.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
