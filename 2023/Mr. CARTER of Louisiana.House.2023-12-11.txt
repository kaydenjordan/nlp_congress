 Mr. Speaker, let me say a huge thank-you to  Representative Ivey for yielding and particular appreciation and thanks  to Congressman D'Esposito, the chairman of the subcommittee.   I am pleased that we are here today to consider Representative  D'Esposito's bill, H.R. 3224, the Countering Weapons of Mass  Destruction Extension Act of 2023, of which I am a proud original  cosponsor.                                time  1545    The Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction, CWMD, office within the  Department of Homeland Security was established to elevate and  consolidate the Department's effort to protect our Nation from  chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear threats.   CWMD supports Federal, State, and local law enforcement and first  responders to defend against CBRN attacks and accomplishes this through  programs such as the Securing the Cities program, STC, which holds  significant importance for the residents of my home of New Orleans.   The Securing the Cities program bolsters our cities' capacity to  identify and thwart potential terrorist threats, particularly during  major events like Mardi Gras, Sugar Bowl, Super Bowl, and so many other  events that are home to the State of Louisiana.   Another critical program deployed by CWMD is the National  Biosurveillance Integration Center, NBIC. NBIC plays a pivotal role in  early detection, rapid response, and coordinated efforts by identifying  and tracking biological events and distributing its products to  Federal, State, and local, congressional, and private sector partners.  NBIC's coordination helps ensure a more effective and unified response  to mitigate the impact of biological threats.   CWMD's expertise is instrumental in formulating and implementing  strategies, coordinating intelligence efforts, and providing essential  resources to fortify the Nation's CBRN capabilities.   Recognizing the pivotal role of this office, I am pleased that we  could unite on a bipartisan basis to bring H.R. 3224, the Countering  Weapons of Mass Destruction Extension Act of 2023, to the floor today.    This bipartisan legislation extends CWMD's  authorization for 2 years and mandates a Congressional report on the  office's plans to enhance morale--an ongoing concern. The bill also  requires the Government Accountability Office to brief Congress  regarding the CWMD and how it is carrying out its mission.   CWMD is a critical asset, ensuring a safer and more secure nation for  present and future generations. Continued support for this office is  paramount, therefore, Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in  supporting H.R. 3224.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Jackson for  the great work that he continues to do. I thank him for his illustrious  words and for the opportunity to participate in the CBC Special Order.   2023 has been an exciting and action-packed year. It has been an  honor to serve as the second vice chairman of the Congressional Black  Caucus under the leadership of my dear friend Congressman   Steven  Horsford, Democrat from Nevada.   As a member of the Regional Leadership Council for Region 7 and on  the House Homeland Security and Transportation Infrastructure  Committees, this session has been yet another one that we continue to  work.   I am proud that, despite the pushback from our friends on the other  side almost at every opportunity, we have accomplished historic  investments for the American people. I would like to highlight just a  few of them that we challenged all year long.   Environmental justice must be at the center of any action to address  disproportionate health and environmental impacts on communities,  especially communities of color. This year I hosted multiple EPA  executives, including the EPA Administrator, Michael Regan, and the  Secretary of Department of Energy, Jennifer  [[Page H6809]]  Granholm, and other leaders from my district.   Louisiana was also selected to establish new Environmental Justice  Thriving Communities Technical Assistance grants, creating the first  ever in Louisiana Thriving Communities Technical Assistance Center that  will give communities an opportunity to have technical access to  attract and have access to real resources to defend communities against  environmental injustice. That is a success. The first that we have had  in a long time at this level.   This will provide resource to help communities and nonprofits  navigate the complex Federal grant process. Additionally, in Louisiana,  we know better than anyone that storms are coming stronger, staying  longer, coming faster, and leaving more havoc in their path, having  greater impact than ever before.   Adequate funding is essential to enhance the resilience of our roads,  bridges, and levies, ensuring they can withstand and recover from  future natural disasters. By investing in robust infrastructure, we not  only protect people's lives and property, but also bolster the overall  economic sustainability of our region. Strengthening our infrastructure  is a proactive measure that reduces long-term costs associated with  disaster recovery, ultimately fostering a safer and more sustainable  future for all Americans.   We have continued to see promises kept as funding from the Bipartisan  Infrastructure Law makes its way to the communities around the country.   I am committed to advocating for the vital funding to fortify our  infrastructure, recognizing its pivotal role in safeguarding our  communities against ever-present threats of natural disasters.   Just as important as protecting our Earth is the health of our minds  and bodies of that of our citizens. Regardless of age, location,  education, and economic standing, racism is the biggest barrier to  mental health for the Black community.   This year, I convened multiple forums where I brought together  visionaries, activists, and leaders who are shaping the future of this  field in the Black community. These events focus on themes, including  reduction in the isolation that our children saw during and after  COVID, improving campus safety, and increasing access to healthcare  providers. I am committed to fighting for greater representation in  industry in the mental health area where we are significantly  underrepresented with providers of this level of care.   Our veterans give so much to us, we owe it to them to make sure that  we do all that we can to help them live healthy, productive, and  meaningful lives during and, most importantly, after they come home.  Far too many of our veterans come home to find themselves homeless,  without a job, without resources, without someone to care after they  have provided for us the greatest contribution, protecting our flanks.  The freedom that we enjoy isn't free. It is paid by our veterans who  put their lives on the line and sacrificed their family time. They  should get the best services when they are away and when they come  home.   This year, I hosted multiple VA curbside events across LA-02 to bring  Federal resources to the front doors of our veterans and our citizens.  That includes specific help for veterans like signing up for disability  pay and receiving VA benefits, assisting with FEMA case work, and  getting assistance with tax refunds.    This is only a small snapshot of the work House Democrats have done  this year in fighting for all Americans. I will continue to put people  over politics and work tirelessly for Louisianans to empower them with  the necessary resources to not just survive, but to thrive.   Mr. Speaker, I wish everyone a merry Christmas, happy holidays, happy  Hanukkah, happy Kwanzaa, and a blessed New Year.
