 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous materials.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself as much time as I may consume.   Today we are considering H.R. 953, the Reducing Regulatory Burdens  Act of 2017, introduced to clarify congressional intent regarding  pesticide use in or near navigable waters.   The Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, otherwise  known as FIFRA, is the appropriate Federal statute to govern safety and  the use of pesticides.   FIFRA first passed in 1910, 62 years before the Clean Water Act was  passed. In 2009, the Sixth Circuit Court decision, the National Cotton  Council v. EPA, changed how this all works. For years before the Clean  Water Act, pesticide use was regulated by the EPA under FIFRA. Under  FIFRA, the EPA regulates and approves pesticides for safe use under the  label, and they have full jurisdiction under FIFRA.   The EPA previously ruled that using pesticides under FIFRA-approved  use does not require a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System,  otherwise known as NPDES, permit under the Clean Water Act.   Because of this court decision in 2009, those who have been safely  applying products to control pest populations now must comply with  additional NPDES permitting.   Some of my colleagues across the aisle have called this Groundhog Day  in the past. I agree. Time after time, they have supported increasing  the regulations just for regulation's sake. They are even willing to  risk public health and outbreaks of Zika and West Nile virus.   The Sixth Circuit Court decision ignored the congressional intent  when the FIFRA and the Clean Water Act were passed. The court ignored  sensible agency interpretation, it ignored years of regulatory  precedent, it expanded the clean water jurisdiction beyond the scope  set by Congress and over areas already appropriately regulated. The  court decision placed burden on the  [[Page H4536]]  EPA, requiring a new and expanded NPDES permitting process for products  already regulated.   The EPA says there are about 365,000 pesticide applicators affected  by this ruling. They would include State agencies, cities and counties,  mosquito control districts, water districts, pesticide applicators,  farmers and ranchers, forest managers, scientists, and even everyday  citizens or homeowners.   The EPA estimates $50 million in paperwork to comply alone every year  with this new regulation. Federal, State, and local agencies are forced  to spend taxpayer dollars in permitting, paperwork, and compliance.  Private applicators, like farmers and ranchers, also face increased  costs. This adds compliance costs, adds permitting costs, and it adds  time and hurts productivity and efficiency. It does not add any new  environmental protections.   This bad court decision affecting the budgetary decisions from local  agencies, I will give you some examples here: the Benton County,  Washington, Mosquito Control District preserves 20 percent of its  annual budget in case it is sued under the Clean Water Act. I think it  is important to mention when the Clean Water Act was passed in 1972, it  was set up with severe penalties to go after the polluters we had--I  like to say the polluters of the 1960s--to clean up our waters, that we  had severe problems. And when it did that, it also opened it up for  citizens' lawsuits and opens up the door for more litigation.   The Benton County, Washington, Mosquito Control District, $37,000 in  permit costs and paperwork they have spent. Benton County could have  treated almost 2,600 acres for mosquito abatement or 400 lab tests for  West Nile virus, or paid for three seasonal workers.   In Gem County, Idaho, the Mosquito Abatement District's staff spends  3 weeks a year tabulating and documenting seasonal pesticide  applications related to permit oversight.   California vector control districts have estimated that it costs them  $3 million to conduct administration of the NPDES permits. They also  have to spend 20 percent of their annual operating budget just to  maintain the computer software related to the unnecessary NPDES permit.   As a result of this court ruling, mosquito districts, State and local  agencies, are now vulnerable to frivolous lawsuits for things like  simple paperwork violations under the Clean Water Act. Fines for these  paperwork violations, which obviously don't have any affect on the  environment, can be as much as $50,000 a day.   For example, the Gem County, Idaho, Mosquito Abatement District was  forced to spend $450,000 to resolve a lawsuit.   In my home State of Ohio, the Mosquito Control District for Toledo is  currently embroiled in a citizen's lawsuit from a simple paperwork  violation.   The 2012 West Nile outbreak is proof NPDES permits and association  costs are hindering the ability to protect the public.   In 2012, the first year of the permitting requirement from the court  case, West Nile cases jumped from 712 cases to almost to over 5,600  cases. That is nearly an 800 percent increase because of the  unnecessary permit requirements.   The States and communities affected by West Nile had to wait until  after a public health emergency was declared. Only then could relief  from the NPDES permit be approved. Only after the West Nile had spread  could local agencies use lifesaving pesticides to kill mosquitoes  carrying the virus. Keep in mind, when the local entity, municipality,  declares an emergency, they don't need to get a permit. They can spray.  I like to say it is after the fact when the mosquitoes are out of  control, then we do aerial spraying. Maybe we could have prevented it  with surface spraying and be less harm to the environment. We shouldn't  have to wait until it becomes an emergency.   H.R. 953 gets rid of the unnecessary red tape so communities can  prevent outbreaks of diseases like Zika and West Nile.   Cities that need to conduct the routine preventative mosquito  abatement should not have to do it with one hand tied behind their  back. H.R. 953 provides a narrow, limited exception from NPDES permit  requirements for those pesticides already approved under FIFRA law and  used in compliance under the label which is approved by the EPA.   I think this is an important point to keep in mind: EPA already  regulates these pesticides and approves them under FIFRA. It goes  through rigorous testing and reporting requirements, and they set the  label and make the determination. They approve how it is going to be  used. If it is a restricted pesticide, they can also put more  restrictions on the applicators and who the applicators are.   Therefore, removing this redundant NPDES permit is appropriate  because the EPA already has full control and can handle the situation  like they did for over 60 years before this court case.   The EPA has assisted in drafting H.R. 953, which does not roll back  any environmental protections. It fixes the regulatory problem caused  by the Sixth Circuit Court's decision and maintains the EPA's  jurisdiction through FIFRA.   Similar legislation has passed the House every Congress since the  court's decision, and I look forward to passing it again today, and  then passing it in the Senate and have the President sign it into law.   A list of organizations--this is a snapshot of the many organizations  because I don't have enough time to list all the organizations, but the  American Mosquito Control Association supports it; the American Farm  Bureau Federation; the National Farmers Union; the National Association  of State Departments of Agriculture; the National Association of Wheat  Growers; National Corn Growers Association; and United Fresh Produce  Association. Those are just a few groups representing thousands of  Americans who depend on commonsense EPA regulations for their  livelihood.   Mr. Chair, I include in the Record--and I want to talk about it here  for a minute--I have a letter from former Secretary of Agriculture  Vilsack. In 2009, he was Secretary of Agriculture in the Obama  administration. When this court case happened, he sent out a letter to  Lisa Jackson, the Administrator of the United States Environmental  Protection Agency. In his letter, he urges the EPA to consider the  significant adverse effect of the Sixth Circuit Court's 2009 decision,  the National Cotton Council and EPA will have on American farmers and  USDA agencies. He said in the letter:   ``By broadening the Act's reach, the court burdens American  agriculture with a newly minted NPDES permit requirement. . . .''   ``The Sixth Circuit's decision encumbers the American farmers' and  the agencies' ability to do business, while reaping little or no  environmental benefit in exchange.''   I want to repeat that. The Secretary of Agriculture in the Obama  administration said that this court case has little environmental  benefit, and it hampers American farmers to do their job to produce the  most wholesome, safe, affordable food in the world.   ``Subjecting FIFRA-compliant pesticides to the additional regulatory  regime''--he goes on to say--``of the CWA is duplicative and will not  help protect the environment.''   Mr. Chair, I include in the Record this letter, dated March 6, 2009,  from Secretary of Agriculture Vilsack and his opposition to the court  case and, in his opinion, what this bill does.                                          Department of Agriculture,                                         Office of the Secretary,                                      Washington, DC, March 6, 2009.      Hon. Lisa P. Jackson,      Administrator, U.S. Environment Protection Agency,      Washington, DC.      Subject: The National Cotton Council of America, et al., v.           United States Environmental Protection Agency, Nos. 06-          4630; 07-3180/3181/3182/3183/3184/3185/3186/3187/3191/          3236 (6th Cir. Jan. 7, 2009).         Dear Ms. Jackson: The United States Court of Appeals for       the Sixth Circuit recently invalidated the Environmental       Protection Agency's (EPA's) Final Rule entitled,       ``Application of Pesticides to Waters of the United States in       Compliance With FIFRA.'' 71 Fed. Reg. 68,483 (Nov. 27, 2006)       (Final Rule). A petition for rehearing or for rehearing en       bane before the Sixth Circuit is due on April 9, 2009. I       would very much appreciate your taking into consideration the       significant adverse effect that the court's decision will       have on American farmers, as well as on U.S. Department of       Agriculture (USDA) agencies, and therefore request that you       seek further review of this decision by the Sixth Circuit.  [[Page H4537]]         In its Final Rule, the EPA reasonably interpreted the term       ``pollutant'' in the Clean Water Act (CWA) as generally       excluding pesticides that are applied in compliance with the       relevant requirements of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide,       and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA). The Final Rule established that       the application of pesticides in compliance with FIFRA would       not require a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System       (NPDES) permit when they are applied directly into waters of       the United States in order to control pests, or when they are       applied to control pests that are present over waters of the       United States, including near those waters, when a portion of       the pesticides unavoidably will be deposited into the water       in order to target the pests effectively. The EPA       specifically concluded that the terms ``chemical wastes'' and       ``biological materials'' in the CWA's definition of       pollutants do not encompass the types of pesticide       applications addressed in the Final Rule. 71 Fed. Reg.       68,486.        The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit concluded that       the Final Rule was contrary to the plain language of the CWA.       Although the court agreed with the EPA that chemical       pesticides applied directly to water to perform a useful       purpose are not chemical wastes, it held that excess       pesticides and pesticide residue meet the common definition       of waste, and therefore are pollutants under the CWA. The       court held that the EPA is required to regulate the residue       of chemical pesticides when the pesticide is applied to land       or air, and the residue finds its way into the navigable       waters of the. United States, and when the pesticide is       applied directly to the water and the residue has a lasting       effect beyond its intended purpose. The court also found that       Congress intended for ``biological materials'' to encompass       more than ``biological wastes.'' The court held that all       biological pesticides are biological materials, and therefore       pollutants under the CWA.        The court's adverse decision will have profound       implications for American farmers. The panel's ruling       effectively broadens the potential application of the CWA to       reach agricultural activities that the EPA has never       regulated under the provisions of the CWA. By broadening the       Act's reach, the court burdens American agriculture with a       newly minted NPDES permit requirement for the application of       all FIFRA-compliant biological pesticides whenever those       pesticides might find their way into waters of the United       States, and for all FIFRA-compliant chemical pesticides       whenever the residues of those pesticides find their way into       waters of the United States. The permit requirement could       reach almost any pesticide application, requiring farmers to       navigate a permitting system that is ill-suited to the       demands of agricultural production. Failure to obtain a       timely permit for pesticide application could cripple       American farmers' emergency pest management efforts and       hamper their ability to respond quickly to new pest       infestations or threats of infestations, thus increasing the       risk of crop losses.        Additionally, several USDA agencies engage in the ground       and aerial application of pesticides, and would be adversely       affected by the panel's decision. The Forest Service (FS) and       the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) now       will be required to obtain NPDES permits, which could       compromise the agencies' ability to respond with efficiency       and flexibility to emerging threats and emergency situations.       The delay and expense associated with complying with the       NPDES permitting requirement could substantially curtail the       agencies' use of pesticides. For the FS, this could result in       diminished efforts to protect the National Forests from pest       infestation and could potentially increase the risk and       severity of wildfires. It could also significantly hamper       aerial spraying programs such as APHIS's Mormon Cricket and       Grasshopper Program, undertaken in cooperation with western       states. Additionally, research programs involving both the       conventional and the experimental applications of pesticides       undertaken by the Agricultural Research Service (ARS) also       will be detrimentally affected by the panel's decision. The       time-consuming and costly process of negotiating the NPDES       permit application process will diminish the efficiency with       which the ARS will be able to undertake its initiatives, and       may, in some instances, curtail the agency's projects       entirely.        The Sixth Circuit's decision encumbers the American       farmers' and the agencies' ability to do business, while       reaping little or no environmental benefit in exchange.       Subjecting FIFRA-compliant pesticides to the additional       regulatory regime of the CWA is duplicative and will not help       protect the environment. FIFRA mandates that the EPA approve       and issue a registration for a pesticide product only after       the EPA has determined that the product will not cause       ``unreasonable adverse effects on the environment.'' The       pesticide registration and re-registration process under       FIFRA considers the effects of pesticides on both human       health and aquatic resources. If the EPA has concluded that a       pesticide satisfies FIFRA and will not have an ``unreasonable       adverse effect on the environment,'' then it is reasonable to       exclude the application of that pesticide from the permitting       requirements of the CWA.        In short, I am concerned that the court's decision will       compromise American farmers' and USDA agencies' ability to       respond efficiently and effectively to emergency threats,       while providing little or no additional environmental       protection in return. Thank you for taking these issues into       account as you consider seeking further review of this case.            Sincerely,                                                 Thomas J. Vilsack,                                                         Secretary.     Mr. Chair, I have nearly 120 organizations that support  H.R. 953, representing a wide variety of public and private entities  and thousands of stakeholders. I have a letter from the nearly 120. I  listed some of those. Some of the additional names are Agricultural  Retailers Association; American Farm Bureau Federation; American  Mosquito Control Association; the Association of Equipment  Manufacturers; CropLife America; Family Farm Alliance; National  Agricultural Aviation Association; the National Alliance of Forest  Owners; National Association of State Departments of Agriculture;  National Farmers Union; National Pest Management Association; and the  National Rural Electric Cooperative Association. I include that letter  in the Record.                                                        May 3, 2017.      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the over one hundred       undersigned organizations, we urge you to vote in favor of       H.R. 953, the Reducing Regulatory Burdens Act of 2017.        For almost forty years, the Environmental Protection Agency       (EPA) and pesticide applicators including public health       agencies charged with mosquito control operated exclusively       under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act       (FIFRA). In fact, EPA has testified to the adequacy of       FIFRA's comprehensive regulatory requirements including       substantial enforcement mechanisms in pursuit of that goal.        However, a 2009 activist-inspired lawsuit resulted in a       federal court decision identifying a technicality in the law       that Congress had not properly clarified its intent that       FIFRA should have preeminence over the Clean Water Act (CWA).       This decision resulted in pesticide users being required to       obtain a CWA National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System       (NPDES) permit. These permits were originally created to       address the discharge of waste by major industrial polluters,       but now are mandated for mosquito control districts and       others who are applying pesticides approved by EPA for use in       the environment for their beneficial purposes of trying to       prevent or control the spread of public health disease in the       U.S.        Though the NPDES permit burden lacks any additional       environmental benefit under these circumstances, it does       force substantial costs on thousands of small application       businesses and farms, as well as the municipal, county, state       and federal agencies responsible for protecting natural       resources and public health. Further, and most menacing, the       permit exposes all pesticide users--regardless of permit       eligibility--to the liability of CWA-based citizen law suits.       In a number of instances, applicators--that once conducted       mosquito abatement applications for local governments and       homeowner associations--can't afford the costs or risk of       frivolous litigation that accompanies NPDES PGPs and have       refrained from conducting public health applications.        H.R. 953 would clarify Congressional intent that federal       law does not require this redundant permit for already       regulated pesticide applications.        In the 112th Congress, similar legislation (H.R. 872)       passed the House Committee on Agriculture and went on to pass       the House of Representatives on suspension. In the 113th       Congress, the legislation (H.R. 935) passed both the House       Committees on Agriculture and Transportation & Infrastructure       by voice vote, and again, the House of Representatives. In       the 114th Congress, the Zika Vector Control Act (H.R. 897)       passed the House of Representatives yet again. With your help       and support, H.R. 953 will also pass the House and hopefully       become law.        Since H.R. 897 passed the House last year, there has been       yet another costly lawsuit against a mosquito control       district, forcing the district to spend its funds fighting in       court instead of protecting public health.        Under these circumstances, NPDES permit requirements impact       the use of critical pesticides in protecting human health and       the food supply from destructive and disease-carrying pests,       and in managing invasive weeds to keep open waterways and       shipping lanes, to maintain rights of way for transportation       and power generation, and in preventing damage to forests and       recreation areas. The time and funds expended on redundant       permit compliance drains public and private resources. All       this for no measurable benefit to the environment. We urge       you to eliminate this unnecessary, expensive, and duplicative       regulation by ensuring the Reducing Regulatory Burdens Act of       2017 passes the House on Wednesday.

American Mosquito Control Association Statement on NPDES Burden      The American Mosquito Control Association Urges Congress To Vote      ``YES'' on H.R. 953, the Reducing Regulatory Burdens Act of 2017         From the perspective of the agencies charged with       suppressing mosquitoes and other vectors of public health       consequence, the NPDES burden is directly related to       combatting Zika and other mosquito-transmitted diseases.        For over forty years and through both Democratic and       Republican administrations, the EPA and states held that       these permits did not apply to public health pesticide       applications. However, activist lawsuits forced the EPA to       require such permits even for the application of EPA-      registered pesticides including mosquito control.        AMCA has testified numerous times to establish the burden       created by this court ruling. The threat to the public health       mission of America's mosquito control districts comes in two       costly parts:                           Ongoing Compliance Costs         Though the activists contend that the NPDES permit has       ``modest notification and monitoring requirements'' the       actual experience of mosquito control districts is much       different.        Initially obtaining and maintaining an NPDES permit comes       at considerable expense. California mosquito control       districts estimate the NPDES compliance costs for their 64       districts to be approximately $4 million dollars over six       years. These costs include;        Initial amount spent by Districts determining waters       subject to reporting.        Total amount spent by Districts tracking treatments to       Waters of the US        Water Testing Consultants        NPDES Administration/Regulatory Consultants        Legal fees related to NPDES        Physical monitoring of larvicides--not completed by       consultants        Completing annual reports        In Wyoming, there are several issues that have impacted the       mosquito districts;        Record keeping requirements has redirected 2-5 % of       District funds annually to permit fees and administrative       costs.        The cost for acre applications of both adulticide and       larvicides has increased 5 to 10-fold for some Districts.       This is due primarily to the fear that local aerial       applicators have regarding the citizen lawsuits. The local ag       pilots have declined to fly for some of the mosquito       districts in Wyoming, requiring them to go out of state to       professional application companies. The City of Laramie which       was able to treat for an estimated $1 per acre now pays an       estimated $5-$10 per acre. This has greatly reduced the acres       that can be treated with larvicide and adulticides.        In Durango, CO, the Animas Mosquito Control District       reported spending over $50,000 in GPS/GIS system, maintenance       and upgrades purchased to comply with an unknown annual       report requirement. They spent numerous hours conducting       meetings, phone calls and on the computer to clarify the       annual reporting requirements, the detail necessary in annual       reports, and even where to send the information.        The fact that the existence of the permit over the last 6       years has no additional environmental benefit (since       pesticide applications are already governed by FIFRA) makes       these taxpayer diversions from vector control unconscionable.        In a survey of mosquito control programs, 71 reported (out       of 734 nationwide) that their multiyear period expenses       incurred due to the NPDES permitting including operational,       permitting, reporting, monitoring and other administrative       costs totaled over $4 million. (This survey does not include       all of the 6-year California estimate mentioned previously).             How Could $4 Million in NPDES Costs be Better Spent         Seasonal field workers ($11,000 for starter), 377       employees.        Bti larvicide ($1.44/lb), 2,879,738 pounds.        Acres of water larvicided aerially (10 lbs/acre + $5.25       applicator cost = $19.65), 211,034 acres.        Acres of water treated by ground crews (10 lbs./acre),       287,973 acres.        West Nile virus--in house testing of adult mosquitoes       (RAMP) $19.36, 214,195 tests.        30 second radio ads for public education ($40-$200),       103,671-20,734.        Acres of aerial adult mosquito control ($.89 applicator fee       + $.95 chemical), 2,253,708 acres.        Evening ground spraying hours ($396/hr. for vehicle,       employee, adulticide), 10,472 hrs.        Every dollar spent on duplicative regulations is a dollar       that could have been used towards Integrated Pest Management       (IPM) activities that control mosquitoes and prevent       mosquito-borne illness.        Resources must not be diverted from these mosquito control       activities in order to protect public health:        Disease surveillance--trapping and testing adult       mosquitoes, monitoring dead birds.        Larvicides and adult mosquito control--reduce mosquito       populations through targeted applications        Habitat modification/source reduction--ditching/dredgers to       permanently reduce mosquito oviposition habitats to reduce       the need for chemical control measures.        Monitoring invasive species of mosquitoes.        Public education--publications on reducing backyard sources       of mosquitoes, information on repellent and personal       protective measures.        Employees, training, and certifications.        Programs that are most affected:        Poorer, rural mosquito control districts        Programs associated with small municipalities        In the Western US, those associated with private aerial       contractors concerned with taking on the added liability.        Municipalities in the south looking to start Zika virus       control efforts. Why would Congress approve $1.1 Billion to       fight and explore Zika virus and then burden us with       regulations that hinder our ability to control the vector of       the disease?        So, why would the activist organizations be so adamant that       these permits be mandatory for public health pesticide       applications . . . ?                       Exposure to Activist Litigation         Municipal mosquito control programs are vulnerable to CWA       citizen lawsuits where fines to mosquito control districts       may exceed $37,500/day. Under FIFRA, the activists would need       to demonstrate that the pesticides were misapplied, that the       product labels were not followed. Additionally, this is not a       question of the applications causing harm to public health.       The pesticides we use are specific to mosquitoes and are       generally used in very low doses by qualified applicators).        However, the CWA 3rd Party Citizen Suit Provision allows       for any third party to sue for alleged violations of NPDES       program requirements. Additionally, the CWA does not require       actual evidence of a misapplication of a pesticide or harm to       the environment,  [[Page H4539]]       but rather simple paperwork violations or merely allegations       in permit oversight.        The Toledo Area Sanitary District is currently involved in       a lawsuit that has already initially cost the mosquito       control program more than $40,000 in legal fees, and the case       has yet to go to court. This could lead to an injunction on       the spray program and end up costing taxpayers $100,000+       dollars, even though the case has nothing to do with       substantive water quality issues, but rather focuses on       alleged administrative paperwork violations.        Gem County Mosquito Abatement District (ID) was the subject       of one of these activist lawsuits utilizing the 3rd Party       Citizen Suit Provision. It took ten years and the grand total       of an entire year's annual operating budget ($450,000) to       resolve that litigation against that public health entity.        These ongoing compliance costs and threat of crushing       litigation directly impact mosquito control districts. The       existence of this unnecessary requirement for mosquito       control activities is directly related to our ability to       combat the vectors related to Zika. It diverts precious       resources away from finding and suppressing mosquito       populations.        The American Mosquito Control Association urges Congress to       vote ``YES'' on H.R. 953, the Reducing Regulatory Burdens Act       of 2017.                                   ____                                  American Farm Bureau Federation,                                       Washington, DC, May 24, 2017.      Hon. Bill Shuster,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Bob Gibbs,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Michael Conaway,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Garret Graves,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Reps. Shuster, Gibbs, Conaway and Graves: Later this       week, the House is expected to vote on H.R. 953, ``The       Reducing Regulatory Burdens Act of 2017.'' This legislation       has previously passed the House of Representatives with       strong bipartisan support, and the American Farm Bureau       Federation (AFBF) urges all members of Congress to vote in       favor of the bill.        H.R. 953 is narrowly crafted to clarify that lawful use of       pesticides in or near navigable waters is not excessively       covered under two statutes, the Clean Water Act and the       Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act. In doing       so, the measure simply codifies EPA's longstanding       interpretation of the law before it was thrown into confusion       by a 2009 court ruling, which imposed an additional layer of       needless red tape on pesticide applicators. H.R. 953 corrects       the duplicative requirements associated with EPA's National       Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) pesticide       permit by specifying that NPDES permits are not needed for       the lawful application of EPA-labeled pesticides. This is an       important fix that will reduce red tape and legal liabilities       associated with the lawful use of pesticides in protecting       public health and food security.        We urge all members to vote in favor of the ``Reducing       Regulatory Burdens Act of 2017.''        Thank you very much for your support.            Sincerely,                                                      Zippy Duvall,                                                         President.     Mr. Chair, I also include in the Record a letter from the  National Association of Counties. NACo recommends that Congress address  some of challenges posed by the EPA's Clean Water Act permit for  pesticides to allow counties to more quickly respond to the mosquito- based public health threats. Counties have reported either  significantly scaled back or discontinued mosquito abatement programs  due to the additional, duplicative, and expensive paperwork and  monitoring obligations required by the program.                               National Association of Counties,                                       Washington, DC, May 21, 2017.      Hon. Paul D. Ryan,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Minority Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Ryan and Minority Leader Pelosi: As the U.S.       House of Representatives moves forward with the ``Reducing       Regulatory Burdens Act of 2017'' (H.R. 953), we would like to       highlight the impact that U.S. Environmental Protection       Agency's (EPA) National Pollutant Discharge Elimination       System (NPDES) Pesticide General Permit (PGP) program has on       county governments' ability to respond promptly and       effectively to emerging public health threats.        As the summer months approach and we enter mosquito season,       counties are concerned about the health and safety impacts of       mosquito-borne illnesses such as Zika. The Zika virus is an       emerging mosquito-borne illness, primarily stemming from the       bite of infected Aedes mosquitoes, and there is no vaccine.       Since mosquitos and their breeding habitats pose the largest       threat to public safety, counties can play a major role in       minimizing the potential spread of the virus and other       mosquito-borne illnesses through public education and       mosquito eradication.        However, since EPA's PGP program was instituted in 2011,       counties have reported that they have either significantly       scaled back or discontinued mosquito abatement programs due       to additional, duplicative and expensive paperwork and       monitoring obligations required under the permit. We       recommend that Congress address some of the challenges posed       by EPA's PGP permit to allow counties to more quickly respond       to mosquito-based public health threats.        We thank you for your leadership on this issue. We look       forward to continuing to work with you on issues important to       counties.            Sincerely,                                               Matthew D. Chase,                                                 Executive Director,                                  National Association of Counties.     Mr. Chair, I thank the Agriculture Committee chairman,  Mike Conaway; and the Transportation and Infrastructure chairman, Bill  Shuster, who are the leadership on this issue. I want to thank the  Agriculture Committee ranking member, Collin Peterson, as well.   Mr. Chair, I urge all Members to support this commonsense effort to  reform this duplicative EPA regulation.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I appreciate my colleague and friend from  Minnesota for his bipartisan support of H.R. 953.   Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman  from Louisiana (Mr. Scalise), the majority whip.    Mr. Chairman, may I inquire as to how much time each side  has remaining.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I just want to make a few remarks on what my friend, my colleague  from Oregon said. I call it the rest of the story.   We talked about the fish kill in 1996 of the steelhead. I inquired of  this tragic incident and came to the conclusion that NPDES permitting  under the Clean Water Act would not have prevented the fish kill.   In 2003, the EPA Office of Pesticide Programs published a report  which looked at this potential risk posed by the herbicide that was  used in the 1996 fish kill. The report stated:         Where sufficient information has been provided, it appears       that the fish incidents are as a result of misuse. The form       of misuse is that water was released from the irrigation       canals too early. In some cases, this was because the gate       valves were not properly closed or that they leaked. In other       cases, the applicator opened them intentionally, but too       soon. In one case, boards that helped contain the irrigation       canal water may have been removed by children playing.    The EPA goes on in the report to address each of the various species  of salmon and steelhead analyzed and repeatedly states:         It is very unlikely the pesticide suspected to cause the       Oregon fish kill would have affected the steelhead or salmon       if it was used in accordance with the label requirements.       Completing NPDES permit paperwork and paying a permit fee       does not prevent fish kills, nor does it improve water       quality. Pesticide applications in accordance with FIFRA       pesticide labels will avoid adverse environmental impacts,       including fish kills.    If a pesticide is improperly applied, there are enforcement  mechanisms in place to address this violation. In the case of the 1996  Oregon fish kill, I understand the party was subject to more than  $400,000 in fines and reimbursements for the incident.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.  Allen).    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   In my closing, I just want to really reemphasize the importance to  pass this bill and get it signed into law because the environment is at  risk, human safety is at risk, human health is at risk. We have over  100 Zika outbreaks currently in the United States. We have hundreds of  West Nile outbreaks. And what this bill does is it puts a tool in the  toolbox for our mosquito control districts, an additional tool to help  eradicate or control the mosquito population to prevent and protect  human health around our citizens.   There has been a lot of talk about pesticide chemicals in the water,  and some of these chemicals that have been mentioned are what we call  legacy chemicals that were used years ago. As a farmer, I can tell you  some of the chemicals we used when I started farming in 1975 didn't  break down. They weren't biodegradable.   The industry has changed a lot. We have new chemicals, better  chemicals, safer chemicals. Many of them are biodegradable. So these  legacy issues are not--the contaminants in a lot of the  [[Page H4545]]  water today isn't from chemicals being used in today's agricultural  environment, but it is from past years because those chemicals last in  the environment for many years.   I think it is also important that the former Secretary of  Agriculture--I stated earlier--Tom Vilsack, was very concerned about  this, and he sent a letter to the EPA Administrator at the time, Lisa  Jackson, that this court case doesn't do anything to help protect the  environment or protect water quality in the United States, and it adds  additional costs and burdens to our agricultural producers in their  efforts to produce the wholesome, safe, affordable food supply to feed  the world.   This is commonsense legislation, and I urge people to vote for H.R.  953. As has been said earlier, this bill has been up several other  times in previous Congresses; it has had strong bipartisan support.  Unfortunately, the Senate did not move on it and take action. Hopefully  this time we will see that, especially with the outbreaks of Zika and  West Nile and seeing the cost.   It was mentioned earlier, too, about the cost of getting the permit.  Obviously, doing the permit, actually applying it probably isn't much  costly, but to get all the stuff lined up, the consultants and all the  paperwork they have to do to get the information there is quite costly.   We had in previous committee hearings mosquito control districts  coming in and talking about the cost. The thousands of dollars they are  spending has blown their budget where they could be using that to spend  on mosquito eradication.   So, obviously, we have hundreds of groups around the country that  support this legislation. It is needed, and I urge my colleagues to  support it so we can move on and protect the environment, enhance the  environment, and also human health and safety.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, a couple of points I would like to make. When  my colleague from Connecticut talked about spraying chemicals,  pesticides over water, the EPA has full authority, full jurisdiction to  restrict those pesticides, how they are used, when they are used, and  also who is using them; and they can restrict it to a manner where the  applicator has to have specific training. And there is nothing to stop  the EPA to say that if you are going to spray over a body of water, you  have to notify the EPA. The EPA has that authority. They have the  jurisdiction to do that.   I think it is also interesting to mention when talking about spraying  and getting a permit after the fact, yeah, that if the local entity  declares an emergency, then they can go in. But my argument is that  since this additional permitting requirement, this additional red tape  bureaucracy is stopping the preventive programs, so we shouldn't have  to get to an emergency situation where we just spray and do the permit  after the fact.   But her amendment, H.R. 953 eliminates the duplicative, expansive,  and unnecessary permit process, and helps free up resources for States,  counties, and local governments to better combat the spread of diseases  like Zika and West Nile virus. This amendment, in effect, undermines  these efforts.   The amendment intends to make the bill's exemption from the Clean  Water Act permitting ineffective by carving out from the bill those  waters that may receive a discharge containing any one of several  hundred listed chemical substances. The vast majority of substances  referenced in this amendment are not even a pesticide and have nothing  to do with the regulation of a pesticide.    Additionally, a discharge covered under this amendment does not have  to be related in any way to the use or application of a pesticide. The  net effect of this amendment is to undermine the bill based on  circumstances that have nothing whatsoever to do with the use of a  pesticide.   Further, the amendment would require a pesticide user to conduct  extremely expensive and time-consuming monitoring. This defeats the  bill's purpose of reducing the regulatory burdens. I urge Members to  oppose this amendment.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I just urge the Members to oppose this  amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, well, that was a lot of drama. Let's not lose  sight that what we are trying to do in H.R. 953 is to free up the  resources so States, counties, local governments can fight the mosquito  population, fight Zika, fight the West Nile virus, and let our  agricultural producers have the most efficient way to protect the  environment, and also produce a safe, wholesome food supply.   This amendment undermines the base bill. The amendment intends to  carve out from the bill those waters that have a discharge of any type.  That means the way this amendment is written, any type of discharge-- even if it is not a pesticide--any type of discharge, a nutrient  discharge, anything would fall under this and undermines the bill. This  amendment covers all types of discharges. I think that is important to  mention.   In addition, most waterbodies in this country are fishable, and,  therefore, subject to this amendment's carve-out. As a result, the  types of discharges and waterbodies in question under this amendment do  not need to be related at all to the actual regulation of a pesticide.   Further, the amendment would require that a pesticide user conduct  extremely expensive and time-consuming monitoring. Moreover, the  amendment's standard of any negative effect is vague and subjective and  could include an effect that has nothing to do with a pesticide.   Registered pesticides already take into account aquatic species' and  fisheries' health into consideration during the registration process. I  think it is important that they go through a rigorous testing process,  and more testing, and the EPA has full control. They can reject that.  If they determine that a pesticide is environmentally harmful, or  potentially harmful, they can pull that product off.   They can also restrict the product even more so, and restrict who the  applicators are, and there is nothing to stop the EPA or the State EPAs  to say: Before you apply a pesticide over a waterbody, you need to tell  us first before you do it.   There is nothing to stop the EPA from doing that.   So all this amendment does, it defeats the bill's purpose, reducing  the regulatory burdens, and I urge my Members to oppose this amendment.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I will just say that the comment about this  amendment would allow States to do it, I don't think there is anything  to stop the States from doing it now. If States want to do more to  protect water quality in their States, I think they have the right to  do that.   Under the Clean Water Act, what it says is: The States will implement  and enforce the Clean Water Act under the guidance of the Federal  Government, but they have to be, at the least, a standard of the  Federal Government. They can exceed that standard if they want, so I  don't think there is anything stopping that.   I urge my colleagues to defeat this amendment and support the  underlying bill.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the motion.    Mr. Speaker, this motion to recommit is unnecessary and  aims to undermine the purpose of the bill.   The underlying bill, H.R. 953, eliminates the duplicative, expensive,  and unnecessary permit process that helps free up the resources for our  States, counties, and local governments to better combat the Zika, West  Nile virus, and other diseases; but this motion, in effect, aims to  undermine the bill.   In this motion, the bill says it will not apply to anybody who makes  a discharge of a pesticide if they made a political contribution to the  President or to any Federal official charged with registration,  regulation, or approval of the use of a pesticide. That is utterly  absurd. You can't make political contributions to regulators at the  EPA.   Let's keep in mind that the EPA has full authority to regulate these  pesticides, pull pesticides off the market, and regulate who applies  them, and they have full authority to protect our water and our human  health.   This amendment simply aims to gut the bill. It is unclear how it ever  would work. We need to stop creating unnecessary roadblocks to the use  of products that stand to protect public health and feed the Nation.   H.R. 953 is a good bill that will help protect public health and the  environment and stop mosquitoes from spreading Zika and the West Nile  virus and other diseases to our vulnerable populations.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly oppose this motion and urge my colleagues to  vote ``no.''   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
