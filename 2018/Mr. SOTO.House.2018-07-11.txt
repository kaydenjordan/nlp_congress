 Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this good, bipartisan  amendment offered by the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Gaetz).   Lionfish are disrupting Florida's natural ecosystem. Lionfish are  taking away prey from our native fish stocks and prey on reef fish that  perform essential ecological services on the reefs.   This amendment would give an incentive for fishermen to remove the  lionfish by awarding a tag for desired reef fish in return for every  100 lionfish tails turned in. That is quite the bounty.   The amendment will promote cooperation between local, State, and  Federal governments to eradicate lionfish from Florida waters.   This amendment is derived from a bill of which I am a cosponsor.   Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Florida for offering this  amendment, and I urge my colleagues to support it.    Mr. Speaker, the first Hispanic woman to serve in Florida  state's House or Senate--went on to become the first Latina in Congress  and rose to be the first woman to chair the House Committee on Foreign  Affairs.   She's inspired many of us to follow her public service example.   For over three decades she's been a champion for the LGBTQ community,  a critical voice in promoting democracy in Cuba and Venezuela, a leader  in advancing the well-being of the Hispanic Community, and a tireless  human rights advocate across the globe.   I've been proud to work with Rep. Ros-Lehtinen on initiatives like:   BRIDGE   United States-Israel Agriculture Strategic Partnership Act   Hurricane Irma Disaster Relief in Florida   Hurricane Maria Disaster Relief in Puerto Rico   She has a gift of bringing people together. Floridians are proud to  have had Ileana as a public servant and her legacy will live on.                            ____________________
