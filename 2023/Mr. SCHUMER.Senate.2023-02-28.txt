 First, some business, and then I will give my remarks.   First, I understand there is a bill at the desk that is due for a  second reading.    In order to place the bill on the calendar under the  provisions of rule XIV, I would object to further proceedings.    Mr. President, now, on the recap of our codel: While  meeting last week with leaders in Europe, India, Pakistan, and Israel-- the nine of us on our codel--two takeaways became clear. First, the  United States should deepen our relationship with India if we want to  outcompete the Chinese Communist Party in this century. Second,  democracies must unite in increasing aid to Ukraine.   I was glad Prime Minister Modi got the message during our meeting  with him in India. My colleagues and I made clear the two largest  democracies in the world--the world's oldest democracy and the world's  largest--could be a powerful check against the CCP.   That doesn't mean just cooperating with India on defense and  security, though that is essential. It means we must take an all-out,  all-of-the-above approach, because that is precisely what the CCP is  doing.   The CCP wants to outcompete America not just on defense but also  economically, geopolitically, technologically, in terms of our  fundamental values and more. Just as our transatlantic partnership  matters immensely, so too will our partnership with India.   The United States and India must, therefore, keep working together to  strengthen our economic ties, expand our trade, and make it easier to  recruit talented workers from abroad to work in our country.   While meeting with foreign leaders, we also made clear the importance  of standing shoulder to shoulder with the people of Ukraine. We made it  clear to the leaders of Europe, India, Pakistan, and Israel that they  must increase their aid to Ukraine. Vladimir Putin's illegal invasion  is now a year old; and as difficult as the road has been, we made it  clear that the worst thing we can do is waver in our support. The  Ukrainian people and the Ukrainian Armed Forces are fighting valiantly,  but they need more materiel. And it is our job to give it to them. A  Russian victory will not quench Putin's hunger for expansion. On the  contrary, it would escalate his desire for more territory.   So the right answer is for the transatlantic partnership--and all the  free nations of the world--to continue supporting the Ukrainian people.

Today, the Supreme Court begins hearing oral arguments on  President Biden's student debt relief plan, a plan that could give tens  of millions of Americans a new lease on life.   Republicans talk a big game about helping working people, but today's  case before the Supreme Court--pushed by Republican officeholders who  oppose the President's plan--is a slap in the face of working Americans  across the country, young and old alike. Let me be clear: 90 percent-- 90 percent--of the relief going to out-of-school borrowers will go to  those earning less than $75,000 a year. This isn't a handout to the  wealthy. Far from it. This is critical relief to working- and middle- class families. For generations, higher education was the ladder up  into the middle class, especially for millions of Black, Latino, and  Asian Americans.   But over the years, the student debt that comes with a college degree  has become not a ladder up but an anchor weighing Americans down-- making it harder for them to put a down payment on a house, buy a car,  start a family, and save for retirement. In other words, the burden of  student debt makes it harder--harder--to achieve the American Dream.   That is what is at stake before the Supreme Court, not just the  chance to relieve the crushing weight of student debt for millions upon  millions of people but also to make the American dream a little more  accessible for millions more--their families, as well as themselves.  That is all we are trying to do, and I am confident we will get there  because I believe the law is on our side.                            ____________________     Mr. President, now on CHIPS and Science. Just 6 months  after President Biden signed the CHIPS and Science Act into law, we are  already seeing it pay major--major--dividends for our economy, to the  tune of $200 billion in private investments across 16 States. And  starting today, applications are officially open for more investments  in American industry and American workers.   Today, Secretary Raimondo, who has done terrific work getting CHIPS  up and running, is rolling out the Department of Commerce's  applications with CHIPS funding.   Today's rollout is a major step towards making America the world  leader in chip production once again, with tremendous benefits for our  national security, for outcompeting the Chinese Communist Party, and  creating tens of thousands of good-paying union jobs right here at  home.   So I want to commend Secretary Raimondo, who was not only a crucial  partner with me in getting the bill across the finish line but who has  also done a fantastic job rolling out the funding so quickly, so  effectively, so efficiently. And I want to commend my colleagues on  both sides of the aisle for recognizing the need to get this done and  pushing to make it happen.                            ____________________     Mr. President, now on to East Palestine. Yesterday, I  called on Norfolk Southern's CEO Alan Shaw to come before the Senate  and answer questions under oath about the derailment in East Palestine.   The accident has been deemed 100 percent preventable. So Mr. Shaw  should be transparent, forthright, and he should not duck but, instead,  testify before America, before the Senate, as soon as possible.   Norfolk Southern owes the American people some answers to some very  important questions.   Why, for example, did Norfolk Southern spend years pushing the  Federal Government, and particularly the Trump administration, to  repeal--repeal--safety regulations intended to prevent accidents  similar to the one in East Palestine?   Why has Norfolk Southern laid off thousands of workers while  reporting over $3 billion in profits in 2022?   And why did Norfolk Southern launch a $10 billion stock buyback  program last year, when they could have used that money to upgrade  safety equipment, hire more workers, or pay their employees better  wages?   Disasters like the one in East Palestine are precisely what can  happen when safety takes a backseat to maximizing profits. It is a  pattern that has played out to devastating effect over the years:  Corporate interests lobby the government to loosen safety rules, then  they cut costs, cut workers, reward shareholders; and sooner or later,  disaster strikes.   And it is so typical--so typical--for people like Donald Trump to do  the bidding of special interests, cause harm to the American people-- that is what he did when he loosened railroad regulations--and then  point the finger at someone else when something terrible happens. That  is just what he did here. It just doesn't wash. The American people see  right through it.   So, once again, I hope the CEO of Norfolk Southern testifies as soon  as possible. Norfolk Southern has broken their trust to the American  public and must--must--be held accountable.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
