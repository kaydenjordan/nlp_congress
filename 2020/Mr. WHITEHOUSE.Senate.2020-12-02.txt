 Mr. President, I have had the pleasure of working  with my chairman on the Budget Committee on budget reform initiatives,  and I want to take this occasion to thank him for the wonderful way in  which he worked with me on those issues and for all of his support.   I want to make a pledge to him as well. The effort began with a lot  of hearings in the Budget Committee to sort out how we could reform  what we were doing. At the moment, the Budget Committee is, probably,  the most dysfunctional piece of this dysfunctional institution, and  Chairman Enzi was determined to remedy that. A lot of work went in at  the committee level. Then a bicameral committee was created to look at  budget reform, primarily out of the House, and I had the opportunity to  serve on that bicameral committee. That was an opportunity that I owe  to Chairman Enzi. He both advocated for me to his leader that I should  be on that committee, and he gave up a spot on that committee to make  sure there was a spot for me there. I hope and believe that I conducted  myself in due accord with Chairman Enzi's wishes and principles in the  course of that.   We had the ability to use that bicameral committee process to do a  test run of our budget reform, and I am pleased to report that,  although the end product was never adopted between the two bodies, the  product that came out of the committee included our budget reform as it  was then constituted. We raised our aspiration from the budget reform  as it was then constituted, which was entirely voluntary, to actually  try to change the Budget Committee's rules to force the process of the  Budget Committee into the mold of the voluntary structure. We did good  work on that, and we came to an agreement. I am sorry to say that its  failure to pass into law arose not from problems on the Republican side  of the aisle but from problems on my side of the aisle that I have been  unable to yet surmount.   My pledge to you, Chairman Enzi, is that I will keep at it. Senator  Blunt is here, and he is helpful in that regard. Senator Lankford and  Senator Perdue are here, and we have a good team, along with Senator  Kaine, Senator King, myself, and others on our side--another being  Senator Shaheen.   So I will continue the work. I vow to you that I will somehow find a  way to get this done, and if I can find a way to call it the Enzi  reform, I will find a way to call it the Enzi reform.   I will long remember the relationship we had and the good work we did  together. I will long remember your 80/20 rule. And maybe--because I  have a similar proposal in Rules--maybe we will even be able to get  your phones and electronics amendment passed.   So thank you to you, sir, for doing what is right, doing your best,  and treating others as they would want to be treated.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    I ask unanimous consent that the scheduled votes  commence.    Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, let me thank Senator Cotton for his  work with me in getting this bill to this happy result.   As the Presiding Officer knows, a bill can look like it was easy to  get done when it passes 96 to 1, but that doesn't mean that the pathway  was easy. This has been years and years of effort.   Senator Cotton really helped make it possible, so I am very grateful  to him.   I also want to thank Senator Braun, who was the first Republican  Member to join me in this and who has been a constant ally and source  of support and encouragement.   I would also like to extend my appreciation to Chairman Grassley of  the Finance Committee. This is a Finance Committee jurisdiction bill.  Chairman Grassley was willing to let it go forward as long as he got  his amendment--without insisting on his amendment being part of the  bill. He got his vote. We voted it down, and the bill has now gone  forward, and that reflects a very high degree of forbearance and  courtesy from Chairman Grassley, which I respect and appreciate.   I also want to thank the ranking member on Finance, Senator Wyden,  [[Page S7165]]  who has worked very hard to make sure that finance issues were resolved  and that he was comfortable with it. He and Grassley were able to give  it committee clearance to come to the floor with their support on these  terms.   I also want to thank Senator Lee--Mike Lee--for his forbearance. He  has been interested in this bill in the past. We debated it on the  Senate floor, and he has allowed it to proceed in this way also, so I  am grateful to Senator Lee.   Of course, that is all the gratitude here within the body for people  who made the bill possible, but the people we really need to be  grateful to and appreciative of are the ALS advocates who come to us to  argue for support and for encouragement. They are filled with hope even  though there is no cure. They continue to seek investment in the  science to try to figure out a way to a cure. They show immense courage   This is a devastating, uniquely bad diagnosis for somebody to get. It  is very hard for the individual who receives the diagnosis and also  terrible for their family as well.   We have all had the experience in this body of seeing our  constituents come to advocate on ALS and have the experience of seeing  them the first time they come to us with a cane. When they come back  the next year, they come back with a wheelchair and, the following year  after that, come back with an electronic support mechanism with  ventilator assistance and are still able to steer around, but it is an  apparatus much more complex than a wheelchair. Then, in the next visit,  it is their widow who comes alone.   We have had the chance to do something good here. It made no sense to  require people who have this diagnosis wait 5 months before they can  begin to get Social Security Disability Insurance benefits. Actually,  very often, that first 5 months is when the support makes the most  difference in terms of the quality of life that remains during the  course of the illness.   We have been at this about 5 years now. Today is a good day in that  sense.   I want to call to mind, just as an example of how this strikes at  home--our small, local, home State paper, the Providence Journal, has a  long tradition of being a very distinguished newspaper. Very often  people who worked for it went on to the Wall Street Journal, the New  York Times, the Washington Post, and big and famous newspapers and made  national names for themselves. The Providence Journal is a really  significant newspaper. Just in the course of my time in politics, two  of its writers have been stricken with ALS--struck down, in fact, with  ALS: Brian Dickinson, first, and Bill Malinowski afterward. Each had to  learn to write in very unusual ways, including with their eyeballs by  blinking as letters went by on a screen or by directing a laser.   It is a terrible disease, ALS. But one thing that it does is it  displays the extraordinary human character of people who fight on  through this increasingly disabling condition. The courage that they  show and the way that they persist--in this case, to keep writing-- Brian Dickinson was writing columns really until the end of his life-- stand as an example to all of us of what courage in impossible  circumstances looks like. That is a blessing they give to all of us.   With many thanks and much appreciation to J.R. Pagliarini, the  president of Rhode Island ALS society, and his president emeritus,  Kenneth McGunagle, and to their executive director, Beth Flanagan, I am  happy to get this done.   Now we hope that in the final days of this Congress, our friends over  in the House--with 300-plus cosponsors on the bill in the House--ought  to be able to get out of each other's way and get this done before this  Congress concludes.   I yield the floor to my friend and colleague Senator Braun with great  appreciation.    Mr. President, today is my 276th climate speech, and  my increasingly battered graphic is showing its wear, but for the first  time in a really, really long time, there is real hope for climate  action in America.   The light of science will shine in a Biden administration. Our U.S.  Government will heed actual data. Agencies will act on facts. The White  House  [[Page S7166]]  will care about the harm carbon pollution does right now across the  country. President Biden will restore the EPA to its role of  safeguarding our air and water and will task the State Department to  surge climate policy abroad. Every Department--from Transportation to  the USDA, to HUD, to the SEC--will have a role in turning this ship  around before catastrophe.   At last, the Biden administration will cleanse America's government  of its grimy infestation of polluter lackeys, stooges, and hangers-on  and will shut off the disastrous handouts to fossil fuel industry  donors. A flood of cleansing executive actions will wash away the  grime. The American Presidency, with its great power, will shake free  of the polluters' grip, but the Presidency alone cannot spare us.   Congress must pass a comprehensive climate bill, stop rewarding  polluters from polluting, and clean up our energy market so it is not  corrupted by or for the fossil fuel industry--for instance, putting a  real price on carbon to pay for the fossil fuel damage. We have to  invest in new, green infrastructure to create millions of jobs. We need  to prepare communities along our coasts for rising seas, others for  higher temperatures, and other climate dangers. We need to address the  dangerous systemic financial risks fossil fuel presents to our economic  system. There is work to be done, and it is overdue.   So what has been stopping us?   Four years ago, Senate Democrats came to the Senate floor and here  exposed this web of denial and obstruction that had been built by the  fossil fuel industry to prevent meaningful action on climate change.  This evil web is a front for billionaire polluters like the Kochs and  fossil fuel pushers like ExxonMobil and Marathon Petroleum. To hide its  funders, this web uses creepy identity-scrubbing groups like Donors  Trust and Donors Capital. They move money and people around in the web  in a Whac-A-Mole array of disposable groups with misleadingly wholesome  names like the Heartland Institute and the Franklin Center for  Government and Public Integrity. Benjamin Franklin would vomit at this  abuse of his name.   Following Big Tobacco's playbook, this web of denial kept the  polluters' fingerprints off the dirty work of sowing doubt about  climate science, just as the tobacco industry fraudulently stood up  front groups to dispense denial of the harms of tobacco. This polluter  web of denial also kept the Republican Party in line by spending  stunning amounts of money in American politics   Dr. Robert Brulle, now at Brown University, created this graphic off  of his research, and it gives you a sense of how big and how complex  this web of denial is that the fossil fuel industry stood up, and it is  funded by huge amounts of dark money by anonymous funders.   When we exposed this web back in 2016, fossil fuel giants like  ExxonMobil said it was out of the climate denial and obstruction  business. Exxon claimed it had not funded the Heartland Institutes of  the world for a decade. Fossil fuel executives said they knew climate  change was a threat, and they claimed to have turned the page on this  nonsense.   Well, that just ain't so. The network of phony front groups,  identity-laundering outfits, and bogus PR campaigns is alive and well.  Like any threatened crooked enterprise, it morphs to hide in its  surroundings, but we just caught another glimpse of it through a New  York Times expose of the corporate PR firm FTI Consulting. FTI started  40 years ago as a hired gun for parties in litigation and now offers  virtually any nasty service a corporation could need. According to the  Times, the fossil fuel industry employs FTI for a lot of dirty work.   One thing FTI does is to stand up fake front groups. The New York  Times chronicles how organizations like Citizens to Protect PA Jobs,  New Mexicans for Economic Prosperity, and the Liberty Energy Project  actually all trace back to FTI through common employees, internet  domain registrations, and other ties. Each of these pop-up groups  suggests that it is a broad coalition of regular Americans. Each sports  a flashy website, like this one, with neighborly looking folk in scenic  vistas, and, of course, they all make the fossil fuel case for cutting  corporate taxes and slashing environmental protections. We call these  fake environmental grassroots groups ``Astroturf''--a product  manufactured by big, powerful special interests to look like grassroots  support.   This one is a classic--Texans for Natural Gas. The Times writes about  this outfit:         Acting as Texans for Natural Gas representatives, FTI       employees have launched pro-industry petitions, produced       videos and reports on the importance of the Permian Basin oil       field, and written opinion pieces for local newspapers       supporting fossil fuels. The site features testimonials from       three women--    I am quoting still--       two of whom are represented with stock photos--    Let me interrupt the quote for a minute because you know you can go  to the internet and find stock photos of people you can use. So these  aren't real testimonials. These are fake FTI testimonials with stock  photos to make it look like it is credible. OK, I will go back to the  quote:       and one with a photo used without permission from the Flickr       page of a photographer in the Philippines.    Classy, huh? This bag of polluter tricks is pretty familiar to those  who have studied the web of denial here, but FTI is also pulling some  new tricks.   One new target is fossil fuel's own investors. A new challenge for  oil and gas companies is their own shareholders--even their biggest  institutional investors--calling on them to identify and address  climate risks. For instance, last spring, BlackRock, the largest  institutional investor in the world, voted at a shareholder meeting to  remove two Exxon directors and install an independent Exxon chairman,  all to improve this oil giant's ``insufficient progress'' in addressing  its business risk from climate change. That kind of warning shot sends  shivers down the spine of a big polluter.   So there is FTI, which popped up a group in 2018 called Main Street  Investors, which commissioned studies arguing that activist  shareholders harm shareholder value, and it launched a website,  divestmentfacts.com, to argue against big university endowments,  pension funds, and other big investors divesting from fossil fuels. The  Times notes about this scheme: ``At least six academic papers published  on this website were by professors who, in addition to their university  jobs, were also working for Compass Lexecon, [an] FTI subsidiary.''   Neat trick using shareholder money to fool shareholders.   Who paid FTI to set up Main Street Investors? The National  Association of Manufacturers, which the watchdog group Influence Map  has called the worst climate obstructor in America. So it is no  surprise that they are paying for this phony nonsense. The question is,  Who paid the National Association of Manufacturers to set this up? They  won't say. So we have to take a guess.   There is more that FTI is up to. Don't like your news coverage? FTI  can build you your own news site. The Times found FTI lurking behind  Energy In Depth and Western Wire--two sites that churn out pro-fossil  fuel articles and spread them around the internet. With mass extinction  of real local newspapers underway, FTI is busy setting up polluter news  pages to fill the void. It is clever, if repulsive.   Of course, FTI does dirty work on social media. After New York City  filed a climate lawsuit against Exxon, FTI launched a social media  attack on New York Mayor Bill de Blasio. In a pantomime twofer, FTI  used content from its phony Energy In Depth news site in its paid-for  social media attack. Who paid? They won't say. Take a guess.   Another FTI campaign bought social media ads to steer people to  another FTI front group, the Arctic Energy Center, which promotes-- guess what--drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and off the  Alaskan coast.   In yet another campaign, FTI's shadowy special strategic  communications unit set up a phony Facebook profile to secretly track  environmental protesters. It did this for Apache Energy, which wanted  to drill for fossil fuel next to a State park in Texas. See the  pattern?   But wait. It gets even creepier than this, if you can believe it. FTI  has a menu that it offers to its clients of fake personas.  [[Page S7167]]    These fake personas use fake social media and message board accounts  to interfere in internet debate--say by harassing local citizens who  are concerned about pollution and who may be criticizing FTI's clients,  so they will bomb into the internet debate around that, offering fake  personas as the phony voice to disrupt that debate.   This is actually their menu. You have what they call ``the  Derailleur.'' ``The Derailleur seizes on a seemingly innocuous section  of the otherwise negative narrative and attempts to pull the comment  thread into a discursive discussion around that detailed non-issue.''   They offer next the ``Drunken Conspiracy Theorist Uncle.'' ``The  Drunken Conspiracy Theorist Uncle agrees with the negative commenter  but conflates other unrelated and offensive issues into it, lumping it  all together into an unpalatable whole.''   They also offer the ``Semantic Nitpicker,'' who ``asks an endless  series of questions seeking clarification or pointing out minor flaws  in the way the argument is constructed. This can be played both  friendly and oppositionally, but by different stacks of kids.''   On it goes through the ``Skeptical Capitalist,'' the ``Patronizing  Voice of Reason,'' the ``Confused Time Traveler,'' the ``Concerned  Hipster,'' and believe it or not, here is a real beauty--the ``Dog  Typing on a Keyboard.'' You can pay FTI to send somebody real behind a  fake persona to go interfere anonymously in somebody else's  conversation--in this case, claiming a dog typing on a keyboard. ``The  dog typing on a keyboard chimes in with very poor grammar, spelling,  and punctuation, and posts frequently to clutter up the thread and make  it very hard to read''--basically packing the debate with so much  nonsense that everybody has to tune out.   These are actually services offered to the fossil fuel industry  clients that they pay for. They pay to disrupt legitimate internet  debate using phony, paid-for personas that come in occupying these  characteristics, I guess you would call them. It is unbelievably  disgusting behavior for any corporation to engage in, which is probably  why they hide the money.   You may ask, why? Why on Earth would fossil fuel companies spend big  money on all this fancy, fake activity--from phony Astroturf groups to  fake attack campaigns, to the dog typing on the keyboard? Why would the  fossil fuel industry go through all these complex, phony schemes? Won't  they ultimately get caught?   Well, the answer is simple, and it is a number--$650 billion. Six  hundred and fifty billion dollars is the subsidy for fossil fuel in the  United States of America every year. Every year, $650 billion. Another  year, another $650 billion, according to the International Monetary  Fund, which is kind of a technical bean counter organization that is  not an environmental group by any stretch.   So let's say you are getting that $650 billion subsidy every year.  Even if all this fakery ends up exposed, if in the meantime you have  disrupted the opposition and kept your business scheme going, you have  reaped another year of multi-hundred-billion-dollar subsidies.   I mention in this web of denial the identity-laundering group called  Donors Trust, and I will come back to them right now because I have  called them out over and over.   Donors Trust just put a letter to the editor into my home State  newspaper to assure its readers that Donors Trust is just as pure as  the driven snow. Of all the newspapers in the world, Donors Trust just  happened to pick mine. I appreciate the attention. But let's get the  facts straight because here is Donors Trust, right in the middle of the  web of denial. It has been called ``the dark-money ATM of the right,''  behind ``the right's assault on labor unions, climate scientists,  public schools, [and] economic regulations.'' It has been called ``the  Right's favorite dark-money conduit, [which] allows the identities of  wealthy conservative donors to stay hidden.'' It has been called  ``Donors Trust, the Right-Wing Secret Money Machine.'' And it is smack  in the middle of this dirty, dark fossil fuel web that has propagated  and funded the lie--the lie of climate denial.   From FTI and all of its schemes and its typing dogs to Donors Trust,  the sleaze and the scale of the fossil fuel scheming is itself a signal  of the mischief afoot. You don't put up a phony-baloney operation of  this magnitude unless you have some real nasty stuff that you are  trying to defend and mislead people about. Well, for $650 billion a  year, you can crank up a lot of sleazy mischief.   Here in Congress, we can't keep dancing to the tune of this crowd. We  still don't know which party will control this Chamber next year, but  we do know that the Senate is out of excuses on climate change. It is  time for a strong climate bill that can be signed into law by a new  President, swept into office with the most votes in history on a strong  commitment to climate action.   It is on us. It is on us whether this web of denial will hold us back  or whether we will break free at last of its corrupting influence and  do, for once--for once--our duty instead of its bidding.   I yield the floor.
