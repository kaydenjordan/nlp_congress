 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Democratic Caucus, I  offer a privileged resolution and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows                                H. Res. 669         Resolved, That the following named Member be and is hereby       elected to the following standing committee of the House of       Representatives:        (1) Committee on the Judiciary.--Mrs. Demings.    The resolution was agreed to.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, a revote--a revote--within less than 24  hours of original passage. This proves that this bill is rotten to its  core.   But here is what the Republicans aren't going to fix:   They didn't fix the fact that this bill won't provide economic  security to hardworking families.   They didn't fix the fact that this bill will subsidize mansions for  the wealthy, not renters or first-time home buyers.   They didn't fix the fact that it won't help families save for  education or their retirement.   They didn't fix the fact that it will saddle our grandchildren with  $2 trillion of debt.   Mr. Speaker, this bill is not an investment in hardworking men and  women or Americans. In fact, it rips healthcare from 13 million  Americans. It is an investment in the GOP's base--corporate special  interests--the wealthiest among the wealthiest, and the entire Trump  empire. This bill is a political calculation they think will get them a  win on election day.   But be warned: Americans are fed up and fired up. They know their  cronies are laughing all the way to the bank. But the American people  are organizing all the way to November.
