 Madam Speaker, this should not be a partisan  vote. This is a vote about America. It is a vote about our democracy  and our oath to the Constitution.   We all took an oath to protect the Constitution against all enemies,  foreign and domestic. We all know that what President Trump did was  wrong. We all know it is wrong to withhold foreign aid for a political  favor. We know it is wrong to ignore congressional subpoenas. We know  it is wrong to default to silly partisan and process arguments rather  than to rise and defend this beautiful, but all too fragile, democracy.   When those in elected power abuse their position for personal  advantage, it is on us to somberly uphold and defend the responsibility  that the Founders bestowed on us.   So, when my colleague talks about partisanship, I would remind him of  those great words of Lincoln. I am paraphrasing him slightly:   When one party would inflame partisanship rather than let the Nation  survive, I am proud to be the party that would accept partisanship  rather than let the Nation perish.   So in this moment the answer is clear, not because we want to impeach  but because we must.   So, Madam Speaker, when you vote in a few hours, don't vote your  party; vote your character. That is how you are going to be judged, and  that is how we are all going to be judged.
