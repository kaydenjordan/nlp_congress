 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to say  no to this outrageous tax bill and do what is right for the American  people.   This bill gives more riches to the richest Republican donors, at the  expense of middle class families and the poorest. This bill does what  the American people already said no to, which is, it dismantles the  Affordable Care Act. It throws 13 million Americans off of their  healthcare and increases premiums for millions more.   This tax bill eliminates most of the State and local tax deduction  and shortchanges so many communities across the Nation, slashing  education funding by as much as $152 billion over the next decade.   This tax heist runs up the deficit by $1 trillion to $1.5 trillion  and triggers automatic spending cuts to Medicare, Medicaid, and  services that children and seniors depend on.   This tax scam gives 80 percent of the benefits to the top 1 percent.  That is a war on any idea of opportunity and income equality in this  country. It is not tax reform, and I urge a ``no'' vote.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today with a heavy heart. Yesterday,  my home State and my home district suffered a great tragedy. Amtrak  Cascades 501, traveling from Seattle to Portland, Oregon, carrying 80  passengers and seven crewmembers, derailed near Olympia, Washington.   Early reports are that at least three passengers have died and nearly  100 people needed hospital care. My heart and prayers go out to all  those families as they deal with this tragedy.   Our office stands ready to help any constituents in any way that we  can. For up-to-date information, friends and family on Amtrak Cascades  501 can also call 1-800-523-9101.   I also want to thank our first responders for their skill and their  courage. This could have been far worse without them.   But as Amtrak, the National Transportation Safety Board, and State  and local officials help on the scene, there are still so many  questions, like: Why was the train going 50 miles over the speed limit  as it rounded the curve? Why was the train not using positive train  control technology to slow the train down? How, Mr. Speaker, can we be  sure that this never happens again?   Mr. Speaker, I will do everything I can to ensure that the  investigation and our affected families have the resources and the  support necessary to get the facts in the coming days and months.                            ____________________
