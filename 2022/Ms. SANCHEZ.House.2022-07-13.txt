 Mr. Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my amendment which would require  the Department of Defense and the VA take steps to investigate and  mitigate the spread of disinformation within their ranks.   Bad actors are taking advantage of new technologies to effectively  manipulate the public, spreading false information faster and further  than ever before. Extremists are trying to blur the line between fact  and fiction, which undermines confidence in reliable sources of  information. The result is more polarization and less trust in our  government.   This ultimately makes it easier for violent groups to recruit  individuals, including servicemembers and veterans, to their causes.   We saw the devastating effects of disinformation in this very Chamber  on January 6 of 2021. I will never forget sitting on the floor of my  office in the dark, a baseball bat in my hand, hoping that I would live  to see my son grow up.   Insurrectionists, motivated by disinformation, stormed the heart of  American democracy. Over 80 of those charged in relation to January 6  had some form of military service.   America's military is not immune to the rising tide of extremism, nor  is it immune to disinformation and conspiracy theories. Experts have  shown that extremist groups target active military and veterans for  recruitment.   We must act before it is too late. We must remain vigilant to the  weaponization of disinformation that aims to polarize our society,  create division, and damage trust in our institutions.   If left unchecked, the reckless spread of disinformation poses an  existential threat to our democracy. I urge all my colleagues to  support this amendment and the underlying package.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1845     Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Beyer), my colleague on the Ways and Means Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close.   Mr. Speaker, this amendment is simple. It simply asks for a report  evaluating the spread of disinformation within the military ranks and  how that can be mitigated.   Respecting our troops and our veterans means protecting them from  exploitation and from manipulation by bad actors such as Russian  trolls.   Disinformation and propaganda not only create divisions in our  society, they exploit vulnerabilities that already exist. This is a  direct threat to our national security because it undermines trust and  confidence within the ranks.   We must do more to reach out to all members of society, especially  those who are most vulnerable to propaganda. Defending our democracy  and bolstering our societal resilience requires it.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support this amendment and  the underlying package.   In the face of what we have seen, the problems that disinformation  and misinformation can cause, those who choose to willfully ignore it  and not prepare for it are contributing to the potential violence.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
