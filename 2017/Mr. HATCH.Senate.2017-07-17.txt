 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, I rise today in support of the nomination  of Mr. Patrick Shanahan to be Deputy Secretary of Defense.   The Department of Defense is going through historic changes in its  organizational structure. These much needed changes are thanks to the  chairman of the Armed Services Committee and his unwavering commitment  to strengthening our Nation's security and ensuring that American  taxpayers get the best return on their investment. We should all  applaud the chairman for his efforts.   But even as we make these reforms, we should also heed the lessons of  the past. History shows us that the Department of Defense runs best  under a Secretary who is a strong policy leader and a Deputy Secretary  who is a dynamic business manager. The most obvious example of this  preferred structure was when David Packard, the former CEO of the  Hewlett-Packard corporation, was confirmed as Deputy Secretary of  Defense. Thanks to Deputy Secretary Packard's considerable business  acumen, his term in office is still regarded as the model of effective  management at the Department of Defense.   That leads us to today and our once-in-a-generation opportunity to  replicate this efficiency and success at the Department of Defense. The  pieces are now in place. Chairman McCain has provided the statutory  catalyst, and I am sorry he has had some difficulty healthwise over the  last few days. We can't wait to get him back. Secretary Mattis is a  brilliant thinker and a master strategist who is providing the critical  leadership we need during this period of uncertainty, and today he is  seeking to replicate the Packard model by choosing as his Deputy a man  of proven business and management skill.   I understand that things could have gone a bit better during Mr.  Shanahan's confirmation hearing, but I believe we all should remember  that Mr. Shanahan has not been nominated for a position in public  affairs--far from it. He has been nominated to be a strong manager who  can increase the effectiveness and efficiency of the Department of  Defense. In this role, I believe Mr. Shanahan will excel. I think  everybody who knows him believes that.   Currently, Mr. Shanahan is a senior vice president at the Boeing  corporation, where he has been responsible for designing and producing  some of the world's most complex machines. For example, when the Boeing  Company's latest aircraft, the 787, was experiencing developmental  difficulties, Mr. Shanahan was one of the key leaders tasked to solve  these issues, earning himself the nickname ``Mr. Fix-it.''   As further evidence of his leadership, I was particularly impressed  with one of Mr. Shanahan's written answers to the Armed Services  Committee's questions. He wrote:         In my three decades of experience, I have developed and       practiced a formula to create change at scale in large,       complex organizations. I believe leadership is essential to       changing the status-quo--setting a compelling vision,       establishing ambitious goals and realistic intermediate       objectives, and converting strategy into action.    Is that not exactly the type of person we want to be managing and  reforming the Department of Defense? I personally think it is.   Finally, I believe Mr. Shanahan's most important credential is that  he is Secretary Mattis's choice to be the Deputy Secretary of Defense.  I firmly believe Secretary Mattis will be remembered as one of our  Nation's premier national security leaders. The Secretary does not fool  around. He demands the best in himself and those around him. If  Secretary Mattis wants Mr. Shanahan, then I believe the Senate should  speed his confirmation so the good work can continue.   If confirmed, I look forward to working with Mr. Shanahan, especially  to ensure that the Department of Defense maintains our current  statutory requirements regarding our defense logistics capabilities. I  strongly believe Mr. Shanahan will play a critical role in leading the  Department of Defense to a new era of effectiveness and efficiency.    I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.    Mr. President, I have one request for a committee to meet  during today's session of the Senate. It has the approval of the  Majority and Minority leaders.   Pursuant to Rule XXVI, paragraph 5(a), of the Standing Rules of the  Senate, the following committee is authorized to meet during today's  session of the Senate:                        COMMITTEE ON FOREIGN RELATIONS    The Committee on Foreign Relations is authorized to meet during the  session of the Senate on Monday, July 17, 2017 at 5 p.m., to hold a  hearing entitled ``A Review of the State Department Reauthorization  Bill for FY 2018 and the State Department Reorganization Plans.''                            ____________________
