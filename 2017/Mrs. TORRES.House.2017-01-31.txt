 Mr. Speaker, this is what a refugee looks like, and I  ask unanimous consent to bring up H.R. 724, which would rescind  President Trump's refugee ban and help unify the family of an Iraqi  refugee who is now separated indefinitely from her husband and children  because of the ban.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. As previously announced, that unanimous  consent request cannot be entertained.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida.  [[Page H768]]
