 Mr. President, I wish to honor my constituent, Dr.  Nancy L. Spruill, who will be retiring this year after more than 47  years of service to our country.   Since 1999, Dr. Spruill has served as Director of Acquisition,  Resources and Analysis for the Under Secretary of Defense for  Acquisition and Sustainment. In this capacity, she is responsible for  all aspects of A&S's participation in the Planning, Programming, and  Budgeting and Execution System, the congressional process, and the  Defense Acquisition System.   Dr. Spruill serves as the Executive Secretary to the Defense  Acquisition Board and is responsible for the timely submission to  Congress of reports for Major Defense Acquisition Programs. She  performs systematic analysis to improve acquisition policy and  education and leads the Department in developing plans to manage  property, plant and equipment, inventory, operating material, supplies/ deferred maintenance, and environmental liabilities. She also manages a  broad portfolio of information technology applications and  infrastructure supporting the mission of the organization. Dr. Spruill  has played a key role in improving the way the Department acquires  major automated information systems. A strong advocate of improving the  acquisition workforce, she works closely with the Defense Acquisition  University and the rest of the Department in leading and training the  thousands of personnel performing cost analysis and financial  management for acquisition programs to improve acquisition outcomes.   Dr. Spruill graduated with a bachelor of science degree from the  University of Maryland in 1971. She joined the Center for Naval  Analyses from 1971-83. In 1975, she earned a master of arts in  mathematical statistics from George Washington University, followed by  a doctorate in 1980. Dr. Spruill served on the staff of the Office of  the Secretary of Defense from 1983, first as senior planning,  programming, and budget analyst in the Manpower, Reserve Affairs, and  Logistics Secretariat, and then as Director of Support and Liaison for  the Assistant Secretary for Force Management and Personnel and Senior  Operations Research Analyst for the Assistant Secretary for Program  Analysis and Evaluation.   In 1993, Dr. Spruill served as Chief of the Programs and Analysis  Division for the Comptroller of the Defense Mapping Agency. She also  served as Acting Deputy Comptroller and was a member of the Reinvention  Task Force for the Vice President's National Performance Review.   Dr. Spruill has received many prestigious awards, including the  Department of Defense Medal for Distinguished Civilian Service, the  Hammer Award, the Acker Skill in Communications Award, and numerous  awards of the Secretary of Defense Medal for Meritorious Civilian  Service, the Secretary of Defense Medal for Exceptional Civilian  Service, and the Presidential Rank Award. A member of the Senior  Executive Service since 1995, she has published many papers on her work  for the statistical community and the public. Her expertise on these  important issues has been invaluable.   I ask my colleagues to join me in thanking Dr. Spruill for her  distinguished service to our country and in wishing her a fulfilling  and enjoyable retirement.                            ____________________
