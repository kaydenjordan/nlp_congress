 Mr. Speaker, I urge Republicans to join Democrats in  fighting inflation.   First, let's acknowledge that pandemic-related disruptions to the  global supply chain and to consumer demand have driven up the price of  goods. We solve this by vaccinating more people here and around the  world, restoring confidence to high-contact service industries, and  ending this pandemic for good.   Second, let's help businesses hire. A shrunken workforce exacerbates  inflation by constraining supply. There are 27 million hidden workers:  Parents who took time off, neurodiverse individuals, the formerly  incarcerated, and people without a college degree.   Passing the Build Back Better Act will unlock registered  apprenticeships, industry-aligned career pathways, and other proven job  training programs.   Republicans may have good ideas, too, like reducing occupational  licensing requirements. They should come join the debate in good faith  instead of scoring political points off of inflation.   Finally, let's hold the Fed accountable to its target of 2 percent  inflation. Both parties in Congress should hold the Fed to account to  reduce asset purchases and reestablish its credibility on price  stability.   Let's build on the bipartisan infrastructure deal to offer bipartisan  inflation solutions.                            ____________________
