 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I rise in support of this bipartisan  amendment.   This amendment is very simple. It states that: ``None of the funds  made available by this act may be used to transfer cluster munitions to  any foreign country.''   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Lee), my friend on the other side of the aisle.    Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from California.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Nevada (Ms. Titus), my friend on the other side of the aisle.    Mr. Chair, over the past year, our country has been  engaged in a proxy war with Russia. We are on a path to a hot war where  we will be directly involved if we don't change that path now. It is  shortsighted to use cluster bombs there, to transfer those munitions.  It will represent an escalation in the war that could draw us further  into that conflict.   I agree with my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. It is a  good idea not to transfer these to any other country.   Now, some have said to me, on previous amendments here on the floor,  that they think we shouldn't be limiting our military.   I want to be clear. This amendment does not limit our own military.  What it says is we will not transfer these munitions to other  countries. I think that is wise, and it is the prudent thing to do. We  shouldn't be providing them to any other country, certainly not under  the guise of world peace, because they last, as my colleagues have  said, for years and years in many cases.   Mr. Chair, I urge adoption of this amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.
