 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Ernst). Without objection, it is so  ordered.    Madam President, I know we are all glad to be back in  Washington, DC, at work after a few days back home, and I know many of  us are eager to continue our work to rescue the American people from  the failures of the Affordable Care Act, otherwise known as ObamaCare.   The failures of ObamaCare are well documented, and while they don't  necessarily apply to everyone, particular individuals and small  businesses in the so-called individual market have seen a meltdown of  the insurance exchanges. The Presiding Officer in her home State of  Iowa, I know, has had insurance companies pulling out to the point  where people can't even find an insurance carrier who will sell a  policy that qualifies under the Affordable Care Act. That is because  the Affordable Care Act was, unfortunately, a partisan exercise and a  Big Government experiment that has failed.   All you have to do is look at the promises that were made at the time  that ObamaCare was being sold back in 2009 and 2010. The President  himself said that if you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor.  Well, that proved to be not true. He said that if you liked your  policy, you can keep your policy. Well, that proved not to be true as  well because people saw their policies canceled because they couldn't  qualify under the new requirements of the Affordable Care Act.   Perhaps the thing that stung the most was the fact that the President  said back in 2009 and 2010 that an average family of four would see a  reduction in their health insurance premiums by an average of $2,500.  Well, what we have seen since 2013 is a 105-percent increase in  insurance premiums under the Affordable Care Act, and so instead of  seeing a cut in their out-of-pocket costs of $2,500, what people have  experienced--families of four--is an insurance premium increase of  $3,000. Now, some people may be able to absorb that cost, but most  people I know cannot. What it has meant is, they have had to  reprioritize their spending so they have less to spend on other things  in their life.   We do know, based on the promises made at the time the Affordable  Care Act was being sold to the American people, that it has been a  failed experiment. So the question is, What are we going to do about  it? What are we going to tell the folks in Iowa who can't find an  insurance policy or an insurance company who is willing to sell them an  insurance policy on the individual market? What are we going to tell  people in Texas who have seen their premiums go up by 105 percent since  2013 and have been priced out of the market or who found that the only  policy they can afford is one with deductibles that are so high that  basically they are denied the benefit of their insurance at all? What  are we going to do about it?   A number of my colleagues have noted that even if Hillary Clinton  were elected President of the United States, we would still have to be  revisiting the failures of the Affordable Care Act because the failures  are all too obvious and public and can't be denied, but despite that,  and acknowledging many of ObamaCare's failings, many of our friends  across the aisle--in fact, all of them so far in the Senate--have made  clear they want nothing to do with providing any help or any aid to the  people who are being hurt by the failures of ObamaCare. They don't want  to lift a finger to help the people who can't find insurance, who can't  afford it, and the policies they are forced to buy limit them in a way  that they simply have decided to opt out.   So instead of working together with us--you would think they would do  [[Page S3877]]  that. It would just be a logical thing to do because their constituents  are the ones who are being hurt, in many instances. Instead, they have  fought us tooth and toenail to preserve the broken status quo in  healthcare that has failed so many people across the country, and they  have made dubious claims about our efforts to address the problem to  the best of our ability.   It reminds me of the old saying: Don't let the facts get in the way  of a good story. Our friends across the aisle have simply washed their  hands of any responsibility, even though they are the ones who passed  the Affordable Care Act and created this failed experiment and put so  many people in distress. Now they are in the process of attacking those  of us who are trying to help people who are hurting, rather than  lending a helping hand and working together with us in a bipartisan  way.   Let me talk just a minute about Medicaid because this is one of the  big attacks that is being made by our Democratic colleagues on our  efforts to try to salvage healthcare for people who are hurt by the  failures of the Affordable Care Act. Much of the conversation has  revolved around Medicaid and rightly so.   In my home State, 4.7 million folks currently rely on Medicaid. It is  an important safety net program for people who are in low-income  status--so for poorer folks. For those Americans, I want to make sure  they understand, notwithstanding all the scare tactics, Medicaid is not  going away.   Now, one of the common refrains is that Medicaid spending is slashed  in the Better Care Act, but the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office  estimates that Medicaid spending will grow by $74 billion over 10  years. So when they have talked about it being cut, it actually grows  by $71 billion over 4 years.   I would also point out there are some who think the current rate of  spending on Medicaid can go forward unabated without any changes, and  that is simply not true. We know that according to the Congressional  Research Service, Medicaid spending across the country totaled $494  billion in 2014. I guess that was the last year for which full  statistics were available--$494 billion. If we do nothing to check the  rate of growth of Medicaid spending, in 2023, it will be $835 billion.  So you go from $494 billion to $835 billion. We simply cannot keep up  with that pace of spending.   Many of us--the Presiding Officer being one of them--are concerned  about cuts in our military, which is the one thing the Federal  Government has to do because nobody else can do it. Right now, we have  seen, during the last administration, cuts of about 20 percent in our  defense spending.   Well, when you have runaway spending in entitlement programs like  Medicaid, where nobody is placed on a budget and forced to spend wisely  and efficiently, essentially by forcing the Federal Government to spend  $835 billion for Medicaid spending alone, that is going to crowd out a  lot of other meritorious and important spending, including for defense  spending as well.   So we need to make sure Medicaid is there but that Medicaid is put on  a responsible budget that grows year after year. In fact, during the  life of this particular bill, over the next 10 years, it will go up $71  billion.   Here is another thing. Our friends across the aisle act like Medicaid  is the very best program to come down the pike. Well, it is not, and  there are a number of reasons for that. One is that Medicaid recipients  don't always get the quality of care or the access to care we would  hope for. That is because the States, which set the rate of  reimbursement of doctors for Medicare beneficiaries, set it so low that  it is roughly half the amount that is reimbursed based on private  insurance. That is the reason why, in 2000, 67 percent of Texas  physicians accepted new Medicaid patients. Today, it is 31 percent. So  if you are on Medicaid, there is a two-thirds chance you will not be  able to find a doctor to see you as a Medicaid beneficiary.   What we have done, instead, in the Better Care Act--particularly for  the single adult population between 100 percent and 135 percent of the  Federal poverty level--is, we said we will give you a refundable tax  credit you can use to buy private insurance. Private insurance is  highly preferable to Medicaid because, for one thing, it reimburses  physicians at a higher rate and gives people greater access to  physicians, hospitals, and greater quality of care. In my State alone,  in the State of Texas, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, as  many as 600,000 new low-income Texans will benefit from the provisions  of the Better Care Act. It will help qualify them for a tax credit not  available to them under ObamaCare.   Simply throwing money at Medicaid will not help people at all. We  need to reform Medicaid and make it more efficient. Frankly, one of the  things I did back when we were debating the Affordable Care Act in the  Senate Finance Committee, I actually filed an amendment that said  Members of Congress would go on Medicaid. Well, it failed, but the  point I was trying to make is that if Members of Congress were on  Medicaid, we would fix Medicaid. Right now, it is substandard  healthcare for the reasons I mentioned. Two-thirds of the doctors in my  State alone refuse to see a new Medicaid patient because it pays them  so far under the standard of private insurance or even Medicare.   By providing low-income Americans access to private insurance instead  of Medicaid, we can assist those who were previously left out of the  healthcare market and will now be able to purchase a plan of their  choice perhaps for the first time. Unless we act, we are going to  continue to see skyrocketing premiums and deductibles and lost  coverage.    The American people were told time and time again that under  ObamaCare costs would go down and they would be able to keep their  doctor, which has proven not to be the case.   I mentioned before on the floor of the Senate that in my previous  life as attorney general of Texas, we had something called the Consumer  Protection Division, and if some business made false claims about a  service or product to the American people when it came to their  healthcare, the U.S. Government would take them to court and we would  win because it is simply a deceptive trade practice in that context. It  is deception. It is deceit. Unfortunately, the American people were  bamboozled by promises that were not kept.   We also know that about $1 trillion in ObamaCare taxes--new taxes  that were imposed to pay for ObamaCare--have ultimately been saddled on  American families with higher costs for healthcare. When ObamaCare was  passed and all these new taxes were passed, my friends across the aisle  acted as though they would simply be absorbed by somebody, but we all  know that simple economics means that ultimately the consumers are the  people who actually pay the tab. They are the ones who end up paying  the taxes.   Some of our colleagues on the other side recognized the destructive  nature of the Affordable Care Act tax scheme. For example, five  Democratic Senators, including my colleagues from Minnesota, voted to  repeal the medical device tax just 2 years ago. The medical device tax  was a draconian form of taxation. It wasn't based on income--in other  words, where you could deduct your expenses and just pay taxes on your  net income--it was a gross receipts tax. In other words, it said in  effect that everything you have earned before you deduct your costs of  doing business is going to be taxed at a given rate, and that was true  of the medical device tax.   Perversely, a tax on medical devices meant not only did the jobs to  produce those medical devices move offshore, in the case of one Texas- based company, they moved their business essentially to Costa Rica in  order to avoid the taxes because they simply couldn't afford to pay  them and stay in business and keep the jobs they had.   It was also a tax on innovation, and that is the reason we saw a  bipartisan response to repeal the medical device tax just 2 years ago,  because this tax has chased away jobs and innovation in the medical  sector and saddled consumers with higher costs.   By repealing those taxes in the Better Care Act, we not only will  lower the bill at the pharmacy or the doctor's office, but we encourage  competition, and that is common sense and ultimately benefits  consumers.   Our plan also protects consumers from government mandates requiring  [[Page S3878]]  them to buy insurance that they don't want and can't afford. This way,  families can choose what works best for them, free from the penalties  by the government. Some individuals may choose to go with no plan at  all.   The dirty little secret about the Affordable Care Act is that it  can't work without a government mandate that you buy government- approved health insurance or else you pay a penalty. I can't think of  any other instance where the government says ``You do what we say, or  we are going to punish you and penalize you,'' as the Affordable Care  Act does.   Even with the individual mandate and this threat of a penalty, we  know that about 28 million Americans are currently not covered by  insurance. Many of them are covered by so-called hardship exceptions.  About 6.5 million of them just pay the penalty because it is cheaper to  pay the penalty than it is to buy the insurance because the prices are  so high.   When some of the critics say that without this economic gun to the  head of a penalty, people will choose not to buy insurance for  themselves, that is a choice they will make as Americans. We believe in  freedom of choice, and when the marketplace provides a product that  they believe adds value at a price they can afford, that is when  consumers buy a product or a service. But they shouldn't have to do it  because the government forces them to do so and penalizes them if they  don't. The Better Care Act gives people the ability, free from a  government mandate, to choose not to buy something they don't want. The  Washington-forced mandates are gone.   The nonpartisan budget office has estimated that under our plan,  average premiums will decrease by nearly one-third in 3 years.   These are some of the important facts we need to be debating, not the  misrepresentations that unfortunately seem to fill the void.   I have shared multiple stories from my constituents back home in the  last few weeks on the floor, and I plan to keep doing that as we  continue our work on this legislation. The stories that I and my  colleagues have heard are what have inspired me and motivated me from  the beginning of this entire process. In fact, it is our job to  represent our constituents. I would encourage all of our colleagues to  listen to their own States and to share the trials of their  constituents as well because the status quo is simply unacceptable. The  Democratic leader has said as much. He said that if we set aside the  Better Care Act and are actually interested in helping ``fix''  ObamaCare, they are willing to do that. But do you know what that is?  Basically, what that represents is a huge, multimillion-dollar bailout  of insurance companies without any other reform. That is what our  Democratic colleagues are supporting by their failure to engage with us  in making sure there are reforms in addition to the other things that  we do.   The other alternative plan--you might ask: Well, if Obamacare didn't  work as was advertised--which it clearly hasn't--and something needs to  be done, what does that something look like?   In the case of our friend the Senator from Vermont, Mr. Bernie  Sanders, he said: I have an idea. Let's just make the Federal  Government provide insurance coverage for everybody, single-payer.   Well, that is simply a solution we can't afford when we look at the  tradeoffs. It would essentially supplant all the private insurance that  people get from their employers and require incredible increases in  taxes in order to do that across the board. So I don't think that is an  alternative our friends across the aisle want to support. They love the  mandate, they love penalizing free American citizens when they don't  purchase a product the government mandates, but they are not going to  defend that. They are not going to defend that. They certainly won't  advocate, at least openly here on the floor, for a single-payer system.   We saw one committee of the legislature in California recently vote  out a single-payer system. This was just one committee, I think, in one  house. The estimated cost of a single-payer system in California alone  was double the annual budget of the entire State. You can imagine what  the numbers would be here at the national level.   Like any piece of legislation, our draft bill can be strengthened,  and we would invite anyone in good faith who is interested in  strengthening the bill to work with us to do so. We are going to  continue to talk and listen and exchange ideas on how we can continue  to make improvements, but in the end, the choice is clear: You either  ultimately support ObamaCare and the status quo, or you are willing to  try to work with us to produce something better that provides more  affordable healthcare from the doctor and healthcare provider of your  choice. That is simply the choice people are going to have. A ``no''  vote against the alternative is simply a vote for the status quo for  ObamaCare, and we know where that is going to lead--it is going to lead  with a big, multibillion-dollar bailout of insurance companies without  any reform. That is what our Democratic colleagues are hoping for if we  are unsuccessful. But we think there is a better way to approach this,  one that brings down cost and maintains choices and the freedom of  choice for the individual consumer.   We will continue to plow ahead with or without their help because we  think it is our duty to do so, and we have confidence that, working  together, we can come up with a better care plan that suits the needs  of Americans when it comes to their healthcare.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.    The following Senators are necessarily absent: the  Senator from Alaska (Ms. Murkowski), the Senator from Ohio (Mr.  Portman), the Senator from Alaska (Mr. Sullivan), and the Senator from  North Carolina (Mr. Tillis).   Further, if present and voting, the Senator from North Carolina (Mr.  Tillis) would have voted ``yea'' and the Senator from Alaska (Ms.  Murkowski) would have voted ``yea.''    The following Senators are necessarily absent: the  Senator from Alaska (Ms. Murkowski), the Senator from Ohio (Mr.  Portman), and the Senator from Alaska (Mr. Sullivan).   Further, if present and voting, the Senator from Alaska (Ms.  Murkowski) would have voted ``yea.''   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lankford).
