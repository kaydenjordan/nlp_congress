 Madam Speaker, I rise to congratulate  Wanda K. Brown on her inauguration as president of the American Library  Association, the oldest and largest library association in the world.   Ms. Brown has an exemplary record as the director of library services  at Winston-Salem State University's C.G. O'Kelly Library in North  Carolina's Fifth Congressional District. She also served as associate  dean of the Z. Smith Reynolds Library at Wake Forest University.   During her tenure as president of the North Carolina Library  Association, Ms. Brown received many national awards recognizing her  leadership in numerous library organizations, including the Black  Caucus of the American Library Association. Ms. Brown's presidency of  the American Library Association is the culmination of an extraordinary  career in librarianship.   I wish Ms. Brown the best in her new endeavors to expand valuable  library services in America and around the world, and I know that the  ALA is in great hands.                            ____________________
