 Mr. Speaker, my friends on the other side of the aisle  made a number of arguments about how, if everyone has a concealed  weapon, America will be safer.   Mr. Speaker, I have two studies here which directly rebut that:   A 2017 Stanford University study found that in States that adopted  the most permissive concealed carry laws, violent crime is 13 to 15  percent higher than it would have been had the State retained a more  restrictive law;   A 2017 study by researchers at Boston University found that States  with shall-issue laws had a 10.6 percent higher handgun homicide rate,  consistent with the results of the Stanford study.   Both of those empirical studies disprove the claim that we make  America safer if everyone carries a hidden, loaded firearm.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   We just heard some of our other colleagues on the other side of the  aisle speak about the God-given right to apparently carry a concealed,  loaded firearm across State lines. What about the God-given right to  live, to stay alive, and to be free from gun violence in this country?  [[Page H9698]]    We now have seen the two deadliest shootings in American history, 20  children slaughtered 5 years ago at Sandy Hook, and the list goes on  and on.   Our Republican colleagues will do nothing about it. They won't pass  universal background checks. They won't pass no fly, no buy to keep  terrorists from being able to buy a gun. They won't prevent bump  stocks. But they are finally rising up to do something, and what is  their answer? Let everyone in America carry a concealed, loaded  firearm. Even people who are violent criminals, stalkers, and domestic  abusers can carry a concealed firearm.   Make no mistake about it. This legislation allows someone to go  online. You don't have to be a resident of the State, a State that has  no protections. You don't have to have training. You could be a  criminal. You can go online and you get a permit in that State. You  don't have to be a resident. You only have to go there, and you can  then travel America with a loaded, concealed firearm and overrule the  will of the people of that State through their legislature to impose  responsible limitations on it.                                time  1530    It also endangers police officers who can be sued for having the  audacity to ask someone if they actually have a permit and detain them.  They have a cause of action against the police officer and attorneys'  fees--unprecedented.   This is the response to a country that is pleading for responsible  gun safety legislation, that is living with the carnage of gun violence  and asking this Congress: Do something about it; protect us from this  violence.   Our Republican colleagues muster up the courage to pay homage to the  NRA and make it easier to sell guns so that people can carry concealed  loaded firearms all across this country.   Shame on you. Shame on you. You have a responsibility to work with us  to protect our constituents from gun violence and to enact sensible gun  safety legislation that will reduce the incidents of gun violence. This  will make it worse.   The claim that somehow it makes it safer is refuted by all of the  empirical evidence. You know it is. Shame on the Republicans.
