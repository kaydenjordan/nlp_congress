 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor schools  from Georgia's First Congressional District--Lyman Hall Elementary,  Midway Middle School, and Savannah Arts Academy--for winning the  regional Helen Ruffin Reading Bowl competition in Valdosta.   With their hard-fought victory, they now move on to compete in  divisional competition in Statesboro on March 7. The competition  started more than 30 years ago when Helen Ruffin, a librarian from  Georgia, wanted to find a way to make reading more exciting for  students at her school.   The Reading Bowl gained traction, and now it is a statewide  tournament. In the competition, participants from each school answer  questions prepared by the committee for points. Teams of students that  answer the most questions correctly about certain award-winning  children's books win the competition.   These three schools from the First Congressional District of Georgia  beat over 40 teams to make it to the next level. I am proud we have  this degree of passion for reading in Georgia, and I am thankful these  schools are working hard to teach their students the value of reading.   Madam Speaker, I congratulate them on their accomplishments this  year, and best of luck to them in Statesboro at divisional competition.                            ____________________
