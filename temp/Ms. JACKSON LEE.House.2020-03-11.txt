 Madam Speaker, as a senior member of the Judiciary  Committee, I am delighted to be able to join our Republican colleagues  and Democratic colleagues and those of us who have advocated for a  progressive mindset as it relates to civil liberties in this country in  support of the reauthorization of the USA FREEDOM Act.   With that backdrop, however, I want to say to my good friend, he  knows that the inspector general's report indicated that there was no  political motive to the beginning of the investigation. And even though  referrals have been made, none of the individuals he mentioned have  been criminally prosecuted.   That is behind us, to a certain extent, but it is a good backdrop to  make sure that anything we do, no matter who the individuals are, that  we do it with the impeccable credentials of the Constitution, civil  liberties, civil justice, and equality.   That is why I rise to support this legislation, although I know that  a more detailed review might have warranted some additional fixes.   But I think it is important to take note that we do have the  prohibition of the government from using section 215 to collect any  records that would require a warrant if the information being assessed  was for law enforcement purposes.   We are trying to contain and constrain. The bill requires the  government to provide notice to individuals whose information is  collected pursuant to 215, and it strengthens First Amendment  protections by requiring the FISA court and the Foreign Intelligence  Surveillance Court of Review to appoint an amicus curiae in any  instance where an application by the government presents significant  concerns about impinging on the First Amendment.   The bill also strengthens the amicus curiae's ability to protect  privacy in civil liberties cases. As well, it directs the Privacy and  Civil Liberties Oversight Board to conduct a study of the way the  government's use of FISA authorities may be premised.   The bill improves transparency. The bill strengthens reporting  requirements. It strengthens, as I said, the Privacy and Civil  Liberties Oversight Board.   In further debates right after 9/11, I worked on a number of  legislative initiatives, including one bill in 2013, the FISA Court and  Sunshine Act, bipartisan legislation that provided much-needed  transparency without compromising national security to the decisions,  orders, and opinions of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.   That language is in this bill, the opportunity to review those  decisions and for those decisions to be able to be reviewed as well.   I am a longstanding supporter of the USA FREEDOM Act, particularly  because section 301 of that bill, which is not in this bill, has  protections against reversed targeting.                                time  1530    Each moment that we have an opportunity to provide security for this  Nation we also have the equal opportunity of infringing on the civil  liberties of our fellow citizens. It is important today to stand on  this floor and say to the American people that we do believe in their  constitutional rights and the Bill of Rights. This legislation is to  further contain those infringements and to protect the rights of our  citizens.   Madam Speaker, I want my colleagues to support this legislation.   Madam Speaker, as a senior member of the Judiciary Committee and as  an original co-sponsor of the USA Freedom Act, which stands for  ``Uniting and Strengthening America by Fulfilling Rights and Ending  Eavesdropping, Dragnet-collection, and Online Monitoring Act'', I rise  in support of the ``USA Freedom Reauthorization Act of 2020.''   I support the USA Freedom Reauthorization Act of 2020 for several  reasons:   1. The bill continues to prohibit the NSA from collecting bulk phone  records. By doing so, the government no longer has the authority to  collect large amounts of call detail records on an ongoing basis. The  Call Detail Records program not only resulted in the over-collection of  records that the NSA did not have authority to receive but also  resulted in several technical problems.   2. The USA Freedom Reauthorization Act prohibits the government from  using Section 215 to collect any records that would require a warrant  if the information being accessed were for law enforcement purposes.  This provision ensures that Section 215 can keep pace with future  developments in the law as courts interpret Carpenter v. United States  and apply it to other contexts.   3. The bill requires the government to provide notice to individuals  whose information is collected pursuant to Section 215 if the  government plans to use that information, or any information derived  from it, in a criminal case or other legal proceeding.   4. The USA Freedom Reauthorization Act strengthens First Amendment  Protections by requiring the FISC and the Foreign Intelligence  Surveillance Court of Review to appoint an amicus curia in any instance  where an application by the government presents significant concerns  about impinging on the First Amendment activities of Americans.   5. The bill contains other measures to strengthen amici curiae's  ability to protect privacy in civil liberties in cases to which they  are appointed.   6. The USA Freedom Reauthorization Act directs the Privacy and Civil  Liberties Oversight Board to conduct a study of the way the  government's use of FISA authorities may be premised on or may impact  protected classes, including based on race, ethnicity, national origin,  religion, or sex.   7. The bill improves transparency by requiring the declassification  of significant FISC and FISC-R opinions within 180 days.   8. The USA Freedom Reauthorization Act strengthens the reporting  requirement for Section 702 queries by eliminating an existing  exemption for the FBI.   9. The bill strengthens the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight  Board (PCLOB) by allowing members to be reappointed to consecutive  terms and to continue serving after their terms have expired, should  they so choose.   The USA Freedom Act was first passed in 2015 as the House's unified  response to the unauthorized disclosures and subsequent publication in  the media in June 2013, regarding the National Security Agency's  collection from Verizon of the phone records of all of its American  customers, which was authorized by the FISA Court pursuant to Section  215 of the Patriot Act.  [[Page H1630]]    Public reaction to the news of this massive and secret data gathering  operation was swift and negative.   There was justifiable concern on the part of the public and a large  percentage of the Members of this body that the extent and scale of  this NSA data collection operation, which exceeded by orders of  magnitude anything previously authorized or contemplated, may  constitute an unwarranted invasion of privacy and threat to the civil  liberties of American citizens.   To quell the growing controversy, the Director of National  Intelligence declassified and released limited information about this  program. According to the DNI, the information acquired under this  program did not include the content of any communications or the  identity of any subscriber.   The DNI stated that ``the only type of information acquired under the  Court's order is telephony meta data, such as telephone numbers dialed  and length of calls.''   The assurance given by the DNI, to put it mildly, was not very  reassuring.   In response, many Members of Congress, including then Ranking Member  Conyers, Mr. Sensenbrenner, and myself, introduced legislation in  response to the disclosures to ensure that the law and the practices of  the executive branch reflect the intent of Congress in passing the USA  Patriot Act and subsequent amendments.   For example, I introduced H.R. 2440, the ``FISA Court in the Sunshine  Act of 2013,'' bipartisan legislation, that provided much needed  transparency without compromising national security to the decisions,  orders, and opinions of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court or  ``FISA Court.''   Specifically, my bill required the Attorney General to disclose each  decision, order, or opinion of a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance  Court (FISC), allowing Americans to know how broad of a legal authority  the government is claiming under the PATRIOT ACT and Foreign  Intelligence Surveillance Act to conduct the surveillance needed to  keep Americans safe.   These requirements were then incorporated in substantial fl part in  the USA Freedom Act, which required the Attorney General to conduct a  declassification review of each decision, order, or opinion of the FISA  court that included a significant construction or interpretation of law  and to submit a report to Congress within 45 days.   As I indicated, perhaps the most important reasons for supporting  passage of the USA Freedom Reauthorization Act is the prohibition on  domestic bulk collection, as well as its enhanced First Amendment  protections, both of which seek to protect American citizens from the  NSA' s abuse of power through unlawful collection of personal data.   I was also a longstanding supporter of the USA Freedom Act,  particularly because Section 301 of the bill contained protections  against ``reverse targeting,'' which became law when an earlier Jackson  Lee Amendment was included in H.R. 3773, the RESTORE Act of 2007.   ``Reverse targeting,'' a concept well known to members of this  Committee but not so well understood by those less steeped in the  arcana of electronic surveillance, is the practice where the government  targets foreigners without a warrant while its actual purpose is to  collect information on certain U.S. persons.   One of the main concerns of libertarians and classical conservatives,  as well as progressives and civil liberties organizations, in giving  expanded authority to the executive branch was the temptation for  national security agencies to engage in reverse targeting may be  difficult to resist in the absence of strong safeguards to prevent it.   The Jackson Lee Amendment, preserved in Section 301 of the USA  Freedom Act, reduced even further any such temptation to resort to  reverse targeting by making any information concerning a United States  person obtained improperly inadmissible in any federal, state, or local  judicial, legal, executive, or administrative proceeding.   Madam Speaker, I noted in an op-ed published way back in October  2007, that as Alexis DeTocqueville, the most astute student of American  democracy, observed nearly two centuries ago, the reason democracies  invariably prevail in any military conflict is because democracy is the  governmental form that best rewards and encourages those traits that  are indispensable to success: initiative, innovation, courage, and a  love of justice.   I support the USA Freedom Reauthorization Act of 2020 because it will  help keep us true to the Bill of Rights and strikes the proper balance  between cherished liberties and smart security.   I urge my colleagues to support the USA Freedom Reauthorization Act.
