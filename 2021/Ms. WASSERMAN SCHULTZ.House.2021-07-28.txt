 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for  yielding, and I congratulate the gentlewoman on presenting her first  bill as a cardinal on the Appropriations Committee. This is a long time  coming, and it is a pleasure to work with her.   The bill invests in health and upholds American global values abroad.   The fiscal year 2022 State-Foreign Operations appropriations bill, in  a historic move, removes the Helms amendment, which has prohibited safe  abortions and healthcare services for poor and vulnerable women in low- income countries for decades. That is a significant decision and one  that enables access to healthcare for millions of women across the  globe.   I am pleased that this bill includes language to support countries,  like Colombia, who have welcomed Venezuelans fleeing the humanitarian  crisis. It also funds prodemocracy and human rights programs in  Venezuela, as well as in Cuba. This funding is critical to ensure  access to broadcasting and the internet in Cuba. These platforms will  provide support to the Cuban people as they struggle for freedom and  true self-governance.   Finally, this bill continues support for the critical U.S.-Israel  partnership by fully funding U.S. security assistance to Israel and  cooperative missile defense programs. Ensuring that Israel maintains  her qualitative military edge is essential for stability in the Middle  East and our own national security.   I truly thank Chairwoman Lee for working closely with me and others  on this bill.   As we always say in the Appropriations Committee, Mr. Speaker, the  spending decisions that we make are an expression of our values. This  bill telegraphs that expression of our values, of America's values, and  the strengths that we have, at the same time providing us the ability  to provide assistance to millions of vulnerable people across the  globe. I am proud to support it and to work with Chairwoman Lee going  forward so we can see it become law.
