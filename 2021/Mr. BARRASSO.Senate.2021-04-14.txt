 Madam President, I come to join my colleague from  Florida, former Governor and now U.S. Senator, and talk about the Save  Democracy Act and the issues that are facing our Nation today, and I  want to  [[Page S1927]]  do that because over the past several weeks, Democrats, the media,  their corporate allies have been misleading the American people about  our voting laws.   Democrats have been pushing a false narrative all around the country,  trying to scare Americans into pushing and pressuring Congress into  passing a Federal election takeover.   Federal election laws and State election laws, as guided by our  Constitution, say that it is States that should be making the decisions  about how we run our elections at home. But what you see coming out of  the Democrats in their H.R. 1--that is called S. 1--is a law that  changes things dramatically and takes decisions out of the folks at  home in Wyoming and puts them in the hands of folks in Washington, DC.  People in Wyoming, as I talked to them the last 2 weeks, don't want  anything to do with that.   Now, Democrats have this listed as their No. 1 priority bill for the  year; otherwise, why would they have listed it as No. 1? Not  coronavirus, not pandemic, not infrastructure--no, taking elections  away from the States, putting them in the hands of Washington.   The bill is over 800 pages long. Virtually every page would, I  believe, make it easier to cheat. That is not what the American people  want. They want to make it easier to vote and harder to cheat.   The bill, H.R. 1, now S. 1, expands ballot harvesting, which is where  paid political operatives, unsupervised, can go door to door, nursing  home bed to nursing home bed, picking up people's ballots and deciding  which ballots to turn in and which ballots to destroy.   The bill would register people automatically when they sign up for  Medicaid or assistance in other forms from the government. It would  force taxpayers to fund political campaigns and political operatives.  Paying for campaign ads, your tax dollars would go for that and things  that--a candidacy you are not for, and you would be paying for their  ads and their computer time and their web pages and their yard signs.  People in Wyoming don't want that.   When I describe each one of these to the people of Wyoming, they say:  Don't let that happen to America.   I think many Democrats haven't read the 800 pages, and I know if the  American people read the 800 pages, they would be just as upset as the  people in Wyoming who have heard what is in the bill.   The American people want security in elections. We want integrity,  accountability, transparency in how it all works, and that is why I am  so proud to be here and supporting Senator Scott and cosponsoring,  along with Senator Hyde-Smith and Senator Lummis, a bill that gives  confidence to people in elections, because our bill--overall bill bans  voter harvesting. It says no to automatic registration. It requires at  least a Social Security number to register to vote. Under our bill, you  could still vote by mail, as people have done year after year in  Wyoming--done it very successfully. You just need to request a ballot,  say your information is up-to-date, and then you get the ballot in the  mail--basic commonsense measures to protect against fraud and against  error.   So the differences between what we propose and what the Democrats  propose could not be more clear. I believe the Democrat bill makes it  easier to commit fraud; the Republican bill makes it harder to commit  fraud.   If the Democrat bill were good, they wouldn't need to use scare  tactics, which they have been using all across the country, and  wouldn't need to spread false information.   So the people of Wyoming tell me they want elections to be fair. They  want them to be free from voter fraud. They want it to be easier to  vote, as I said, harder to cheat, and just basically using an  identification card or a means to identify yourself when you go to vote  would make common sense. That is what we do in Wyoming, and it should  be continued to be allowed so when someone shows up to vote, they can  just confirm that they are who they say they are.   And that is why I am proud to stand here today with Senator Scott and  support him on the floor   I yield the floor.    Madam President, I come to the floor today to oppose  the Democrats' latest liberal spending spree. Just over a month ago,  Democrats put $2 trillion onto America's credit card. They said it was  for coronavirus. That was false advertising, and that is because only  $1 out of every $11 in the $2 trillion being spent was actually going  to public health.   The bill turned out to be a big payoff to the people who run the  Democratic Party: the union bosses, the DC bureaucrats, and the  bankrupt blue States. Democrats crammed the bill through the Senate  with just 50 votes. Democrats haven't even finished their victory lap.   Yet, at this time, they want another $2.3 trillion. They have already  told us they are going to cram it through with just 50 votes, once  again, and, once again, they are using more false advertising.   President Biden calls this an infrastructure bill. Well, that is a  new definition of the word ``infrastructure.'' Only about $1 out of  every $20 would go to roads and bridges.   Now, here are just a few other items that the Democrats call  infrastructure: $100 billion for so-called workforce development and  over $300 billion on housing and upgrading of Federal buildings-- Federal buildings--the ones we work in. It includes $100 billion for  something called the greening of schools, which, when you go through  and see what does that include, it includes making greener lunches. It  includes eliminating paper products in the cafeterias and making the  cafeteria trays that people use to carry their food, makes each one of  those into trays that can be recycled.   Call it what you will, this is not infrastructure. The largest  spending part of the bill is $400 billion to expand Medicaid. The list  goes on and on. That is just the tip of the iceberg.   Now, some of the spending in the overall bill may have merit. That  spending should go through regular order, going through committees and  coming to the floor of the Senate for amendments and then votes.   But it is still not infrastructure. This isn't an infrastructure  bill. Even the White House Press Secretary admitted it. She said this.  She said it is partly infrastructure--partly infrastructure.   Now, the bill includes another big payoff to the union bosses because  it forces long-term healthcare facilities to unionize if they want to  receive the funding in the bill. There is Medicaid expansion. That  would hurt States like Wyoming and others that protect and believe in  the right to work.   The bill would also hurt Wyoming because of its attack on American  energy. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has compared the bill  to the Green New Deal. One Democratic Senator admitted it. He said it  is a way of accomplishing many of the goals of the Green New Deal.   Out of all the payoffs in the bill, one of the biggest goes to the  electric car industry. The bill would spend more money on electric cars  than it does on roads, bridges, ports, airports, and waterways  combined--an astonishing amount of money.   President Biden announced the bill in one of America's greatest  energy-producing regions, which is Western Pennsylvania. Yet energy- producing States like Pennsylvania and Wyoming have a lot to lose from  this bill.   The bill would spend $10 billion on something called the Civilian  Climate Corps. These are taxpayer-funded activists who would advance  environmental justice. That is what it says: $10 billion to Civilian  Climate Corps to advance environmental justice.   And then there is another $35 billion on climate innovation and $27  billion in clean energy and sustainability accelerator. It just seems  that they are throwing money and names onto things. These are slush  funds. They are going to give government bureaucrats more power to pick  winners and losers in our economy.   We all remember the disaster called Solyndra. It was a Silicon Valley  startup. The last time Joe Biden was in the White House, his  administration, along with Barack Obama, gave them $500 million-- taxpayer dollars--for so-called clean energy. We later found out that  Solyndra lied on their loan application form, and, apparently, no one  in  [[Page S1931]]  the administration caught it. The company went bankrupt--500 million  taxpayer dollars gone forever.   President Biden is bringing back this kind of central planning. It is  all in the name, he says, of green energy. If we pass this bill, I will  tell you that we are going to see another Solyndra and another one  after that and another one after that.   So how are Democrats going to pay for this piece of legislation?  Well, they are going to cram through the largest tax increase of the  century. They are going to use 15 years' worth of tax increases to pay  for 8 years of spending. So the spending is temporary, but the tax  increases will be permanent.   If the bill becomes law, it will be harder for American companies to  compete with companies in other countries, and the concern is that  means more companies are going to move overseas because taxes there  will be lower. When they do, they are going to take good American jobs  with them.   You know, with the Republican tax cuts that we did in 2017, we saw $1  trillion flow back into this country in just 2 years. President Biden  is ready to send all of that money back overseas.   The official name of the bill is the American Jobs Plan. Yet it is  not much of a jobs bill. The jobs this bill would allegedly create  would cost $800,000 each job. It is a lot to pay for a single job when  communities all across the country have outside of their businesses  ``Help wanted'' signs.   I saw one in Afton, WY, last week. A small community in western  Wyoming there is a convenience store, and the sign said:         Your father called. He said you need a job. We're hiring.    There are signs like that all over the country. Small businesses and  small business owners I have talked to continue to say: We cannot find  people to hire. And yet the administration has a jobs plan, they say,  where it is going to cost taxpayers $800,000 for each job to create. At  the same time, the bill is going to eliminate many good-paying energy  jobs, and that is a real concern.   Democrats are cramming this through at a time when our economy is  already recovering. The pandemic is coming to an end. The experts say  we are going to create 11 million more jobs over the next 4 years even  if we don't pass the bill. And there are jobs available today.   One analysis from the Wharton Business School said the bill would  actually slow down the economy. That is because the bill would  discourage businesses from investing. It is not an infrastructure bill,  not much of a jobs bill. It is a slush fund for more liberal spending.  That is what is on the minds of the Democrats who are pushing this bill  forward.   It is not what the United States needs right now. We need real  infrastructure improvements. We need a real infrastructure bill--one  that will build road, bridges, our waterways, and allow us to do things  faster and better and cheaper and smarter. If Democrats want to do  that, Republicans are ready to support it.   Last Congress, I worked with Senator Tom Carper of Delaware on a  bipartisan infrastructure bill in the Senate Environment and Public  Works Committee. I chaired it in the last Congress. Our bill was so  bipartisan that Senator Bernie Sanders voted for it, and so did I. It  passed the committee unanimously, 21 to 0. When we went to work with  Democrats in the House on the legislation, they ignored it and replaced  it with the Green New Deal.   That is what President Biden is doing right now as well. He is  ignoring the bill we passed and trying to sneak the Green New Deal into  law.   So I would urge my Democratic colleagues to reverse course, to throw  out this liberal wish list, this slush fund of liberal spending, and  start over working in a bipartisan way with Republicans.   We should start with a bipartisan bill that the Senate Committee on  EPW passed last year. Instead of paying off the unions and the climate  activists, let's rebuild our roads and our bridges and do it in a way  that works for all Americans.   Thank you.   I yield the floor.
