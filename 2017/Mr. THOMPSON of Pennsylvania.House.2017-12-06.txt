 Mr. Speaker, I rise today as one of the  senior members on the House Education and the Workforce Committee and  co-chair of the Career and Technical Education Caucus to note that this  week is Computer Science Education Week.   Computer science drives job growth and innovation throughout our  economy and throughout our society. Computing occupations are the  number one source of all new wages in the U.S. and make up two-thirds  of all projected new jobs in STEM fields, making computer science one  of the most in-demand college degrees.   Computing is used all around us in virtually every field, but fewer  than half of the United States' schools offer any computer science  courses, and only 8 percent of STEM graduates study it; 93 percent of  parents want their child's school to teach computer science, but only  40 percent of schools teach it; 67 percent of parents and 56 percent of  teachers believe students should be required to learn computer science;  50 percent of Americans rank computer science as one of the two most  important subjects of study after reading and writing.   In the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, there are currently 16,976 open  computing jobs. The average salary for a computing occupation in  Pennsylvania is $85,654, which is significantly higher than the average  salary in the State of $47,540. Mr. Speaker, only 169 schools in  Pennsylvania offered the advanced placement computer science course in  2015-2016, and there are fewer AP exams taken in computer science than  in any other STEM subject area.   But technology connects the world in ways like never before. From  everyday conveniences at our fingertips to improved communications,  technology plays an ever-increasing role in our lives. We are becoming  more dependent on applications or apps, and the students of today will  become the leaders of tomorrow by developing such technology.   Proudly, the House of Representatives has encouraged America's  students to focus on computer science and STEM subjects through the  annual Congressional App Challenge. This competition allows K-12  students from across the country to practice their code writing skills  by developing an app. Winning apps will be displayed in the Capitol  Building later this year.   This year's winner from Pennsylvania's Fifth Congressional District  is Lachlan Campbell. He redesigned the Hack Club website to make it  more user friendly. Hack Club is a nonprofit network of coding clubs  run by high school students around the world. Lachlan started a Hack  Club this past spring at his very own State College Area High School,  and taught more than 40 students how to code and create a website.   His project for the Congressional App Challenge was to redesign  hackclub.com, and his overhaul has been welcomed by the club.   I congratulate Lachlan on winning the Congressional App Challenge for  Pennsylvania's Fifth Congressional District. He is a two-time winner,  having come in first place in 2015 as well. He has got a promising  career ahead of him.   Mr. Speaker, I am so proud of all of the students who participate in  the App Challenge. The competition inspires students from every corner  of the country to explore STEM, coding, and computer science through  hands-on practice, and that is something we can all support.   Happy Computer Science Education Week.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today with a heavy  heart to honor Alfred Earnest Pellow, a resident of Franklin,  Pennsylvania, who passed away last week at his home.   Ernie, as he was called by family and friends, was involved in  founding the Veterans Coalition and the VETS Honor Guard in Franklin.  He was also deeply instrumental in bringing the Veterans Administration  clinic to Franklin to care for our military men and women.   The 79-year-old was a U.S. Army peacetime veteran who served 37  months in Germany. In 1960, he married his wife, Joyce, with whom he  spent 57 years of wedded bliss. He was a family man: a loving husband,  brother, father, and grandfather.   Ernie was a self-employed building contractor. He received the  Pennsylvania Builders of the Year Award in 1996 and Pennsylvania  Builders Distinguished Achievement Award in 2014.   A member of Masonic Blue Lodge and the York Rite, Ernie received his  Masonic 50 year pin in 2015.   Mr. Speaker, Ernie Pellow lived a life of service: service to his  country, service to his community, and service to his family. He will  be sorely missed by all who knew him.                            ____________________
