 Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that H.R. 38, as  amended, includes the Fix NICS Act. I have long supported the National  Instant Criminal Background Check System, or NICS.   NICS is about saving lives and protecting people from harm by  preventing guns from falling into the wrong hands. It does this without  interfering in the timely transfer of firearms to eligible gun buyers.   I was the original cosponsor of the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention  Act of 1993 and worked diligently for its passage. I strongly supported  this bill because it makes sense to prevent convicted felons and  individuals judged to be mentally ill from obtaining guns.   At the time of negotiations, I insisted on the inclusion of the NICS  program. Under this system, firearms dealers use the FBI's NICS system  to cross-reference with a list of known convicted felons, drug users,  illegal aliens, and those convicted of domestic violence.   As I have stated many times, the NICS system is only as good as the  records that are put into it. Too often, people who otherwise would not  pass a background check can slip through the cracks and buy guns.   After the recent shooting in Sutherland Springs, Texas, the U.S. Air  Force disclosed that it had failed to report the gunman's history of  domestic assault to the database, which should have prevented him from  purchasing a firearm in the first place.   This legislation will provide a much-needed push to speed  implementation of the NICS system used in conducting instant background  checks prior to gun purchases. At the Federal level, it would require  Federal agency cooperation and provide relevant records to the Attorney  General for inclusion into the NICS. It holds Federal agencies  accountable if they fail to upload relevant records to the background  check system through public reporting and prohibiting bonus pay for  political appointees.   At the State level, it will incentivize them to make sure that their  reporting is up to date by giving Federal grant preferences to States  which comply.                                time  1500    Mr. Speaker, let me be clear. This bill is not about expanding  background checks. This is about ensuring that the existing law is  working. There is strong bipartisan support for improving what has  become the systemic problem of missing information in the database.  Accurate reporting is essential to ensuring that the system works as  intended.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.
