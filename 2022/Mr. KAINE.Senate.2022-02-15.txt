 Mr. President, by supporting the development of a  workforce trained in in-demand skills, we can accelerate the recovery  of our economy. The Nation's continued progress and the socioeconomic  mobility of our citizens are contingent on the education and skills of  the American workforce and its ability to adjust to and fulfill the  needs of the 21st century economy, especially in the wake of the  coronavirus pandemic and with growing infrastructure needs. Career and  technical education--CTE--programs are vital to every student's  education, providing them access to the important knowledge, skills,  and credentials needed to obtain careers in rapidly growing, high- demand industries. Today, approximately 11 million students across the  Nation are enrolled in CTE programs offered by thousands of career  academies, comprehensive high schools, CTE high schools, community  colleges, and CTE centers. Through applied learning, these students  obtain workplace skills and technical training that mirror in-demand  positions in the workforce.   In the next decade, millions of skilled workers will be needed to  fill infrastructure positions in the United States, including jobs  related to designing, building, and operating transportation, housing,  telecommunication, and utilities facilities. As local governments are  able to invest in projects previously put on hold because of the  pandemic and with the recent passage of the bipartisan Infrastructure  Investment and Jobs Act, there will be even more demand for skilled  workers. CTE programs intentionally match skills with workforce  demands, lowering the probability of high school drop-out and  increasing the likelihood of on-time graduation rates. One study showed  that high school students who were CTE concentrators graduated from  high school, enrolled in postsecondary education, and were employed  full-time at higher rates than their nonconcentrator peers. CTE  concentrators also had a higher median income 8 years after graduation.  These CTE programs will help fill the estimated 30 million U.S. jobs  available with an average annual income of $55,000 that do not require  a bachelor's degree yet necessitate some level of postsecondary  education.   In 2018, Congress affirmed the importance of CTE by passing the  Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act,  which supports CTE programs in secondary and postsecondary education.  We also need to ensure we continue reskilling and upskilling workers by  supporting workforce development programs.   Today, with my Senate CTE Caucus cochairs Senator Portman, Senator  Baldwin, and Senator Young and more than two-thirds of my Senate  colleagues, I am pleased to again introduce a bipartisan resolution to  designate February as Career and Technical Education--CTE--Month. CTE  Month encourages students, parents, counselors, educators, and school  leaders to learn more about the diverse educational opportunities  offered in their communities and recognize the valuable role of CTE in  developing a well-educated and highly skilled workforce in the United  States. By formally recognizing CTE Month through this resolution, we  hope to bring greater awareness to improving access to high-quality  career and technical education for millions of America's students and  our Nation's ongoing economic competitiveness.                                 S. Res. 517
