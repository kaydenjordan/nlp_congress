 Mr. President, it is no secret that I am strongly  opposed to this disastrous, unfair, and destructive piece of  legislation that we are debating today that will give massive tax  breaks to the wealthiest people in our country, to the most profitable  corporations, and to billionaire campaign contributors.   What really concerns me is that we are debating, as everybody  acknowledges, a very complicated and confusing piece of legislation  that is over 500 pages long. Here we are a few hours before we are  going to be voting on this legislation, and nobody has seen it. Nobody  even knows what is in this legislation. It is probably being written as  we speak right now. That is not a very effective or intelligent way to  deal with legislation that impacts every American and trillions of  dollars.   One of the concerns I have as we look at this bill is that there are  provisions in it that nobody really understands in terms of whom it  impacts and whom it benefits. As one example, buried in this  legislation, on page 503, section 14504, is a paragraph entitled  ``Modification to Source Rules Involving Possessions.'' That is the  title of that section. What does that mean? As best we can understand,  it means that if you are a hedge fund manager who is a resident  [[Page S7659]]  of the Virgin Islands, you will be able to get a major tax break on  capital gains and a 90-percent reduction in tax liability on your  income.   It has been estimated that corporations and the wealthy are avoiding  over $100 billion each and every year by stashing their cash in the  Caribbean and other offshore tax havens. It appears that this provision  will make a bad situation even worse. In adding insult to injury, it  appears that this provision may help only a handful of wealthy hedge  fund managers who have claimed residency in the Virgin Islands. It has  been estimated that this provision alone--one provision in a 500-plus  page bill--will cost over $600 million in lost revenue in the next  decade--$600 million in lost revenue when we have a $20 trillion debt  and 40 million people who are living in poverty.    Now, I see no Republican Senators on the floor, but I am sure that  staff is watching this discussion. I have a question that I would like  to discuss with Senator Wyden but, more importantly, with some of our  Republican colleagues.   What I would like to ask my Republican colleagues is whether there  has been a hearing on the need to provide tax breaks to wealthy hedge  fund managers who have established residency in the Caribbean.   I would say to my friend from Oregon that there are a lot of problems  facing our country--a declining middle class, 40 million people living  in poverty, 28 million people having no health insurance. I am not  aware that one of the great crises facing this country is the need to  provide tax breaks to wealthy hedge fund managers who have established  residency in the Caribbean. It may be one of those great national  crises that I have missed, but I don't quite perceive it as being an  issue that the American people seem to be deeply concerned about.   I hope that my Republican colleagues--maybe Senator Hatch or others-- will come to the floor and tell us who this provision benefits. Are we  talking about one hedge fund manager? Are we talking about two? Are we  talking about three hedge fund managers who are going to divvy up some  $600 million in tax breaks over the next decade?   I ask my colleague from Oregon, who is the ranking member of the  Senate Finance Committee, his thoughts on the issue.    I thank the Senator very much.   I would just say, according to a number of independent studies,  despite what President Trump and the Republican leadership are saying,  the overwhelming bulk of the tax benefits in this legislation goes to  the top 1 percent. I believe the number is 62 percent that goes to the  top 1 percent.    You have 62 percent of the benefits going to the top 1  percent. Meanwhile, by the end of the decade, my good friend, Senator  Wyden from Oregon, there is no question but that tens of millions of  middle-class Americans will be paying more in taxes; is that correct?    So here we have a nation today that has a grotesque  level of income and wealth inequality--worse than at any time since the  late 1920s. The top one-tenth of 1 percent now owns almost as much  wealth as the bottom 90 percent, and 62 percent of all new income is  going to the top 1 percent. The Republicans' solution is to make this  grotesque inequality even worse by giving 62 percent of the tax  benefits to the top 1 percent.   I want to get back to this one point. I suspect that when you rush a  bill of this magnitude through the U.S. Senate when there have been  virtually no hearings, no experts, no real ability to have significant  debate and discussion at the committee level, what you are going to  find the day after this bill is passed are absolutely outrageous  provisions.   I suspect--I don't know, and I would like my Republican colleagues to  help us here; I cannot verify because we don't have the information-- that on page 503, section 14504, there is a provision that will provide  $600 million in tax breaks over a 10-year period that will end up in  the pockets of a handful of Wall Street hedge fund managers. That is  what I suspect. Maybe I am wrong. Therefore, I hope that some of the  Republicans who put this provision in the bill will tell us how this is  going to benefit the people of the United States or the Virgin Islands  or anyplace else.   Again, I am speaking to the ranking member of the Senate Finance  Committee, who knows something about this.   Is this an issue, Senator Wyden, that has been discussed for 1  minute?    Let me make two points as I wind down here.   One, yesterday, I challenged my Republican colleagues, after this  bill is passed, to tell us and tell the American people that when they  rack up a deficit of $1.4 trillion, they are not going to  [[Page S7660]]  come back and cut Social Security, Medicaid, Medicare, education,  nutrition.   Tell the American people that you are not going to balance the budget  and compensate for your huge tax breaks to the rich and large  corporations by going after the middle class and working class of this  country.   I challenged my Republican colleagues yesterday to come to the floor  and tell the American people that they would not do that. They have not  responded to that challenge.   The second challenge today is to tell us what is in section 14504,  page 503. This is a provision that would provide $600 million in tax  breaks to my Republican colleagues. Who is going to get those tax  breaks? We believe--and tell us if we are wrong; maybe we are--that we  are talking about a handful of hedge fund managers. Who are they? How  many of them are there?   I would ask, respectfully, that Senator Hatch or any other Republican  come down to the floor and tell us who benefits from section 14504.    I will.    I will.    Absolutely. That is absolutely what they will do. They  will talk about saving Social Security; they will talk about  entitlement reform. What they mean is cutting Social Security, cutting  Medicare, and cutting Medicaid.   As the Senator has indicated, it is not some kind of an abstract,  theoretical idea. That is what Speaker Ryan is already talking about.  More to the point, that is exactly what was in the budget that was  passed here several months ago.    I will.    I will.    I will.    I will.    I will.    Mr. President, let me conclude my remarks.   I would urge my Republican colleagues to come down to the floor of  the Senate and explain to the American people what section 14504 is  about and who benefits from some $600 million in tax breaks over a 10- year period. Is it two hedge fund managers? Is it five hedge fund  managers? What is it?   That is my request, and I hope we can get a response to that quick  question as quickly as possible.   With that, I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.    Mr. President, as I think about what is going on here  today, I think this is in many ways a historic day, a day that  historians will look back on--December 1, 2017--and they will conclude  that today is the day of one of the great robberies, of criminal  activities, if you like, in the modern history of this country. The  Federal Treasury is being looted tonight. As we speak, there are  lobbyists all over Capitol Hill, writing down in handwriting,  amendments to this bill to give hundreds of millions, if not billions,  of dollars in tax breaks to large corporations. As we speak, they are  probably still writing those amendments.   Meanwhile, this Senate, this Republican-led Senate has been unable to  reauthorize the CHIP program, the health insurance program for low- income children. They didn't have enough time to do that. We have been  unable to reauthorize the Community Health Center Program, providing 27  million people with health insurance. We don't have the time to do  that. But tonight we are presumably going to pass legislation when, at  a time of massive income and wealth inequality, 62 percent of the tax  benefits go to the top 1 percent, and 10 years from now, millions and  millions of middle-class Americans will be paying more in taxes.   I have not the slightest doubt, as I have said before, that after the  Republicans pass this huge tax giveaway to the wealthy and large  corporations, they will be back on the floor of the Senate, and when  they come back, they will say: Oh, my goodness, the deficit is too  high. We have to cut Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, education,  and nutritional programs. In other words, in order to give tax breaks  to billionaires and to launch profitable corporations, they are going  to cut programs for the elderly, the children, the working families of  this country, and the poor. This legislation will go down in history as  one of the worst, most unfair pieces of legislation ever passed.   I say to my Republican colleagues, as you saw on November 7, the  American people are catching on. They are demanding a government that  does not simply work for corporate lobbyists but works for the middle  class. They are demanding a tax system that says to the wealthy and  large corporations: You are going to start paying your fair share of  taxes, and, no, we are not going to cut Social Security; we are going  to expand Social Security. We are not going to cut Medicare; we are  going to move to a ``Medicare for all'' healthcare system. The American  people are catching on.   While Republicans may get away with this act of looting tonight,  history is not on their side. The day will come, and it will come  sooner rather than later, when we are going to have a government here  that represents all of us, not just the Koch brothers, not just the  billionaire class, not just wealthy campaign contributors.   I yield.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.    Madam President, could we have order, please?   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.   The Senator from Vermont.    Madam President, could we have order, please?   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.   The Senator from Vermont.    Thank you.   Madam President, tonight is chapter 1 of the Republican Party Koch  brothers plan.   Tonight, the Republicans provide $1 trillion in tax breaks to the  wealthiest people in this country and to the largest corporations,  while raising the deficit by over $1.4 trillion.   Part 2 of their plan--probably coming in a few months--will be to  call for massive cuts to Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid in  order to pay for their tax breaks to the rich. For those of us who  don't want to cut these vitally important programs that the American  people have paid for, this amendment establishes a 67-vote threshold to  make those cuts.   If you don't want to cut Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid to  give tax breaks to millionaires, support this amendment.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.    I would just say that I would be delighted to gut and  destroy this legislation, but pursuant to section 904 of the  Congressional Budget Act of 1974--I am sorry.    Pursuant to section 904 of the Congressional Budget Act  of 1974, I move to waive all applicable sections of that act for  purposes of the pending amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?   There appears to be a sufficient second.   The question is on agreeing to the motion.   The clerk will call the roll.   The legislative clerk called the roll.   The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 46, nays 54, as follows:                        [Rollcall Vote No. 294 Leg.]                                  YEAS--46       Baldwin      Bennet      Blumenthal      Booker      Brown      Cantwell      Cardin      Casey      Collins      Coons      Cortez Masto      Donnelly      Duckworth      Feinstein      Franken      Gillibrand      Harris      Hassan      Heinrich      Heitkamp      Hirono      Kaine      King      Klobuchar      Leahy      Manchin      Markey      McCaskill      Menendez      Merkley      Murphy      Murray      Nelson      Peters      Reed      Sanders      Schatz      Schumer      Shaheen      Stabenow      Tester      Udall      Van Hollen      Warren      Whitehouse      Wyden                                  NAYS--54       Alexander      Barrasso      Blunt      Boozman      Burr      Capito      Carper      Cassidy      Cochran      Corker      Cornyn      Cotton      Crapo      Cruz      Daines      Durbin      Enzi      Ernst      Fischer      Flake      Gardner      Graham      Grassley      Hatch      Heller      Hoeven      Inhofe      Isakson      Johnson      Kennedy      Lankford      Lee      McCain      McConnell      Moran      Murkowski      Paul      Perdue      Portman      Risch      Roberts      Rounds      Rubio      Sasse      Scott      Shelby      Strange      Sullivan      Thune      Tillis      Toomey      Warner      Wicker      Young   The PRESIDING OFFICER. On this vote, the yeas are 46, the nays are  54.   Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not having voted  in the affirmative, the motion is rejected.   The point of order is sustained and the amendment falls.                              Amendment No. 1854    There will now be 2 minutes of debate, equally divided, prior to a  vote on the Brown amendment No. 1854.   The Senator from Ohio.    Mr. President, I would like to enter into the  Congressional Record the scores produced by the Congressional Budget  Office for section 20001 as it appears in Senate amendment 1618; and  the score of section 20001 as it appears in Senate amendment 1855.   In Senate amendment 1618, CBO estimates that opening the coastal  plain for oil and gas leasing and managing ``it in accordance with  requirements of the Naval Petroleum Reserves Production Act of 1976  (including regulations)'' will result in net Federal receipts of $1092  million from 2018 through 2027.   In Senate amendment 1855, CBO estimates that managing lease sales  ``in a manner similar to the administration of leases under the Naval  Petroleum Reserves Production Act of 1976 (including regulations)''  will result in net  [[Page S7710]]  Federal receipts of $910 million from 2018 through 2027, a decrease of  $182 million compared to the language in Senate amendment 1618.   I ask unanimous consent that the following CBO tables be printed in  the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                        Congressional Budget Office,                                                   U.S. Congress,                                   Washington, DC, November 8, 2017.      Hon. Lisa Murkowski,      Chairman, Committee on Energy,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.        Dear Madam Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has       prepared the enclosed cost estimate for a Legislative       Proposal Related to the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.        If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be       pleased to provide them. The CBO staff contact is Jeff       LaFave.            Sincerely,                                              Keith Hall, Director.        Enclosure.   A Legislative Proposal Related to the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge  As posted on the website of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural                  Resources (FLO17783) on November 8, 2017                                   SUMMARY         The legislation would direct the Secretary of the Interior       to implement an oil and gas leasing program for the coastal       plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR). Based on       information provided by the Department of the Interior (DOI),       the Energy Information Administration (EIA), and individuals       working in the oil and gas industry, CBO estimates that       implementing the legislation would increase net offsetting       receipts, which are treated as reductions in direct spending,       by about $1.1 billion over the 2018-2027 period.        Because enacting the legislation would affect direct       spending pay-as-you-go procedures apply. Enacting the       legislation would not affect revenues.        CBO estimates that enacting legislation would not increase       net direct spending or on-budget deficits in any of the four       consecutive 10-year periods beginning in 2028.        The legislation contains no intergovernmental or private-      sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform       Act (UMRA).                   ESTIMATED COST TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT         The estimated budgetary impact of the legislation is shown       in the following table. The costs of this legislation fall       within budget functions 300 (natural resources and       environment) and 800 (general government).  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                                             By fiscal year, in millions of dollars--                                        -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                          2018    2019    2020    2021     2022      2023      2024      2025      2026      2027    2018-2022  2018-2027 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                              DECREASES IN DIRECT SPENDING a Estimated Budget Authority............       0       0       0       0      -725         *         *      -366        -1        -1       -725     -1,092 Estimated Outlays.....................       0       0       0       0      -725         *         *      -366        -1        -1       -725     -1,092 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Components may not sum to totals because of rounding; * = between -$500,000 and zero. a CBO estimates that implementing the legislation also would cost about $10 million over the 2018-2022 period, assuming the availability of appropriated   funds, for environmental reviews and the administrative costs of conducting the lease sales.                             BASIS OF ESTIMATE         For this estimate, CBO assumes that the legislation will be       enacted near the end of 2017 and that the funds necessary to       implement the legislation would be available.      Description of the Legislation        The legislation would direct the Secretary of the Interior       to implement an oil and gas leasing program for lands located       within the coastal plain of ANWR, which includes about 1.5       million acres of federal land on the northeast coast of       Alaska. Under current law, activities related to oil and gas       leasing in ANWR are prohibited.        The legislation would require the Secretary to hold two       lease sales over a seven-year period following enactment and       to offer at least 400,000 acres of land in ANWR for lease at       each sale. Any lease sales in ANWR would be carried out in       accordance with procedures used to conduct oil and gas       leasing within the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska. For       each lease awarded, lessees would pay the federal government       bonus bids to acquire the leases, annual rent to retain the       leases, and royalties based on the value of any oil or gas       production from the leases. The legislation would establish a       16.67 percent royalty on oil and gas produced in ANWR. (Under       current law, the federal government charges royalties of 12.5       percent for oil and gas produced onshore and 18.75 percent       for oil and gas produced in the Outer Continental Shelf.)       Finally, under the legislation, Alaska would receive one-half       of the gross proceeds generated from the leasing program.      Spending Subject to Appropriation        CBO estimates that implementing the legislation would cost       $10 million over the 2018.2022 period for environmental       reviews and administrative costs associated with the leasing       program subject to the availability of appropriated funds.       Based on information provided by the Government       Accountability Office, we estimate that completing the       environmental reviews required under the National       Environmental Policy Act would cost $2 million. In addition,       CBO estimates that other implementation costs would total       between $1 million and $2 million per year over that period.      Direct Spending        CBO estimates that implementing the legislation would       increase net offsetting receipts by about $1.1 billion over       the 2018-2027 period.        Bonus Bids. CBO estimates that gross proceeds from bonus       bids paid for the right to develop leases in ANWR would total       $2.2 billion over the 2018-2027 period. That estimate is       based on historical information about oil and gas leasing in       the United States and on information from DOI, EIA, and       individuals working in the oil and gas industry about factors       that affect the amounts that companies are willing to pay to       acquire oil and gas leases. In addition, CBO relied on       estimates prepared by the United States Geological Survey of       the amount of oil that might be produced from the coastal       plain of ANWR. As specified in the legislation, one-half of       all receipts from leases in ANWR would be paid to Alaska,       leaving net federal receipts totaling $1.1 billion over the       2018-2027 period.        Estimates of bonus bids for leases in ANWR are uncertain.       Potential bidders might make assumptions that are different       from CBO's, including assumptions about long-term oil prices,       production costs, the amount of oil and gas resources in       ANWR, and alternative investment opportunities. In       particular, oil companies have other domestic and overseas       investment options that they would evaluate and compare with       potential investments in ANWR. The potential profitability       for a wide range of such global investment options would       probably be a significant factor in prospective bidders'       ultimate choices of how much to bid for ANWR leases. The       number of factors that affect companies' investment decisions       result in a wide range of estimates for bonus bids. CBO's       estimate reflects our best estimate of the midpoint of that       range.        Other Receipts. In addition to receipts from bonus bids,       CBO estimates that the federal government would collect net       receipts from rental payments totaling about $2 million over       the 2022-2027 period. (Lease holders make an annual rental       payment until production begins.) CBO also estimates that the       federal government would receive royalty payments on oil       produced from ANWR leases; however, based on information from       EIA regarding the typical amount of time necessary to drill       exploratory wells, complete production plans, and build the       necessary infrastructure to produce and transport any oil       produced in ANWR, CBO expects that no significant royalty       payments would be made until after 2027.                         PAY-AS-YOU-GO CONSIDERATIONS         The Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010 establishes budget-      reporting and enforcement procedures for legislation       affecting direct spending or revenues.

Portions of the royalties       would be shared with the state under formulas specified by       the legislation and under federal laws governing oil and gas       production. Over the 2018-2027 period, CBO estimates that       Alaska would receive a total of about $1.1 billion in       royalties.              INCREASE IN LONG-TERM DIRECT SPENDING AND DEFICITS         CBO estimates that enacting the legislation would not       increase net direct spending or on-budget deficits in any of       the four consecutive 10-year periods beginning in 2028.
