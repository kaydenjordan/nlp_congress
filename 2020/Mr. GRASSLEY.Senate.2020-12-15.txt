 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 minute  in morning business, please.    Madam President, we are probably all guilty of not  remembering the sacrifices of our men and women in uniform, but  particularly during this time of year, it is especially difficult for  them to be away from friends and family.   Right now, there are almost 1,500 Iowans deployed overseas with the  Iowa National Guard, just as one example of a group we should be  thinking about. And I think about this group because that 1,500  includes 1 member of my own staff.   We rely on our brave men and women in uniform to protect our way of  life, our democracy, and the liberties we cherish. The sacrifices they  make are not taken for granted and won't be forgotten by future  generations. All of our Nation's servicemembers and their families will  be in my prayers and, I hope, the prayers of all of my colleagues  during this holiday season.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Madam President, as we approach the holiday season,  many of us will be celebrating differently. COVID-19 may be limiting  travel, family members we see in person, or other holiday traditions.  Yet there is much to be grateful for.   For me, I am thankful for my health, my family, my country, and my  staff. I am also grateful to serve Iowans and work in the Senate to  tackle legislation, conduct oversight, and work for the best interests  of the people of Iowa.   I am also thankful to reflect upon previous accomplishments. This  time of year coincides with a milestone achievement, that being the  anniversary of the passage of the FIRST STEP Act, and to remember that  the criminal justice reform bill that we call the FIRST STEP Act is the  most comprehensive overhaul of criminal justice legislation in a  generation   On December 18, 2018, the Senate passed the most significant criminal  justice reform legislation in a generation, and 3 days later, President  Trump signed the bill into law. The FIRST  [[Page S7489]]  STEP Act is an example of what the Senate can accomplish when we reach  across the aisle to address our Nation's most pressing problems. I am  proud that the FIRST STEP Act has been the law of the land now for 2  years.   The past 2 years have been uniquely challenging. In the first year of  the law's tenure, I worked with Senate partners to oversee its  implementation efforts. This included meeting with critical  stakeholders in the Justice Department, reviewing the status of the  law's implementation, and ensuring that the law's application reflected  congressional intent.   In that first year, we accomplished a lot together, in a bipartisan  way. Because of the FIRST STEP Act, thousands of inmates received the  benefits of the retroactive application of the Fair Sentencing Act to  resolve sentencing disparities that came about from legislation, I  suppose, from almost 30 years ago between those convicted for crack and  those convicted for cocaine.   In this first year, the Justice Department also released its risk and  needs assessment system--a tool used to individually review the  recidivism risk of each Federal inmate and place the inmate in  programming to prevent future criminal acts. The Bureau of Prisons also  issued procedures for more efficient access and use of the home  confinement program.   Implementation efforts have faced significant challenges, however,  namely, the COVID-19 pandemic. Fortunately, the FIRST STEP Act provided  tools that the administration has been able to use to help vulnerable  inmates. During the pandemic, it has become apparent that inmates who  are confined in Federal prisons are among the most vulnerable  populations in the United States. As they are in Federal custody, it is  quite obvious the Federal Government has a duty to ensure they are  treated humanely.   To that end, Senator Durbin and I urged the increased review of  compassionate release and elderly home detention cases in light of the  COVID-19 cases within our Federal prisons. We also asked the Justice  Department inspector general to review the use of home confinement  authority, the preventative safety measures connected with it, COVID-19  testing, screening, and isolation measures, and the availability of  access by inmates to electronic communication. I am pleased to say that  this administration responded to many of our requests, though more work  needs to be done as we continue to grapple with the effects of COVID-19  in our Federal prisons.   One of the most important issues we must address is a key provision  of the FIRST STEP Act, that being the requirement for the Bureau of  Prisons to make programming available to prisoners to help them to live  productive lives once they leave prison, and that will make it less  likely, then, they will return to lives of crime.   The coronavirus has made it impossible for the Bureau of Prisons, at  least at this time, to provide this programming as the law intends and  requires because, as you know, inmates must be socially distanced from  each other to prevent the virus's spread, which flies in the face of  meeting in person to participate in recidivism reduction programming.  Therefore, as we move forward, balancing effective programming access  with the CDC-approved safety measures is critical.   As I return to the leadership of the Committee on the Judiciary,  whether that is as ranking member or chairman, depending upon the  outcome of the Georgia races, I want everybody to know that I am going  to continue to make the implementation of the FIRST STEP Act a priority  and will ensure the Justice Department and the Bureau of Prisons  faithfully execute the law.   Lastly, as we embark on a new Congress and a new year, I urge my  colleagues on both sides of the aisle to seek the middle ground on  criminal justice reform. We have done it before, and we can do it  again, and more needs to be done.   The FIRST STEP Act has made a difference in the lives of thousands of  prisoners, and it will continue to impact many in the Federal criminal  justice system. It gives prisoners a better opportunity to leave their  criminal pasts behind and become productive members of society. In  fact, we learned that from States like Texas, Mississippi, and North  and South Carolina, where they actually did a good job of preparing  people to return to society, with productive lives, saving the  taxpayers money if there is not recidivism. Some of those States have  even shut down some prisons.   Alerted to that, too often, Congress waits to learn something from  our laboratories of our political system--the States. We learned a lot  that brought about the FIRST STEP Act. There is more that we can learn,  and we can build on the FIRST STEP Act. It is remarkable what we were  able to achieve 2 short years ago. I am hopeful to carry that spirit  into 2021 and beyond, whether I am chairman or ranking member of the  Senate Judiciary Committee      Special Inspector General for Pandemic Recovery Expedited Hiring                          Authorities Act of 2020    Now, Madam President, I have one other short point I would like to  make that deals directly with negotiations going on right now for a  COVID-19 package that we are trying to put together. Some people call  it a stimulus package or something that could be put in the omnibus  appropriations bill.   This goes back to the CARES Act that we passed in March when Congress  authorized the creation of a Special Inspector General for Pandemic  Recovery to oversee the billions of dollars in new Federal spending-- hence, to make sure that those Federal dollars were spent according to  the law. In the past, when Congress created a special inspector general  to fill a sudden need in new government oversight, this Congress  quickly followed with additional legislation to provide the IG with  expedited hiring authority to staff his new offices and also to begin  timely oversight operations. Such timely oversight operations are  particularly needed now because so much of this CARES money that was  appropriated in March has gone out the door.   So, in the tradition of past Congresses setting up other special IGs  to fill a sudden need, I introduced S. 3751, a bipartisan piece of  legislation modeled on past special IG expedited hiring authority  language. My bill provides the IG a short 6-month window to quickly  hire the staff he needs to build his organization and begin carrying  out the oversight mandated by Congress under the CARES Act. However, as  of today, my bill still hasn't passed, and IG Miller has been left to  work with an office that is still highly understaffed.   That is an outcome that should concern everyone here in the Senate if  you are passionate about government oversight and making sure that  money is spent responsibly. Whenever the government spends large sums  of money, as we have in addressing this pandemic, there will always be  bad actors somewhere out there, lying in wait, to test the system to  see how much they can steal. We need a fully staffed and fully  functional IG in place to meet those bad actors head-on to serve as an  effective check on waste, fraud, and abuse.   Despite broad support for my bill from both sides of the aisle, I  have heard rumors that some of my colleagues across the aisle may be  wary of granting expedited hiring authority to the IG simply because  they don't agree with the personal politics of the individual confirmed  for that position. This amounts to an attempt to nullify the IG's  confirmation by limiting his ability to conduct oversight and,  hopefully, to make sure that all of the money that we are spending  under all of these pandemic appropriations we have made is spent  according to the law; hopefully, that implies responsibly spending the  money.   Congress has already made the decision to establish this IG. Now we  need to give the office the resources it needs to succeed. Personal and  political disagreements are not reasons to deny the American people  oversight of how billions of their tax dollars are being spent. Once  the IG hires staff and has the ability to begin the substantive  oversight work mandated by Congress, there will, as always, be an  important place for congressional oversight to ensure the IG is doing  his job.   I intend to conduct the same level of oversight of this IG that I  have for others. I expect my colleagues will do the same.   That is why I urge my colleagues, regardless of any personal  differences that they have, to support this bipartisan legislation  granting expedited  [[Page S7490]]  hiring authority for the Special IG for Pandemic Recovery and included  in the forthcoming COVID legislation.   Now, I have heard rumors within the last hour that there has already  been a decision that they are not going to move ahead on this money for  hiring to get this job. If that is true, I don't want anybody, whether  it is a Republican or a Democrat, to ever complain about something that  comes to light, that the money wasn't spent the way it was intended to  be spent or it was wasted here or wasted there. Don't complain to me.   I yield the floor.
