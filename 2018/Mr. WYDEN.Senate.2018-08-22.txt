 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, what the Trump administration is doing to  sabotage healthcare in our country is a monumental scandal in slow  motion. What the President promised was better care for all Americans  at lower cost. What he and his officials have delivered is special  deals for special interests and rewards for rip-offs.   It is almost as if you took the clock above the Chamber and turned it  back. What Americans want--and I heard it at townhall meetings last  weekend at home in Oregon--is to move forward on healthcare. They want,  for example, to have strong measures, not empty rhetoric, to hold down  the cost of their medicines--lifting the restrictions so that Medicare  can bargain and hold down the cost of medicine and use the smart  principles of negotiating power that the private sector uses all the  time. They want to move forward on healthcare, not backward.   There is no clearer example of the administration's trying to take  the country back on healthcare than its efforts to give a green light  to junk health insurance. Junk health insurance represents all of the  unsavory insurance industry tricks and abuses that the Affordable Care  Act sought to eliminate. Junk plans exist, literally and figuratively,  so that companies can prey on the vulnerable and the people with  preexisting conditions, such as if you have asthma or diabetes, or prey  on women, prey on older people, or prey on the less fortunate. They  certainly don't exist to cover the healthcare that Americans actually  need because that is where they always fall short.   The centerpiece of the Affordable Care Act was an ironclad, loophole- free guarantee that no American would ever face discrimination over a  preexisting condition.   I note that my friend, the President of the Senate, has joined the  Chamber. He knows this pretty well because he worked with me on our  bipartisan effort to ensure that there would be loophole-free, airtight  protection for Americans from discrimination against those with a  preexisting conditions. For all practical purposes, we got what we  worked on in a bipartisan way, when we had eight Democrats and eight  Republicans. We got that into the Affordable Care Act. Essentially, now  what the Trump administration seeks to do is to undo that guarantee of  airtight, loophole-free protection for people who have these  preexisting conditions.   I am going to read a question that appears on an application for one  of these plans that are being marketed now. Under a bold headline that  says ``Important: You must answer the questions below as they apply to  You and all other family members applying for coverage,'' the question  reads: ``Within the past 5 years, have you or any other person to be  insured been aware of, diagnosed, treated by a member of the medical  profession or taken [medication] for: cancer or a tumor, stroke, heart  disorder, heart attack, coronary bypass or stent, peripheral vascular  disease, carotid artery disease, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease  or emphysema, kidney disorder or disease, neurological disorder,  degenerative disc disease or herniation/bulge, rheumatoid arthritis,  degenerative joint disease of the knee or hip, diabetes, Crohn's  disease or ulcerative colitis, bipolar disorder or schizophrenia, any  eating disorder [or] alcohol abuse or chemical dependency, or does  anyone listed on the application currently weigh over 250 pounds  (women) or over 300 pounds (men)?''   Another question on the same application asks, ``Have you or any  other person to be insured been hospitalized for a mental health  condition in the past 5 years or been treated by a member of the  medical profession for a mental health condition in the past 12  months?''   Finally, another question asks, ``Have you or any other person to be  insured ever been diagnosed or treated for Acquired Immune Deficiency  Syndrome (AIDS), AIDS-related complex, or any other immune system  disorder such as HIV?''   I would also note that this part of the application contained a  number of typos, a mislabeled number, and a mislabeled word.  Apparently, the scam artists are as bad at editing their documents as  they are at covering the healthcare people actually need. But setting  aside the bad grammar, the questions collectively tick through dozens  of health categories that include hundreds of various conditions and  illnesses, so we are talking about well more than 100 million Americans  who would answer yes to at least one of them.   Americans need to know and they ought to know that the only reason  junk insurance companies ask these probing questions about your health  background is to use the information against you and keep you from  getting meaningful coverage. That forms the basis of the Trump-era  discrimination against those with a preexisting condition.   A lot of people have preexisting conditions. What is that? Everybody  knows folks in Tennessee or in Oregon who have asthma or diabetes. We  are talking about millions of Americans.   When my colleague from Tennessee and I were working together--eight  Democrats, eight Republicans--I said: You know, it is really going to  be monumental if we get airtight, loophole-free protection for those  with pre-existing conditions. The reason I said that is that ever since  I was director of the senior citizens at home, the Gray Panthers, it  has been clear to me that as long as our country allowed discrimination  against those with preexisting conditions, healthcare in America would  basically be for the healthy and the wealthy. If you are healthy, no  sweat, no preexisting conditions, and if you are wealthy, you have no  real problems because you can just write out the checks to pay for your  treatment. But now we are talking about going back to those days--not  the days when the Senator from Tennessee and I and other Democrats and  Republicans got together and did something that really was a monumental  step forward, protecting millions of people with preexisting  conditions--now we are going backward.   What are those Americans going to hear in their time of need when  their cancer comes back or when they face another bout of medical  illness? What they are going to hear, with policies like the one I just  read from, is the fraudsters who conned them into buying the junk  insurance basically saying: You are on your own. And those Americans  are going to be buried under mountains of medical debt.   By the way, we are talking about medical debt. I think my friend from  Tennessee and I have talked about this over the years. Healthcare is  the great equalizer. For example, in a discussion Democrats ran  yesterday on healthcare, we had a gentleman who did everything right.  He worked hard. He was a professional. He was constantly trying to  better himself and contribute--not just supporting his family but the  community. He got Parkinson's. All of a sudden, he wasn't able to pay  his bills. So healthcare is the great equalizer in America.   When I read about the junk plans, I have to tell you, it takes me  back to the old days when these scam artists preyed on the seniors who  needed insurance coverage above and beyond what they got from  traditional Medicare.   Mr. President and colleagues, this is something that is very personal  to me. When I was a young man, I was codirector of the Oregon Gray  Panthers. I would go and visit seniors in their homes--very often they  would have a small apartment or something--and they would go in the  back, and they would pull out a shoebox full of Medigap policies. These  were policies that insurance salesmen sold them that the salesmen said  would fill in the gaps in Medicare. Frequently, a senior would spend  thousands of dollars--this was a number of years ago--on these policies  that were worth little more than the paper they were written on. They  often contained--we saw this at our legal aid program for seniors--what  were called subrogation clauses, which essentially meant that if you  had another policy that covered it, the first one didn't have to cover  it. The two of them canceled each other out. So vulnerable seniors with  serious medical  [[Page S5813]]  conditions would get conned into buying these plans that were  essentially worthless.   After years of effort--we began in Oregon in the State insurance  commission office. I had the honor of getting elected to represent  Oregon in the U.S. House of Representatives. We began there and  continued it in the Senate. We acted in a bipartisan fashion to  eliminate the junk plans. We did that literally decades ago. We drained  the swamp, to use the lingo of today. We really drained the swamp as it  related to these rip-off Medigap policies. We got it down to a handful.    I would be willing to bet that the Senator from Tennessee, the  Senator from Ohio, and my other colleagues on the floor don't have  folks at home coming up to them any longer and telling them that they  have rip-off Medigap insurance. I haven't had a complaint about that  for years and years. Now the Trump administration is trying to bring  back junk insurance for an even larger portion of the American people-- more people than just the seniors.   The bad news with these junk policies doesn't begin and end with  discrimination and debt. The Trump administration is letting the junk  insurance companies steal the money Americans pay in premiums and other  expenses.   According to one recent study, half of each premium dollar and  sometimes as much as two-thirds gets wasted on overhead, administrative  costs, and profits. The Affordable Care Act had a rule that banned that  kind of waste. The Trump administration threw it out so that the rip- off artists can once again pocket unsuspecting Americans' premium  dollars.   What the Trump administration is doing to undermine healthcare is not  only playing out in what is called the individual insurance market; the  harmful threat is a threat to the 167 million Americans who get their  insurance through their jobs as well.   Worse healthcare at a higher cost--a far cry from what people were  promised a few years ago--is clearly a growing problem. Worse  healthcare. Higher costs. A forced march back to the days when  healthcare in America, as I have said--and it has really been my  reference point as much as anything--I said: Let's not turn back the  clock to the days when healthcare was for the healthy and wealthy. This  junk insurance is unquestionably the kickoff of this administration's  formal effort to do just that.   There was an effort in the Affordable Care Act to build a functional  market that didn't trample all over typical Americans and their  families. The President and his allies in Congress have done everything  they can--starting with an Executive order on day one--to empower the  scam artists and powerful companies to have the ability to make  healthcare worse and rip off our people. That has been the story from  day one of this administration. As I said a few minutes ago, it is a  monumental scandal in slow motion.   On behalf of those Americans who are hurting, who are not being taken  care of, many of us are going to do everything we can to make sure--for  those who are getting hurt, who can't afford these kinds of practices,  we are going to keep this front and center of the American people until  we end this consumer scourge.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, these are incredibly harmful and traumatic  times for immigrants and refugees in America. Perhaps there is not  greater example of the damaging immigration policies of this  administration than the so called zero-tolerance policy that led to the  cruel and needless separation of thousands of children from their  parents.   Separating a child from his or her parents has lasting, harmful, and  traumatizing impacts. These separations have been shown to increase  anxiety and depression among children that have already experienced  significant trauma in their home countries and along their journey to  the United States. Best practices in child welfare promote keeping  children and their parents safely together, unless removal is in the  child's best interest.   While the Department of Justice ended the family separation policy  after an incredible outcry from the public and experts in children's  health and well-being, the damage is far from over. The administration  is now undergoing a court-supervised process to reunify separated  children and families. Significant and self-inflicted obstacles remain  in this reunification process, and I and my Senate colleagues will  [[Page S5828]]  continue to doggedly press the Departments of Justice, Homeland  Security, and Health and Human Services until every child is safely in  the custody of a parent, relative, or other guardian and to ensure  nothing like this happens again.   Hundreds of children still remain in government custody, scared and  unsure if they will ever see their parents again. Children who were  separated from their parents or arrive on their own are placed in the  custody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement, which falls under the  Administration for Children and Families, ACF, within the Department of  Health and Human Services. The President has nominated Lynn Johnson of  Colorado to fill the role of head of ACF. If confirmed by the Senate,  Ms. Johnson has one of the most important jobs in public service, and  that is ensuring the safety and well-being of these vulnerable children  and working toward their reunification.   I voted against Ms. Johnson's nomination when it came before the  Senate Finance Committee due to the sheer volume of unanswered  questions and false or misleading answers from this administration  regarding its family separation policies. Tonight, I had the  opportunity to discuss my concerns with Ms. Johnson and secure her  commitment to changing the way things are done in the Administration  for Children and Families.   Ms. Johnson committed to enacting and enforcing policies that prevent  Office of Refugee Resettlement grantees and facilities from engaging in  activities that are not consistent with best practices for children  including prohibiting solitary confinement for punitive purposes or  behavioral modification; prohibiting the distribution of psychotropic  medications or sedatives absent the informed, written consent of a  parent or guardian, except in the case of well-documented emergencies;  prohibiting arbitrary restraint policies; prohibiting any security  measures that are not necessary for the protection of minors or others,  such as denying them access to drinking water or preventing them from  making private phone calls; and guaranteeing the maintenance of  confidentiality of information disclosed by children to therapists and  counselors in the context of a therapeutic/treatment relationship.   In addition, Ms. Johnson committed to ensuring ORR and its supported  grantees and facilities allow any separated child to call a parent or  legal guardian as frequently as the child wishes--if there are  documented safety concerns, calls may be monitored by staff with the  child, but otherwise, children must be able to contact a parent or  legal guardian as they wish. If the parent/legal guardian is in the  custody of the Department of Homeland Security, the two agencies must  establish a process to accept children's calls and connect them to  their parents; and conducting a full review within 90 days of the  oversight, staffing, training, medication, and licensing policies for  ORR-funded facilities and issue a report to Congress describing the  oversight of these facilities and the actions ACF will take to address  oversight and program shortcomings. The review must include the extent  and adequacy of policies related to post-release services; legal  services; and health, including reproductive health, to ensure that  they are consistent with constitutional protections. In the event the  full review cannot be completed within 90 days, ACF will provide the  summary of their work at that point, with a timeline and guarantee that  the full report will be soon available.   I am grateful for these commitments and will hold Ms. Johnson to them  if she is ultimately confirmed by the full Senate.                            ____________________
