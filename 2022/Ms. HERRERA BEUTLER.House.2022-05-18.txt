 Madam Speaker, I rise today to urge defeat of  the previous question so we can protect and support local police  departments to help them hire and retain more officers. It is that  simple.   Over the past year we have seen a dramatic rise in crime in  communities across our Nation. And the district I serve, my home in  southwest Washington, hasn't been spared. Not a day goes by without a  local paper depicting another carjacking, killing, burglary, or  assault. These are on the rise.   When you meet with our local law enforcement, as I have, they have  been sounding the alarm for well more than a year. Then consider the  phrase that we have all heard repeated by politicians across this  country and in this town: Defund the police.   In States like mine, Washington, so-called police reform laws have  made it harder for police to catch criminals and do their jobs. Place  yourself in the shoes of a law enforcement officer who puts her life on  the line every single day. It is no wonder that honorable individuals  have left the profession in droves.   One county sheriff's department in my region announced that deputies  would no longer be able to respond to certain crimes like theft of  property, stolen vehicles, and more, due to the laws that are trying to  defund police. This is deeply concerning. We must act now to help shore  up our police forces to keep our cities and streets safe.   The Communities Deserve Cops Act will help reverse staffing shortages  by providing and signing retention bonuses for police officers. It is  time to stop chasing individuals away from the profession of policing,  which is exactly what we have been doing, and the Communities Deserve  Cops Act will help bring folks back into law enforcement.   Mr. Speaker, I urge defeat of the previous question so the House can  bring up this legislation to improve it, to help hire and retain police  officers, to shore up our police departments, and help keep our  communities safe.
