 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this  bipartisan bill to renew the Generalized System of Preferences program  for 3 years.   I thank Congressman Reichert for his leadership of the Trade  Subcommittee and the good work that Mr. Pascrell has done as well.   This program, known as GSP, is incredibly important for the  competitiveness of our local businesses and our local workers. It helps  our families and our communities by reducing tariffs, which are  essentially taxes, on products that many of us use every day. Through  GSP, we secure tax-free access to thousands of products from around the  world.   Last year, this saved American businesses more than $865 million. In  Texas alone, our local job creators saved more than $76 million. Of  course, this is money that our businesses can instead use to hire more  workers, to expand, and innovate.   But, really, think about what it means for families. Think about that  single mom in the grocery store carefully reading every price tag so  she can stretch every dollar to the max. For her, GSP makes everyday  essentials more affordable, as well as the occasional treat that saves  money. It provides her with real peace of mind.   GSP delivers all these benefits in an accountable way that doesn't  hurt American workers or businesses.  [[Page H1102]]    I thank all the Members who worked on this important pro-growth, pro- family bill; in particular, our Ways and Means Committee members:  Congressman Neal, my ranking member; Congressmen Reichert and Pascrell,  our Trade Subcommittee chairman and ranking member; and Congresswoman  Jackie Walorski, who has been an outstanding leader in this effort.   Now, let's pass this bill, provide certainty for our job creators,  and deliver the tax relief that American families deserve.
