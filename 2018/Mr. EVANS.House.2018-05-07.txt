 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the subject of this Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleagues for holding  this Special Order hour, the CBC Special Order hour this evening, as we  discuss SNAP and other efforts by the President and the GOP to shed the  social safety net.                                time  1930    Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus,  Chairman Richmond, for allowing me to have this opportunity to lead  what we call the ``Conscience of the Congress'' of the Congressional  Black Caucus, who is the one who has led this and come up with this  idea for us.   As we paint a picture of the Black community in 2018, it is clear  that we have a lot to lose. Too many of our neighborhoods are,  unfortunately, still plagued by rampant poverty, dysfunction, and  crime. These are very serious issues that our community has to deal  with.   But instead of the GOP Congress working with us side by side in a  bipartisan manner, we have a group, Mr. Speaker, hell-bent on enacting  jaded, outdated, economic backwards legislation in the form of SNAP  that would throw thousands of recipients off the roles. According to  the nonpartisan Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, SNAP is the  country's most effective antihunger program helping one in five  Americans afford a basic diet.   For over 15 years, State and Federal policymakers have worked on a  bipartisan basis to strengthen SNAP. The GOP would take a large step  backwards, reducing or eliminating benefits for more than 1 million  households with more than 2 million people. And let me be clear, it is  not just about programs, policies, and laws being enacted by the GOP  and President Trump, it is about the overall tone that has been set by  this President, who regularly raises insults, instead of engaging in  meaningful policy discussions.   The President's review of welfare programs is an immoral attempt to  get the programs that provide a basic standard of living for Americans  struggling to make ends meet, all to pay for the massive tax cuts for  himself and the richest 1 percent. Instead of taking food out of the  mouths of poor children or kicking the elderly off of Medicare,  President Trump and congressional Republicans should work with  Democrats to put more money in the pockets of hardworking Americans.   Let me be clear: this executive order is a thinly veiled attempt to  restrict access to healthcare, housing, food, and many other basic  living programs by adding onerous so-called work requirements.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Alabama (Ms. Sewell), a  person who I admire and had the chance of visiting with her in the  great State of Alabama. She has a lot of experience firsthand and knows  and understands what it means to be close to the people.    Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask my colleague from Alabama  (Ms. Sewell) one quick question.   She raised a very good point about promise. Does she have any last  thought about the element of promise; could she just take a minute or  so, just really from her own experience and her own constituents, what  the meaning of that promise means today?    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from the Seventh  District of Alabama. I really appreciate her comments.   Mr. Speaker, throughout this next 45 minutes, I am going to be  introducing  [[Page H3768]]  some of my colleagues, but I want to read a letter that was sent to me  on April 27, 2018.   As the gentlewoman from Alabama said, I am from Pennsylvania; and  being from Pennsylvania, our Governor wrote a letter, and this is what  he said:   ``I write today to express my concerns regarding the text of the  Agriculture and Nutrition Act of 2018, or the farm bill released last  week. The importance of the farm bill to Pennsylvanians cannot be  overstated. As you know, Pennsylvania farmers are facing the same  challenges impacting the agricultural industry throughout the country.  With trending towards lower farm incomes and a recent market loss for  42 Pennsylvania dairy farmers, the farm bill should be an opportunity  to support our Commonwealth's most vulnerable agricultural industry.  Unfortunately, the House Agriculture Committee has released a partisan  bill that will punish struggling Pennsylvanians--especially seniors,  individuals with disabilities, and working families in all your  congressional districts.   ``The farm bill has always been a bipartisan effort because hunger is  not a political issue. For more than 40 years, Pennsylvanians have  relied on the SNAP program to help put food on the table during tough  times. Nearly 14 percent of our State's population is experiencing food  insecurity. Cuts to SNAP will only increase that number.''   Mr. Speaker, the exact number in my congressional district, the  Second Congressional District, is 215,195 individuals. In the new  district, the Third Congressional District, it is 207,441 people who  will be affected by these cuts.   ``Let's be clear--SNAP recipients already face work requirements.  This bill increases them and institutes lengthy ineligibility periods  for individuals who are noncompliant just for 1 month. In this bill, by  2021, all nondisabled individuals ages 50 to 59 would face work  requirements and by 2026, the required number of work hours per week  will increase from 20 to 25. Yet this legislation does not include  adequate funding for States to provide job training or allow  individuals a period of time to engage in educational activities to  help residents meet these new threshold requirements. In Pennsylvania,  that would translate to an additional 199,000 individuals who will be  affected. Let me repeat that. In Pennsylvania, that will translate to  199,000 individuals between 50 and 59 who would face cuts to SNAP. It  is more difficult for older individuals to find work when unemployed,  and many people want to work more than 25 hours but cannot due to lack  of available hours, children, or age.''   Time limits on SNAP, Mr. Speaker, believe me, would have a  devastating affect in Pennsylvania.   ``SNAP is a critical social net for our seniors and families'' and  veterans. ``SNAP recipients receive on average of $126 per month, which  translates to around $1.40 per meal,'' Mr. Speaker. ``According to  Feeding America, the average meal in Pennsylvania costs $2.93. These  cuts are an attack on our most vulnerable citizens. If the goal of the  House leadership''--that is, the Republican leadership--``is to  decrease the amount of money the Federal Government spends on SNAP, I  suggest''--this is Governor Wolf--``you raise the Federal minimum wage  to $12 per hour'' so that people can have a real chance.   Mr. Speaker, I think it is clear from the Governor of Pennsylvania  that there is an attack on poor people, and the Governor of the great  State of Pennsylvania has gone on record in saying that we are moving  in the wrong direction.   Someone whom I have a lot of respect for, and she has served in the  great State of Wisconsin in the State legislature, and I have known her  before I had this opportunity to come to Congress, is a person who is  not shy about the things that she expresses. She speaks truth to power.  That is the great woman from the Fourth District of Wisconsin, Mr.  Speaker, Congresswoman Gwen Moore.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Wisconsin (Ms. Moore).     Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I want to respond to the gentlewoman from  Wisconsin (Ms. Moore). I will give her something that is firsthand from  a mayor who is on the forefront.   I have a letter here from the mayor of the city of Philadelphia,  which Philadelphia has about 1.5 million people. It is one of the  biggest poor cities in America, so I am going to give you somebody  specifically who can state that he wrote a letter, and I want to read  what he has said.   He said: ``In Philadelphia''--remember, where America started, the  Liberty Bell, the Constitution Center, Ben Franklin. You remember that,  right? That is where it all started, right?   This is what he said: ``In Philadelphia, approximately 480,000  individuals receive SNAP to help buy food they need to survive and feed  their families.''   There are more SNAP recipients who can work and do not work and would  prefer to work, more than if they could.   ``SNAP is critical to helping low-wage and part-time workers who  can't find steady employment, veterans''--those who fought for our  country, those who have been out on the forefront--``people who are  homeless. . . . ''   The number that came from HUD in the city of Philadelphia was in the  ballpark of 6,000 to 15,000 people homeless. Now remember, that is  where the Liberty Bell is, Independence Hall is, Betsy Ross' house. You  remember all of that, right?   So it is clear that SNAP is critical.   ``It also helps families with children, seniors, and people with  disabilities put food on their table.'' And think of this: ``It doesn't  cost much--the benefits average about $1.34 per person per meal--but it  helps Philadelphians fulfill basic needs. And it also has been found to  have long-term positive impacts on health, as well as on children's  educational attainment. SNAP also contributes to the Philadelphia  economy. Every dollar spent on SNAP generates $1.70 in economic  activity in Philadelphia's grocery stores,'' grocers who depend a great  deal on the importance of this initiative.   Remember, where America started, in Philadelphia, this is occurring.  So here there is a letter from the mayor stating very clearly that  cutting off SNAP will not help Philadelphians get their jobs but will  just make it harder for them to pay for their food they need.   So, in other words, those work requirements and the things the  gentlewoman described, we have an evidence-based letter of a mayor who  is on the front line, who has to deal with these things every single  day.   And the fact of the matter is you can document the statistics. In the  congressional district that I represent, which is a part of the city of  Philadelphia, there is 26 percent poverty, 195,000 people. There is  a food bank in one of our major universities in the city of  Philadelphia.    In the suburban district, which I have a letter from Montgomery  County, which is supposed to be one of the richest counties outside of  Philadelphia, I say to you, Mr. Speaker, that you ask the right  questions and you raise the right issues all on the basis, as you  described, on that framework and what you described, paying for that  giveaway or taxes.   It is not an accident that that tax issue was H. Res. 1 and the farm  bill is H. Res. 2. So you think about the order of that, you think  about H. Res. 1, H. Res. 2, you see for yourself.   So the gentlewoman's whole theory is definitely not incorrect, and  what she has laid out is very clear that this is an attempt to beat up  on poor people, beat up on people in these communities.   Mr. Speaker, I say to you that we, as the Congressional Black Caucus,  are not just going to sit silent. We are going to make sure people hear  us. We are going to make sure people know that we are just not going to  accept this.   So I say to the gentlewoman, I heard her message and I have described  it to her.   I yield to the gentlewoman from Wisconsin.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from the great State  of Wisconsin for her comments.   I want to introduce someone else who is also on the Budget Committee,  who I have watched a long time in the short period of time that I have  been here. She has been a real fighter, and she speaks to the issues. I  have not seen anyone intimidate her, and she is from the great 18th  District of Texas.   I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I thank my good colleague from the great  State of Texas in the 18th District for her comments adding to this  discussion.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the Governor of  Pennsylvania, who indicated 1.8 million people are on SNAP; the city of  Philadelphia, where it all started here in terms of America, 400,000  individuals on SNAP, a letter from the mayor of the city of  Philadelphia; and a letter from the chair, Chairwoman Arkoosh, who is  chair of the Montgomery County Board of Commissioners, the third  largest county in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, where 50,000 people  are on SNAP.                                   Commonwealth of Pennsylvania,                                     Harrisburg, PA, April 17, 2018.      Hon. Dwight Evans,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Congressman Evans: I write today to express my       concerns regarding the text of the Agriculture and Nutrition       Act of 2018 or the Farm Bill released last week. The       importance of the Farm Bill to Pennsylvanians cannot be       overstated. As you know, Pennsylvania farmers are facing the       same challenges impacting the agricultural industry       throughout the country. With trending low farm incomes and a       recent market loss for 42 Pennsylvania dairy farmers, the       Farm Bill should be an opportunity to support our       commonwealth's valuable agricultural industry. Unfortunately,       the House Agriculture committee has released a partisan bill       that will punish struggling Pennsylvanians especially       seniors, individuals with disabilities, and working families       in your congressional district.        The Farm Bill has always been a bipartisan effort because       hunger is not a political issue. For more than 40 years,       Pennsylvanians have relied on the Supplemental Nutrition       Assistance Program (SNAP) to help put food on the table       during tough times. Nearly 14 percent of our state's       population is experiencing food insecurity. Cuts to SNAP will       only increase that number. In February of this year, over 1.8       million Pennsylvanians were enrolled in SNAP, including       215,195 individuals in the 2nd Congressional District and       207,411 in the new 3rd Congressional District. Over 80% of       SNAP dollars are distributed to households with children,       seniors, or an individual with a disability according to the       US Department of Agriculture.        Let's be clear--SNAP recipients already face work       requirements. This bill increases them and institutes lengthy       ineligibility periods for individuals who are non-compliant       for just one month. In this bill, by 2021 all nondisabled       individuals ages 50 to 59 would face work requirements and by       2026 the required number of work hours per week will increase       from 20 to 25. Yet this legislation does not include adequate       funding for states to provide job training or allow       individuals a period of time to engage in educational       activities to help residents meet these new threshold       requirements. In Pennsylvania that would translate to an       additional 199,000 individuals between 50-59 who would face       cuts to SNAP. It is more difficult for older individuals to       find work when unemployed and many people want to work more       than 25 hours but cannot due to lack of available hours,       children, or age. Time limits on SNAP would now apply to       parents of children older than 6. Over 20% of Pennsylvania's       SNAP recipients have children in the household. These parents       already face significant barriers to meet the current work       requirements. Increasing them makes it more likely their       children will face hunger which creates barriers to academic       success and results in poorer health outcomes and a higher       risk of chronic conditions. Combined, each of these things       contributes to a cycle of poverty that can be almost       impossible to break.        Cuts to SNAP do not just affect those who receive SNAP       benefits. In the 2017 fiscal year, SNAP recipients in       Pennsylvania spent more than $2.7 billion in benefits. These       dollars do not only benefit the recipient but flow to local       business that provide jobs and economic stability to the       commonwealth. SNAP spending currently accounts for more than       10 percent of all spending on food purchased to be eaten at       home. It is estimated that each SNAP dollar spent provides       nearly double the impact in local communities. Cuts to SNAP       are cuts to cuts farms, food processors, and grocery stores       as well.        SNAP is a critical safety net for our seniors and families.       SNAP recipients receive on average of $126 per month, which       translates to around $1.40 per meal. According to Feeding       America, the average meal in Pennsylvania costs $2.93. These       cuts are an attack on our most vulnerable citizens. If the       goal of House leadership is to decrease the amount of money       the federal government spends on SNAP, I suggest you raise       the federal minimum wage to $12.00 per hour and lift millions       of Americans out of poverty that way instead of taking food       off the table for Pennsylvanians. I urge you to reject this       partisan legislation and instead work together on a bill that       can pass both chambers with bipartisan support. My       administration is ready and eager to engage in conversations       on legislation to benefit all Pennsylvanians. Thank you for       the opportunity to weigh in on this issue.            Sincerely,                                                          Tom Wolf,      Governor.                                   ____                                             City of Philadelphia,                                                   Philadelphia, PA.        Dear Representative Evans: I am writing to provide you with       information about the  [[Page H3772]]       impacts of changes to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance       Program (SNAP) that are proposed in the Agriculture and       Nutrition Act of 2018 under consideration in the House, which       include cuts to SNAP benefits and expansion of time limits       and work requirement. My administration has made work and       workforce a priority--in fact we recently announced the       City's workforce strategy: Fueling the Philadelphia's Talent       Engine. We believe that work is key to success for families       and for our communities. But adding bureaucratic requirements       and harsh penalties to a program that helps people stave off       hunger is not the way to increase employment.        In Philadelphia approximately 480,000 individuals receive       SNAP to help buy the food they need to survive and feed their       families. Most SNAP recipients who can work do work, and       would prefer to work more hours if they could. This bill       expands SNAP time-limits and work requirements and adds harsh       penalties--12 and 36 months ineligibility for food       assistance--for those who are not in compliance, even if they       are trying to find work. The bill proposes reducing the       spending on direct food assistance to needy families in order       to pay for implementation of these bureaucratic new       requirements. Research indicates aggressive new work       requirements are likely to cause families in need to lose       food assistance, while doing little to increase employment.        SNAP is critical to helping low-wage and part-time workers       who can't find steady employment, veterans, people who are       homeless, and people struggling with addictions. It also       helps families with children, seniors, and people with       disabilities put food on the table. It doesn't cost much--the       benefits average about $1.34 per person per meal--but it       helps Philadelphians fulfil basic needs. And it also has been       found to have long-term positive impacts on health, as well       as on children's educational attainment. SNAP also       contributes to the Philadelphia economy. Every dollar spent       in SNAP generates $1.70 in economic activity in       Philadelphia's grocery stores and farmer's markets.        We believe that one group of Philadelphians who would be       disproportionately impacted by the penalties related to work       requirements is people with criminal records. Having an       arrest any time in one's life continues to decrease a job       seeker's prospects more than any other factor. Returning       residents want work, but if their criminal record prevents       them from finding employment they would be unable to fulfil       the work requirement and would lose SNAP benefits as a       penalty.        Cutting off SNAP will not help Philadelphians get jobs but       will just make it harder for them to pay for the food they       need while they struggle to find work.        I urge you and your colleagues in Congress to focus on       policies that help create jobs and boost wages rather than       punishing people who are already facing economic hardship.            Sincerely,                                                   James F. Kenney,      Mayor.                                   ____                                             Montgomery County Board                                                of Commissioners,                                     Norristown, PA, April 17, 2018.      Hon. Dwight Evans:      Washington, DC.        Dear Congressman Evans: I am writing today to oppose the       changes to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program       (SNAP) that are outlined in the Agriculture and Nutrition Act       of 2018. The proposed strict eligibility requirements would       eliminate as many as one million recipients that rely on SNAP       to feed themselves and their families.        In Montgomery County, more than 50,000 residents receive       SNAP benefits, and more than 21,000 of those recipients are       children. Another 8,000 are senior citizens, and more than       7,500 are disabled adults. For these residents, the SNAP       program makes the difference as to whether or not these       vulnerable individuals have a meal each day.        With an average monthly benefit of $123.51 for SNAP       recipients, it is already difficult for recipients to receive       proper nutrition. Not only that, but Montgomery County has a       large population that is food insecure, but earn just enough       to disqualify them for SNAP benefits. An estimated 58 percent       of those who experience hunger in our county are ineligible       for assistance. We need to extend SNAP benefits, not shrink       them, for our most vulnerable county residents.        In Pennsylvania, one in 12 workers use SNAP to supplement       their nutritional needs. Many of the workers on SNAP earn low       wages, have unstable schedules and cannot rely on enough       hours to feed their families each week, or are in between       jobs. SNAP assists workers in the service industry, sales and       retail workers, teaching assistants, construction and other       seasonal workers, and agricultural workers among many others.       These individuals are a critical component of our local       economy and yet still struggle to put food on the table for       their families.        As a doctor, I know that access to healthy, affordable food       and safe housing are key factors in the health of children       and adults. SNAP has an impact on the health of its       recipients--they have lower healthcare costs than people who       are eligible for SNAP, but do not use it. Food insecurity       also has a particularly negative impact on children, who       account for nearly half of SNAP recipients in Montgomery       County, and pregnant women, as it is linked to infant       mortality.        Any cuts to SNAP benefits, or restrictions that attempt to       broaden the circle of who legislators believe deserve to go       hungry, are bad for our residents. No one deserves to go       hungry--not the children in our county, and not their parents       who may sacrifice their own meals so there is more food for       their little ones.        SNAP is helping many families keep their heads above water,       and we should be finding more ways to expand the program to       assist those families, instead of trying to cut the rope.       Please contact my office if you have any questions.            Sincerely,                                    Valerie A. Arkoosh, MD, MPH,                                      Chair, Montgomery County Board                                                  of Commissioners.     Mr. Speaker, I would like to read a little bit from Ms.  Arkoosh's letter.   ``In Montgomery County, more than 50,000 residents receive SNAP  benefits, and more than 21,000 of those recipients are children.  Another 8,000 are senior citizens, and more than 7,500 are disabled  adults. For these residents, the SNAP program makes the difference as  to whether or not these vulnerable individuals have a meal each day.   ``With an average monthly benefit of $123.51 for SNAP recipients, it  is already difficult for recipients to receive proper nutrition. Not  only that, but Montgomery County has a large population that is food  insecure, but earn just enough to disqualify them for SNAP benefits. An  estimated 58 percent of those who experience hunger in our county are  ineligible for assistance. We need to extend SNAP benefits, not shrink  them, for our most vulnerable county residents.   ``In Pennsylvania, 1 in 12 workers use SNAP to supplement their  nutritional needs. Many of the workers on SNAP earn low wages, have  unstable schedules, and cannot rely on enough hours to feed their  families each week. . . . ''   This is a major county in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.   Mr. Speaker, I give this as further evidence that clearly we are  going in the wrong direction. So let's be clear. With the President's  executive order, which is a thinly veiled attempt to restrict access to  healthcare, housing, food, and many other basic living programs, by  adding on onerous work requirements, it is not surprising that this  President is ordering a mass review of the social safety net programs  that help the poorest of the poor the same week that the nonpartisan  Congressional Budget Office projected a massive deficit as a result of  the Republican's tax scam.   Let's be clear, Mr. Speaker. Democrats sounded the alarm months ago  when the Republicans passed a massive $1.9 trillion tax cut. That is  because Republicans employed this terrible three-step process before.   First, cut the tax rate for top income earners and corporations.  Claim that it will magically pay enough through economic growth. We  have heard that before.   Second, balloon the deficit when economic growth does not pay for the  tax cut and pretend to be shocked.   Third, insist on massive cuts in critical programs that provide a  basic standard of living for all Americans, like eliminating Meals on  Wheels for seniors and benefits for Americans with disabilities.   Mr. Speaker, we have seen this plan before, and it is very  unfortunate. We all need to understand, as Dr. King talked about, a  beloved community. We are our brothers' and sisters' keeper.   What is worse, Mr. Speaker, the President's budget and executive  action to make it harder for struggling Americans to get the help they  need is officially step three.   The President and the conservatives who control this agenda paint a  racist and inadequate portrait of poor people as lazy welfare queens  who would rather depend on the government than pull themselves up by  the boot straps.   But nothing could be further from the truth. It is a reality that a  million Americans face. Everybody would like to work, Mr. Speaker. So  let's be very clear. Everybody, if they have a good, decent job and a  decent income, no one--no one, Mr. Speaker--wants to be on the SNAP  program.   However, Mr. Speaker, understanding the cyclical nature of our  economy, there is a need. Food banks cannot do it alone. We all know,  the reality is there is a direct connection between what is happening  in our economy.   So let's be clear. Our Nation's societal safety net already has  failed to help the families they need. Already, in  [[Page H3773]]  the State of Pennsylvania, nearly 14 percent of our population, many of  them in Philadelphia, are hungry. And, unfortunately, they will be  joined by more Pennsylvanians if this farm bill is to pass.   Mr. Speaker, this is not something to be taken lightly. This is not  something that we should smile and joke about because this is no joke.  There are an awful lot of people out here, Mr. Speaker. And the  Congressional Black Caucus stands today to work with anyone who is  trying to move us forward and not backwards.   So it is clear, Mr. Speaker, in terms of the effects that we are  having, this is something that we shouldn't take lightly.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to make a little announcement about the  person who does all the staff work, because it is important to  recognize staff.   She has been the guiding force behind these Special Orders, and I  want to thank her personally and go on the record that Caren Street has  been a fantastic person. She is just leaving the Congressional Black  Caucus, but she will still be around and be available.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Caren for all she has done for the  people of this country and particularly for the Congressional Black  Caucus.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
