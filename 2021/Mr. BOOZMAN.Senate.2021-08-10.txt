 Madam President, I call up my amendment No. 3103 and ask  that it be reported by number.    Madam President, my amendment will establish a deficit- neutral reserve fund to ensure rural electric cooperatives remain  eligible for USDA financing for the construction, maintenance, or  improvement of fossil fuel burning plants.   I ask my colleagues to support this commonsense approach to ensure  that the electricity needs of rural America continue to be met and, in  the future, are affordable and reliable.   The amendment ensures that rural Americans continue to have  accessible, affordable, reliable energy to power their farms, their  businesses, and broadband networks in the 21st-century economy.   In order to achieve net zero emissions by 2050, the Department of  Agriculture has proposed the retirement of fossil fuel-burning  powerplants in rural America.   So this amendment would protect rural America and make sure they have  reliable and affordable energy.  [[Page S6219]]    I ask my colleagues for a ``yea'' vote.
