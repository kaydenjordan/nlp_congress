 Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to commend Chandler Police  Chief Sean Duggan for recently being named the 2019 Chief of the Year  by the Arizona Association of Chiefs of Police.   Chief Duggan has served Arizonan communities in law enforcement for  more than 30 years, following in the footsteps of his father who was a  New York City police officer. He joined the police force in 1986 when  he started with the Scottsdale Police Department and also served as a  member of the Arizona Department of Public Safety's gang and illegal  immigration task force.   In an interview 5 years ago, after being selected as Chandler's top  cop, Chief Duggan said: ``Was I a kid who wanted to be chief? No. It's  the greatest honor that can be bestowed on me professionally.''   Mr. Speaker, I say to Chief Duggan: Your service to Chandler has been  honorable. The citizens of Chandler thank you for your leadership.  Throughout your career, you have dedicated yourself to protecting our  liberties and ensuring that criminals are removed from the streets. The  east valley is privileged to count you as a neighbor, influencer, and  leader.   Congratulations on your award. You have earned it.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to be here and to speak and  report to the American people about what we saw and learned on the  Arizona-Mexico border over the weekend.   We spent Sunday and Monday putting a lot of miles on cars, traveling  within 30 miles of the border all the way from the New Mexico line  through about two-thirds of the State of Arizona. It becomes kind of  interesting because, quite frankly, there are so many people who do not  appreciate the breadth and the wide open space of that country.   Let me just take a few minutes and tell you that we had nine Members  of Congress there. We met with Border Patrol agents, Customs agents,  Border Patrol management. We met with ranchers, residents along the  border. We met with numerous people, all who have an interest in the  immediate impacts of illegal border crossings.   One ranch that we happened to visit in Arizona, right on the border,  you could look out and you could see the vastness of what our Border  Patrol agents are dealing with. You could literally see many miles into  Mexico. The Sierra Madres are coming down from their height, leveling  down, and then you have two other additional mountain ranges that come  on the Arizona side, right through it, kind of tapering into the  Chiracahua Mountains, beautiful mountains.   You can see the vastness of this open space, and it is many hundreds  of miles, and even thousands of miles square. We have two or three  Border Patrol agents there and no fence, really, to speak of.   So we talked with some of the ranchers who live along there and their  experience. We walked through some of the hills and on the paths that  illegal aliens and drug traffickers pass through and walk. We talked  with some of them.   One gentleman explained to us that he has had four home invasions-- four home invasions--more than 15 burglaries, and, every day,  trespassers on his property.   Imagine that as your lifestyle, knowing that you will have home  invasions, knowing that you are going to have people trespassing on  your property consistently.   We moved over to the wall in Douglas, Arizona. It sits on the border  with Agua Prieta. We took pictures. We talked with Border Patrol  agents. And then we could see where that border wall, how long that  goes.   It is bollard fencing, which is slatted steel fencing that goes  anywhere from 10 to 15, 18 feet high. But it was so ineffective in some  places that they have started putting concertina razor wire to keep  people down.   In a minute, I will tell you how that doesn't really work.   And then they put up a third or second barrier there in some parts of  Douglas, but not enough money. It just kind of runs out. And you can  see how far that border wall goes in Douglas, and it is the bollard  fencing.   We then kept moving in Cochise County in Arizona, and we ended up, we  were able to talk to some local law enforcement and some of the Angel  Parents.   But I want to talk about something that I thought was most intriguing  and interesting. As we were sitting there in that restaurant with some  of our staff, our Members of Congress, some local law enforcement, some  of the Angel Families, we had a resident just come up out of the blue,  and she thanked the local law enforcement for the efforts being made to  protect the citizens of that county.                                time  1700    She said: You know, I have had a home invasion. I have had repeated  burglaries. I have had trespassing on my property, on my ranch. We get  people come in, they turn on water, they want a drink of water, and  they just let the water run. They never turn it off. They trash my  property.   She was telling me this. I asked her to address our group. She did.  Impromptu, she told of her experience, out of the blue. She didn't know  who we were. I thought that was remarkable. It was completely unstaged.   We had the Angel Parents, Mary Ann Mendoza talk about her son,  Brandon, who was a Mesa police officer. Brandon was killed by a driver  who had previously been arrested and deported. He was driving along the  wrong way on the freeway and runs into Brandon and kills him.   Steve Ronnebeck spoke. Steve had a son, Grant, early twenties, very  outgoing, gregarious young man, working at the QT, which is a  convenience store. One night, Mr. Altamirano, who had been convicted  and deported previously--in fact, he was convicted for burglary. That  was a plea deal down from the two counts of kidnapping and rape of a  woman who was victimized by Mr. Altamirano.   He had been deported. He comes back, goes in to buy a pack of  cigarettes. Grant is counting out the change. Mr. Altamirano does not  like how slow it seems to be taking, pulls a gun out, and pointblank  shoots him in the face, killing Grant Ronnebeck. What a tragedy that  is.   So they are not alone. I have talked with Angel Families from  throughout the country. You say: Well, okay. You are in a border State.  That might happen in a border State. This goes throughout the country.  These types of tragedies have happened throughout the country.   It is unfortunate and it is sad, but it is preventable in large  measure.   We got a briefing at a Border Patrol station in southern Arizona.  They are not too far below their full complement. They are about 80,  maybe 75 percent of their full complement of agents. This is a big  area, though, and they run three shifts. By the time you  [[Page H1167]]  take care of time off, vacation days, sick days, by the time you take  everything into account, you have seven people watching and monitoring  the cameras that do not cover even all of the area for which this  station is responsible.   You have seven Border Patrol agents trying to interdict, literally,  over hundreds of miles, hundreds of miles largely fenced with a four- strand barbed wire fence. It isn't like you have even have T poles as  your fencing poles or even a more rigid pole. It is basically branches  of trees. That is what you have along that particular section of the  border. It doesn't take much to get across.   So we went to Sasabe, which is a very small port of entry, and they  have 1\1/2\ miles of bollard fencing either side of that. Then this is  something that is really hard to explain, but they have, again, the  four-strand barbed wire fence that rolls on out until, I know, where it  goes into single-strand barbed wire fencing. I have been there, I have  seen it. But on this trip, we just watched the four-strand barbed wire  fence.   When you get there, how does it tie in to the bollard fencing: with a  piece of rope that is tied to a slipknot.   And you think fences don't work? Of course they work. The bollard  fence works. You can stand there right at the end of the bollard fence  and look out into Mexico, and the several paths that you see moving  north toward their border all come up to where that rope and that  slipknot that is holding the four-strand barbed wire fence comes into  the bollard fence, and they all come right to there.   Why? Because you lift up the rope, pull it down. You can actually put  it back on and then continue on up the hill.   But there is a convenience store in that little town near that Border  Patrol stocked with MREs. And guess who needs MREs: cartel scouts who  are in the hills and mountains of southern Arizona and near that little  town.   They sell bullets, not in the box. When I have ever bought bullets,  ammunition for my guns, they are in little boxes--not here. You can get  them in little baggies, you know, little plastic bags you buy to put  your sandwich in. This is what you have.   So is it any wonder that in the Tucson sector, 40 percent of the  drugs that have been seized in the last couple years are in that  sector?   You have a drug problem. We have tens of thousands of people killed  each year because of opioid abuse. The vast majority of that is coming  across the southern border. And of that that is interdicted, you have a  significant plurality that is coming right through that Tucson sector.   So we then had a chance to meet with some Border Patrol agents, talk  to them about what is going on. It was marvelous. They gave us some  ideas.   I want to talk a little bit about something that we really don't  focus on.   Mr. Speaker, I am going to save that, though, because I see the  gentleman from Arizona.    Mr. Speaker and the gentleman, I would tell you, it looked  to me like it was about a quarter-inch rope. It was not much more than  what you would call about a clothesline width, but it was about a  quarter to a half inch.    Mr. Speaker, that is correct.    Mr. Speaker, yes, that was my impression. You also can't  tell how many people are coming through. It may be one or two. It may  be 20 or 40.    Mr. Speaker, that is exactly right. In fact, that road  kind of ended where the bollard fence ended. And then you had the  Normandy fence that was sitting there, but then right next to it, you  had that track for people to come walking through that barbed wire  fence.  [[Page H1168]]         Mr. Speaker, yes. I would tell the gentleman that when I  talked about, literally, nearly 1,000 or more square miles that seven  agents are covering, if the camera is there, they have seen these  people. By the time they get there--it takes 2, 2\1/2\ hours because it  is rugged terrain--nobody is there anymore; because the sensors, the  cameras are there, and nobody is there anymore, and they are moving on.  That is because they are trying to get to their destination, which may  be Tucson, it may be Phoenix, and from there, all points throughout the  country for these drugs to be distributed.   But, yes, indeed, this happens over and over and over on a daily  basis.    Mr. Speaker, yes. It was one of the Angel Moms, Mary Ann  Mendoza, who said it well. She said: A wall won't stop everyone, but no  wall will stop no one. They wanted a wall.   There was not one person that I met, and that we met, that didn't  advocate for a wall. But they also understood that you need to have the  infrastructure, that is to say, roads. You need to have cameras and  sensors. You need to actually have more boots on the ground: better  vehicles that can get there, and, where necessary, horses.   Don't forget that they were using dogs, for instance, to sniff out  currency. We have a shortage of dogs at the ports of entry and in the  interior between the ports of entry.   They need lighter weight. We talked to one agent who said that when  he is out there wearing his full bulletproof vest and the whole  harness, if it is 110 degrees ambient temperature--which, by the way,  most of our summer is going to be well above 100--he said that quickly  rises and you are at 145 to 160 degrees as a Border Patrol agent.   So, yes, we need a lot. But the one thing that is foundational to all  of this, to try to get the border under control, is fencing.    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate everyone who went to the border  with us. We will be doing it again. I will invite my Democratic  colleagues to come with us as well. It is eye-opening.
