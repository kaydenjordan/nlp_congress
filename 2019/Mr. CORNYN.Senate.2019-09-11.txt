 Mr. President, as we all know, today we commemorate the  solemn anniversary of the attacks on 9/11/2001.   If you ask anybody who is old enough to remember where they were that  day, I bet they can tell you. It is one of those rare moments that  defines an entire generation.   I have always said that it is etched in my memory like the only other  event in my lifetime that might rise to that level of shock and horror,  and that is the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.   Eighteen years ago today, I was in Austin, talking on the phone to  then-Governor Rick Perry. When I hung up the phone, my wife said, ``You  need to see this,'' pointing to the TV set. That was just as the second  plane hit the World Trade Center, and we all know what came after.   It was the same image that millions of Americans struggled to  understand on that morning and still struggle to comprehend today--how  someone could be so evil and so determined to take innocent lives.   September 11 serves as a dividing line in American history. For  people like me, there is before and there is after, but for an entire  generation of younger people, there is really only after. I believe  this 18th anniversary carries special weight because those young people  who have only lived in a post-9/11 world will now be able to vote in  our elections, serve in our military, and help shape the future of our  country.   It is a reminder of our commitment as a nation to carry out the  promise we made in the wake of the attack to ``never forget''--never  forget.   As Americans, we must remain vigilant, and we must remain with a  strong sense of purpose and a strong moral clarity regarding  confronting evil in all its forms. We vow to carry the memory of the  nearly 3,000 lives lost that day in our hearts, the sense of patriotism  that welled up inside of each of us, and the determination never to be  intimidated, and never to back down.   Today, we remember the families who lost loved ones that day, the  first responders who ran not away from but toward the danger, and the  commitment of our Armed Forces, who fight to eradicate terrorism around  the globe each and every day.
