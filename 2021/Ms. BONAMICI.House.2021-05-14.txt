 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding.   I rise in strong support of the bipartisan Pregnant Workers Fairness  Act. As a mom and policymaker, I know how important it is to protect  the health, well-being, and economic security of pregnant workers and  their families. Unfortunately, under current Federal law, pregnant  workers do not have access to reasonable workplace accommodations.   Simple accommodations, such as providing seating, water, or an extra  bathroom break, would allow pregnant workers to stay safe on their job  during pregnancy. But when pregnant workers do not have access to the  accommodations they need, they are at risk of jeopardizing their health  and the health of their baby, losing their job, being denied a  promotion, or not being hired in the first place.   It is unacceptable that, in 2021, pregnant workers can still be  forced to choose between a healthy pregnancy and a paycheck.   Congress passed the Pregnancy Discrimination Act more than four  decades ago, but pregnant workers still suffer discrimination at an  alarming rate.   Megan, a manufacturing worker in Oregon, was forced to take unpaid  leave after her employer denied her modest request for light duty 3\1/ 2\ months before her due date. Oregon has since passed a State version  of the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, and it is working very well. But  pregnant workers across the country need fairness, too.   We know that women of color are overrepresented in low-wage,  physically demanding jobs and are, therefore, disproportionately harmed  by a lack of access to reasonable accommodations. By clarifying the  right of pregnant workers to reasonable accommodations on the job, we  will finally give them the ability to work safely without fear of  facing discrimination or retaliation.   I thank Chairman Scott and Chairman Nadler for their leadership. I  urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan bill.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the National  Partnership for Women & Families in support of the Pregnant Workers  Fairness Act.                                            National Partnership for                                                Women & Families,                                       Washington, DC, May 11, 2021.        Dear Member of Congress: The National Partnership for Women       & Families is a non-profit, non-partisan advocacy       organization committed to improving the lives of women and       families by achieving equity for all women. Since our       creation as the Women's Legal Defense Fund in 1971, we have       fought for every significant advance for equal opportunity in       the workplace, including the Pregnancy Discrimination Act of       1978 and the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA). We       write in strong support of H.R. 1065, the Pregnant Workers       Fairness Act. This bipartisan legislation will support       pregnant workers on the job, improving women's and families'       economic security and promoting healthier pregnancies.        More than 40 years ago, Congress passed the Pregnancy       Discrimination Act of 1978, outlawing discrimination on the       basis of pregnancy, childbirth or related medical conditions,       yet pregnancy discrimination is still widespread and impacts       pregnant workers across industry, race, ethnicity and       jurisdiction. Nearly 31,000 pregnancy discrimination charges       were filed with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity       Commission (EEOC) and state-level fair employment practice       agencies between 2010 and 2015, and the reality of pregnancy       discrimination is likely much worse than illustrated by EEOC       charges. As a result of this discrimination, too many women       must choose between their paychecks and a healthy pregnancy--      a choice that no one should have to make.        The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act would create a clear       policy standard requiring employers to provide reasonable       accommodations to pregnant workers. Support for a law like       this is nearly universal and bipartisan. Eighty-nine percent       of voters favor this bill, including 69 percent of voters who       strongly favor it. Just this Congress, thirty-five leading       private sector employers endorsed the Pregnant Workers       Fairness Act in an open letter to Congress.        More than 85 percent of women will become mothers at some       point in their working lives. And sometimes, an accommodation       is needed in order for a pregnant worker to continue       performing their job. Those accommodations are often small       changes to their work environment such as additional bathroom       breaks, a stool to sit on or the ability to have a water       bottle at their work station. Although minor, these       accommodations allow pregnant workers to stay in the       workforce and continue to provide for themselves and their       families. When pregnant workers are fired, demoted, or forced       into unpaid leave, they and their families lose critical       income, and they may struggle to re-enter a job market that       is particularly harsh for people who are currently or were       recently pregnant.        Pregnancy discrimination affects women across race and       ethnicity, but women of color and immigrants are at       particular risk. They are disproportionately likely to work       in jobs and industries where accommodations during pregnancy       are not often provided (such as home health aides, food       service workers, package handlers and cleaners). Black women       are much more likely than white women to file pregnancy       discrimination charges, they are also at a higher risk for       pregnancy-related complications like pre-term labor,       preeclampsia and hypertensive disorders making reasonable       accommodations on the job even more important,  [[Page H2325]]       and loss of wages and health insurance due to pregnancy       discrimination especially challenging.        To date, thirty-one states including the District of       Columbia and four cities have passed laws requiring employers       to provide reasonable accommodations to pregnant workers. But       the ability to maintain a healthy pregnancy and keep a job       should not depend on where a pregnant person works. Women are       a crucial part of the workforce and their participation       matters for the growth of our economy and for the stability       and wellbeing of families nationwide.        The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the conditions of       pregnant workers. Pregnant people are at a higher risk of       falling ill from COVID-19 and experiencing complications, and       thus require increased protections against the virus. Since       the beginning of the pandemic, pregnant workers have       experienced increased levels of workplace discrimination by       being denied accommodations and leave. The Pregnant Workers       Fairness Act would ensure that pregnant workers have access       to the accommodations they need in order to have a safe       workplace experience.        The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act would strengthen existing       federal protections, ensure more equitable workplaces and       allow women to remain in the workforce and maintain their       economic stability while having the accommodations necessary       for healthy pregnancies. It is time to clarify and strengthen       existing federal protections for pregnant workers by passing       the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act.        Sincerely,                                                  Debra L. Ness,                                                          President,                         National Partnership for Women & Families.     Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support  this bill.
