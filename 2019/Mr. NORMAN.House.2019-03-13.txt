 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in celebration of the life of  H. Leon Comer, Sr., who passed away at the age of 91 on Tuesday, March  5, 2019. He was a man born of humble means who never lost sight of  where he came from.   He was the son of the late John Stoll Comer, Sr., and Annie Lee Roach  Comer, where he was one of seven siblings. He was born in Rock Hill,  South Carolina, where he attended Oak Ridge Elementary School and later  served in the United States Merchant Marines.   He was married to Francis Watkins Comer for 64 years and had two  children, Brenda Comer Sutton and Leon ``Chip'' Comer, Jr.   Leon Comer believed in the value of hard work and, after working as a  manager of a beer distributor in the greater Rock Hill market for 12  years, he founded Comer Distributing in 1971, with only five employees,  distributing 250,000 cases of beer, with only three routes.   The original building, consisting of only 5,000 square feet, was  located on Pendleton Street, and later expanded to 17,000 square feet  to a much larger site on Carmel Road.   Comer Distributing expanded into the greater Columbia market in 2012  and, 1 year later, added another 11,200 square feet of space. The  company opened in a two-story office building in 2018, along with an  expanded warehouse. The company has grown to 70 employees, providing  1.5 million cases of a variety of brand-name beverages each year.   Leon retired in 1990; however, over the course of his lifetime, he  served on many boards, clubs, and commissions, including the Rock Hill  Economic Development Board; York County Natural Gas Authority; York  Masonic Lodge #385; Hejaz Shriners; Winthrop Eagle Club, where he was a  founding member; Ducks Unlimited; the South Carolina Beer Wholesalers  Association, serving twice as chairman of the board; the Waterfowl  Association; the American Legion; Frank Roach Post #34; the USC  Gamecock Club; and many more organizations and local groups.   Leon and his wife, Frances, were longtime members of St. John's  United Methodist Church, where he was very active for many years. The  lives that have been positively affected by the giving and donations to  Christian causes, such as the men's shelters and the Boys and Girls  Clubs, will be remembered for years to come.   The company is now being run by his son, Chip Comer, and the legacy  of his father can be summed up by the words of Chip when he said the  following: ``My father is the epitome of what I would always want to  be, as he taught me so many life lessons growing up.''   Leon Comer left an indelible imprint on the many lives that he  touched, and he will be remembered as a man who epitomized the meaning  of ``true service above self'' and was a man who dedicated his life to  serving his faith, his family, and his country.   May God bless Leon Comer and his family.                            ____________________
