 Mr. President, I wish to start this afternoon with a  reflection on what happened yesterday. We are thinking today of the  individuals who were hurt in the attack during the baseball practice in  Virginia, and, of course, we are praying for those who were injured. I  will list them. Many of the names we already know, but it is important  to list them.   Of course, Representative Steve Scalise from the State of Louisiana-- we are thinking of his family and praying for them, and we hope for his  speedy recovery. Matt Mika, who works for Tyson Foods, was also a  shooting victim like Representative Scalise. Zack Barth, who works for  Congressman Roger Williams, was a shooting victim, and Special Agent  Crystal Griner, of course, of the Capitol Police, who exhibited such  courage in the line of duty. We are thinking of Crystal at this time as  well.   We know there were individuals injured at the scene, including  Special Agent David Bailey of the Capitol Police, who was not shot,  apparently, but suffered an injury and was released from the hospital.  We are happy to hear he has been released. Representative Roger  Williams, who was hurt at the scene as well--not a shooting victim but  hurt--and, of course, two of  [[Page S3532]]  our colleagues were there at the time, Senator Rand Paul and Senator  Jeff Flake. We are thankful they were not injured in any way.   On these days, we come together as a family to remember those who  have been the victims, and we are thinking of them and their families  and praying for them.
