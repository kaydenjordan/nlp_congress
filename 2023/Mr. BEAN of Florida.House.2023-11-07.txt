 Mr. Speaker, in 1919, President Woodrow Wilson  declared November 11 as Armistice Day, a day in which to honor those  who gave their all in World War I.   In 1954, Congress amended Armistice Day to be inclusive of all  veterans who have fought for American freedom, effectively changing its  name to Veterans Day. It is on this day that we salute our remarkable,  brave patriots who keep America safe.   We the people enjoy the blessings of hard-earned peace, liberty, and  the pursuit of happiness because of our warriors who answered the call  to defend our Nation.   Our men and women in uniform are a constant reminder of the true  source of our Nation's greatness, and many veterans have freely given  the last full measure of their devotion for our Nation. Because of  their defense, our Nation remains strong, and our children can pursue  their dreams.   To our veterans, your loved ones have endured seasons without a  parent, a child, a sibling. On Veterans Day, we also recognize your  families and thank them for their sacrifice.   It is my greatest honor to represent so many heroes who have served  our Nation or who are serving our Nation from the Fourth Congressional  District of Florida. Just as they have fought for our country, I will  always fight for them.   Mr. Speaker, here is the truth about Veterans Day. It is not just one  day. It  [[Page H5474]]  is every day because every day America and her people cherish the  sacrifice and the service of our Nation's veterans.       October 7 Is Deadliest Day in Jewish History Since the Holocaust     Mr. Speaker, on October 7, hearts, minds, and  lives were forever changed. We believed hatred and murder of Jews to be  a thing of the past, but we were heartbreakingly wrong.   October 7 will go down as the deadliest day in Jewish history since  the Holocaust.   Today, our strongest ally in the Middle East, our friend, Israel, is  at war after enduring a multipronged terror attack by Hamas.   Let me be clear: Hamas is not a militant group. They are terrorists.   The atrocities that took place on October 7 by Hamas against innocent  Israelis were not the result of provocation. It was a massacre.    It was not in response to occupation of the Gaza Strip. It was a  massacre.   It was not a flare-up. It was a massacre.   If you take elderly women, mothers, the disabled, and children  hostage, or if you target families and slaughter and torture civilians  indiscriminately, you do not get to claim the moral high ground.   There can be no confusion about the war between Israel and Hamas. It  is good versus evil. It is civilization versus barbarism. It is self- defense against aggression.   We must be a voice for the truth, and here is the truth: At least  1,400 Israelis were murdered. More than 4,400 were severely injured.  More than 200 hostages were taken to be used as human shields. Twenty- seven Americans are dead, and 10 remain unaccounted for.   Make no mistake, Israel is shaken but is not defeated. The United  States must be bold and courageous in standing up for the nation of  Israel and the right for her to defend itself.   When fighting evil, there can be no neutrality. We must send a clear  message to Hamas and Hezbollah and those that fund them that the United  States stands with Israel today, tomorrow, and always.                            ____________________
