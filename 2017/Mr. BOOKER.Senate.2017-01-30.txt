 Mr. President, I rise in gratitude for the opportunity to  speak on the Senate floor. I want to express a lot of gratitude toward  the Senator from Massachusetts. She has been an advocate for the truth  of our country. She has spoken here on this hallowed floor. I have now  watched her speak in the streets, at airports, at rallies. She is one  of those people--like so many Americans, literally millions of  Americans over the course of these last few weeks--who is saying with  the force of conviction that they will not be silent when the cause of  our country is at stake.   I join with her tonight, along with some of my other colleagues, to  stand up and really speak from the heart. I think this floor has seen  many partisan speeches, but this is not going to be about Republican or  Democrat. This is not a speech I ever imagined I would be giving in the  U.S. Senate. I never thought I would be here today talking about  something that quite honestly was unimaginable to me just months ago.   This is a time I could not have foreseen, and I fear my generation of  Americans maybe, perhaps, should have known that moments like this are  possible; that we who believe in the values of our Nation, we who  believe in the ideals enshrined in our Constitution, such as religious  liberty, we should know that every generation of Americans has to prove  worthy of these ideals and stay forever vigilant in their protection  and never get so complacent as to think that this could never happen.  The ideals we enjoy were fought for and struggled for and often bled  for and died for. We of our generation who have the privileges we  enjoy, the blessings of liberty that we luxuriate in, we have the  obligation to stay the course to ensure that these moments never come,  and when they do, that we stand with conviction to speak out against  them, work against them to resist any retrenchment of American values.   What Donald Trump did in this Executive action issued this past  Friday is, in no uncertain terms, a break with American policy. I  believe it is a violation of our very Constitution, that it is illegal,  unconstitutional, as well as immoral. More than this, it very  specifically makes this Nation less safe and not more so. I want to  repeat that. It makes this Nation less safe and not more so.   The ban was put forth in a climate of fear, intending to try to  appeal to people's fears, trying to tell people that doing this  Executive order was going to make us safer, but in its essence it is  illogical when you look at the facts. Not only should it be known that  it blocks immigration from seven majority Muslim countries--seven  countries. Not a single perpetrator of terrorist attacks on American  soil has come from these countries, dating back to well before 9/11. In  fact, well before 2000, well before the nineties, well before the  eighties and, in fact, not since the seventies, in over 40 years, no  American has been killed on American soil by any of these countries in  terrorist attacks.   In addition to that, what this ban is doing is it is shutting down  the Refugee Resettlement Program for about 4 months and suspends the  Syrian refugee program indefinitely, despite the fact that individuals  entering the United States as refugees undergo the most heavily vetted  resettlement process of anybody traveling into the United States.   So understand this. If you are trying to come into this country  through student visas, Visa Waiver Programs, there are so many ways to  come into this country without going through the refugee process, which  takes between 1 year and 3 years, and you are not just going through  the vetting of the Department of State but also the Department of  Defense, the Department of Homeland Security, the FBI, the National  Counterterrorism Center, numerous agencies for over up to 3 years are  vetting you. Let me tell you right now, again, people who go through  this  [[Page S480]]  program, history is showing, you have not seen in any recent years that  folks going through these programs pose a terrorist threat or are  taking American lives. So the very argument being used to push this ban  is illogical and has no basis for any of the experiences we have had in  this country.   A former chief counsel for U.S. Citizenship and Immigration services  remarked that no competent terrorist would choose the U.S. refugee  process as a preferred strategy for gaining entry into this country.  Subjecting yourself to the 1 to 3 years of vetting from multiple  agencies, more than any other way to enter, is not a way for terrorists  to try to gain access to this country at all.   What we see is that this terrorist ban is putting focus--excuse me,  this Executive order is putting focus in areas that do not produce  safety but do have the collateral consequence of making us less safe.   The order indefinitely suspends the resettlement of Syrian refugees  in the United States. The majority of these folks are women and  children who are fleeing barrel bombs, chemical attacks, military  attacks on homes and schools. They are fleeing famine, they are fleeing  starvation, they are fleeing the same violent extremism that we  ourselves are trying to fight against. While the Syrian people face  violence, terror, and oppression, the President has chosen to equate  helpless refugees with those who are actually perpetrating the terror.  Despite the fact that we have this stringent years-long vetting program  for Iraqis and Afghans who risked their lives to help Americans by  acting as interpreters, the ban ends--astonishingly, it ends a Special  Immigrant Visa Program and substitutes it with nothing.   What is this Special Immigrant Visa Program that many of my  colleagues have spoken about? It is a program that is specifically  there for Iraqis and Afghans who helped America and put their families  in danger, who put their necks out for us. They put themselves out  there to assist our servicemen and servicewomen. It actually is there  to help people who, because of their service to us and our country, now  have their lives endangered where they are.   I want to read a series of tweets just yesterday from Kirk Johnson, a  former USAID Administrator in Iraq who wrote about these folks who put  themselves on the line for Americans who are our allies and our  friends. This is what Kirk Johnson wrote:         I served in Iraq as USAID's man in Fallujah. Lived       alongside Marines and interpreters as they fought terrorists.        Over 100,000 of these Iraqis risked their lives for us       during the war. They bled for our country.        You said, before signing--    He is talking about President Trump--         ``We only want to admit those into our country who will       support our country, and love deeply our people.''    And what Kirk Johnson wrote follows:         I'd like you to know [Donald Trump] about some of these       people.        ``Homeboy'' lost his leg dragging a wounded U.S. SSgt from       MN out of the field of fire. He spent 4 years being vetted       before coming here.        Hossam helped us build schools. When insurgents found out,       in Oct `06, they left a severed dog head on his front step       that said ``run.''        Faisal, an interpreter for the troops you command [Donald       Trump], died of a suicide bomb on 3/14/2008.        Mohammed was assassinated when terrorists, who wanted to       kill the ``traitor'' booby-trapped his house in Jan 2008.        Ali had both his legs amputated by an IED blast while       working as an interpreter in Nov 2007.        Hameed died of a gunshot wound to the head while helping       our troops in July 2007.    I could do this all day, sadly.   He wrote in his remarks. He goes on to say:         Those that helped us were Christians, Muslims, Yazidis,       atheists, you name it.    These people in Fallujah and the surrounding areas were our allies.         When they ran through gunfire to save our troops, they       didn't think about such labels.        These Iraqis believed in America. They loved our country.       They lost their country as a result of the choice they made       to help us.        Your signature [Donald Trump] just banned them.    He continues:         I have heard from many, many soldiers and Marines (some of       extremely high rank) who believe this is a huge mistake.        One senior military officer with extensive experience in       Iraq and Afghanistan told me it was ``heinous and       counterproductive.''    Now why is it counterproductive? Well, for one, when we are  conducting dangerous missions, when we are relying on people in country  to assist us with our counterterrorism efforts, if they are going to  take that risk, put their lives on the line, be subjected to terrorism  themselves, there should be a process that allows them, after proper  vetting, to get into this country. That has been American policy. Even  people who have been threatened, victimized, and persecuted can't just  walk into our country because some of our high-ranking Marines say so.  They still go through vetting that often takes years. That is the  process. It is a process that Donald Trump has now stopped.   Yesterday a report noted that radical jihadists--the people we are  fighting against, the terrorists intending to kill us--were already  using this Executive order as a victory, proof that the United States  is at war with Islam. Now some people say that claim is hard to make.  This is just banning people from seven countries. Well, look a little  closer at the Executive order. There are exceptions made for non- Muslims in those countries.   Imagine this. We are the United States of America. Enshrined in our  Constitution is this idea of freedom of religion; that there is no  religious test to vote, there is no religious test to have citizenship,  there is no religious test to enjoy the richness of a nation that  believes in religious liberty. But in one action by the President of  the United States, who claims to be concerned about terrorism from  these countries, he says: I am going to stop people from entering. Oh,  wait a minute, only Muslims. Christians are welcome. If that is not a  violation of core principles of freedom of religion that there should  be religious tests to enter from these countries--that is an assault on  all we proclaim in our country to be our core values.   This is not missed by our enemies. They are now trying to say this  isn't a war between America and ISIS. This isn't a war between America  and radical jihadists. They want, as a propaganda tool, for people to  believe that this is a war between the United States and Islam, between  America and a religion. That is a lie. But when Donald Trump takes  actions like this that specifically target people because of their  faith, he is playing into the hands of the propagandists who seek to  hurt us.   National security experts from across the political spectrum, from  Republicans and Democrats, have spoken out against this order on this  basis and on how it will affect our security as a country.   The former Director of the CIA, Gen. Michael Hayden, said of this  order that it ``inarguably has made us less safe.''   Those people who want to help us, who want to serve with our marines,  who want to be interpreters, who want to stand up for America, what are  they to think now when America has shut its doors, when they have  watched others do this, and now they can't gain access to this country?  What about those allies of ours who say that the great United States of  America is standing up against terrorism and Muslim leaders in other  countries? But it is not about Islam; it is about the people who are  conducting vicious terrorism, which is a sin on a peaceful religion.  What can our allies say now, when we have specifically targeted an  Executive order from our President not at a country but at a people who  pray a certain way in that country?   What are we to think in the United States? This great Nation born  from the ideas of liberty and freedom--freedom to pray as we want--what  are we to think?   Despite all of the evidence to the contrary, just 2 days after  President Trump instituted this ban, he remarked: Hey, this ban is  going ``nicely.'' Earlier today, President Trump's spokesman referred  to those being unlawfully detained as just being ``temporarily  inconvenienced.''   We know that the reality of the situation is much different for the  families and individuals across the globe who are affected. Many of  them are permanent residents and green card holders for whom this  Executive order has amounted to a door slammed in their face by the  country that is supposed to represent the shining beacon on the planet  Earth of liberty and hope.  [[Page S481]]    Hundreds of people of seven different nationalities have been trapped  at American airports. Many of them were detained for hours on end  without access to lawyers; they were handcuffed and interrogated; some  were immediately deported, while many more have been turned away at the  doors to their flights bound for the United States. These are people  who followed all of the rules, who went through extensive vetting, who  upended their lives--doors slammed in their faces.   I am sorry, but this is not an inconvenience. This is a denial of  process, a denial of procedure; it is a denial of basic liberty and a  violation of our principles.   It is no wonder, though, that judges across the country began issuing  stays within hours of this order becoming effective. As we saw in New  York, how people like Hamidyah Al Saeedi, the 65-year-old mother of a  sergeant--65-year-old mother of a sergeant in the 82nd Airborne  Division of the U.S. Army, who traveled from Iraq to see her son for  the first time in 5 years. A mother of a sergeant in the 82nd  Airborne--someone who should be honored--lawfully entered the United  States, and because of this order, she was detained for 30 hours,  denied a wheelchair, and handcuffed, before her release.   On Saturday night and early into the morning, I saw Customs and  Border Patrol officials at Dulles. I left Washington, DC, and drove to  Virginia to go to Dulles Airport. I saw Customs and Border Patrol  officials seemingly defy the orders coming from a Federal judge to at  least permit all legal permanent residents in detention access to legal  counsel. I held the judge's order in my hands. Because of the kindness  of a local law enforcement officer who was stationed in Dulles, I was  able to shuttle to Customs and Border Patrol, and I was then able to  submit handwritten notes and questions to the officials who refused to  meet with me. I did not get much of an explanation as to why they were  defying a clear order from a Federal judge. Whether or not this was a  case of bureaucratic confusion or a message from the courts getting  lost, Federal law enforcement officers, under the supervision of the  Department of Homeland Security, ignored and defied the orders of a  Federal judge.   To me, this is more reason for outrage. In a Nation with three  branches of government, the judiciary with a clear role giving an order  to the executive branch, I believe the defiance of that order also was  unconstitutional.   Access to counsel is a principle in our democracy. It is about  fairness and due process. Failing to allow access to counsel, to me,  seems a clear violation of constitutional norms and ideals. The judge  obviously believes so, and that is why he ordered counsel to be  provided.   Still, right now, we don't know how many people are being detained  across the country in the wake of this Executive order or how many were  immediately and quietly deported once they came here again, thoroughly  vetted, in accordance with the law, but they were still deported upon  their arrival in this country. I think Congress deserves answers. I  wrote to Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly earlier this evening to  seek them.   This mistreatment of any legal permanent resident or visitors to this  country is wrong. It is un-American. It undermines the truth of who we  are. It is patently unacceptable.   This Executive order has treated green card holders and immigrants in  this Nation as if they were criminals. It has torn families apart  across the world and pulled the rug out from families who were  preparing to begin a new life in the United States of America. And this  order has betrayed some of our closest allies--men and women who risked  their lives to help American servicemembers deployed often on hostile  soil. Ending the special immigrant visa programs established to help  Iraqis and Afghans who risked their lives to help American forces is  unacceptable. The United States cannot turn its back on those who  stepped up and stepped in when we needed them most.   Just this morning, I read about an Iraqi man, Sami, who had risked  his life to work with the American Government in Iraq. After waiting 7  years to gain entry, going through a laborious process of vetting under  the special immigrant visa program, he and his family finally got the  OK, and they were ready to start their new lives in America. On  Saturday, he and his wife and two daughters had flown from Iraq to  Istanbul, and they were sitting in their seats ready to take off when  they were removed from the plane by security officials. Foreign Policy  magazine reported that, through tears, Sami's 7-year-old daughter  asked, ``Why don't they want us in America?''   American servicemembers and veterans are joining a growing core,  speaking out against this misguided decision which threatens the  commonsense program that helps our military do their jobs.   Take Zachary Iscol, a former Marine infantry officer who wrote about  some of the Iraqis he worked with who had risked everything to help the  United States. He told the story of one man, Frank, who had served as  an interpreter for his Marine Corps unit and, in doing so, had taken a  bullet in his leg. Frank had remained in Iraq since then. Zachary  wrote:         He was still living in Baghdad with daily fears for his and       his family's safety. After six years of vetting, including       what seemed like countless interviews and background checks       by various government agencies, he had finally been cleared       to come to the United States with his pregnant wife and 18-      month-old son.    Zachary went on to write:         My wife and I began to prepare our guest room for their       arrival. But now, because of a new executive order by       President Trump, Frank is no longer welcome.    This is an American military man, preparing to have these folks who  put their lives on the line for him, stay in his home.   This special visa program is why people like Mohammed and Saif  Alnasseri, whom I am proud to call Jersey residents--two of my  constituents--were able to come to this country. I would like to share  a little bit about this family.   Mohammed Alnasseri was finishing high school in Iraq in 2003 when the  Americans arrived. As an English speaker, Mohammed began helping the  Americans stationed near his neighborhood, working for free as their  neighborhood translator. When the unit he had become friends with left,  he decided to apply for work as an official interpreter with the U.S.  Army. By 2004, he had been sent to Fallujah to work with and help  protect American military fighting there. Because of his work with the  American military, he recounts receiving hundreds of death notes,  threatening not just his life but the life of his mother and his  family.   He returned to Baghdad where he worked, despite these threats, as a  contractor with an American company until one day he was targeted and  almost assassinated in his car. He knew at that point, with the death  threats and the assassination attempt, that he had to get out of the  country.   After moving to Australia, his sister informed him about America's  special visa program, so he applied, and 2\1/2\ years later he was able  to join his family in the United States.   In a call with my office just earlier today, he wanted to make it  clear that he arrived in the United States on July 3, and by August 10,  he had started his job. He remarked to my team that he couldn't  understand why anyone would think he was coming to America because it  was easy or because he wanted something. He spent most of his savings  trying to get to America, and he had never taken any benefit since  arriving here.   Mohammed met his wife in New Jersey and now lives in our State, works  at Costco, and is working to obtain his citizenship. He shared that  this Executive order made him more sad than scared and that it simply  didn't make sense to ban regular, hard-working people who are also  afraid of terrorists, persecuted by terrorists, almost killed by  terrorists, and who had done so much to help our country. It made no  sense to them.   This is what he said: ``We ran away from these people. I paid all the  money I had to leave.'' He did that for the safety of his family.   Mohammed's brother is now a proud American citizen, father of two,  and resident of Scotch Plains, NJ. Saif and his wife had worked as  pharmacists in Iraq, but when the war began, he knew he needed to get  involved. So Saif worked as a translator and reporter for  [[Page S482]]  the Los Angeles Times during the war in Iraq, providing support and key  insights to the American media and the American public. They were able  to come to the United States in 2008 through that special visa  program--the SIV program--and slowly worked their way through school.  Now, as pharmacy technicians, they have their pharmacy licenses.   Saif is a pharmacy manager in Cranford, NJ, a homeowner in Scotch  Plains, and a proud father of two girls. He savors this country, this  precious Nation. He celebrates our values. He is a glowing testimony to  the truth of who we are. His success is our success. His family's  security and safety and thriving lives in New Jersey give luster to the  greatness of America.   In a phone call yesterday, Saif remarked that this Executive order  was embarrassing and hurtful, that it was clear Muslims were being  targeted, and that he couldn't understand why those who were so heavily  vetted like his family posed such a threat.   Saif and his family are heavily involved in their community in Scotch  Plains, and they make sure to offer support to families similar to  theirs who come from Iraq seeking refuge. They are not just basking and  luxuriating in their good fortune to become American citizens; they are  honoring one of the great hallowed traditions of our country, which is  service.   At the end of the call, Saif remarked that ``[he] didn't think this  would happen in any other country.'' It seemed like he was about to say  this kind of religiously targeted ban wouldn't happen anywhere else,  and he might have been right. But instead, he said that ``if this kind  of executive order from a leader in any other country happened against  any group of people, you would never see the kind of resistance and  action of so many standing up for them.''   Even in one of the darkest moments in recent history, this man, this  patriot, this person who served our Nation's interests and continues to  volunteer in service to this day, could have every reason to be angry,  upset, and cynical. But what is beautiful from our conversations with  this man is that he hasn't given up faith. He still believes in the  American people.   The beautiful thing about the conversations my staff has had with  those New Jersey residents who once were serving our Nation in theaters  of violence and terrorism, standing up for our military, for our press,  victimized by terroristic threats, shot at, assassination attempts-- these families now here in America witnessing this Executive order are  saddened and embarrassed by it, but they are not giving up in their  faith in America. That is our story.   I stand here today--dare I say, all of the Members of the Senate  stand here today because of this tradition of our country, that even  when we had dark chapters from our past where others in positions of  power violated our values, the faith and activism and engagement of  American people remained.   I dare say we are the oldest constitutional democracy on the planet  Earth. God, the genius of our Founders who put on paper ideals that  have been heralded for centuries on planet Earth. Newer constitutional  democracies literally would study our Constitution and model their  nations after elements of our Constitution. I am sad to tell you that  some of those countries' democracies have failed. They had the vaunted  words, they put forth the same principles and ideals, but their  countries' democracies have been overthrown, have seen despots who  destroyed the very spirit of those ideals.   Why has America persisted? It is not just because of the documents  that are sacred and so special in the course of human events. But what  makes those documents true and real--because those sentiments are not  just written on parchment; every generation has had them written on  their hearts and have said: No matter what I may be experiencing in  this country, I am going to dedicate myself to the principles and  ideals, because as great as our Founders were when they founded this  country in liberty and in justice and equality under the law, it didn't  apply to everyone. It didn't apply to women. Native Americans were  referred to as savages. African Americans were fractions of human  beings. Yet the faith of a people in every generation worked to expand  the concepts of liberty and freedom. They made the Constitution more  real. They made our Union more perfect. They made our country's truth  more true for more people.   It is why great poets like Langston Hughes wrote:         America never was America to me,        And yet I swear this oath--        America will be!    That is the call to the citizenry of this country.   There have been dark days in our past, but every generation of  Americans, despite the dark actions of people in power, understands the  truth that the power of the people is greater than the people in power.  If we never lose faith in the ideals of this Nation, if we keep  standing and working and sacrificing and struggling, every generation  could advance the ideals of our country and make us more free and more  true and more real for more people.   Last week, we saw yet another American leader shrink the ideals of  this country, try to pull us backward to times past when we turned our  backs on people fleeing persecution. What Donald Trump did is try to  pull back on the ideals inscribed on that great statue that sits right  next to New Jersey, the mother of exiles, who says in poetry, among  other things, ``give us''--not ``Hey, you can come in'' but a demand:         Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning       to breathe free,        The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.    It is a demand to the world that we will take those who are  oppressed, we will take those who are being violated, we will take  those who are being victimized. A President turns his back on those  ideals. We have seen it before.   Dr. Lauren Feldman wrote to me about chapters of dark pasts. She  wrote:         Today is Holocaust Remembrance Day. I am a Jew. My       relatives were unable to find refuge in our country and were       murdered by the Nazis. My grandmother lost her beloved aunt,       Rokhl Rosnick Gertman, and an uncle and 4 young cousins that       she never met. Had we as a country done the right thing and       welcomed the refugees fleeing the Nazis, Tante Rokhl and       millions of others could have joined their family members in       safety and we could have been proud of our country, instead       of ashamed of the racist paper walls built by the FDR       administration to keep my family and others out.        Please tell Mr. Trump that we cannot go back. We must be a       beacon of safety and refuge for the persecuted. Please do all       that you can to prevent this ban from being enacted. Please       think of my relatives and the relatives of your other       constituents and fellow citizens who were needlessly and       shamefully murdered because of our fear and racism. We are       better than that. You are better than that.    She concludes, ``Thank you for your time and service. Dr. Lauren  Feldman, Princeton.''   We are the United States of America. We haven't been perfect, but  there has been a striving and a yearning in every generation to be more  so.   I am a product of people Black and White, Christian and Jewish and  Muslim, who, even though issues didn't affect them directly, knew that  injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. They marched and  they fought. They sat in. They got on buses for freedom rides knowing  they would be bombed. They tried to cross bridges, standing up against  law enforcement, State troopers, Governors who dared them to try to  pass them. There were implacable walls of hatred and racism, but they  stood anyway, and they bled the southern soil red--for my freedom, for  our freedom, for this Nation's freedom.   I have worked all my career for the safety of communities. Yes, we  must make sure our Nation is safe. But don't let fear and concern for  safety ever make us ever turn our backs on our values as a nation. When  we are threatened by our enemies, it is not a time to surrender our  values, it is time to double down on them. The terrorists win if they  change our free hearts and our souls set on liberty.   We as a nation are called to be great, to be a beacon of liberty and  justice. There are people now pulled off of airplanes, forced to return  to communities where their lives are being threatened. We made a  bargain with them: Stand for America. Stand with our military. Stand  against terrorism.   There are people who went through years and years of vetting by  agency after agency, and when they were on the brink of freedom, like  people of old who were on ships that came into our harbor, they were  turned away, back to  [[Page S483]]  face persecution and injustice. That is not the America I believe in.  It is not who we are.   So I say to our President in prayer, in deep abiding faith: Repeal  your Executive order. Stand up for our principles. Defend them. Be the  champion millions of Americans want you to be.   I say to Americans, to all of us as a country: This is not a time to  despair. It is not a time to give up. It is not a time to grow cynical  or lose faith in our country or our values. No, remember our history.  When dark times come, when it seems that people in the highest points  of power are turning their backs on their ideals, it is not a time to  retreat or equivocate, it is a time to fight, to stand up, to resist.   We are a great nation not just because of the words printed on a  Constitution; we are a great nation because people with great sacrifice  and struggle fought to live those words and to make them real in the  lives of every single person.   America, we must now stand up. The opposite of justice is not just  injustice; it is silence and indifference. This may not affect you or  your family directly, but it is a threat to all of our collective  values.   Go to the Jefferson Memorial and read those final words. Thomas  Jefferson knew that for this Nation to be great, we had to pledge to  each other an unusual level of commitment. He said that we must  mutually pledge to each other our lives, our fortunes, and our sacred  honor.   There is no honor in this Executive order. We as Americans now must  pledge our sacred honor to do all we can to tear this order down so  that the truth of America can rise again.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Rounds). The Senator from Connecticut.
