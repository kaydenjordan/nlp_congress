 Madam Speaker, I rise today to give voice, not just to the  80 percent of my constituents whose heritage lies in Asia and the  Pacific, but to all I represent; that we join with our brothers and  sisters across our country in solidarity; that hate against any of us  based on our race, our ethnicity, our heritage, is hate against us all;  that this must end here now.   I rise today to recognize my Senator, Mazie Hirono, a pioneer in her  own right, who brought this message to us in anger and in faith. I rise  today for my granddaughter, 2-year-old, Cadence Masako Ansdell, and for  millions like her for whom we must, today, make this choice, that when  they come of age, they will know only the harsh lessons of their past  and not the tragic reality of their present.   Madam Speaker, I rise for us all.
