 Madam Speaker, the latest disastrous Norfolk Southern  train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio, traveled through my district  before its crash.   Unfortunately, this follows another dangerous derailment last October  in Sandusky, Ohio--in my district--at the busy Columbus bridge  overpass.   One half year later, it is clear that Norfolk Southern repairs have  seriously lagged at this main artery into Sandusky, Ohio. Rail  companies have failed to restore this vital main artery into the city  of Sandusky, Ohio.   In a year where Norfolk Southern's rail barons brought in--get  ready--$3.27 billion in profits, the companies ought to invest in the  necessary safety protocols and immediate repairs to prevent such  disasters from happening again across northern Ohio's busiest corridor.   The current and long-term health and safety for rail workers, for  residents of communities in East Palestine and Sandusky must be  America's top priority. America cannot allow rail chieftains to exploit  communities and working people's safety while in turn padding their own  pocketbook with billions of dollars of money.   The time to change course in rail safety is now.                            ____________________
