 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend and  distinguished Member of Congress, Mr. Hastings, for providing me the  opportunity to speak today on behalf of deported veterans.   Mr. Speaker, setting the record for the most closed Congress is not a  proud accomplishment. Our job is in our title: Representatives. We  represent the American people.   According to the most recent Gallup poll, 78 percent of Americans  disapprove of the way Congress is handling itself. Can you blame them?   When I came to Congress, I heard from constituents and Americans  across the country about the injustice of deported veterans.   I heard from Arnold Giammarco from Connecticut, who was deported to  Italy after coming to the United States at the age of 4 and honorably  serving our country.   I heard from Gerardo Armijo, a Purple Heart recipient in my district,  who was brought to the United States as an infant. He served two tours  in Iraq, came home honorably discharged with PTSD after he suffered  major injuries from an IED, and failed to get the care that he needed  from the Veterans Administration. Due to drugs and alcohol, he found  himself in some trouble and is now deported.   These stories are flooding in from all corners of the globe. We are  deporting honorably discharged veterans after promising them  citizenship. This is a disgrace.
