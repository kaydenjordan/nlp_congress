 Mr. President, 160 years ago, Abraham Lincoln reminded  us that ``at all times . . . all American citizens are brothers of a  common country, and should dwell together in the bonds of fraternal  feeling.''   That bond--our commitment to coming together to move our country  forward, our embrace of the challenges our country faces because we  know we will come out of these moments strong--has made the United  States exceptional.   As we approach the Fourth of July holiday, I want to take a moment to  recognize what makes America who she is today and the values that have  allowed us to carry on the Great American Experiment for 244 years.   The United States--the shining city on a hill, the land of  opportunity, the land of the free and the home of the brave, the red,  white, and blue--our country is exceptional precisely because we have  never settled for anything less.   It was that very reason it was Americans who first discovered  electricity, built the airplane, put a man on the Moon, developed  chemotherapy, and that other countries look to us for leadership during  troubled times. It is why we prevailed in two world wars, defeated the  axis of evil, and have since maintained the greatest Armed Forces in  the world. It is why the ideal of the American dream exists.   Importantly, it is the American people, past and present, who have  shaped our American character--the 56 men who put their lives on the  line to draft and sign the Declaration of Independence in 1776; the  volunteer army of farmers and shopkeepers who defeated the British and  today has grown into the best fighting force the world has ever seen.   Fifty-five Americans came together to write the U.S. Constitution,  guaranteeing the freedoms for Americans to worship, to speak out, to  bear arms, and to peaceably assemble. In the years that followed,  America fulfilled its promise to form a more perfect union while  acknowledging it is not perfect but always striving to do better.   We ended the injustice of slavery; 100 years ago this year, gave  women the right to vote; overcame the Great Depression; fought for the  equal rights of all Americans during the civil rights movement; and  persevered after September 11.   Today we still have those heroes who make America what she is today.  We see these works in our midst every day: our service men and women  who bravely protect us across the globe and keep the enemy away from  our shores; the dedicated men and women of law enforcement who work  tirelessly to keep our communities and our families safe; our teachers,  who provide the gift of education to our youth; our doctors and nurses,  who save lives every day and have bravely taken on the challenge of  COVID-19.   American exceptionalism started with our humble beginnings, and it  has endured throughout the challenges our country faces.   It is tempting to focus on the divisions in America today, but we  have much more in common that unites us. This Fourth of July is a  reminder of the blessings of life, liberty, and the pursuit of  happiness that all Americans deserve.   President Reagan once said:         Freedom is a fragile thing and is never more than one       generation away from extinction. It is not ours by       inheritance; it must be fought for and defended constantly by       each generation, for it comes only once to a people.    I agree, and I hope this Fourth of July we can stand together, proud  that we will strive to make this country a more perfect union.   I yield the floor.
