 Madam Speaker, I rise today to call attention to the  significant mail backlogs we are experiencing in northern Ohio, across  the whole region, Cleveland to Toledo, impacting the timely and  reliable delivery of mail.   Postal employees do remarkable work every day to execute their  mission.   To the tens of thousands of military veterans who work for the Postal  Service, we owe you an enormous debt of gratitude for your continued  loyal service to our Nation.   However, the decision by the U.S. Postal Service Board of Directors  and management to implement disastrous policies to consolidate  processing centers and ship local mail hundreds of miles away to be  sorted elsewhere is truly illogical.   While we are finally seeing incremental progress being made, our  region is still in desperate need for constructive solutions to the  backups and slow processing people are enduring on the ground.   I will continue working with my colleagues from across our country  and across the aisle until we bring about new Postal Service leadership  and fully restore the service our people and communities richly deserve  and expect.                            ____________________
