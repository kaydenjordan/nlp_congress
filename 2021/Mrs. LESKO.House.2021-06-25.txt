 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me time.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this resolution.   America's oil and gas industry is truly the backbone of the American  economy, supporting 10 million jobs and contributing to billions of  dollars of economic development in all 50 States.   The energy industry is critical to our economic and national  security, providing low and stable energy prices to American families  and ensuring our independence from the Middle East and Russia.   Despite these essential contributions, Democrats here are attempting  to strap the industry with duplicative and unnecessary regulations.  This resolution will contribute to American job losses and higher  energy costs for American consumers, right on their energy bills.   This will also not reduce worldwide emissions, and the reason is  because China is building coal-fired power plants at a rate that  outpaces the rest of the world combined.   So what we are doing here with not only this resolution, but the  other policies that my friends on the other side of the aisle are  pushing, is we are actually hurting America, losing American jobs,  giving up our energy independence so we are reliant on China and Russia  and the Middle East.   Why in the world would we do that? Mr. Lamb said this is for America.  I totally disagree. This will hurt America and this bill will help  China and Russia.   Mr. Speaker, I oppose this resolution.
