 MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong  support of this bill, the 8-K Trading Gap Act. I thank Mr. San Nicolas  for yielding and for his leadership on the committee, and, of course,  Chairwoman Waters.   This bill would fix a loophole in our current law that allows  corporate executives to trade on information before it is disclosed to  the public and to their own shareholders.   Right now, when there is a significant corporate event in a public  company, the company has to disclose that event to the public by filing  a form 8-K within 4 days of the event occurring. Of course, during this  4-day gap, executives at the company know about the significant event,  but other investors do not.   There has been research from academics at Columbia Law School and  Harvard Law School that shows that executives do actually trade in this  4-day gap and profit significantly from it. In fact, one of the authors  of this study was Robert Jackson, who is now an SEC Commissioner.   Commissioner Jackson brought this issue to my attention when he was  still an academic, and I would like to thank him for his hard work on  this issue.   My bill would address this problem by simply prohibiting executives  from trading during this 4-day gap that they know about and the public  doesn't, which is clearly illegal.   When SEC Chairman Clayton testified before the Financial Services  Committee, I asked him about this bill. He said that he thought it was  ``good corporate hygiene that, once a determination has been made that  there is a material event to disclose, that the company's insider  trading policy . . . would have a control in there where the senior  executives would not be allowed to trade.''   This is basically an endorsement of this bill. That is exactly what  my bill would do, and I think it is just plain common sense.   I very much want to thank Ranking Members McHenry, Huizenga, and Hill  for their work with me on this bill, and I would also like to thank  Chairwoman Waters for her support.   I urge my colleagues to support it. It is a commonsense, good- government bill. It will help investors and help the entire system.    MALONEY of New York.
