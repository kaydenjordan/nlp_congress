 Mr. President, I thank the ranking member for his  outstanding efforts, along with many others.   What I would like to do now is yield to Senator McCain, and I will  speak last.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.   Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank the Democratic leader for his  courtesy, as always.   In just the last 3 years, under Vladimir Putin, Russia has invaded  Ukraine, annexed Crimea, threatened NATO allies, and intervened  militarily in Syria, leaving a trail of death, destruction, and broken  promises in his wake. Of course, last year Russia attacked the  foundations of American democracy with a cyber and information campaign  to interfere in America's 2016 election.   I am proud--I am proud--of the two individuals who just spoke, the  Senator from Maryland and the Senator from Tennessee. Both of them have  worked in a bipartisan fashion and got legislation to this floor.  Although it is long overdue, it is here. I believe we will see an  overwhelming vote, and I thank them for their bipartisanship.   In the last 8 months, what price has Russia paid for attacking  American democracy? Very little. This legislation would begin to change  that. The legislation would impose mandatory sanctions on transactions  with the Russian defense or intelligence sectors, including the FSB and  the GRU, and the Russian military intelligence agency which was  primarily responsible for Russia's attack on our election.   I believe my colleagues know what is in this. It would codify  existing sanctions on Russia by placing into law six Executive orders  signed by President Obama in response to both Russian interference in  the 2016 election and its illegal actions in Ukraine, and it would take  new steps to tighten those sanctions.   The legislation would target the Russian energy sector, which is  controlled by Vladimir Putin's cronies, with sanctions on investment in  Russian petroleum and natural gas development as well as Russian energy  pipelines.   My friends, the United States of America needs to send a strong  message to Vladimir Putin and any other aggressor that we will not  tolerate attacks on our democracy. That is what this bill is all about.  We must take our own side in this fight, not as Republicans, not as  Democrats but as Americans.   It is time to respond to Russia's attack on American democracy with  strength, with resolve, with common purpose, and with action. I am  proud to have played a small role. What I am most proud of is the  bipartisanship you are seeing manifested today on both sides of the  aisle. We need a little more of it.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from  Arizona for his dedication to our national security, for his tremendous  involvement in this legislation, and all that he does on behalf of all  of us to make sure that our Nation is secure.   Thank you so much for those comments and for your deep involvement in  this piece of legislation.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.    Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from  Arizona for his dedication to our national security, for his tremendous  involvement in this legislation, and all that he does on behalf of all  of us to make sure that our Nation is secure.   Thank you so much for those comments and for your deep involvement in  this piece of legislation.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.    Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from  Arizona for his dedication to our national security, for his tremendous  involvement in this legislation, and all that he does on behalf of all  of us to make sure that our Nation is secure.   Thank you so much for those comments and for your deep involvement in  this piece of legislation.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.    I thank the minority leader for his comments, and I yield  a moment to Senator Crapo, who played an outstanding role as the leader  of our committee.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.    I yield the floor to Senator Menendez.    I yield the floor to Senator Menendez.    I yield the floor to Senator Menendez.    I thank the Senator from New Jersey for his outstanding  leadership on Iran and his leadership on Russia and North Korea. He has  led us for years and years in sanctioning Iran and has brought them to  the table. I thank him for that.   For those who are here and want to vote, I am going to yield 1 minute  to Senator Gardner. I am going to speak for about a minute and a half,  and to my knowledge, we will be ready to vote. I thank all of my  colleagues for their patience.   Senator Gardner.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.    I thank the Senator for his leadership on North Korea,  and I thank him for speaking.   Mr. President, I will be very brief, as I normally am. This bill has  taken passion, tenacity, and all of us working together to bring out  the best in this body and to get to this point where we are today. I  want to thank everybody who has been involved.   Senator Cardin has been an outstanding ranking member. As always, we  worked together, just as we did today on another markup, to get to  where we are. We have Senators Crapo and Brown. I think there were  about four committees working to get this piece of legislation out. It  was an incredible effort working around the clock for days and nights.  I want to thank them for their leadership.   I want to thank Senator Menendez, again, for his involvement, in  particular on Iran, but on all of these issues.   Certainly, thanks go to Senators McCain and Graham for their  tremendous leadership in beginning the process, especially on Russia.  Thank you so much.   Thank you, Senator Schumer and Senator McConnell, for giving us the  freedom to operate under regular order, the freedom to operate in the  committee process, which I know all of us long to get to on all issues  that we deal with here, and thank you to all of those Members who have  been so involved. Our staffs have been incredible. Thank you so much  for the professionalism, the knowledge, the energy, and the willingness  to work late hours to make this happen.   The attributes of this legislation have been discussed. I think we  all are ready for this moment. We are all ready to speak to what Russia  has done to our country and to others, to speak to what Iran is doing  outside of the nuclear agreement, and to speak to what North Korea  continues to do.   One attribute that hasn't been spoken to is this: It has been my goal  as chairman, working with the ranking member, that Congress continue to  be more and more relevant and to garner back the powers that we have  given to the executive branch for decades. One of the most important  attributes of this legislation is the congressional review, where, when  major decisions are made, Congress is involved; Congress has a say. I  hope we will build upon that, not only in foreign policy but in other  matters.   I want to thank all involved.   I urge a strong vote on this piece of legislation that sends a strong  message to Iran, to Russia, and to North Korea.   With that, I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.   The bill was ordered to a third reading and was read the third time.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the  question is, Shall the bill pass?    I ask for the yeas and nays.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?   There appears to be a sufficient second.   The clerk will call the roll.   The bill clerk called the roll.   The result was announced--yeas 98, nays 2, as follows:                        [Rollcall Vote No. 175 Leg.]                                  YEAS--98       Alexander      Baldwin      Barrasso      Bennet      Blumenthal      Blunt      Booker      Boozman      Brown      Burr      Cantwell      Capito      Cardin      Carper      Casey      Cassidy      Cochran      Collins      Coons      Corker      Cornyn      Cortez Masto      Cotton      Crapo      Cruz      Daines      Donnelly      Duckworth      Durbin      Enzi      Ernst      Feinstein      Fischer      Flake      Franken      Gardner      Gillibrand      Graham      Grassley      Harris      Hassan      Hatch      Heinrich      Heitkamp      Heller      Hirono      Hoeven      Inhofe      Isakson      Johnson      Kaine      Kennedy      King      Klobuchar      Lankford      Leahy      Lee      Manchin      Markey      McCain      McCaskill      McConnell      Menendez      Merkley      Moran      Murkowski      Murphy      Murray      Nelson      Perdue      Peters      Portman      Reed      Risch      Roberts      Rounds      Rubio      Sasse      Schatz      Schumer      Scott      Shaheen      Shelby      Stabenow      Strange      Sullivan      Tester      Thune      Tillis      Toomey      Udall      Van Hollen      Warner      Warren      Whitehouse      Wicker      Wyden      Young                                  NAYS--2       Paul      Sanders           The bill (H.R. 3364) was passed.                            ____________________
