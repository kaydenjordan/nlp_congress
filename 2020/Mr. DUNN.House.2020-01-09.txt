 Madam Speaker, I rise today to pose a simple question to my  colleagues: Are we, as a body, subject to the rules in the  Constitution? The answer is: Of course we are.   However, Speaker Pelosi has chosen to ignore the Constitution and go  rogue. Last month, she stood on this very floor and told us how  important it is that we impeach the President immediately. Now,  outrageously, she claims for herself new powers never contemplated by  the Constitution.   By not transferring the Articles of Impeachment to the Senate,  Speaker Pelosi has claimed for herself the authority to veto any bill  passed by this House with no possibility of override. This is a  monstrous abuse of her position and an outright attack on the trust of  the American people.   Clearly, she knows the impeachment process has been a sham all along  and will fail in the Senate. I urge the Speaker to do her job and move  the articles to the Senate immediately.                            ____________________
