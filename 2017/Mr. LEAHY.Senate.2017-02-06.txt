 Mr. President, I thank the distinguished senior Senator  from  [[Page S694]]  Minnesota for her comments. She speaks from experience and knowledge,  as has the senior Senator from Washington State, on this issue.   In my years here, I have seen thousands of confirmation votes,  literally at all levels, up to and including Cabinet members and  Supreme Court justices. I have voted for a large majority of a  President's nominations--both Republican and Democratic Presidents.  Some may not have been those I would have chosen, but I felt that, at  least, the President should be given the prerogative, if the person is  qualified.   Now, ideology is one thing, and qualification is another. Out of  those thousands of confirmation votes, I have a hard time remembering  any that were like this one. This one had a whirlwind confirmation  hearing and committee vote. It was almost as though they were afraid to  have the nominee actually have to appear and answer questions. And now  the Senate is going to vote on the nomination of Betsy DeVos to lead  the Department of Education.   I will be very blunt. On the very little time that she was allowed to  be shown to the public, she showed--and I certainly believe this--that  she does not have the qualifications to uphold the Department of  Education's primary goal--that of ensuring that all students--all  students, not just the wealthy, but all students--have access to a  quality, public education that allows them to succeed.   I am both a father and a grandfather, and I am proud of it. I watched  my children go to school. And now I see my grandchildren going to  school. I understand well the impact of education on our children. When  students have access to strong public education from the very  beginning, they are more apt to succeed in the long run.   Our Nation's public schools--as is the case in my home State of  Vermont--hold the promise of student success through strong State  accountability measures and legal protections regardless of one's race,  income, or learning ability. They offer nutritious meals for  underserved students, many of whom receive their only meals of the day  at school. Any teacher will tell you that if you have a hungry child,  you have a child who cannot learn. If a child is fed, you have a child  who can learn.   Public education means strong teachers and school leaders, technology  in the classroom, an assessment to test not just how well a student can  memorize material for an exam on a particular day of the year, but how  much they have grown over the course of many months.   Many of the schools have counselors and nurses. They operate under a  modern infrastructure to support those with disabilities and children  in foster care. But public education also means that both the States  and the Federal Government are held accountable for everyone having  access to the same excellent resources.   In fact, just over 1 year ago, this body agreed to these protections.  We passed the Every Student Succeeds Act here in the Senate by a vote  of 85 to 12--an amazing, overwhelming, bipartisan vote. It was the firm  agreement among the majority of the Senate--Republicans and Democrats  alike--that all students deserve access to critical public school  resources in order to succeed. We made a promise that we would do  better by our students; that public schools would be the premier  standard for outstanding education for all.   Unfortunately, the nominee before us--in the very little time that  she was allowed to testify and be questioned in the confirmation  hearing--showed that she does not share these same goals. Instead, she  has referred to public schools as a ``dead end.''   Well, if you are a billionaire, you have a choice to go wherever you  want to school. Maybe these people in a public school are not good  enough for you? Well, then, go buy a school if you want. Most people  don't have that option. Most people are hard working. My wife and I  were when our kids were in school. Our children are today.   What does Betsy DeVos advocate for? She advocates for the  privatization of education. She has funneled millions of dollars into  organizations and initiatives to promote private school vouchers and  school choice.   These efforts have diverted public funds toward private schools,  schools that are not held to any antidiscrimination or accountability  standards. These schools can discriminate all they want.   At her confirmation hearing--in the very little time that she did  speak--she did not understand the Individuals with Disabilities  Education Act. This is a landmark law. It is a Federal law that public  schools in all 50 States must follow.   Lastly, Mrs. DeVos and her family have contributed to anti-LGBT  causes and anti-women's health efforts, which are in direct conflict to  the one who is supposed to lead the Department of Education. How can a  nominee disagree with the mission of the Department of Education and be  fit to oversee that agency and promote the civil rights of schools and  college campuses?   She also appears to oppose efforts to expand college access, in an  era when college is so important. Again, in the little bit of time she  was allowed to testify before the Senate HELP Committee in January,  Mrs. DeVos, when asked, would not agree to work with States to offer  free community college to eligible students, instead saying that  ``nothing in life is truly free.'' This is an easy thing to say if you  are a billionaire.    She also admitted to knowing little about the Pell Grant Program and  Federal student loans, as neither she nor her children have ever had to  use such resources. As most of us know our children will have to use  them, this is simply out of touch with the real life expectations of  millions of students and families who rely on these funds to make  college attainable.   It is what I hear from hard-working families in Vermont. Parents tell  me that their child is going to be the first one in their family to go  to college, and the only reason they can do it is because they can get  Pell grants or Federal student loans. Mrs. Devos's answer is: What are  those?   College tuition rates have climbed more than 300 percent in the last  decade. It is unacceptable to deny students Federal financial  resources. To say, well, if you are rich, you can have them, but  otherwise, tough.   As it is, students are increasingly saddled by insurmountable student  loan debt. Many forgo starting a family, or buying a house or a car.  Many of these students have also fallen prey to for-profit  institutions, many of which continue to offer the false promise of  gainful employment upon graduation. In reality, many of these  institutions offer nontransferable credits or unaccredited degrees, and  are increasingly shuttering their doors, leaving students with  egregious debt and nowhere to turn to finish their degrees.   The Department of Education has an extremely important role to ensure  that all students--of every race, income level, or whether that student  has disabilities or not--have access to the critical tools provided by  public schools and by student financial aid programs.   Thousands--thousands--of Vermont- ers have called or written to me worried that Mrs. DeVos does not agree  with these principles. When I say thousands, to put that in context, we  are the second smallest State in the Union. Thousands have contacted  me. I share these concerns of my fellow Vermonters.   They know my children went to public school. They want to be able to  send their children to public school too. They want the best education.   I am telling these Vermonters I will not support this confirmation.  It is dangerous and shortsighted to confirm someone who has so much to  learn about our Nation's public schools and the challenges they face.   Universal free public schools were a revolutionary American  invention. It has helped make America the great Nation it is today. So  in the United States, we should strengthen public schools, not snub  them.   Mrs. DeVos is the wrong choice for our children but also for our  Nation's future. Our public schools need strong leadership, not someone  who has made it her life's work to undermine their success. So I oppose  this nomination. I hope my fellow Senators will too.

Mr. President, this week we have to decide whether Senator  Sessions, somebody whom many of us have known and worked with for many  years--I certainly have during all of the time he has been in the  Senate--is the right person to lead the Department of Justice. I  thought long and hard on it. I decided he is not. I would like to share  a few reasons why.   In fact, the Trump administration itself underscored what is at stake  with this nomination. When the administration accused Acting Attorney  General Sally Yates of having ``betrayed the Department of Justice,''  it exposed a view of the Justice Department that is disturbing and  dangerous. The claim that Ms. Yates ``betrayed'' the Department by  refusing to defend the President's illegal and shameful Executive  order--you have to believe that in the Attorney General's office, your  job is to defend the President at all costs. That is wrong. I think  Senator Sessions knows that.    There is a reason the Justice Department is not led by a Secretary of  Justice: the Attorney General is the people's attorney, not the  President's attorney. The Trump administration has already shown us why  this distinction  [[Page S837]]  matters. Within its first two weeks, the current administration found  itself rebuked in numerous Federal courts around the country. Its  extreme agenda cast a shadow over all the President's nominees. This is  an administration that was even criticized yesterday by a very  conservative Republican, John Yoo, in a New York Times op-ed entitled,  ``Executive Power Run Amok.'' You know there is a problem when the same  man who twisted the law in order to green-light torture thinks you have  gone too far.   The President seems to have a penchant for going too far. During the  campaign he promised--and he said this a number of times; it was  covered in the press--he would implement a Muslim ban. He actually  stood before the cameras and said that. As President, he then signed an  Executive order that barred immigration from certain Muslim-majority  countries but created an exception that gave preference to members of  minority religions in those countries; that is, non-Muslims. He even  spoke to a Christian press organization stating he would protect  Christians. That is nothing more than a Muslim ban by another name.   My parents and grandparents fought religious biases in this country.  I have always felt one greatness of this country is when we said there  would be no religious bias and we would actually stand up for the First  Amendment. The First Amendment says you can practice any religion you  want or none if you want, and it gives you freedom of speech. Now if  you have a country and a government that protects your right to  practice any religion you want and protects your right of free speech,  then that same government is protecting diversity, and if you have  diversity, it is very easy to have democracy.   When a Federal judge in Washington State temporarily blocked this  order, President Trump did not express respectful disagreement as every  President I have ever known, Republican or Democrat, would. He took to  Twitter--Twitter, like a teenage kid--to attack the judge's legitimacy,  labeling him a ``so-called judge.'' President Trump attempted to blame  this judge who was nominated by a Republican President and confirmed by  a Republican-led Senate for any future terrorist attack on this  country. The President's words are beyond outrageous. It is almost as  though he wants to precipitate a constitutional crisis.   That is why the question of who should be our next Attorney General  is so critical. This is a President who must have an Attorney General  who is willing to stand up and say no for going beyond the law. Sally  Yates knew that. Two years ago, Senator Sessions asked Ms. Yates: ``Do  you think the Attorney General has a responsibility to say no to the  President if he asks for something that's improper? A lot of people  have defended the Lynch nomination, for example, by saying, well, he  appoints somebody who's going to execute his views. What's wrong with  that? But if the views the President wants to execute are unlawful,  should the Attorney General or the Deputy Attorney General say no?''   Ms. Yates answered that her duty was to the Constitution. Just two  years later she proved that by telling the President that his travel  ban was indefensible under the law. Perhaps she was remembering the  commitment she made to Senator Sessions, and that is exactly what she  did.   Many around Senator Sessions felt that she never should have stood up  to President Trump. She should stand up to President Obama but not  President Trump.   I have reviewed Senator Sessions' long record. I have reviewed his  responses to many questions from members of the Senate Judiciary  Committee. I am not convinced that he is capable of telling the  President no.   Under oath, Senator Sessions denied that he was involved in creating  the Muslim ban Executive order. Well, I will take him at his word, but  Senator Sessions' views on this issue are well known to Members of the  Senate Judiciary Committee. In 2015 I offered a simple resolution in  the committee. It expressed the sense of the Senate that the United  States must not bar individuals from entering into the United States  based on their religion--a very simple resolution. Every Democrat, most  of the Republicans--including the Republican chairman, Senator  Grassley--voted in support of my resolution. The committee recognized  that imposing a religious test for those who seek to enter this country  violates our most cherished values, but Senator Sessions broke away  from the majority of his Republican colleagues, and he strongly opposed  the resolution. I found that deeply concerning in 2015 when he was a  Member of the committee. I find it even more disturbing now that he  seeks to be our Nation's top law enforcement official. We need an  Attorney General who will stand in the way of religious discrimination,  not one who endorses it.   Today I am introducing a very similar resolution. It reaffirms that  no one should be blocked from entering into the United States because  of their nationality or their religion. I invite Senator Sessions--and  I invite all Senators--to cosponsor this resolution. Senator Sessions  is still taking an active role in the Senate, including voting on  controversial Cabinet nominees for President Trump. If he cosponsored  it, it would help to reassure Americans that he stands against  religious discrimination and religious tests.   But my concerns about whether Senator Sessions would be willing to  tell President Trump no extend well beyond religious tests. In fact, in  his testimony before the Judiciary Committee, both Republicans and  Democrats, he did not demonstrate to the Judiciary Committee that he  would be willing to tell the President no on any issue, no matter how  objectionable.   Take, for example, the President's many conflicts of interest. For  months, there has been media coverage about President Trump's conflicts  of interest and the constitutional concerns they present. Yet Senator  Sessions repeatedly evaded my written questions on this topic by  claiming that he has ``not studied the issue.''   I asked Senator Sessions whether President Trump should follow  guidance from the Office of Government Ethics and divest from assets  that might create a conflict of interest. Senator Sessions said that he  has not studied the issue.   I asked Senator Sessions whether President Trump receiving payments  from entities controlled by foreign governments raises any concerns  under the Emoluments Clause of the Constitution, which forbids such  payments absent Congressional consent. Senator Sessions said that he  has not studied the issue.   I asked Senator Sessions whether President Trump's family members who  are running the organization that he still owns should participate in  policy discussions or meetings with foreign governments. Again Senator  Sessions said that he has not studied the issue.   Senator Sessions has refused to acknowledge that there is a conflict  of interest for a President to have a personal financial stake in the  policies pursued by his administration. Actually, that is definition  101 of a conflict of interest. The President should not personally  profit from their decisions. This answer was particularly troubling  because I know that he knows the right answer. Senator Sessions told  Senator Feinstein at his hearing: ``I own no individual stocks because  I want to be sure that I don't have conflicts of interest.'' He added,  ``I want to adhere to high standards.'' Well, I appreciate that. But  Senator Sessions--and I assume Attorney General Sessions--apparently  refuses to hold the President to any standards at all.   In fact, his woeful blindness extends even to the Russian  interference into our democracy. In response to questions in the  Intelligence Committee's report on Russian interference--the  intelligence community found without a doubt that we had Russian  influence in our democracy--he said: ``I have not reviewed the report,  but I have no reason not to accept the intelligence community's  conclusions as contained in the report.''   Well, if he hasn't read the report on something as critical as this,  I suspect he is one of very few Senators who hasn't. I asked him  whether the activities described in the report are illegal: Are they a  threat to our democratic process? For anyone other than President  Trump, that is not a difficult question. Reading the report, the answer  should be an obvious yes, but Senator Sessions refused to answer. If  Senator Sessions is not willing even to acknowledge facts that make  President  [[Page S838]]  Trump uncomfortable, how can we believe that Attorney General Sessions  will ever say no to President Trump?   Senator Sessions also refused to answer questions from all nine  Democrats on the Judiciary Committee on how he would respond if  President Trump pressured him to end any investigations into Russian  interference in our elections.   There is absolutely nothing in Senator Sessions' testimony before the  Judiciary Committee that gives me confidence that he would be willing  to stand up to the President. He has demonstrated only blind  allegiance. This is a President who first cited what is now called  ``alternative facts'' to deny his small crowd size at the inauguration,  but now he is citing ``alternative facts'' to excuse murders and  assassinations by Putin's regime. That should alarm us all. It  shouldn't matter what party you belong to; as Americans, that should  alarm us.   Later tonight I will describe my concerns about Senator Sessions'  record on civil rights issues. But I have one concern that is made much  worse, given Senator Sessions' lack of independence from President  Trump. I am particularly worried that, if confirmed, Senator Sessions  will fail to protect Americans' constitutional right to vote. There is  nothing more sacred in a democracy than the right to vote. Yet Senator  Sessions called it ``a good day for the South''--not for the country  but for the South--when the Shelby County decision, which effectively  gutted the Voting Rights Act, was handed down, something that virtually  every Republican and Democrat in both the House and Senate voted for  that President Bush signed into law.   The fact that Senator Sessions voted to reauthorize the Voting Rights  Act in 2006 doesn't give me much comfort when immediately after that  unanimous vote, he turned around and argued, notwithstanding his vote,  that it was unconstitutional.   We cannot view his record on this issue in isolation because if he is  nominated and confirmed to be President Trump's Attorney General--well,  we know the President has his own views on voting in America. Several  Republicans, like the Speaker of the House, Mr. Ryan, and our own  colleague Senator Graham, have rightly condemned President Trump's wild  conspiracy theory that there millions of illegal votes cost him the  popular vote, which he lost by nearly 3 million votes. I fear that  continuing this dangerous falsehood can be used to justify further  attacks on the hard-won right to vote for racial minorities, students,  poor and elderly citizens.   What bothers me the most is that Senator Sessions again refused to  acknowledge the fundamental and plainly visible fact that the President  is flat out wrong that there were 3 million illegal votes cast. Senator  Sessions responded to me that he doesn't know what data the President  may have relied on. Well, the rest of us know there isn't any such  data, but Senator Sessions refuses to admit as much.   So his close ties to President Trump and the important role he played  in forming President Trump's agenda raise important questions about his  impartiality in matters involving the President. I asked him several  times, What is the scenario in which he would recuse himself, given  clear conflicts of interest? But he brushed those questions off. He  claimed he was ``merely . . . a supporter of the President's during the  campaign.'' Well, that would be fine, but I think Senator Sessions is  selling himself short.   He was widely reported to be a central figure in the Trump campaign.  A key figure in the Trump campaign, Steve Bannon, called him the  President's ``clearinghouse for policy and philosophy.''   This relationship appears to fly in the face of the Justice  Department's recusal standards. The Department's standards mandate  recusal when the attorney has ``a close identification with an elected  official . . . arising from service as a principal adviser thereto or a  principal official thereof.'' I asked Senator Sessions the obvious  question--whether that language would apply to his relationship with  President Trump, but he refused to say one way or the other.   The Justice Department has to be independent because it is the chief  law enforcement department in our government. But I worry about that  independence in this administration. It is already clear that if you  say no to this President, there goes your job. Now more than ever, we  need an Attorney General who is willing to pay that cost for the good  of the country--for the good of the country. Country outweighs any  partisan interest of a particular officeholder or a particular  President.   I am not convinced that that kind of independence describes Senator  Sessions. He has not demonstrated the independence that he himself used  to demand of nominees.   David Frum, a former speechwriter for President George W. Bush,  recently wrote an article in the Atlantic addressing whether someone  should accept an invitation to serve in the Trump administration, given  the real risks that there may be tremendous ``pressure to do the wrong  thing.'' The ``very first thing to consider,'' said the former Bush  speechwriter, is, ``How sure are you that you indeed would say no? And  then humbly consider this second troubling question: If the Trump  administration were as convinced as you are that you would do the right  thing--would they have asked you in the first place?''   In the case of the nominee before us--the Trump administration's  ``clearinghouse for policy and philosophy,'' as Mr. Bannon called him-- I fear the answer to these questions is clear. That is why I am going  to be voting against this nominee.   It is ironic that as we consider the nomination of Senator Sessions  to be the Attorney General, a position which he is going to be  responsible for is defending the fundamental rights and liberties of  the American people--all of us--whether you were supporters during the  last campaign of President Trump or Secretary Hillary Clinton. But even  though Senator Sessions is supposed to defend our fundamental rights,  we see President Trump continuing to praise Russian President Vladimir  Putin, who has repeatedly demonstrated his disdain for freedom of  speech, of association, of due process, and of the rule of law.   In less than a week the President has attacked a Federal judge for  performing his constitutional duty. He has called unfavorable polls  ``fake.'' He has continued to discredit as ``dishonest'' any media  outlet that dares criticize him. His spokesperson, Sean Spicer, echoes  these sentiments. They sound remarkably like what one would expect to  hear from Vladimir Putin.   In fact, President Trump has done this while reiterating his support  of torture and his admiration of Putin. Remember, Putin's critics  continue to turn up dead. Putin has stolen tens of billions of dollars  that were taken in bribes from oil and gas and other industries.  President Trump seems unaware of this, or is unconcerned about it, even  though everybody knows about it.   It is hard to avoid the conclusion that, after repeatedly lauding  Putin's leadership, Trump is now attempting to emulate Putin's efforts  to spread misinformation, chastise his critics, and intimidate those  responsible for upholding the law. His assaults on anyone he perceives  to be standing in his way, including a Federal judge nominated by  President George W. Bush, is even worse than his routine expressions of  contempt for political norms that seem to be coming straight out of  Stephen Bannon's playbook. Not only has the President expressed little,  if any, concern that every U.S. intelligence agency--every U.S.  intelligence agency--believes that Russia sought to influence, and  quite possibly did influence, the Presidential election, and that Putin  himself was involved, but Senator Sessions, who campaigned for the  President, refused to recuse himself from decisions related to Russia's  cyber attacks.   Can anybody imagine what the Republican leadership would be saying if  the table was turned? They would try to shut down the government to  hold a new election.   Failing that, they would demand that an independent commission be  established to investigate the Russian hacking, and they would insist  that the nominee for Attorney General pledge to recuse himself.   Well, along with Senator Durbin and others, I have called for such an  independent commission outside of Congress, but the Republican leaders  have  [[Page S839]]  summarily rejected it. It is cynical politics at its worst that puts  partisanship over the integrity of our elections.   President Trump and Senator Sessions both speak about the importance  of law and order. President Trump and Vladimir Putin seem to agree  about what those words mean. Senator Sessions has said nothing to  suggest that he disagrees, even though the Congressional Republican  leadership recognizes Putin as a dangerous thug who tramples on the  rule of law.   Why does our President keep praising this man who assassinates his  critics, who has killed people who have criticized him in the media,  who has stolen so much money, and taken so many bribes? He has become  one of the wealthiest people in the world, but he is not a person to  praise. We have a lot of leaders in our own country--both Republicans  and Democrats--whom we can praise, but not Vladimir Putin.   I think we have to be careful. We have to care about the integrity of  our democracy, about due process, the rule of law, and about the  constitutional checks and balances that distinguish this country from  autocracies like Russia. We should expect the nominee for Attorney  General to demonstrate that he will defend these principles, not to  remain silent when they are attacked, even if the person attacking them  is the President of the United States.   Mr. President, I see the distinguished senior Senator from  Connecticut on the floor.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Johnson). The Senator from Connecticut.    Mr. President, this is fascinating. I say to my  colleagues, I have served here longer than any other Member of this  body. I have been here 42 years. I have been here when the Democrats  were in the majority and when the Republicans were in the majority,  with Democratic Presidents and Republican Presidents. I have never,  ever seen a time when a Member of the Senate asked to put into the  Record a letter especially by a civil rights icon and somebody  objected. It has always been done.   I have had letters that people have asked to be put in that were  contrary to a position that I might take. Of course, I would not  object. They are allowed to do it. I have seen letters when Members of  both sides of the aisle have debated back and forth and the other side  would put in letters that were contrary to their opponents' positions,  and of course nobody objected.   Don't let the Senate turn into something it has never been before. I  would hope that cooler heads would prevail, and we go back to the  things that made the Senate great, that made the Senate the conscience  of the Nation, as it should be.   I have never once objected to a Senator introducing a letter, even  though they took a position different than mine. I have never known of  a Republican Senator to do that, and here we are talking about a letter  from a civil rights icon.   Let's not go down this path. It is not good for the country. It is  not good for the Senate, it is not good for democracy, and it sure as  heck is not good for free speech.   I admire the Senator from Rhode Island. He is a man of great  integrity, a man who was attorney general of his State and U.S.  attorney in his State. His request was something that is normally  accepted automatically. I would hope Senators would reconsider.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.    Mr. President, the United Nations High Commissioner for  Refugees has reported that more than 65 million people have been  forcibly displaced around the globe by the end of 2015. In the face of  such staggering human suffering, we must not shutter our doors and  abandon our foundational principle of religious freedom. Yet that is  exactly what our new President would have us do with the Executive  order he signed 2 weeks ago. This is not something I support, and for  good reasons.   Our freedom of religion was enshrined in the Constitution 225 years  ago. Since forging this promise, we have been a confident Nation  welcoming those of all faiths. The Executive order issued by the new  Republican President threatens these founding ideals and the very  freedoms we enjoy as Americans. It singles out Muslim refugees and  those fleeing violence in Syria, and it suspends the refugee program as  a whole. This is not the America I know. It is contrary to our values  and contrary to the example America needs to set for the world.   The ongoing conflict in Syria makes clear the enormity of the  humanitarian crisis we face. The terror inflicted by both Bashar Al- Assad's regime and ISIS has forced more than half of Syria's 23 million  people from their homes and claimed the lives of hundreds of thousands  of civilians. Currently, there are more than 4.8 million registered  [[Page S872]]  Syrian refugees, the overwhelming majority of whom are women and  children. Communities across the country, including some in Vermont,  started the process to welcome these refugees who have undergone years  of security screenings and vetting. Rutland, VT, is prepared to welcome  100 refugees, but to date only two families have arrived. One of these  families shared that their own children ``were exposed to a lot of  terror, and the sound of bombs and the sound of bullets and gunshots  all day long.'' This is no way to live. That is why I strongly agree  with Rutland's mayor Christopher Louras, who said accepting refugees  ``is just the right thing to do from a compassionate, humanitarian  perspective.'' We must do more.   There are other humanitarian crises impacting the world. Closer to  home, ruthless armed gangs in El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala  continue to brutalize women and children with near impunity. We have a  moral obligation to respond, and it is in our national interest to do  that.   National security leaders agree that anti-Muslim rhetoric is not only  contrary to our values, it also makes us less safe. FBI Director Comey  told the Senate Judiciary Committee in November 2015 that part of  ISIL's narrative is to depict the United States as anti-Muslim. The  Defense Department has made a similar point. House Speaker Ryan has  also denounced a ban on Muslims, noting that it is ``not conservatism''  to impose a religious test. A bipartisan majority of the Senate  Judiciary Committee agreed in December 2015 when it passed my amendment  confirming that ``the United States must not bar individuals from  entering into the United States based on their religion.''   The chaos and confusion caused by this Executive order at our  airports in the United States as well as around the world highlights  the recklessness of this administration's attempt to bar people based  on their religion and national origin. The devastation this is causing  to lawful immigrants and refugees fleeing violence is immeasurable. I  fear for my constituents who are lawful permanent residents of the  United States who also happen to be nationals of one of the seven  targeted countries. Due to the widespread outrage expressed by  thousands of concerned citizens and legal challenges across the  country, the Trump administration has now clarified that the Executive  order should not apply to legal permanent residents. But there  continues to be an understandable fear that the Trump administration  may again attempt to bar them from this country. Like them, I fear that  the Trump administration may again seek to bar lawful immigrants from  returning to their homes, work, and families in Vermont. I also fear  for the young Somali refugee in Vermont who has been patiently waiting  for the completion of the resettlement process so that his pregnant  wife and young son will be saved from the squalor of a refugee camp and  reunited with him in Vermont. And the man from Sudan who has been  waiting for his two young sons to finally be granted their visas to  join him and the rest of their family. And the husband whose Libyan  wife was recently granted a visa and has been waiting for the  International Organization for Migration to arrange her flight to the  United States. I am concerned for these families and for so many others  in Vermont and around the country.   Americans are bound together by our shared ideals. Among those ideals  are tolerance and diversity. They unite us as a nation; they make us  stronger. That is the message we should be embracing--one of inclusion,  not one of exclusion and division. Federal District Court Judge  Geoffrey Crawford perfectly encapsulated this sentiment at a  naturalization ceremony for 31 new Americans in Rutland, VT, last week.  The summary of his powerful remarks, which he directed particularly to  our new Muslim citizens, was this: ``You are equal in the eyes of the  law.'' This simple message is clear, and unequivocal: You are welcome,  you are equal, you are protected.   That is why I am introducing a resolution expressing the sense of the  Senate that no one should be blocked from entering the United States  because of their nationality, race, ethnicity, religion, sexual  orientation, gender identity, or gender. Adoption of this resolution  simply reaffirms the basic principle that this country does not have a  litmus test. It will also show that the Senate will not allow fear to  undermine the very principles and values that we cherish and that we  have sworn to defend. The resolution is consistent with the strong  bipartisan actions taken by the Senate less than 4 years ago when we  passed comprehensive immigration reform legislation that included  protections for refugees and asylum seekers. I urge Senators to come  together once again in support of my resolution.                            ____________________     Mr. President, yesterday I spoke at length about my fear  that Senator Sessions' would not have the ability to act as an  independent Attorney General. The Attorney General is not the  President's lawyer. He or she is the chief law enforcement officer of  the United States. And he or she must faithfully serve all Americans.  Even if Senator Sessions could demonstrate independence from President  Trump, my review of his extensive record leaves me unconvinced that he  is capable of serving and protecting all Americans.   In 1986, Senator Ted Kennedy called Jeff Sessions a ``throwback''  because of his conduct on civil rights issues. I regret to say that,  since the Judiciary  [[Page S938]]  Committee's bipartisan rejection of Senator Sessions' nomination to be  a district court judge in 1986, Senator Sessions has not allayed our  concerns. In his 20 years in the Senate, he has not shown a commitment  to protecting the most vulnerable in our communities. Time and again,  when the rights of women, LGBT individuals, and disenfranchised  communities have been debated here in the Senate, Senator Sessions has  not sought to protect their civil and human rights. Too often, he has  been the one standing in the way.   That is why National Nurses United has written to me to express their  opposition to Senator Sessions. They wrote: ``We provide the best care  we possibly can, without regard to race, gender, national origin,  religion, socio economic circumstances, or other identifying  characteristic. That is what caring professionals do. Unfortunately,  that is not what Jeff Sessions has done in his role as a public  servant.'' I ask unanimous consent that their full letter be printed in  the Record at the conclusion of my remarks. That is why my friend John  Lewis testified before the Judiciary Committee in opposition to Senator  Sessions. Congressman Lewis stated that, ``When faced with a challenge,  Senator Sessions has frequently chosen to stand on the wrong side of  history.'' Senate Republicans should be listening to these concerns and  those of protesters in our streets and airports standing up for our  Constitution. We should not subject those concerns to a gag rule.   Yet Senator Sessions and his supporters have painted a different  picture of his record. They have argued that he has a strong record on  civil rights. So I asked Senator Sessions in written questions to  identify areas in which racial inequalities persist. He could have  talked about sentencing or about areas where the Civil Rights Division  has found patterns and practices of police departments violating  people's rights or about the kind of voter suppression efforts that an  appeals court found ``target[ed] African Americans with almost surgical  precision.'' Senator Sessions did not identify a single example of  racial inequality in modern America. That is astonishing. No one can  uphold the rights of all Americans if he is unwilling to pay attention  when those rights are being violated.   Some have suggested that Senator Sessions' record on civil rights has  been criticized unfairly and he is held to a different standard because  he is a conservative from the South. I disagree. When the Judiciary  Committee rejected Senator Sessions' district court nomination in 1986,  one of the votes against him came from Senator Heflin, who was a  conservative from Alabama. Moreover, I and most other Democrats just  voted to confirm as U.N. Ambassador another conservative Southerner:  Nikki Haley. In 2015, then-Governor Haley made the decision to remove  the Confederate flag from the South Carolina Statehouse grounds. She  said, ``[I]t should never have been there'' and that she ``couldn't  look my children in the face and justify it staying there.'' When  Senator Sessions was asked about this and other efforts to remove the  Confederate flag from public buildings, he argued that such efforts  ``seek to delegitimize the fabulous accomplishments of our country.''  It can come as no surprise that the civil rights community is concerned  by his nomination.   But I will speak to my own experiences with Senator Sessions' views  on civil rights laws. In 2009, Senator Sessions opposed expanding hate  crime protections to women and LGBT individuals, groups that have  historically been targeted based merely on who they are. He stated, ``I  am not sure women or people with different sexual orientations face  that kind of discrimination. I just don't see it.'' Thankfully, a  bipartisan majority of Senators saw it, and the Matthew Shepard and  James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act is now law. These  protections are needed now more than ever. According to recent FBI  statistics, LGBT individuals are more likely to be targeted for hate  crimes than any other minority group in the country.   Judy Shepard, Matthew's mother, wrote a letter last month opposing  Senator Sessions' nomination. She was concerned not just by Senator  Sessions' opposition to the law that bears her son's name, but by how  Senator Sessions viewed such hate crimes. She wrote:         ``Senator Sessions strongly opposed the hate crimes bill--      characterizing hate crimes as mere `thought crimes.'       Unfortunately, Senator Sessions believes that hate crimps       are, what he describes as, mere `thought crimes.'        ``My son was not killed by 'thoughts' or because his       murderers said hateful things. My son was brutally beaten       with the butt of a .357 magnum pistol, tied him to a fence,       and left him to die in freezing temperatures because he was       gay. Senator Sessions' repeated efforts to diminish the life-      changing acts of violence covered by the Hate Crimes       Prevention Act horrified me then, as a parent who knows the       true cost of hate, and it terrifies me today to see that this       same person is now being nominated as the country's highest       authority to represent justice and equal protection under the       law for all Americans.''    But that was not all. Senator Sessions also said that ``the hate  crimes amendment . . . has been said to cheapen the civil rights  movement.'' I asked him about this comment and whether he still felt  that way at his hearing, but he did not respond to the question. I  asked him a second time, in a written follow-up, what he meant by that  comment. He replied that ``Those were not my words,'' but again did not  explain what he had meant by that remark. So I asked him a third time.  The third time, he finally conceded. He wrote to me that ``it is not  correct to say it cheapens our commitment to civil rights.'' If it is  not correct to say that, then why did Senator Sessions quote it in the  first place--and why did it take him three tries to acknowledge the  error?   Senator Sessions also opposed the 2013 Leahy-Crapo Violence Against  Women Reauthorization Act, which overwhelmingly passed the Senate with  support from a majority of Republican Senators. During his hearing, and  again in written questions, Senator Sessions refused to commit to  defend this important law's constitutionality. He said only that he  ``will carefully study'' it to discern whether it is ``reasonably  defensible.'' His refusal to voice support for VAWA is all the more  troubling in light of reports that the Heritage Foundation's budget  blueprint, which is reportedly being relied on by the new  administration, calls for eliminating all VAWA grants. I asked Senator  Sessions to commit to stand up for victims and preserve these critical  programs. Again, he refused.   Amita Swadhin, who appeared before the Judiciary Committee and  bravely shared her story of being raped as a child, explained why this  issue is so important: ``We need an Attorney General who will continue  the progress we have made since the initial passage of VAWA, someone  committed to improving and enforcing our laws to ensure the most  vulnerable victims of crime can come forward to seek accountability and  to access healing.'' This law and these grants are a matter of life and  death to many people across the country. We need an Attorney General  who understands that. The National Task Force to End Sexual and  Domestic Violence, which has never before taken a position on an  Attorney General nomination, wrote to the Judiciary Committee because  they do not believe Senator Sessions understands that. The letter  states:         ``Senator Sessions' senate record of strenuous objection to       protections for historically marginalized populations,       coupled with his record of selective prosecutions,       demonstrate his unwillingness to protect marginalized       victims' access to justice and disqualify him from holding       the position of Attorney General of the United States, a       position charged with the responsibility of securing justice       for all.''    I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record at  the conclusion of my remarks.   Senator Sessions and his supporters have tried to minimize his  opposition to the Leahy-Crapo VAWA bill by pointing out that he did  vote in committee for the Republican substitute amendment. Let me  explain what that amendment would have done. It would have cut  authorization levels by 40 percent, hampering efforts to prevent  violence and provide services to victims in need. It would have removed  all provisions intended to ensure that victims can receive services,  regardless of sexual orientation and gender identity. It would have  removed important provisions to let tribal justice systems reach the  many criminal and civil cases that fell through the cracks. That  amendment would have gutted core elements  [[Page S939]]  of the VAWA reauthorization that go to the heart of what VAWA does. A  vote for that amendment hardly demonstrates a commitment to victims.   Another issue that concerns me is criminal justice reform. For years,  I have worked with a bipartisan group of Senators to reduce mandatory  minimum sentences for drug offenses. These sentences have created  perverse disparities within our justice system. Racial minorities still  receive nearly 80 percent of them. Our bipartisan effort has had the  strong support of the Justice Department and many others in law  enforcement, but not Senator Sessions. In recent years, no one in the  Senate has fought harder against even modest sentencing reform than he  has.   I am also concerned about Senator Sessions' commitment to ongoing  civil rights litigation. I asked whether he would maintain the Justice  Department's position in certain important cases. He would not commit  to maintaining the Department's position, even in voting rights cases  where courts have already found that certain voter ID laws are  discriminatory.   Senator Sessions would not commit to even maintaining cases that are  already at the Supreme Court. Last month, the Supreme Court heard oral  argument in Endrew F. v. Douglas County School District. The Justice  Department filed an amicus brief in support of the petitioner, arguing  that the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act requires states to  provide more than de minimis educational benefits and in fact ``give  eligible children with disabilities an opportunity to make significant  educational progress.'' Even though it would be extraordinary for the  Justice Department to take a new position after oral argument has  already been heard, Senator Sessions would not commit to maintaining  the Department's position in this case.   I pointed to a lawsuit the Justice Department filed last year in  Georgia alleging that Georgia's treatment of students with disabilities  violated the Americans with Disabilities Act. In this lawsuit, the  Justice Department noted that some of the facilities used by students  with disabilities ``are located in poor-quality buildings that formerly  served as schools for black students during de jure segregation.'' I  asked Senator Sessions whether he would continue to pursue this case,  and bring others like it where States are in violation of the ADA. He  refused to commit to continuing this case. The ADA also contains a  waiver of State sovereign immunity, which is a critical tool for  enforcing that landmark law. Twice during the Bush administration, the  Justice Department argued, and the Supreme Court agreed, that the  waiver was a valid exercise of Congressional power under section V of  the 14th Amendment, but Senator Sessions would not commit to defending  the constitutionality of that provision.   Senator Sessions' record on disability rights is also of concern  because of the way he spoke about students with disabilities. He once  argued that mainstreaming causes a ``decline in civility and discipline  in classrooms all over America.'' As with my hate crimes amendment and  VAWA, the problem is not just that Senator Sessions has opposed  protections for the most vulnerable, it is also the language that he  uses when opposing them, which denigrate those the laws seek to  protect. That is why a group of 18 disability rights organizations have  written to Senate leadership expressing their strong opposition to  Senator Sessions' nomination.   Senator Sessions has also demonstrated a shockingly brazen attitude  when I asked him about the offensive rhetoric used by some of his  political associates. I asked him whether he would condemn certain  remarks by David Horowitz, Frank Gaffney, and others. Senator Sessions  received awards from these individuals. He regularly attended their  conferences. He has given media statements in support of their  organizations and the views they put forth. Yet, when Senator Sessions  was directly asked to respond to some of their statements, he  effectively shrugged his shoulders. These included comments: referring  to Muslims as ``Islamic Nazis'' who ``want to kill Jews, that's their  agenda''; alleging that President Obama ``is an anti-American radical  and I'm actually sure he's a Muslim, he certainly isn't a Christian. .  . . He's a pretend Christian in the same way he's a pretend American'';  alleging that two Muslims members of Congress have ``longstanding  Muslim Brotherhood ties''; arguing that a Muslim member of Congress  should not be allowed to serve on the House Intelligence Committee  because of his ``extensive personal and political associations with . .  . jihadist infrastructure in America''; claiming that married women by  definition cannot be raped by their husbands; calling for ``railroad  cars full of illegals going south; and calling President Obama a  traitor.   Senator Sessions responded that he does not hold those views. That is  fair enough. But he did not explain why he chose to associate with such  individuals. When someone accuses President Obama of treason, it is not  at all enough to say, ``I do not hold that view.'' That is why, last  month, Muslim advocates and 36 other civil rights organizations,  including the Leadership Conference on Civic and Human Rights and the  NAACP, wrote a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee expressing  strong concern that ``Senator Sessions has closely aligned with anti- Muslim hate groups, accepted their awards and accolades, and publicly  praised their leadership. Senator Sessions' appointment will only  embolden these groups and activists and serve to further fan the flames  of anti-Muslim bigotry already burning in this country.'' If Senator  Sessions cannot condemn David Horowitz and Frank Gaffney, who the  Southern Poverty Law Center has repeatedly called ``extremists'' who  run hate groups, for calling President Obama a traitor, it is fair to  ask whether he will have the courage to stand up to the President of  the United States, as Sally Yates did.   The Attorney General is charged with enforcing the laws that protect  all Americans. No one can fulfill that obligation who is not clear-eyed  about the threats facing the most vulnerable in our communities. We  need an Attorney General who will aggressively confront those who  appeal to hate and fear. I do not believe that person is Senator  Sessions. The Senate and the Judiciary Committee have heard from a  multitude of civil rights, civil liberties, and domestic violence  organizations, as well as nurses and numerous faith leaders, who oppose  this nomination. This Senator stands with them.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                         National Nurses United,                                   Washington, DC, February 7, 2017.      Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,      U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.        Dear Senator Leahy: We write on behalf of the more than       150,000 registered nurse members of National Nurses United to       urge you to vote against the confirmation of Senator Jeff       Sessions, President-elect Donald Trump's nominee for Attorney       General. Much has been said by many others against       confirmation of this nominee, so we will be brief.        Our members work as bedside healthcare professionals in       almost every state in the nation. We work in every hospital       setting, from small rural facilities to large urban public       health systems, in prominent research hospitals affiliated       with prestigious public and private universities, as well as       Veterans Affairs hospitals and clinics. We care for Americans       on every point of the demographic spectrum, at their most       vulnerable. We provide the best care we possibly can, without       regard to race, gender, national origin, religion, socio       economic circumstances, or other identifying characteristic.       That is what caring professionals do. Unfortunately, that is       not what Jeff Sessions has done in his role as a public       servant. And to vote in favor of confirming him as the chief       law enforcement officer of the United States would abdicate       your responsibility to provide the oversight necessary to       ensure that basic legal rights are enforced evenhandedly and       for the protection of all people.        As Senate colleagues, you no doubt know Senator Sessions'       record as a lawmaker, as well as his record as the U.S.       Attorney for the Southern District of Alabama and as the       Alabama Attorney General. It was, of course, his record in       the U.S. Attorney's office and his many publically verified       racially insensitive comments that resulted in a majority of       the Senate Judiciary Committee voting against confirmation       for his nomination to be a U.S. District Court judge in 1986.       This `no' vote happened while the Judiciary Committee was       majority Republican. Even Senator Howell Heflin, a fellow       Alabamian, voted against him, citing ``reasonable doubts''       over whether he could be ``fair and impartial.''        Senator Sessions has oft asserted that his comments over       the years were taken out of context, or intended as humor.       But his record tells the truth. Early in his career he  [[Page S940]]       charged civil right leaders (``the Marion Three'') with       voting fraud related to their efforts to assist African       American voters. The fact that the defendants in that case       were acquitted didn't deter Mr. Sessions. Later, as Attorney       General of Alabama, he initiated another voter fraud       investigation involving absentee ballots cast by black voters       that, again, resulted in findings of no wrong doing. During       that same timeframe, he was criticized for declining to       investigate church burnings, and he ``joked'' that he thought       Ku Klux Klan members were ``OK, until [he] learned that they       smoked marijuana.''        Against that background, Senator Sessions aggressively       interrogated Justice Sonia Sotomayor, the Court's first       nominee of Latino heritage. Further betraying a deep belief       in natural division between racial groups, he grilled Justice       Sotomayor about whether she could be fair to white Americans,       despite her 17-year record as a jurist and having received       the American Bar Association's highest rating. And he       expressed grave concerns that she would engage in judicial       ``empathy'' on the high court, favoring persons of certain       races or ethnicities over others. He then voted against her       confirmation.        Senator Sessions' prejudices are not only against people of       color. As an organization representing a predominately female       profession we are compelled to express our outrage that       Senator Sessions defended Donald Trump's statements about       grabbing women by the genitals, by saying that such conduct       would not constitute sexual assault. The fact that he took a       different position during his Committee hearing is of no       comfort. It only shows that he will say whatever he believes       will help land him in the seat of power to determine whether,       and against whom, to enforce our laws. His comments last fall       dismissing President-elect Trump's despicable treatment of       women is consistent with his vote in 2013 against the       Violence Against Women Act. As nurses, we see close up the       devastating effects of domestic violence against our       patients, and we are disturbed by Senator Sessions' alleged       concern that the protection of that statute should not extend       to victims of violence on tribal lands.        Moreover, confirming Senator Sessions to the job of the top       prosecutor would exacerbate our national crisis over race       issues in policing and our criminal justice system. He       personally blocked the Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act,       a bipartisan effort spearheaded by Sens. Charles Grassley (R-      Iowa), Mike Lee (R-Utah), and John Cornyn (R-Texas), and       Speaker of the House Paul Ryan (R-Wis.). The fact that law       enforcement leadership throughout the nation supported the       reform effort made no difference to Senator Sessions. And       unfortunately, his actions as U.S. Attorney for the Southern       District of Alabama only further illustrate his indifference       to this crisis. For example, drug convictions made up 40       percent of his cases when he served in that position--twice       the rate of other federal prosecutors in Alabama.        Despite the current trend of focusing resources on violent       crime, and away from out-dated drug war policies, Senator       Sessions continues to oppose any attempts to legalize       marijuana and any reduction in drug sentences. As Attorney       General, he could direct federal prosecutors throughout the       country to pursue the harshest penalties possible for even       low-level drug offenses, a step that would further exacerbate       our national record of incarcerating non-violent offenders--      the vast majority of whom could be successfully treated, at       far lower cost to society, with appropriate healthcare       treatment.        Nor should Senator Sessions be trusted to ensure equal       access to voting rights. He has publically called the Voting       Rights Act ``intrusive,'' and has insisted that its proactive       protections of racial minorities were no longer necessary.       This is especially disturbing as Senator Sessions voiced       public support for voter-ID laws, while his home state       recently tried to close over thirty DMV offices, many in       majority-black areas, shortly after instituting strict voter-      ID requirements. We are reminded of the words of Coretta       Scott King in her letter opposing Jeff Sessions' nomination       to the federal district court in 1986: ``The irony of Mr.       Sessions' nomination is that, if confirmed, he will be given       a life tenure for doing with a federal prosecution what the       local sheriffs accomplished twenty years ago with clubs and       cattle prods.''        We will not attempt to address all the positions Senator       Sessions has taken that are out of step with the reality of       the difficult times we are in, but as nurses we must include       our grave concern that as Attorney General he would not be       vigilant in enforcing environmental protections. In a July       2012 Senate hearing on climate science, Senator Sessions       dismissed the concerns about global warming expressed by 98%       of climate scientists, and asserted that this is ``[a] danger       that is not as great as it seems.'' These positions are       frightening. Climate change is a public health issue that       cannot be overstated. As nurses we have been seeing for some       time increases in the frequency and severity of respiratory       diseases such as asthma, bronchitis, and emphysema, as well       as an increase in cancers and aggravation of cardiovascular       illness. The effects of air pollution are particularly acute       in pediatric patients. They have higher respiratory rates       than adults, and consequently higher exposure. Our elderly       patients are also especially vulnerable. Respiratory symptoms       as common as coughing can cause arrhythmias, heart attacks,       and other serious health impacts in geriatric patients. As       global warming progresses, we are seeing sharp increases in       heat stroke and dehydration, both of which are sometimes       fatal.        In our disaster relief work through our Registered Nurse       Response Network, we have been called upon to assist the       victims of Hurricane Katrina and Super Storm Sandy--events       that many scientists believe would not have been of the       magnitude they were if not for rising temperature.        Current and future generations cannot afford to have a fox       minding the hen house on the important issues of civil and       criminal protections under the control of the Attorney       General. We urge you to set aside your personal loyalty to       Senator Sessions and evaluate honestly his record and fitness       for this critically important job. We urge you to vote       against his confirmation.            Sincerely,                                                Deborah Burger, RN,                              Co-President, National Nurses United.                                                     Jean Ross, RN,      Co-President, National Nurses United.                                   ____           National Task Force to End Sexual & Domestic Violence        Dear Member of the Judiciary Committee: We, the steering       committee of the National Task Force to End Sexual and       Domestic Violence (NTF), a coalition of national, tribal,       state, and local leadership organizations and individuals       advocating on behalf of victims of sexual assault, domestic       violence, dating violence and stalking, write to express our       opposition to Senator Jeff Sessions' nomination for Attorney       General of the United States of America. We have arrived at       this position based upon a review of his record as a state       and federal prosecutor, during which he applied the law       unevenly, and as a U.S. Senator, during which he supported       laws that would afford only some members of our society equal       protection of the law. The role of Attorney General requires       a demonstrated commitment to providing equal protection under       the law--particularly to people who face discrimination       because of their race, religion, gender, gender identity,       sexual orientation, disability or other identities. We       respectfully submit that Senator Sessions' record speaks for       itself and that his history of differential application of       the law carries with it the potential to harm victims and       survivors of gender-based violence, particularly survivors       from historically marginalized communities. Thirty years ago,       this Committee rejected Senator Sessions' nomination to the       federal bench due to well-justified concerns regarding his       problematic record on civil rights and troubling history of       making racially insensitive statements. These aforementioned       concerns, combined with his equally troubling comments on the       nature of sexual assault and other concerns raised below,       make Senator Sessions an unqualified choice to serve as U.S.       Attorney General.        The position of Attorney General of the United States of       America, created by the Judiciary Act of 1789, bears the       responsibility of representing the United States in all legal       matters in which the country has an interest. Chief among       those interests is the affording of equal protection under       our criminal, civil and civil rights laws to all members of       our society. Under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 503, the President's       appointment of an Attorney General must be with the ``advice       and consent of the Senate.'' The process ensures that the       person holding the post of Attorney General is one fit for       such duty, a person with the intellectual, moral and       steadfast ethical capacity to uphold the laws and interests       of the United States and to apply the laws equally to all       members of society.        Failure to Speak Up for Victims of Violence and Discrimination         A threshold qualification for the position of Attorney       General is a deep understanding of the laws s/he is sworn to       uphold. Of critical relevance are Senator Sessions' recent       comments on the nature of sexual assault in response to the       release of a 2005 video in which President-Elect Donald Trump       describes grabbing women's genitalia without their consent.       When asked whether he would characterize the behavior       described by President-elect Trump as sexual assault, Senator       Sessions responded, ``I don't characterize that as sexual       assault. I think that's a stretch. I don't know what he       meant--.'' Federal statutes enacted prior to Senator       Sessions' tenure as U.S. Attorney for the Southern District       of Alabama criminalize ``abusive sexual conduct.'' The       applicable definition for conduct prohibited by 18 U.S.C.       Sec. 2244 is clearly stated: ``the intentional touching,       either directly or through the clothing, of the genitalia,       anus, groin, breast, inner thigh, or buttocks of any person       with an intent to abuse, humiliate, harass, degrade, or       arouse or gratify the sexual desire of any person.'' Thus,       the Senator is either unaware that abusive sexual contact is       illegal under federal law, or he feigned ignorance of the       laws he was sworn to uphold as an officer of the court for       the sake of political expedience.        The Department of Justice has the exclusive authority to       enforce the United States' criminal statutes, including 18       U.S.C. Sec. 2244. The Department of Justice also has       exclusive jurisdiction over the prosecution of domestic and       sexual violence in the District of Columbia, most sexual       assaults perpetrated in Indian Country, and concurrent       jurisdiction over domestic violence offenses committed in       Indian Country. Any candidate for Attorney General of the       United States, particularly a former U.S. Attorney, should       possess  [[Page S941]]       a thorough understanding of the legal definition of sexual       assault under federal law and under the laws of the       jurisdictions in which the Office of the U.S. Attorney has       prosecutorial responsibility. The National Task Force has       worked collectively for decades to ensure that legal       definitions in the U.S. Code and under state and local laws       make it absolutely clear that sexual assault is a crime. The       job of the Attorney General is to enforce the law without       fear or favor. Thus, we expect the Attorney General to       enforce federal laws addressing sexual assault without       introducing nonexistent ambiguity, because of the       perpetrator's identity. Senator Sessions' cavalier statement       about sexual assault leaves us fearful that he will not       vigorously prosecute sexual assault crimes, a practice       unbefitting of the nation's chief law enforcement officer.        Additionally, Senator Sessions' poor history with respect       to fighting for fairness and equity has us justifiably       concerned that he will not step in to vindicate the rights of       survivors of campus sexual assault and other victims of       discrimination. The Justice Department has jurisdiction to       enforce a myriad of civil rights statutes, including Title VI       of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Title IX of the Education       Amendments of 1972. These statutes bar discrimination in       education based on race, color and national origin and sex       (respectively) by educational institutions that receive       federal funding. On college and university campuses alone, we       know that 20 percent of women are victimized by sexual       assault. Absent an Attorney General's commitment to ensuring       that educational institutions root out bias and violence and       hold perpetrators accountable, victims of discrimination,       harassment or violence based on sex, race and/or national       origin will be unable to pursue their education in an       atmosphere of educational equity. Teachers surveyed since the       election have described thousands of incidents of ``bigotry       and harassment,'' stemming from incidents involving ``racist,       xenophobic or misogynistic comments,'' and/or ``derogatory       language directed at students of color, Muslims, immigrants,       and people based on gender or sexual orientation.'' It is       imperative that the person nominated to the position of       Attorney General possess a demonstrated record of work and       support for these impacted communities, including people of       color, immigrants, Muslims and religious minorities, members       of the LGBT community, and people with disabilities.        Regrettably, Senator Sessions' career is replete with       actions taken and statements made in opposition to equitable       educational access. While Attorney General of Alabama,       Senator Sessions fought equitable educational access for       poor, minority and disabled students in Alabama even after       being ordered by a federal court to remedy the yawning       financial disparities between Alabama's richest (and whitest)       and poorest school districts. Additionally, his       mischaracterization of the Individuals with Disabilities in       Education Act as creating ``special treatment for certain       children,'' and being responsible for ``accelerating the       decline of civility and discipline in classrooms across       America,'' is appalling. In light of these remarks, we are       concerned not only about the Senator's willingness to use the       civil rights statutes to protect survivors of both campus       sexual assault and other forms of harassment and violence in       the education context, but also his commitment to ensuring       equal access and safety under certain programs in the       Violence Against Women Act for victims of sexual and domestic       violence who have disabilities.                           Fair Application of Law         We have additional concerns regarding the Attorney       General's role with respect to the fair, even and unbiased       application of the law. Victims and survivors come from all       racial or ethnic backgrounds, faith practices, sexual       orientations, and gender identities: 33.5% of multiracial       women have been raped, as have 27% of American Indian and       Alaska Native women, 15% of Hispanic, 22% of Black, and 19%       of White women. Additionally, 53.8% of multiracial women and       39.3% of multiracial men experience intimate partner physical       violence, intimate partner sexual violence and/or intimate       partner stalking in their lifetimes, as do 46.0% of American       Indian and Alaska Native women, 45.3% of American Indian and       Alaska Native men, 19.6% of Asian and Pacific Islander women       (data for Asian and Pacific Islander men is not available),       43.7% of Black women, 38.6% of Black men, 37.1% of Hispanic       women, 26.6% of Hispanic men, 34.6% of White women and 28.2%       of White men. We know firsthand that many survivors from       vulnerable populations hesitate to contact law enforcement or       do not trust the court system to address their victimization       because they fear, based on prior experience, that any       justice system response may not help them. We expect anyone       who serves as Attorney General to create a Justice Department       accessible to all; the 5th and 14th Amendments of the U.S.       Constitution demand no less.        Senator Sessions' well-documented prosecutorial record, as       U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Alabama and as       Attorney General for the State of Alabama, demonstrate his       propensity to inequitably apply the law to the disadvantage       of historically marginalized populations. Senator Sessions'       history leads us to question whether he will vigorously seek       to ensure that all victims and survivors of gender-based       violence, particularly vulnerable populations and those at       the margins of society, have access to vitally needed       services and legal protections.   Senator Sessions' Opposition to Protections for the Immigrant and LGBT                                Communities         We are concerned that the positions that Senator Sessions       has taken on immigration and LGBT individuals pose grave       threats to vulnerable victims of gender-based violence. His       consistent support of immigration policies that increase the       barriers to safety for undocumented victims of sexual and       domestic violence victims pushes immigrant victims further       into the shadows and harms families and communities by       allowing perpetrators (batterers and rapists) to abuse,       traffic and assault with impunity. During the consideration       of two major comprehensive immigration reform bills, as well       on various other occasions, Senator Sessions has sponsored       amendments and stand-alone legislation to limit the       availability of critical safety net assistance for immigrants       and increase barriers to protections from abuse and       exploitation by penalizing local jurisdictions that fail to       engage in immigration enforcement activities. He has made no       subsequent statement that indicates that he would rethink       these punitive policy positions were he to be confirmed.        His failure to support, and sometimes active opposition to,       progress and protections for the LGBT community leave us       gravely concerned that if confirmed, he would not stand up       for the rights of the LGBT community generally, and       particularly with respect to LGBT victims of violence. He       opposed the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes       Prevention Act, which is of particular concern as we witness       a spike in harassment of minorities and bias crimes over the       last several months. Additionally, he supported a       constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage. He also       opposed the repeal of ``Don't Ask Don't Tell.'' Senator       Sessions' record sends the message to marginalized survivors       that their experiences will not be understood, nor will their       rights be protected, if he is confirmed as the Attorney       General.                 Opposition to the Violence Against Women Act         We are also concerned that the nominee voted against the       Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) Reauthorization of 2013.       Seventy-eight out of one hundred senators supported the       bipartisan bill; Senator Sessions was in the distinct       minority. The 2013 Act addresses the gaps in law that were       uncovered through outreach to and surveys of programs and       service providers and domestic and sexual violence victims       themselves.        Our analysis revealed that many survivors were not able to       access services and justice to the extent they needed. Of       particular note, we found that LGBT survivors often lacked       access to justice and support based on their gender identity       or their sexual orientation. We also learned of the       deplorable lack of access to justice faced by survivors of       domestic violence and sexual assault on tribal lands. VAWA       2013 included provisions that removed one of many barriers       that prevent access to justice for American Indian and Alaska       Native domestic violence survivors. The 2013 statute's       provisions expand and ensure that immigrant survivors can       access VAWA protections, allowing survivors to come out of       the shadows, help hold batterers and abusers accountable, and       enable law enforcement to protect community safety. VAWA       2013's goal of ensuring equal protection of the law was       rejected by Senator Sessions, who cast the bill's       advancements toward inclusion and equal protection as       political maneuvering and, in that light, voted against the       bill. The Attorney General is tasked with ensuring that       VAWA's protection and programs are available and accessible       to all. Senator Sessions' opposition to the VAWA protections       and his prosecutorial record leave us gravely concerned that       he would not vigorously or consistently apply these       protections.                                  Conclusion         The 14th Amendment provides the inalienable right that       every person receive equal protection under the law. Senator       Sessions' senate record of strenuous objection to protections       for historically marginalized populations, coupled with his       record of selective prosecutions, demonstrate his       unwillingness to protect marginalized victims' access to       justice and disqualify him from holding the position of       Attorney General of the United States, a position charged       with the responsibility of securing justice for all.       Selective application of the law and outward hostility       towards victims of sexual and domestic violence in       historically marginalized populations has a chilling effect       on their willingness and ability to seek services and       protection. It drives sexual violence, domestic violence,       dating violence and stalking underground, something we have       made great strides to avoid. The Attorney General of the       United States must be an individual committed to protecting       the inalienable right of equal protection under the law to       all within United States' jurisdiction. Moreover, his       minimizing comments about the nature of sexual assault call       into question his dedication to enforcing the law and       providing justice to victims of this serious crime.        In short, we oppose Senator Sessions' confirmation as       Attorney General of the United States and we ask you, as a       member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, to ask him direct       questions regarding the concerns raised in this letter, and       to advise the President, pursuant to the prescription of 28       U.S.C.  [[Page S942]]       Sec. 503, that Senator Sessions' is unqualified to hold this       post.            Yours truly,       The National Task Force to End Sexual and Domestic Violence.    Mr. President, since 1989, Vermont has accepted more than  8,000 refugees from around the world. Most recently, two families from  war-torn Syria were placed in Rutland.   Vermonters understand the meaning of community, of supporting one  another through tough times and celebrating together in seasons of joy.  Over the last three decades, the meaning of community has expanded to  include numerous nationalities as Vermonters have welcomed new  neighbors from countries including Somalia, Sudan, and Bhutan, among  others. Over the last 25 years, Vermont's growing diversity has infused  vitality and a diversity of culture into our rural State as locals open  their arms--and their hearts--to new cultures and ways of life. New  Vermonters hail from the world over  [[Page S965]]  and are greeted in the Green Mountains by support groups and refugee  associations. Some organizations aid new arrivals by offering workforce  developments and translation services, while others host furniture and  clothing drives. Many refugees are able to find jobs in Vermont's  bustling tourism industry, as they work to save for future endeavors.   These support networks expand as the same individuals who once relied  on refugee organizations begin to offer guidance to others. For some,  this means years of saving before opening restaurants or stores with  food and products that feature their home countries. Others focus on  engaging recently arrived refugees in the very communities that they  were welcomed into. As their roots grow deeper and their communities  wider, Vermont's cultural vibrancy increases.   At the end of the day, however, these refugees have become part of  the fabric of our communities. Vermont has become a home, if not their  first home. In an article featured in POLITICO in November 2016, one  refugee, Ramadan Bahic, a Bosnian Muslim who fled their Serb-controlled  town during the Bosnian civil war said, ``My language is my language,  my accent will stay, but if you ask me, I'm a Vermonter.''   To Mr. Bahic and to those refugees recently settled in Vermont--or  hope to do so in the future--I say welcome home.   I ask unanimous consent that the text of a November 2016 POLITICO  article, ``My Language is My language, But I'm a Vermonter,'' be  printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                       [From POLITICO, Nov. 17, 2016]             `My Language Is My Language, But I'm a Vermonter'         Vermont has accepted thousands of refugees over the years,       boosting the population and the economy. A debate over       accepting Syrians put the state to the test.                             (By Erick Trickey)         Burlington--Eight years ago, Som Timsina's family left a       refugee camp in Nepal and became one of the first Bhutanese       families to seek sanctuary in Vermont. Timsina drove the       Holiday Inn's shuttle on night shifts for three years as he       saved to open his own Asian grocery. Five years later,       Central Market has become a gathering place for the state's       growing population of ethnic Nepali from Bhutan, and its       kitchen dishes out Himalayan cuisine that gets raves from       locals on Yelp--tikka masala and biryani, plus Nepali momo       dumplings.        Timsina, 38, works long, fast-paced days. In a 20 minute       chat in his store, he never takes off his black jacket or       takes the Bluetooth from his ear. Though business isn't as       strong as he'd like, and housing costs in Burlington are       high, Vermonters, he says, have offered a welcoming refuge       for him and his family--including his father, who was       tortured by authorities in Bhutan.        ``They react good so far,'' he says of Vermonters. ``They       are helping us.''        For decades now, Vermont has welcomed refugees from around       the world: more than 8,000 since 1989, just over 1 percent of       the small state's population. Vermonters have been almost       Canadian in their big-hearted welcome of the displaced and       persecuted, primarily from Somalia, Sudan, Central Africa,       Bhutan and Bosnia. They're generous donors of furniture and       household goods for new arrivals. They've taken Somali       refugees into their homes to help them adjust to American       life. And their schools have stepped up with English-language       classes for kids from abroad. In Vermont, refugee       resettlement has enjoyed near-unanimous support from state       and local political leaders, who see it as a way to add youth       and vigor to the largely rural state's declining population.       And for the most part their constituents have agreed. Until       this year.        On April 26--the same day Donald Trump swept through seven       Republican primaries in the northeast--the mayor of Rutland,       southern Vermont's largest town, announced a plan to accept       up to 100 war refugees a year, beginning with Syrian       families. The reaction was swift. A volunteer group, Rutland       Welcomes, organized to prepare for the Syrians' arrival, and       at the same time a vocal group bent on halting the       resettlement, Rutland First, flooded meetings in the town of       16,000. The ensuing debate, which dragged on through the       summer, was a miniature version of the emotionally charged       argument that dominated so much of the presidential cycle.       But the way Rutland residents responded was quintessentially       Vermont: generous and pragmatic. In the end, most residents       saw that this was about more than the refugees' well-being.       It was about their own as well.        A six-foot-tall teddy bear with a red bowtie rests on a       shelf in Vermont Bosna Cutting, Ramadan Bahic's fabric shop.       It's a photo op for every kid who visits the business, and a       symbol of how Bahic and his wife rebuilt their lives in the       Green Mountain State after fleeing Bosnia in 1993. Fashion       designers before the war, the Bahics now cut fabric for       clients that include the Vermont Teddy Bear Co.        ``I can say I'm born here,'' says Bahic, 56, burly and       upbeat. ``My language is my language, my accent will stay,       but if you ask me, I'm a Vermonter.''        Bahic and his family, all of them Bosnian Muslims, fled       their Serb-controlled town during the Bosnian civil war. ``My       father was beaten by Serbs,'' Bahic says. ``Both my parents,       they were almost killed. We were witnesses, so we were       supposed to be killed.'' The Red Cross evacuated them to a       refugee camp in Croatia, and after four months, they were       resettled in Burlington.        Though Vermont isn't known for its diversity--whites make       up 94 percent of its population of 625,000--that's changing.       Bahic's new life is a testament to the major role refugees       have played in bringing new cultures to Burlington. His       parents' funeral services were presided over by an imam from       the Islamic Center of Vermont, one of the state's two       mosques. Though Bahic leads a mostly secular life--he likes       to gamble and drink--he's visited Burlington-area churches to       explain Islam. The 15 employees at his business in suburban       Winooski include many Vietnamese-immigrant seamstresses. His       Bhutanese neighbors in his Colchester apartment complex are       working hard, hunting for new work, moving up. ``In five       years, they're looking to buy a house, some looking to buy a       new car,'' he says.        Immigrants in Vermont have organized to help newer       arrivals. The Association of Africans Living in Vermont,       founded as a social circle, now offers workforce development       and translation services to new refugees. Tuipate Mubiay, a       Congolese immigrant who co-founded the group in 1999, also       runs an orientation and a conversation partners program for       refugee students at the Community College of Vermont.        ``I feel Vermont has more open doors than other states,''       says Mubiay. Immigrants in the state tend to find jobs,       apartments and health insurance faster than elsewhere, he       says.        At the Vermont Refugee Resettlement Program in Colchester,       the state's only refugee placement agency, flyers on a lobby       bulletin board offer refugees tips on jobs, health care and       transportation: ``UPS is now hiring,'' ``Vermont Health       Connect,'' ``Get a bike--Bike Recycle Vermont,'' ``And       Remember, Please Give 15 Days Notice If You Are Quitting A       Job.'' The Children's Book of America, edited by William J.       Bennett, the Reagan administration secretary of education,       rests on a coffee table, its cover illustration a bunch of       kids from a kaleidoscope of ethnicities waving American       flags.        Amila Merdzanovic, VRRP's director, came to Vermont in 1995       as a Bosnian refugee. She makes the case for resettlement's       contributions to Vermont: It brings about 200 working adults       a year to a state with a stagnant, aging population. ``We       have employers calling us on a daily basis, saying, `We need       workers,' she says. Many refugees get jobs at hotels and       restaurants. Landlords call, too, despite Burlington's low       housing vacancy rate. ``Refugees are hyper-aware of the       importance of good credit,'' she says. ``[They] take care of       their apartments and their neighborhoods.''        It's hard to measure refugees' assimilation or happiness.       Instead, agencies like VRRP look at self-sufficiency to       measure success. Refugees get a one-time payment of $925 to       $1,125 to start anew in the U.S. After that, the goal is to       help them find a job that pays enough to make them ineligible       for state aid. In 2015, Merdzanovic says, 75 percent of       employable adults resettled in Vermont were self-sufficient       within three months of arriving. By eight months, the figure       rose to 88 percent.        ``[If] we don't hear from them, we know they're working,       their kids are in school, they're driving, they have a car       and driver's license. That's a success,'' she says.        In Burlington, refugees' biggest challenge is affordable       housing. Timsina, the Bhutanese grocer, says some refugees       have moved to Ohio or Pennsylvania because of Burlington's       high rents--at least $1,500 a month for a three-bedroom       apartment. That's one reason Rutland appealed to VRRP.        But accepting Rutland's application to become a       resettlement site for Syrians has exposed VRRP to something       it hasn't dealt with elsewhere: angry opposition. ``It's very       different,'' says Merdzanovic. ``It's new waters for all of       us.''        As Rutland Mayor Chris Louras crosses a downtown street       corner, an SUV pulls up. ``Hey, Louras!'' shouts the       passenger.        ``Mr. Congressman!'' says the mayor.        Peter Welch, Vermont's lone member of the House of       Representatives, is the passenger, and he's not at all       surprised to find the mayor giving an interview about his       support for refugees. Welch is quick to say that he and       Vermont's senators back Louras' effort.        ``All three of us support accepting refugees in the       country--America needs to do its share--but the real hard       work is in the communities where people are going to land and       live,'' Welch says.        It hasn't been easy, but Louras, an Army veteran who still       sports a soldier's buzz cut, has a history of charging ahead.       That's what Louras did last November, when Vermont Governor       Peter Shumlin, a Democrat, announced that he, unlike several       Republican governors, would continue to welcome Syrian       refugees to his state.  [[Page S966]]         ``I saw that as an opportunity,'' Louras says, ``not just       to do the right thing--to open our doors to a people who are       fleeing for their lives--but also to do the right thing for       the community.'' Louras says Syrian refugees could give       Rutland a population boost and more cultural and ethnic       diversity, which in turn could help the town attract and       retain millennials.        ``Our population is crashing,'' Louras says. Though Rutland       is one of Vermont's largest cities, that doesn't mean it's       very big. About 16,000 people live there, down from 19,000 in       1970. Louras, mayor for nine years, has worked to turn it       around. He says downtown occupancy is at 95 percent, up from       75 percent when he started. But Rutland has been hit hard by       the opioid epidemic and the subprime mortgage crisis.       Absentee landlords have neglected their properties, leaving       the city to step in with garbage pickup and grass-mowing.       Refugees, he says, could revitalize the city's hardest-hit       neighborhoods.        ``In Burlington and Winooski, new Americans really take       pride in where they live and become very engaged community       members.'' Besides, he says, the town's economy needs       workers: Unemployment is below 4 percent in Rutland County,       and the region's top employers, Rutland Regional Medical       Center and a GE aviation plant, have trouble finding new       employees.        So, after talking with State Department and Homeland       Security officials, VRRP, the local school district and major       regional employers, Louras announced in April that Rutland       would apply to welcome 100 refugees a year, starting with 100       Syrians. A supportive group, Rutland Welcomes, organized       almost immediately to prepare for the Syrians' arrival. So       did opposition.        ``These are the same people or many of the same who danced       in the street celebrating 9/11, the same people who hate       us,'' read a change.org petition against the resettlement,       with more than 400 supporters. Another group, Rutland First,       also launched fierce criticisms of the refugee resettlement       plan and hosted national anti-immigration speakers Philip       Haney and James Simpson in September.        Some critics complained that Louras had acted secretly by       not informing the city's board of aldermen. ``To keep it a       big, fat, frickin' secret until it's too late obviously       breeds mistrust,'' says Rutland City Treasurer Wendy Wilton.        In a July meeting, the aldermen narrowly rejected a       petition to hold a nonbinding citywide referendum on refugee       resettlement. Instead, they voted to send a letter to the       State Department saying they weren't ready to endorse the       idea.        ``The last thing I wanted was for Rutland to be tarred [as]       the community that voted on whether or not Muslims could be       our neighbors,'' says Will Notte, president of the aldermen,       who supports resettlement. ``We never voted on Italians       coming. We didn't vote on the Poles. This is not something       that is meant to be decided at the ballot box.''        Rutland alderman Scott Tommola, who voted to send the       question to the ballot, says he's not opposed to taking in       refugees. ``I've met very few who are adamantly opposed to       this,'' Tommola says. ``The majority of people I talk to are       cautiously optimistic.'' But he isn't convinced that the city       has the jobs, housing and education capacity to take in 100       refugees a year. ``Show me these jobs and the housing that's       adequate,'' he says.        In August, at a Rutland First meeting, Wilton claimed that       taking in refugees will cause Rutland's property taxes to       rise. She predicts they'll drive up English-language learning       costs in local schools, and their housing needs will require       the city to spend more on community development. ``It could       be much more difficult than we think to help these folks,''       she says. Louras and others have disputed Wilton's figures.       The mayor says taking in refugees won't cost City Hall a       thing, and the schools superintendent says the district has       excess capacity for teaching English.        Wilton, like Rutland First, says she isn't completely       opposed to taking in refugees--maybe 25 a year would be OK,       she says. But she's concerned that they'll take jobs from       native Vermonters and that there aren't enough middle-class       jobs in town to offer economic mobility. She also has       security concerns about admitting Syrians to the U.S., citing       intelligence concerns that ISIS can generate fake passports       and may try to infiltrate the West through refugee flows.       ``We're more than likely to end up, out of 10,000, 20,000       people, to have some folks here that don't have our best       interests at heart,'' she says.        Louras says he's confident that the federal vetting process       is solid: ``Individuals who want to do us harm are not going       to come through refugee resettlement.''        In late September, the State Department approved Rutland as       a new home for refugees. Louras says 75 Syrians from either       the Zaatari refugee camp in Jordan or camps in Lebanon, plus       25 Iraqis, should arrive in December or January.        Notte says he's confident that most Rutland residents       support the refugees' arrival. He says meetings of Rutland       Welcomes attract much larger audiences than resettlement's       vocal opponents. The refugees' supporters have organized a       furniture donation drive and begun holding free weekly Arabic       lessons at the Unitarian Universalist Church.        ``Vermont is desperately in need of young working people,''       Notte says. ``It's a match made in heaven.''                            ____________________     Mr. President, I have come to this Chamber to pay tribute  to Dermot Gallagher, an Irish diplomat and civil servant who I was  deeply saddened to hear passed away on January 15, 2017, after a  lifetime dedicated to public service.   Dermot Gallagher was a friend of the United States. His career  overseas was bookended by tours here, having first been posted at the  Irish consulate in San Francisco in 1971 before serving at the United  Nations in New York, the Irish Embassy in London, with the European  Commission in Brussels, as Irish Ambassador to Nigeria, and ultimately  returning to the U.S. as the Irish Ambassador in Washington.   He is perhaps best known for his role in the Northern Ireland peace  process. For decades, Dermot was involved in efforts to bring about  peace and reconciliation. He was involved in the Sunningdale  negotiations in 1973, implementation of the Anglo-Irish Agreement in  the late 1980s, and ultimately the negotiations and implementation of  the Good Friday Agreement, when he used his ``emollient style of  negotiation and diplomacy,'' as former junior minister and former  Senator Martin Mansergh aptly described, to make significant  contributions.   Dermot was also my friend. Over the course of his 6 years as  Ambassador, my wife Marcelle and I came to know Dermot and his wife,  Maeve, and I was fortunate to retain his friendship long after he  returned to Ireland to advance the cause of peace.   I fondly recall our discussions about the relationship between the  U.S., and particularly Vermont, and Ireland over dinner while he was  Ambassador, visiting with him over a decade later when he had returned  to Ireland and I visited on a trade mission, and the many conversations  between about our families, our shared heritage, and our passion for  U.S.-Ireland relations and the cause of peace.   I shared a personal memory in Ireland nearly 20 years ago that is  worth sharing again because it speaks to who Dermot was as a person.  While he was Ambassador, I was discussing my family's Irish ancestry,  and I told him I wished my father, Howard Francis Leahy, had still been  with us to know my family was planning a trip to Ireland. Dermot said  to me, ``Pat, don't you think your father knows?'' It brought tears to  my eyes. He was as personable and genuine as he was a skillful  diplomat.   Perhaps his legacy has been best conveyed by the reaction of his  former colleagues on learning of his passing, who described him as a  ``gentleman,'' ``distinguished diplomat,'' and a ``brilliant, creative  and warm human being.'' President Michael D. Higgins noted his  significant contribution to the peace process. Minister for Foreign  Affairs Charlie Flanagan lauded his ``talented service,'' marked by  ``great loyalty and constant commitments.'' Prime Minister Enda Kenny  described him as a ``patriot, an outstanding public servant who  embodied the best of Ireland and its people.''   Dermot was all of these things, and he will be greatly missed, but  affectionately remembered.   Marcelle and I send our deepest condolences to his wife, Maeve, and  to their children, Fiona, Aoife, and Ronan.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I would like to take a moment today to  honor Father Ray Doherty, a fellow Michaelman and a pillar of the St.  Michael's College community. Father Ray, as he is warmly known,  exemplifies so many of the qualities we Vermonters hold dear. His  compassion and leadership have contributed to a vibrant college campus  and has inspired those beyond its borders. As a member of the Society  of Saint Edmund, whose members founded the college in 1904, Father Ray  has embodied a commitment to social justice throughout his lifetime of  service.   Father Ray first came to St. Michael's as a 17-year-old freshman. He  spent his college years as both a student and an athlete, gracing the  baseball program with his talents as pitcher before graduating in 1951.  Father  [[Page S967]]  Ray then served as a staff sergeant in the U.S. Marine Corps during the  Korean conflict. It was there that Father Ray saw the importance of  loyalty and strong leadership, leading him to join another brotherhood  following his discharge.   As an Edmundite priest for more than six decades, Father Ray had  advised and supported countless students at Saint Michael's. His  leadership on campus focuses on setting a good example through actions  rather than words. Father Ray's commitment to social justice and  involvement in campus service organizations has fostered peace and  justice with in the college community. Though honored with an array of  awards, including induction into the college's athletic hall of fame  and the establishment of a scholarship in his name, Father Ray remains  humble. His role as an administrator, leader, and friend is rooted in a  sense of selflessness and an everlasting commitment to the community  around him.   To my friend Ray, I say, ``Semper Fi.''   The St. Michael's College Magazine recently highlighted Father Ray's  service, and I ask unanimous consent that that featurette be printed in  the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                   Great Leaders Think of the Common Good                         (By Susan Salter Reynolds)         Father Ray Doherty, SSE, served as a staff sergeant in the       United States Marine Corps during the Korean conflict, and       has been an Edmundite priest in the campus ministry and on       the Board of Trustees at Saint Michael's for half a century.       He is, by all accounts, a much-loved and admired presence on       the campus.        ``What I look for in leadership is a good example,'' he       says, paraphrasing St. Francis: ``It's not so much what you       say as what you do.'' Father Ray can't help but point out       that in this election season these words took on special       meaning.        ``Great leaders think of the common good,'' he says. ``They       aren't in it just for themselves.'' Here at Saint Michael's,       he says, ``We are blessed with the opportunity to lead by       example.''        Father Ray believes that making people feel safe is an       important part of good leadership. He admires the leadership       of Pope Francis ``He is a man of action,'' Father Ray says,       recalling a time when Pope Francis embraced a man with a very       disfigured face. ``He didn't hesitate. This is an example of       actions being more important than words.''        Humility is another raw ingredient of leadership, and       Father Ray sees this quality on campus in many places,       including the leadership of President Jack Neuhauser. ``He is       extremely humble--always stands in the back for group       photographs!''        Was the leadership Father Ray saw in the Marines different       from the leadership he has experienced in civilian life?       ``The training was strict,'' he says, ``but I might never       have become a priest if I hadn't had that opportunity to       think about things. There's a lot of love in military life.       Many talk about love for their fellow Marines, about fighting       maybe not for a cause or a country but in the moment for the       guy next to you. You develop these bonds, this loyalty''        ``Leadership can also mean listening to the call. When I       look back on my life I see so many surprising moments when I       made decisions on my own or with God's help. As a Christian       and a believer, I do believe that there is some guidance out       there if we are open to it. We must be open to inspiration in       order to he good leaders.''                            ____________________
