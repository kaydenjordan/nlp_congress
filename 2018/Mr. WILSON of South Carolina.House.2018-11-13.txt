 Mr. Speaker, it is with sincere  gratitude and appreciation that I have the opportunity to recognize  Taylor Andreae, former deputy chief of staff for South Carolina's  Second Congressional District. I will always appreciate Taylor for his  years of service on behalf of the people of South Carolina.   Taylor is a graduate of Wake Forest University and is a recent  graduate of the United States Army War College, where he received a  master's degree in strategic studies and national security policy  studies.   Taylor worked on a wide array of issues, specializing in armed  services, national security, and foreign affairs. Beginning as a  military legislative assistant in 2014, it has been an honor to work  with such a dedicated public servant who began his service with Senator  Lindsey Graham.   Taylor will continue his service as chief of staff for Representative   Mike Gallagher. I know his parents, Jane and Chip, are grateful for  his success, as both have been congressional staff members, with Chip  being former chief of staff for Senator Richard Lugar from Indiana.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism. Our prayers for the  victims of the wildfires in California.                            ____________________
