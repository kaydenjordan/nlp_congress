 Madam Speaker, I rise to thank President Joe Biden, the  first President I have ever noted that asked for a review of America's  supply chain for manufactured goods. It grew out of his interest in the  pandemic and the fact we couldn't supply our ventilators, our face  masks, our gloves, all the protective equipment for our healthcare  workers.   He is on the right track because all of that has been outsourced. I  think one of the reasons we can't get vaccines at the level we need is  because the ingredients have been outsourced. America needs to bring  back industry here.   Today's New York Times has a story, ``In China, an Electric Car Maker  Loses Money but Thinks Big,'' and I commend this story to the Biden  administration and everyone who is listening.   We have to have a fair playing field globally in order to maintain  manufacturing in this country because places like China play under the  table. They have vehicles that lose money in the marketplace, but it is  a state-run economy, and they will subsidize what they have to in order  to win that market share.   Congratulations, President Biden, you are on the right track.                            ____________________
