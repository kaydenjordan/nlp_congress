 MALONEY of New York asked and was given permission  to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her  remarks.)    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I strongly support  H.R. 1, the For the People Act.   Included in this important legislation is the Vote by Mail Tracking  Act, legislation I introduced to ensure that all ballots in Federal  elections have a Postal Service barcode.   This would enable election officials and the public to track the  status of a ballot from when it is put in the mail to when it is  delivered, reducing anxiety, increasing accuracy, transparency, and  accountability for our ballots.   After an election year with record-breaking numbers of Americans  voting by mail, it has never been more critical to provide election  officials and the public peace of mind that every vote matters and is  counted accurately.   I urge overwhelming support for H.R. 1, which includes reforms across  our Government that are critically important, and it includes this  important bill, too.                            ____________________
