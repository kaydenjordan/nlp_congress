 Madam President, November 21, 2021, will mark the  26th World Day of Remembrance--WDoR--for Road Traffic Victims,  commemorating the millions of people killed and injured on the world's  road. It is also a day to thank emergency responders for their role in  saving lives, to reflect on the impact of road traffic deaths and  injuries on families and communities, and to draw attention to the need  for improved legislation, awareness, infrastructure, and technology to  save more families from the tragedy of losing a loved one.   More than I million people die from road crashes every year, and tens  of millions are seriously injured. Road traffic crashes are the No. 1  killer of young people aged 15-29 and the eighth leading cause of death  among all people worldwide. Rochelle Sobel, president of the  Association for Safe International Road Travel, highlighted the gravity  of this issue and the imperative to fix it: ``Every 27 seconds,  somewhere in the world, a person dies in a road crash.''   On this 26th anniversary of World Day of Remembrance for Road Traffic  Victims, it is important to remember the history and recommit to the  goals of this day. It was initiated in 1995 as the European Day of  Remembrance and quickly spread around the globe to countries in Africa,  South America, and Asia. In 2005, the United Nations General Assembly  adopted resolution 60/2, recognizing November 15 as the World Day of  Remembrance for Road Traffic Victims. Since that time, the observance  of this day has continued to spread to a growing number of countries on  every continent.   This year marks the start of the new Decade of Action for Road Safety  2021-2030, during which the WDoR will highlight the reasons for all of  the necessary actions to be taken during this coming decade. Indeed,  the day has become an important moment to focus international attention  on this preventable epidemic and as an advocacy tool in global efforts  to reduce road casualties. As a result of the growing awareness and  global call to action that World Day of Remembrance for Road Traffic  Victims has generated, in September 2020, the United Nations passed a  resolution declaring the years 2021 to 2030 a new Decade of Action for  Road Safety. The declaration affirms the UN's commitment to work  vigorously to implement a new, ambitious agenda to halve road crash  deaths by 2030.   Additionally, the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 3.6  calls on governments and their stakeholders, including NGOs and private  citizens, to address the personal, medical, and financial burdens  associated with road traffic deaths and injuries.   The devastation of losing a child, parent, sibling, partner, friend,  caregiver, or caretaker is immeasurable, as are the challenges of  caring for a permanently disabled loved. Road traffic crashes are  preventable, and so we owe it to our communities to work together so  that the hopes and dreams of our loved ones are not shattered on the  roads of the United States and the world. We must all take action to  prevent these avoidable tragedies and save lives.                            ____________________
