 Mr. Speaker, last week, tragedy struck my community  when an explosion rocked the R.M. Palmer chocolate factory in West  Reading, claiming the lives of seven people and injuring many others.   Most people know Palmer chocolate for their Easter bunnies and other  holiday treats, but we know them as an important part of our community.   Since the tragedy, our first responders have been heroes.   Our neighbors, nonprofits, and local businesses have set up programs  to help and, in some cases, literally have given the shirts off their  backs for those who were impacted.   Similarly, and also not surprisingly in our community, government  leaders at the local, State, and Federal levels are also on the ground,  collaborating together to support our community and recovery.   I speak today full of grief for the families and friends of those  whom we have lost, and I speak today full of gratitude for the strength  and dedication of so many in our community who are doing so much.   We see you, and we honor you. We are very proud to stand with you.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, while there is a great deal of divisive  and partisan debate on the energy bill that is being considered this  week, I rise to offer a bipartisan, commonsense, and straightforward  amendment to protect U.S. national security in times of energy crisis.   The amendment closes a dangerous loophole that has existed since 2015  which allows our foreign adversaries to purchase our strategic oil  supply.   As the law is currently written, oil from the Strategic Oil Reserve  is sold by the Department of Energy to the highest bidder with few  exceptions on what countries can purchase from the U.S. supply. That  means that our fiercest adversaries, like China, Russia, Iran, or North  Korea and other sanctioned governments, can purchase and export our  strategic oil. In fact, companies owned by and affiliated with the  Chinese Communist Party have won purchase contracts during the past two  Presidential administrations.   Simply put, this loophole threatens our national security, and it  poses serious harm to American families. The American people need  Congress to act and to act quickly.   That is why I reached across the aisle to introduce the Banning Oil  Exports to Foreign Adversaries Act with my colleague, Representative    Don Bacon. My amendment includes the straightforward and commonsense  solution put forward by our bill. It prohibits the export or sale of  the Strategic Petroleum  [[Page H1589]]  Reserve to China, North Korea, Russia, Iran, and any country currently  under U.S. sanctions.   In January, my colleagues and I voted to pass a bill through the  House of Representatives that would prohibit the sale of our strategic  reserve to China, but that legislation does not go far enough.   Do we want North Korea buying American oil? How about Iran or Russia?   As a veteran and one of the most bipartisan Members of this body, my  position remains clear. We must make sure that we put national security  over party politics. We must ensure that our foreign adversaries are  not allowed to profit at the expense of American safety and security.   My amendment reflects the fact that Congress has more work to do on  this to close this dangerous loophole, not just for China but for any  foreign adversary that poses a threat to our Nation.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues, both Republicans and Democrats  alike, to support this amendment and to include the bipartisan Banning  Oil Exports to Foreign Adversaries Act in this legislation.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
