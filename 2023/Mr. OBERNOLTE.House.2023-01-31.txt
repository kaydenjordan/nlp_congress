 Mr. Speaker, in times of national crisis, our  Constitution and our Federal laws empower our President to temporarily  seize extraordinary power. This is necessary to allow him the authority  to alter Federal law to meet the urgent needs of the emergency.   In this case, that declaration of emergency to meet the crisis of the  coronavirus pandemic occurred almost 3 years ago. Mr. Speaker, also  incumbent in that authority is the expectation that the executive  branch will return that authority to the people when it is no longer  needed. That is certainly the case today.   Congress has met hundreds and hundreds of times since the executive  branch first declared the state of emergency. Congress has had abundant  opportunity to pass Federal legislation codifying or rejecting the  President's recommendations. Unfortunately, the Biden administration  has recently renewed the state of emergency for a twelfth time. This is  not what the Founding Fathers intended.    Mr. Speaker, the Founding Fathers intended the legislative branch of  government, the people's elected Representatives, to be the ones that  set laws for the United States of America, and it is past time that  that authority be returned to the people.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this bill.
