 Mr. Speaker, I support H.R. 4447 which, in broad strokes,  would reform U.S. energy policy by making investments in energies that  will reduce our carbon footprint.   My amendment is offered, not as a critique of the underlying bill,  but to fulfill a promise made to constituents in my community that we  can simultaneously invest in cleaner energy and in our workforce.   My amendment creates opportunities for workers at risk of being  displaced so that they can begin or continue a career in construction.    For those in coal or other related industries, this amendment offers  cost-shared grants to pay for pre-apprenticeship training in cleaner  energy career paths. My amendment prioritizes grants to entities that  have a successful history of placing pre-apprentice graduates into full  apprenticeship programs or into gainful employment, and it supports  local businesses by creating a sliding scale of Federal cost sharing,  devoting a greater percentage of resources to small, local businesses  rather than to larger businesses that already have the financial  wherewithal to transition workers.   I urge a ``yes'' vote.
