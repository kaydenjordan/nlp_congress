 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Jeffries) for yielding me the time.   As someone who has been both a victim of police insensitivity and  someone who has spent his entire life in an area known for police  mistreating people, and somebody who represents the area where Emmett  Till was killed and his accuser wore a badge, this notion that somehow  law enforcement's activities just started is not true.   But, you know, you have to walk in my shoes and the shoes of the  Congressional Black Caucus to know what we are talking about. I hope at  some point we can get there.   I am a grandfather. The story my father told me about law  enforcement, this day I am telling my grandson that same story 50 years  later. Law enforcement hasn't changed.   So what we have to do is if we are committed to it, we have to  support this bill.   The notion that the system is not broken? It is operating how it was  designed, so we are going to have to fix it, and we fix it by  supporting this bill.
