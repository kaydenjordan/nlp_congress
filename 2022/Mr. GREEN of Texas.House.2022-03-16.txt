 Madam Speaker, and still I rise. And I rise today  with a very simple message: Those who believe that if we leave the  world alone, the world will leave us alone are entirely wrong.   Madam Speaker, the world would find its way to our door as it has  done so now with Ukraine.   I had the honor of hearing the President of Ukraine speak this  morning, and if there is something I came away with without question it  is this: It is that this war is about more than Ukraine. It is about  freedom-loving people wherever they may be. It is about people who will  not tolerate seeing women and babies being killed live on television.  It is about a belief that if you can do something to end an injustice,  you have to do it.   This is why I rise today to say, Madam Speaker, that if there is a  vote for planes for Ukraine, I will vote to support planes for Ukraine.  And I will do so because I believe that this is needed for their  defense.   While some would say: But the defense currently would not be planes  because they don't have to fight planes--that they are using long-range  projectiles to bomb Ukraine--my point is this: Let's not wait until the  skies over Ukraine have been darkened with Russian planes before we  send the help that they need.    I don't mind the world knowing that we are part of this. I don't  think we can allow a standard to be set such that in the future the  precedent is if you send in planes you are escalating. I think if we  send in planes, we are meeting the challenge that is necessary to  defend Ukraine.   Again, those who believe that if we leave the world alone it will  leave us alone are entirely wrong. This is about liberty and justice  for all; government of the people, by the people, and for the people of  Ukraine and the rest of us as well. This is about freedom-loving people  wherever they may be.   If there is a vote for planes, then I will vote for planes for  Ukraine.                            ____________________
