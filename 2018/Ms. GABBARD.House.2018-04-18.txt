 Mr. Speaker, over the last several days, the people of  Hawaii have faced extreme and severe weather, heavily impacting the  communities of Waimanalo, east Oahu, and most heavily, the island of  Kauai.   Far too many people are living and struggling in chaos as a result of  record-breaking rain, flooding, and landslides that have completely  devastated communities, homes, and businesses. It has led to hundreds  of people being evacuated.   Many people are still struggling without water and electricity. They  are stranded, separated from their children and family members on  different parts of the island, and relying on airlifts from the Hawaii  National Guard for basic supplies. Time and again, our Kauai community  has come together, proven to be strong and resilient, mobilized to  support and take care of each other.   I want to say a big thank you to Mayor Carvalho, the Hawaii National  Guard, the Coast Guard, our first responders, organizations like the  Red Cross, churches, schools, and members of our community who have  stood up and taken action, leaders like: Joel Guy and Ryan Sebring;  Doug Phillips, who was running boats; Laird Hamilton, who was running  water rescue; Hanalei and the Takeshiros, who were running their Zodiac  up and down the Wainiha River; Malama Kawai, Mocu Chandler, Laura  Richards, and so many more.    I am looking forward to being on Kauai tomorrow to offer my support  to those who are helping provide relief to those most affected as our  delegation stands ready to help Kauai recover from this disaster.                            ____________________
