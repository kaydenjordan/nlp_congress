 Mr. President, one of the challenges we face in this  era of great power competition is identifying unique threats before  they escalate.   When it comes to Russia and Ukraine, these threats have come into  full focus. Vladimir Putin took off his statesman costume and declared  a war of choice on Ukraine. Last week, we received the first public  allegations of his intent to unleash Syrian proxies on anyone still  standing between his war machine and the territory he covets.   I am glad to hear more of my colleagues speaking up about the unique  dangers of proxy wars. Last week, I laid out in detail how Putin has  used proxies to install himself in countries that are leadership poor  but resource rich.   We know that fighters from the Kremlin-backed Wagner Group have  slaughtered their way through Africa and the Middle East on behalf of  Putin's grand Soviet ambition. And now he is going to do the very same  thing in Ukraine.   We have also seen Iran unleash proxies and State-sponsored terror  organizations in Iraq, against American Armed Forces and against  civilian populations in Lebanon, Yemen, and Gaza.   In their 2022 threat assessment, the intelligence community stated:         We assess that Iran will threaten U.S. persons directly and       via proxy attacks, particularly in the Middle East.    This is a public statement. This is the Annual Threat Assessment. It  is backed by years of evidence, proving that Iran has done this before  and they are going to try to do it again.   President Biden should be doing everything in his power to keep this  threat as far away from American citizens as he can--but no such luck.  The impending nuclear deal he is trying to hand Tehran unlocks billions  of dollars for Iranian banks, companies, and other entities that  finance violence.   Where does the White House think that money will end up?   We know there is nothing Tehran loves more than a power vacuum. They  have invested heavily in Hezbollah, the Houthis, and Hamas--all  terrorist organizations hunkered down in some of the world's most  unstable regions. Over the past decade, the Iranians have spent more  than $16 million on carefully targeted bloodshed. That is right--Iran  alone, the largest state sponsor of terrorism.   The landscape is chaos, and, still, the Biden administration is  pushing the world toward a sanctions relief scheme that would empower  the Iranians to terrorize and subjugate even more people.   The regime in Tehran is a menace. This week, incoming CENTCOM  commander, General Kurilla, said as much in his confirmation hearing  when we asked him how sanctions relief would affect the Iranian  influence.   I am quoting him:         [T]here is a risk with sanctions relief that Iran would use       some of that money to support its proxies and terrorism in       the region, and if it did, it could increase risk to our       forces in the region.    In this week's CENTCOM posture review before the Armed Services  Committee, outgoing commander, General McKenzie, acknowledged these  concerns about sanctions relief, saying:         [T]here is a risk that they could use that money in ways       that we would not want them to use that money.    That is right. We certainly don't want them to put one more penny  toward these proxy wars, for good reasons.   First, proxies don't just parachute in and declare victory. They  brutalize entire populations and use weapons that these hostile regimes  wouldn't normally have access to.   Second, because proxies operate outside the law, the rogue regimes  that hire them maintain plausible deniability.   Third, this plausible deniability creates a false sense of security  that allows hostile governments to pull up a chair to the negotiating  table and pretend to fit in with normal countries, all the while  denying the United States access and placement.   We have a limited number of ways to deter hostile regimes from waging  war on the civilized world. The West failed the people of Ukraine in  this regard, but it is not too late to change course.   Ronald Reagan once said:         [W]ar comes not when the forces of freedom are strong, but       when they are weak. It is then that tyrants are tempted.    He believed in achieving peace through strength, and so do I.   It is pretty simple. If you don't stand up for yourself, you will get  run over, and if you don't stand up for your friends, there may not be  anyone left to help them when the wolves are actually at the door.   When I talk to Tennesseans about this, the one thing they want to  know is why President Biden makes decisions that make this country more  vulnerable and less safe. Whether through lifting sanctions on Iran,  slow-walking sanctions on Russia, or keeping our economy entangled with  China's, Biden has refused to lead. Forget doing what needs to be done;  he won't even say what needs to be said. He is fearful. He is scared to  anger the new Axis of Evil. He is scared to anger our more timid allies  in Europe. He is scared to anger the radical left here at home.   Is there anything that he is not afraid of?   He is so weak-kneed in the face of adversity that he can't even bring  himself to finish building the fence that would secure our southern  border.   I want to focus on that border security for just a few minutes  because, while Russia and Iran might dominate headlines, for  Tennesseans, our wide-open southern border is a perfect example of what  can happen when a President concedes national security to score points  on his political rivals.   Border encounters were up 2 percent in February. That is almost  165,000 people trying to enter the country unnoticed; 76 percent of the  people the Border Patrol caught were single adults; cocaine seizures  increased 83 percent; meth, 97 percent; heroin, 173 percent.   We know for a fact that terrorists and members of international  criminal organizations cross our border with impunity. Over the course  of 3 days last December, the Border Patrol arrested a guerrilla member  of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, four MS-13 gang members,  and an 18th Street gang member--six--six--distinguished representatives  from the most dangerous gangs in the entire world and they almost  disappeared into the country undetected. Thank goodness for law  enforcement because these are not ordinary criminals.    In January of 2021, the Department of Justice indicted the 14 most  senior members of MS-13 on charges of conspiracy to support, finance,  and commit acts of terrorism.   Is this the Biden doctrine--choosing vulnerability over security and  annihilation through weakness?   Who exactly does the President intend to win over with this approach?   Ukraine will find no peace in the easing of diplomatic tensions on  some  [[Page S1242]]  U.N. panel. Children in Africa won't have a future if we start writing  checks to proxy fighters. The people of El Salvador, Guatemala, and  Honduras won't be better off if we enable the drug dealers and sex  traffickers who make a living exploiting their families. No matter  where in the world you look, you can see the costs of Joe Biden's  willful blindness to danger.   He has the tools he needs to protect the United States from these  threats. Now, he needs to use them.   It is time to stop relying on foreign oil and make the country energy  independent again: Finish the Keystone Pipeline. Do an Operation Warp  Speed for energy. Allow oil and gas exploration on Federal land.   We have to stop leading from behind when it comes to preventing Iran  from obtaining nuclear weapons.   President Biden must submit to Congress any deal with Iran; and rest  assured, we will block the implementation of anything the White House  tries to sneak under the radar. We must pay attention to the flow of  money and power in proxy hotbeds and recognize the danger posed by  these terrorists for hire. We can't neglect security threats close to  home. It is time to secure the border and give our law enforcement  officials the resources they need to catch terrorists and gang members  before they disappear into the country.   Tennesseans can't identify with the President's refusal to lead. They  are confused and frightened, but they also have faith in our ability as  a country to pull out of this skid. They believe in the promise of  America. All they want is for their President and elected leaders to  prove that they also believe in this country.   I yield the floor.
