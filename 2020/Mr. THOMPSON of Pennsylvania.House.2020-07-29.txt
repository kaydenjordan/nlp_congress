 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  July as National Park and Recreation Month.   Our Nation is blessed with a robust park system across the country on  the Federal, State, and local levels. Summer is a popular time to take  advantage of all that our parks have to offer.   The coronavirus pandemic and the shelter-in-place orders that have  followed have left many of us desperate for fresh air, and as many  parks begin to reopen, there are plenty of beautiful landscapes and  outdoor activities to enjoy at parks across the country.   As a lifelong resident of rural Pennsylvania, an avid outdoorsman,  and someone who was a former recreational therapist at one point, I  know firsthand the positive impact that our Nation's parks system can  have on communities, and I am proud to be a strong supporter.   My district, Pennsylvania's 15th Congressional District, is home to  countless parks and outdoor recreational facilities, including the Oil  Region National Heritage Area and the Allegheny National Forest, just  to name a few.   This month is an opportunity to underscore the role that parks play  in our everyday lives and in the fabric of American culture. It is also  an opportunity to recognize the hard work and contributions of our park  employees. Our parks give us all an opportunity to connect with the  nature around us. They create a sense of community, stimulate local  economies by attracting businesses, jobs, and tourism, and increase the  quality of life for all residents.   Mr. Speaker, public parks and recreational facilities foster a  variety of activities that contribute to a healthier society. There is  an undeniable connection between parks and public health. Studies show  that Americans who live within a 10-minute walk of a park see increased  physical activity and lower obesity rates.   Recreational programs at public parks provide children with a safe  place to play, access to healthy foods, opportunities to be physically  active, and enrichment activities that help prevent at-risk behavior  such as drug use and gang involvement.   Just last week, the House passed the Great American Outdoors Act,  legislation that will ensure our national parks are around for future  generations to enjoy.   As summer continues, it is my hope that families across the country  will find an opportunity to take advantage of our Nation's parks and  recreation facilities. If considering a visit to one of our national  parks, visit the National Park Service website at nps.gov to find an  open park in your community.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to stress the  importance of researching, combating, and eradicating the spotted  lanternfly. This invasive pest is native to China, Bangladesh, and  Vietnam, but has been wreaking havoc in Pennsylvania since 2014.   The spotted lanternfly is a relentless menace that continues to harm  Pennsylvania's agricultural sector, damaging trees, and destroying crop  yields. These insects lay egg masses on trees, causing oozing sap, mold  growth, and more.  [[Page H3890]]    While the spotted lanternfly is harmless to humans, it can seriously  impact our surroundings. The Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture  estimates the potential damage in lost revenue from the spotted  lanternfly could amount to $18 billion per year, statewide.   I have been pleased to work with my colleague, Congresswoman  Houlahan, to stress the importance of ridding the Commonwealth of this  pest. It will take continued support to eradicate the spotted  lanternfly and prevent further harm to our environment and economy.   I would like to encourage any Pennsylvanian who encounters a spotted  lanternfly to get rid of it and to report an infestation to the  Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture.                            ____________________
