 Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from  women's community groups in support of this legislation.                                                      July 15, 2019.      Pass the Raise the Wage Act         Dear Members of Congress: As members of a broad coalition       of organizations that promote economic security and equity       for women, we strongly urge you to pass the Raise the Wage       Act as a top priority of the 116th Congress.        The Raise the Wage Act will raise the federal minimum wage       from $7.25 to $15 an hour by 2024, then index the minimum       wage so that it continues to rise along with wages overall.       It will also end unfair exclusions for tipped workers, people       with disabilities, and youth so that they, too, can benefit       from a decent minimum wage.        Women across the country--especially women of color--      continue to experience a pay gap and a higher risk of poverty       than men. Women working full time, year round typically make       only 80 percent of what their male counterparts make, leaving       a wage gap of 20 cents on the dollar. This wage gap varies by       race and is larger for women of color: Black women working       full time, year round typically make only 61 cents, Native       women only 58 cents, and Latinas only 53 cents, for every       dollar paid to their white, non-Hispanic male counterparts.       While Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) women make       85 cents for every dollar paid to white, non-Hispanic men,       many AAPI communities experience drastically wider pay gaps.        Women's overrepresentation in low-wage jobs is a driving       force behind the gender pay gap. Women are close to two-      thirds of the workforce in jobs that pay the minimum wage or       just a few dollars above it, as well as two-thirds of workers       in tipped jobs. Women of color are particularly       overrepresented among tipped workers and other low-wage       workers. They are particularly harmed by the $7.25 federal       minimum wage that has not gone up in a decade and by the       $2.13 tipped minimum cash wage that has been frozen for an       astonishing 28 years.        Poverty-level wages heighten women's economic       vulnerability, which in turn heightens their vulnerability to       sexual harassment on the job. Women who rely on tips to       survive often feel compelled to tolerate inappropriate       behavior from customers so as not to jeopardize their income       and employers are often unwilling to protect their employees       for fear of upsetting a paying customer. Women's lack of       economic power in these workplaces perpetuates the already       pervasive culture of sexual harassment in industries that       employ large numbers of tipped workers.        The Raise the Wage Act is critically needed to advance       women's economic security and dignity in the workplace. The       Economic Policy Institute estimates that increasing the       federal minimum wage to $15 by 2024 would give nearly one in       three working women a raise, including 41 percent of Black       working women, 38 percent of working Latinas, 29 percent of       white working women, and 18 percent of Asian working women.        Women and people of color have been left behind by our       economy and our policies far too often, for far too long.       Adopting the Raise the Wage Act would mark a crucial step       toward ensuring they can work with equity, dignity, and       safety. There is no more fitting way to begin this historic       Congress than by making real, concrete progress in ensuring       all women receive adequate pay.        We urge you to prioritize the Raise the Wage Act in the       116th Congress by swiftly passing this legislation.

I want to commend Chairman Scott and his staff for their outstanding  work to get us to this point.   The current Federal minimum wage rate hasn't budged in a decade, but  basic costs have, and they have dramatically. It is an affront to basic  fairness and an intolerable conditions for families working hard yet  falling further and further behind.   They live on a razor's edge facing impossible choices:   Paying the rent or the car;   Buying diapers and formula for their children or medication for  themselves;   Cutting a check for a student loan debt payment or a doctor's visit.   Today, a single mother with two children working full-time at $7.25  an hour is living well below the Federal poverty line. We can fix that  by voting to give her a raise.   Let's do the same for the rest of America by passing the Raise the  Wage Act. It is long overdue.
