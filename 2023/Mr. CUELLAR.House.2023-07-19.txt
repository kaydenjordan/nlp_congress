 Mr. Chairman, I thank the Texas delegation from San  Antonio--Mr. Joaquin Castro, Mr. Chip Roy, Mr.  Greg Casar, and Mr.  Tony Gonzales--for all working together, along with the Senators.   Mr. Chair, I rise in support of this amendment to add seven slots to  the Ronald Reagan National Airport.   Right now, cities like San Antonio cannot get direct flights. The  slots added in this amendment will allow more cities like San Antonio  to have a direct flight.   With a population of 1.4 million, San Antonio is the seventh largest  city in the U.S. San Antonio is known as Military Town USA and has over  80,000 Active-Duty members and 159,000 veterans. Joint Base San Antonio  trains more soldiers than any other place in the country, and it is  home to the Department of Defense's largest military hospital.   We have to do this for the veterans. We have to do this for the  soldiers.   Mr. Chair, for Military Town USA, along with the San Antonio  delegation, I ask that we pass this amendment.
