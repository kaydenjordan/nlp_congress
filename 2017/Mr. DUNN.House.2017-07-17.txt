 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate an exceptional  member of the United States Navy on the event of his retirement,  Commander Doug Huggan.   On Friday, July 14, Commander Huggan completed his tour as the  commanding officer of the Naval Support Activity Florida. This caps a  long and distinguished career.   His service to the Navy started as an E-6 airborne command pilot and  has taken him around the world, from the European Command to Japan, and  finally to Panama City.   While at NSA Panama City, Commander Huggan led over 3,000 Active-Duty  and civilian personnel in performing critical missions, including  surface warfare training, explosive ordnance disposal, salvage  training, and experimental diving.   His leadership over the last 2 years in the Second District is a  testament to the core values instilled upon all those who serve in the  Navy.   Mr. Speaker, please join me in saying thank you to Commander Huggan  and his family for their years of service and sacrifice, and wish them  luck as they move on to enjoy a new chapter in their life.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 2210) to designate the community living center of the Department  of Veterans Affairs in Butler Township, Butler County, Pennsylvania, as  the ``Sergeant Joseph George Kusick VA Community Living Center''.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2210         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) Sergeant Joseph George Kusick of Bruin, Pennsylvania,       was assigned to the command and control detachment of the 5th       Special Forces Group (Airborne) of the Army during the       Vietnam War.        (2) On November 8, 1967, Kusick distinguished himself by       exceptionally valorous actions while serving as a radio       operator of a special forces reconnaissance team on a combat       mission deep in hostile territory.        (3) During an enemy ambush, Kusick, though seriously       wounded, refused aid and radioed the forward air controller       to advise him of the critical situation.        (4) While the team leader led a withdrawal to a landing       zone, Kusick maintained contact with the controller and       requested emergency extraction.        (5) Realizing the importance of having a radio operator on       the ground to direct landings, Kusick refused evacuation by       the first helicopter.        (6) After the second helicopter was shot down, and in the       midst of enemy fire, Kusick continued to maintain radio       contact and called for a hoist extraction of the men still       remaining on the ground.        (7) The last helicopter, which Kusick boarded, was shot       down by intense Viet Cong fire and crashed in flames,       resulting in Kusick's death.        (8) On December 22, 1967, Kusick was posthumously awarded       the Silver Star Medal for gallantry in action.        (9) The citation to accompany the award of the Silver Star       Medal stated that ``Kusick's gallantry in action, at the cost       of his life, was in keeping with the highest traditions of       the military service and reflects great credit upon himself,       his unit, and the United States Army''.       SEC. 2. SERGEANT JOSEPH GEORGE KUSICK VA COMMUNITY LIVING                     CENTER.         (a) Designation.--The community living center of the       Department of Veterans Affairs in Butler Township, Butler       County, Pennsylvania, shall after the date of the enactment       of this Act be known and designated as the ``Sergeant Joseph       George Kusick VA Community Living Center''.        (b) References.--Any reference in any law, regulation, map,       document, paper, or other record of the United States to the       community living center referred to in subsection (a) shall       be deemed to be a reference to the ``Sergeant Joseph George       Kusick VA Community Living Center''.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Dunn) and the gentleman from California (Mr. Takano) each  will control 20 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.   The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Florida?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2210, a bill to  designate the Department of Veterans Affairs Community Living Center in  Butler Township, Pennsylvania, as the Sergeant Joseph George Kusick VA  Community Living Center.  [[Page H5891]]    Sergeant Kusick, a native of Bruin, Pennsylvania, served in the  United States Special Forces during the Vietnam war. During a combat  mission, deep in hostile territory, on November 8, 1967, Sergeant  Kusick was seriously wounded during an ambush by enemy forces.   Wounded, yet refusing aid and initial evacuation, he remained in the  midst of battle to help secure emergency extraction for his fellow  soldiers. The helicopter that Sergeant Kusick finally boarded was shot  down by Viet Cong fire and Sergeant Kusick's life was lost. He was just  22 years old.   Sergeant Kusick was posthumously awarded the Silver Star for `` . . .  gallantry in action, at the cost of his life . . . in keeping with the  highest traditions of the military service and reflects great credit  upon himself, his unit, and the United States Army.''   It is only fitting and appropriate that we honor Sergeant Kusick's  service and sacrifice by naming the VA Butler Healthcare's Community  Living Center after him.   H.R. 2210 is sponsored by Congressman Mike Kelly, from Pennsylvania,  and I am grateful to him for introducing it and allowing us to honor  and forever remember this great American hero. This legislation  satisfies all of the committee's naming criteria and, as such, is  supported by the entire Pennsylvania congressional delegation, as well  as by many veterans service organizations.   Once again, I thank Congressman Kelly for sponsoring this  legislation, and I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting  it.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 10 minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Kelly).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 10 minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Kelly).    Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman--our  colleagues--for his kind comments, and also especially Representative  Kelly for bringing forward this outstanding bill. I encourage all  Members to support this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Dunn) that the House suspend the rules and  pass the bill, H.R. 2210.   The question was taken.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds  being in the affirmative, the ayes have it.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further  proceedings on this motion will be postponed.                            ____________________
