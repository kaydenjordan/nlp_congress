 I announce that the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr.  Markey), the Senator from Washington (Mrs. Murray), and the Senator  from New Mexico (Mr. Udall) are necessarily absent.    Mr. President, I am grateful to Chairman Inhofe and  Ranking Member Reed and their staffs for their work to produce the  fiscal year 2021 defense authorization bill.   The FY21 NDAA authorizes $740.5 billion in defense spending, up $2  billion from last year. The bill provides a 3-percent pay raise for our  troops and includes provisions that support spouse employment,  childcare, and improved military housing. It ensures that the United  States can defend effectively against threats from Russia, China, and  North Korea and invests in key and innovative capabilities and  technologies. It includes key provisions I requested to boost efforts  at Rock Island Arsenal, address military sexual trauma, and protect the  health of our military communities from dangerous chemicals.   But this year, we take up the NDAA during a global pandemic, record  unemployment, and calls to address racial injustice. The bill touches  on some of these issues. It authorizes $44 million for vaccine and  medical research related to COVID-19 and expands benefits for Active  Duty and National Guard personnel involved in COVID response.   I am pleased that it includes a provision authored by Senator Warren  to require DOD to remove names, symbols, and other displays honoring  the Confederacy. If we want to move toward a more just society, we  cannot continue to honor Confederate leaders who committed treasonous  atrocities in order to preserve slavery.   I also authored two amendments that were included by consent, the  first an amendment supporting strong security assistance for the  Baltics that I filed with Senator Grassley. The Baltic States remain  key allies and among the few NATO countries that fulfill the target  spending of 2 percent of GDP on defense, and this provision encourages  support for more robust and enduring security assistance. My other  amendment is one I sponsored with Senator Portman, welcoming NATO  recognition of Ukraine as an Enhanced Opportunities Partner. EOP status  will help only further deepen cooperation with NATO, which is  especially critical as 2020 marks the 6th year of ongoing Russian  occupation of eastern Ukraine.   But the FY21 NDAA still does not go far enough.   I field two amendments that go to the heart of our duties as  Senators, the power to declare war and the power of the purse. Congress  must stop abdicating its constitutional responsibilities.   Article I of the Constitution gives Congress the sole authority to  declare war. I voted for the war in Afghanistan, but I never imagined  that we would still be there nearly two decades later or that the same  authorization would be used to justify actions around the world that  this body had not contemplated at the time. My amendment would sunset  all authorizations for the use of force after 10 years so that Congress  can take up the issue and engage in its constitutional duties.  [[Page S4212]]    I also cosponsored an amendment led by Senator Udall making clear  that Congress has not given the executive branch any authority to go to  war against Iran.   We also cannot continue to let this President raid national defense  funds for his ridiculous and racist border wall effort--remember, the  one that the President promised Mexico would pay for. Every dollar  diverted has been at the expense of our men and women in uniform,  especially hurting our National Guard. This bill does nothing to  address that. Even when the Ninth Circuit court ruled last Friday that  the money grab was illegal, the Department of Defense informed us on  Monday that it would not stop construction of the President's campaign  promise. That is why I filed an amendment that would keep the President  from transferring defense funds outside of DOD for the wall. We need a  robust debate on the proper, effective way to respond to the  humanitarian crisis at our border, one approved by Congress.   In addition, I filed an amendment that would disapprove of Russia  participating in the G7 or being readmitted into a reconstituted G8.  Not only does Russia maintain its occupation of Ukraine, but it has  continued its interference in the U.S. and other democratic nations.  And just last week, The New York Times reported that Russian  intelligence secretly offered bounties to Taliban-linked militants to  kill American troops in Afghanistan. Apparently, the White House has  known about this for months and did nothing. It is unacceptable. My  amendment makes it clear that the U.S. should not support Russia's  participation in this international summit.   The FY21 NDAA also doesn't go far enough to address the toxic class  of chemicals known as PFAS, which have been linked to serious and  devastating illness.   That is why I am pleased to cosponsor Senator Shaheen's amendments to  designate PFAS as hazardous substances and boost DOD cleanup efforts,  provide blood testing for servicemembers and their families, and  increase funds to study the impact of PFAS on health. In addition, I  support Senator Gillibrand's amendment that would extend  antidiscrimination protections to our transgender servicemembers who  bravely make sacrifices for our country. I also am a cosponsor of  Senator Schatz amendment to limit the transfer of equipment under to  the DOD 1033 program to militarize police forces across the country and  provide transparency to the program.   I hope that we may be able to debate all of these important issues  during consideration of this bill, all of which will only help improve  this legislation and provide for our national defense. In the meantime,  I reiterate my thanks to Chairman Inhofe and Ranking Member Reed for  their work on this bill.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.
