 Mr. President, I rise today in honor of a dear  friend Jim Deremeik who dedicated his career to supporting low-vision  rehabilitation care and education.   Jim and I first met at the New York Lighthouse Guild. I was finishing  my optometry studies and doing an externship with the lighthouse  program, and Jim was working at the Arkansas School for the Blind. Our  work at the New York Lighthouse Guild involved learning how to better  enable people who are blind, but still had partial vision, to use this  remaining vision through magnifiers and other devices so they could  better navigate a sighted world. Through Jim's persistence, I began  volunteering in Little Rock at the Arkansas School for the Blind and  developing a low-vision program. Working together and with the great  team at the school, we were able to make a big difference in the lives  of many students. Our working relationship turned into a deep  friendship.   My old football coach at the University of Arkansas Frank Broyles  always used to say there are two kinds of people: givers and takers. I  soon learned that Jim was the definition of a giver. Over the years,  Jim has received many awards and accolades, but the thing he will be  most remembered for is his servant leadership towards his students and  clients, along with the example that he has set for his friends and  coworkers.   I know Jim is retiring, but I can't imagine him not being involved in  some way through various organizations and entities to continue helping  others. My only regret is that life has taken us down separate paths,  and we have not gotten to spend nearly as much time with each other as  I would like. I wish Jim and Peggy, his wonderful wife, the best. The  blind community is much better off as a result of the dedication and  care of Jim Deremeik.                            ____________________
