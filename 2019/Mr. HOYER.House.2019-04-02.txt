 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I  would hope that we could do what the gentleman from Oregon wants to do  and work together in a bipartisan fashion.   I will say to him, however, that his party was in control from 2011  to last year, and there was almost no effort to accomplish that  objective. There were, however, over 65 votes to repeal, and there was  no replace. When his party won the Presidency as well, there was no  replace. We passed something through this House that couldn't get  through the Senate. The Senate was controlled by the gentleman's party.   This is something that is not optional for any of our citizens.  Healthcare is essential, and they expect us to sit down and work  together.   Unfortunately, today, we saw in a tweet--the President who campaigned  on the basis of everybody was going to be covered at less cost and  higher quality. We are now, I suppose, in about the 29th month in the  President's term. He has sent us no bill--and this morning, he has the  gall, in my opinion, to tell the American people: I have got a plan. It  is secret, and I will show it to you in 2021.   What is interesting about 2021? It is after the election.   Elections ought to be about policy. The election of 2018 was about  policy, healthcare, and, very frankly, our argument prevailed. Our  argument was that we wanted to protect the Affordable Care Act; that we  wanted to make sure that the protections included in the Affordable  Care Act were available to all Americans.                                time  1415    Madam Speaker, I want to thank Representative Allred for introducing  this resolution, and I rise in support of it.   Since taking office, President Trump and his administration have been  focused on doing everything it can to take affordable healthcare  coverage options away from American families.   Madam Speaker, you can make healthcare a lot cheaper. Offer them no  coverage--it is very simple--not hospitalization, not doctors'  reimbursement, not this, not that, and not the other. We call them junk  policies. They pretend to be health coverage when they are not.   The President did make two failed efforts along with his party to  repeal the Affordable Care Act in Congress. They came after Republicans  tried to repeal or undermine the bill in more than 65 votes during  their years in the majority. The American people do not want to get rid  of the Affordable Care Act, because if they did, then they wouldn't  have us in the majority because they know we want to keep it. They want  Congress, however, to work to improve and make our healthcare system  work better for all Americans, and, yes, have it affordable and  accessible.   Instead, President Trump and Republicans have doubled down and  tripled down on their agenda of sabotaging the law through executive  actions on an almost weekly and monthly basis and through lawsuits like  the one now pending in Texas.   I am not sure who convinced the President to change his mind, but I  have a suspicion Mick Mulvaney did. Mick Mulvaney, of course, voted 65  times--well, I don't know that he was here every one of those votes,  but every time he had an opportunity, he voted to repeal the Affordable  Care Act. If the Americans wanted to repeal the Affordable Care Act,  then they would have voted against us.   Madam Speaker, I would tell my friend from Oregon that if it is  partisan, it is partisan because none of you will support it, and so  many of you campaigned on the basis of wanting to protect preexisting  conditions. Obviously, the President changed his mind about doing that.   All this resolution does is express the sense of this House that such  efforts are wrong and would harm tens of millions of Americans who  benefit from the ACA. This includes the 133 million or more Americans  living with preexisting conditions like asthma, diabetes, cancer, et  cetera, et cetera, et cetera, who are protected in their ability to get  healthcare insurance.   The actions taken by President Trump, however, and the Republicans  would make these individuals uninsurable, forcing them and their  families into financial hardship in order to pay for medical bills. It  also includes older Americans for whom Republicans have proposed an age  tax.   It would do harm to the 20 million Americans who are now covered  because of the Affordable Care Act who would lose their coverage as a  result of what President Trump and Republicans in Congress are seeking  to do. That is what the lawsuit does. This says that we don't agree  with the lawsuit--a pretty simple proposition.   By joining the Texas lawsuit, the Trump administration is seeking to  allow women to be charged higher premiums than men as they used to be.  It seeks to allow lifetime and annual limits on coverage, which the  Affordable Care Act banned. In addition, it is trying to force  Americans under age 26 to get coverage on their own, even if they don't  have a job yet and are still in college.   Preventive health visits and screenings would, once more, require  out-of-pocket co-pays. Plans would no longer be required to cover  essential health benefits. Now, if you don't have to cover required  health benefits, then you are going to get a cheaper policy, not a lot  of coverage, but a cheaper policy. The objective is not just a cheaper  policy, it is a policy that covers your risks. If we can make it  cheaper, then we ought to do that. Plans would no longer be required to  cover, as I said, essential benefits such as maternity care and  prescription drugs.   This resolution is an opportunity to state on the Record whether  Members support doing away with these reforms or not. Now, that doesn't  mean you think that an alternative is perfect, it simply means that we  either want to improve or replace it with something that is viable,  passable, and good for the American people, whether to turn back the  clock or look ahead, and whether to stand with the Trump administration  as it seeks to dismantle every single piece of the Affordable Care Act,  which it has done.   The gentleman mentions maybe a daily resolution, well, unfortunately,  we have daily action by the President that does things that we don't  think are appropriate. We voted on one of those the other day where we  appropriated money to a certain object, and the President wants to  change it on his own. We think that was unconstitutional. We didn't get  a lot of help on the Republican side, the gentleman did, I agree with  that, the gentleman who has spoken before me.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to  join me and others in supporting Representative Allred's resolution in  expressing bipartisan opposition to the  [[Page H2960]]  Trump administration's efforts--not to Trump, but to the policies. We  ought to be talking about policies, not personalities. It is not about  personalities. It is about policies and do we believe that we ought to  repeal the Affordable Care Act without a replacement?   I think the answer to that ought to be an emphatic ``no'' for all of  us. The gentleman is correct. We ought to work on a bipartisan basis to  accomplish good objectives for our people. This vote will show every  single American where his or her Representative stands on the question  which is so consequential to the everyday lives of millions and  millions of Americans.   The President clearly has no intention--he said in his tweet today-- of sending a bill down here until 2021, 2 years and more from now. How  sad to be the leader of our country and say: I am not going to tell you  what I am going to do, just trust me.    Well, Mr. President, we don't have any reason based upon your  performance to trust you to make sure that Americans have what you said  you were going to give them, that everybody was going to be covered at  lower cost or higher quality.   Vote for this resolution and tell the American people that when you  said on the campaign trail: I am for preexisting conditions, you meant  it; and when you said that there were other protections that you wanted  to keep in the bill, you meant it.   If you do, then you will vote for this resolution and send a  message--democracy is a lot about messages--by talking to one another.  This is the way the Congress can talk to the administration--one way.  We can talk a lot of ways.   Have that communication be clear: Mr. President, leave the Affordable  Care Act alone and work with us to make it better and work for all  Americans, which is what you said you would do during the course of the  campaign.
