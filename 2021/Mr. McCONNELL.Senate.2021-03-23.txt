 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, while House Democrats try to overturn a  certified election result from last November, some Senate Democrats are  agitating to break Senate rules to ram through a partisan rewrite of  all 50 States' election laws--all 50 States' election laws.   The 60-vote threshold is the reason huge pillars of domestic policy  don't oscillate back and forth every time a different party wins the  majority. So let's think of something like the Mexico City policy, the  executive branch policy about funding overseas abortions. It has  flipped back and forth every single time the White House has changed  parties since the 1980s. Republican Presidents issue the memo; the  Democratic Presidents retract it.   The legislative filibuster is what keeps the entirety of Federal law  from working that way. For a long time, Senators on both sides have  recognized the Senate and the country are better off with some actual  stability. Both sides have understood there are no permanent majorities  in American politics, so a system that gives both sides a voice  benefits, actually, everyone in the long term.   That is what 33 of our Democratic colleagues said just a few years  ago, when they all signed a joint letter insisting that rules  protecting debate on legislation be preserved.   That is what President Biden believed consistently throughout his  long Senate tenure. About 15 years ago, then-Senator Biden said killing  the filibuster would be, ``an example of the arrogance of power.'' That  was President Biden. He restated his long-held position during the  campaign just last year.   Here is what my colleague the Democratic leader said in 2017. Senator  Schumer said:         The legislative filibuster . . . is the most important       distinction between the Senate and the House. . . . [L]et's       find a way to further protect the 60-vote rule for       legislation.    That was the Democratic leader in 2017.   And Democrats didn't just spend the last 4 years supporting the  filibuster; they spent 4 years using it. Senate Democrats used the  filibuster to kill Senator Tim Scott's police reform bill in the wake  of the deaths of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor.   We could have had Federal legislation on the books since last summer,  putting more body cameras on police officers, requiring fuller incident  reporting to the FBI, and finally making lynching a Federal crime,  among other things. Democrats stopped it. They stopped it using the  filibuster.   A few months before, they used the filibuster to briefly turn the  bipartisan sprint toward the CARES Act into a partisan standoff. The  press marveled that Senate Democrats had the gall to block relief--a  tactic that helped tank the markets--in order to demand further  changes.   Back in early 2018, Senate Democrats used the filibuster to block  government funding and force a brief governmen shutdown over, of all  things, immigration. One of the Democratic leader's first major acts as  the leader of his conference was to wield the filibuster to shut down  the entire Federal Government.    So, look, the Democratic side just spent 4 years defending and, of  course, happily using the same Senate rule that many of our colleagues  now attack. So this reversal is not about principle. It has nothing  whatsoever to do with principle. It is just raw power--raw power.  [[Page S1683]]    Three years ago, the assistant Democratic leader was asked about the  Senate majority going ``nuclear'' and killing the legislative  filibuster. Here's what Senator Durbin had to say:         I can tell you that would be the end of the Senate as it       was originally devised and created going back to our Founding       Fathers.    That was Senator Durbin in 2018, just a few years ago. Now he argues  the opposite.   Now I understand our colleague has rotated through several different  explanations for his reversal in just the last few days.   First, our colleague from Illinois indicated he changed his mind-- changed his mind--because Republicans, and I specifically, had used the  filibuster so much in the intervening years. But, Mr. President,  Republicans were in the majority the whole time. We were in the  majority the whole time. It was the Democrats who used the filibuster  in the minority in 2018, 2019, and 2020--not Republicans. That argument  makes no sense whatsoever.   A few days later, there was a new made-up rationale: It is just that  the Senate hasn't been getting anything done, so the institution needs  an overhaul. Except we have just had a uniquely terrible year to make  that argument.   Last year was not a good year to make that argument. We passed five-- five--bipartisan COVID bills with big bipartisan majorities that spent  the most money in American history and helped save the country. Don't  see any obstruction in that. We passed a historic bipartisan bill for  national parks and public lands. Didn't see any outrageous use of the  filibuster on that.   So there is fake history swirling all around the discussion--fake  history.   About a year ago, former President Obama launched a new, coordinated,  and very obvious campaign to get liberals repeating the claim that the  Senate rules are somehow a relic of racism and bigotry. That came just  a month after Democrats had used the filibuster to kill Senator Tim  Scott's police reform and anti-lynching bill.   So these talking points are an effort to use the terrible history of  racism to justify a partisan power grab in the present. It is not  unlike what we saw last summer, when some protest mobs ended up  defacing statues of people who actually crusaded for justice--like  Abraham Lincoln, Ulysses S. Grant, and the abolitionist Matthias  Baldwin--mistakenly damaging good institutions because of our troubled  past.   Multiple fact checkers have torn into this simplistic notion that the  rules of the Senate are rooted in racism: ``Historians told PolitiFact  that the filibuster did not emerge from debates over slavery or  segregation.'' One scholar's account was that ``the very first Senate  filibuster was over a bridge across the Potomac River.''   The very first filibuster was over a bridge over the Potomac River.   The junior Senator from Massachusetts just got three Pinocchios from  the Washington Post for these arguments.   Their look--the Washington Post's look--at history found ``the first  recorded filibusters in the Senate concerned issues such as where to  locate Congress, what to do about Andrew Jackson's censure over  withdrawn federal deposits, who would be appointed to a publication  called the Congressional Globe and whether to create a national  bank''--nothing to do with racism.   But I am curious. If my Democratic colleagues really believe what  they are saying, did they themselves use a racist tool against Senator  Scott's police reform bill just last year?   Did they use a racist relic when they delayed the CARES Act or  blocked legislation to protect unborn babies who can feel pain?   Were Senators Schumer and Durbin and their 33 colleagues who signed  that letter all endorsing a racist relic?   Or is our colleagues' story that the filibuster was not an offensive  relic as recently as last summer but magically--imagine this--just  magically, within a year, magically became an offensive relic the  instant the Democrats came to power? All of a sudden, it is an  offensive, racist relic when the Democrats came to power. Jaw-dropping  hypocrisy. These backflips insult the intelligence of the American  people.    The far left is desperate to change the subject to the 1960s because  they want people to forget how Senate Democrats behaved just last year.  This is not about the 1960s. It is not a racist relic.   Look, if some of my Democratic colleagues want to keep lobbying two  of their colleagues to go back on their word, they should at least have  the courage to be honest.   The far left wants Democrats to break the Senate rules for no other  reason--no other reason--than they want more power. They want more  power. The same people who are trying to overturn a certified election  result over at the House want to break Senate rules so they can  override the election laws of all 50 States from right here in  Washington. It is that simple. And it is not going to be hidden by a  coordinated campaign to change the subject.                            ____________________     I suggest the absence of a quorum.
