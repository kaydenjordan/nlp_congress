 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, pre-born babies feel pain. The medical field has found  clear evidence that pre-born babies have the capacity to feel intense  pain at 20 weeks.                                time  2015    That is what this legislation is about. When a child's body is  gruesomely dismembered, they feel pain. When the abortion doctor  attempts to use a ``less crunchy technique''--as we learned in last  year's abhorrent videos about Planned Parenthood, which was their  words--to procure more intact body parts, they feel pain.   Mr. Speaker, I shudder to think of the millions of lives taken from  this world in such a gruesome and violent manner. Equally disturbing is  the thought of how much pain has been endured by millions of pre-born  babies whose lives have been cut short since Roe v. Wade.   We must do more to promote a culture of life in this country. We must  do more to lessen a culture of violence. That is why I rise today in  strong support of the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act. By  acknowledging that babies feel the pain of abortion at 20 weeks, this  legislation affirms the inherent humanity of the most innocent--unborn  babies--in our country.   To add to that, this legislation also includes protections for babies  that survive an attempted abortion. It ensures that children who do  survive and are able to continue to live outside the womb are given the  immediate medical attention they deserve so that they have a chance to  live.   With growing developments in the medical field, children are able to  survive outside the womb at earlier points in pregnancy. Such was the  case for Micah Pickering, for whom this legislation is name for. Micah  was born at 20 weeks' gestation and is now a healthy 5-year-old.   The Congressional Budget Office recently reported that approximately  2,750 lives per year will be saved through this bill. That is 2,750  girls and boys; daughters and sons; brothers and sisters; and not  medical waste, like opponents of this legislation would like you to  believe.   The United States is only one of seven countries, including North  Korea and China, that allow abortion after 20 weeks.   Are we really that kind of Nation? Does our Constitution not grant  all Americans the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness,  no matter how small or seemingly insignificant they are?   Mr. Speaker, this is commonsense legislation. I urge every single  Member of this body to take a deep look inside themselves and ask if  they support not only inflicting pain on unborn babies, but also  denying these innocent babies their constitutional right to life.   I thank my colleague, the gentleman from Arizona, for his leadership  on this important issue.   If you want to stand for a culture of life, vote for this bill. If  you want to take a stand against a culture of violence, vote for this  bill.   I urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation.
