 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight the troubling  record of President Biden's U.S. Supreme Court nominee, Ketanji Brown  Jackson, commonly known as KBJ.   Throughout her legal career, Ketanji Brown Jackson has earned a  disturbing record on crime. In advocating for and administering lighter  sentences for sex offenders, particularly those preying on and sexually  abusing innocent children, KBJ has set an unforgivable pattern that  disqualifies her from our country's highest Court.   A prime example of this pattern can be found in the case of U.S. v.  Hawkins, where the sentencing guidelines called for up to 10 years in  prison for a man, an adult convicted of possessing multiple images of  child sex torture. Ketanji Brown Jackson sentenced this predator to  just 3 months in jail. Unconscionable.   Mr. Hawkins recently told The Washington Post, ``I wasn't very happy  that she gave me 3 months, although after reflection when I was in  jail, I was hearing from other people who said it was their first time  arrested and they got 5 years, 6 years.'' And he got 3 months.   As crime rates soar in our cities across the country, adding soft-on- crime Justices, especially a Justice who basically ignores the crime of  possessing and promoting images of severe child sexual assault, adding  a Justice like that to the bench sends an alarming message to  communities fearing for their safety.   Additionally, during her confirmation hearing last week, KBJ refused  to define what a woman is, excusing her absurdity by claiming she isn't  a biologist.   From women's sports to woke corporations like Disney, liberals are  pushing an evil agenda that is erasing women and undermining women's  accomplishments. As conservatives like myself fight this woke  extremism, there will surely be cases considered in the future at the  Supreme Court that require Justices to understand and accept the  differences between men and women.   If KBJ can't define a woman, how is she to adjudicate Title IX cases?  This is a legitimate question that no Democrat wants to answer. This,  too, is disqualifying.   While I do not serve in the body that decides this monumental  confirmation, I do have a responsibility to tell the American people  the truth. And the truth is, a vote to confirm Ketanji Brown Jackson is  a vote for lenient sentences for child sexual torture, a vote for the  left's woke war on canceling the achievements of real women, and a vote  for the liberals' dangerous agenda.   Americans, including Georgians, don't want a Justice on the bench who  supports any of this radical garbage. Georgians are watching Senators  Warnock and Ossoff. Will they vote for a Supreme Court nominee that is  soft on crime, on one of the most heinous crimes of all, child sex  torture, or  [[Page H4014]]  will they stand up for all of Georgia's family values, protect our  children, and be tough on crime by voting ``no'' on this Supreme Court  nominee?   For the sake of our great Nation, the Senate must save the Supreme  Court from a lifetime of votes siding with demented pedophiles by  voting ``no'' on Ketanji Brown Jackson's confirmation.                             No Vaccine Mandates     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to join me  in ensuring the Federal Government never again abuses its power by  ordering employees to receive a vaccine or lose their job.   The COVID-19 pandemic has proven powerful elites will stop at nothing  to quench their thirst for power, including President Biden, who issued  through OSHA a rule that forced businesses with 100 or more employees  to require the COVID-19 vaccine.   Forcing workers out of a job if they refuse to take a jab is a wholly  unconstitutional power grab that violates Americans' freedoms,  exacerbates labor shortages, and intensifies the supply chain crisis.   Congress occasionally gives our government agencies certain broad  authorities, and when those powers are abused, it is our responsibility  to claw them back and safeguard the rights of American citizens.   While the U.S. Supreme Court blocked President Biden's OSHA rule,  Congress has the authority and the responsibility to prevent any future  attempts by the executive branch to subject the American people to  unlawful mandates. This is why I proudly introduced H.R. 7281, the  Reversing Every Vaccine Emergency Requirement and Stopping Employee  OSHA Mandates Act.   My bill, whose short title, is REVERSE OSHA Mandates Act, amends the  Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 to repeal the Secretary's  authority to issue emergency temporary standards and is a commonsense  and crucial step toward preventing future government overreach by OSHA  and defeating their hand in medical tyranny.   It is incumbent upon Congress to prohibit this dangerous abuse of  power from further tarnishing our Nation's history and subverting  American workers' rights, which is why I urge all of my colleagues on  both sides of the aisle to support this legislation that reins in OSHA  and protects the freedoms of American workers.                            ____________________
