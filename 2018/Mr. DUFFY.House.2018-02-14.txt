 Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman for all of his work  and support on this legislation, as well as the gentleman from Arkansas  (Mr. Hill), for which my provision is made part of a larger package.   I also thank the gentlemen from Georgia and Illinois, my good friends  across the aisle, David Scott and Bill Foster, both of whom are  cosponsors of the Protection of Source Code Act. It is a bipartisan  bill.   The recent cyber incidents at Equifax, SEC, and even at the NSA, has  shown that all organizations are vulnerable to security risks. These  incidents are a timely reminder of the risks that we face in this  digital age.   Given this reality, it is important for government agencies such as  the SEC to rethink what they collect, how they collect it, how it is  stored, and what they do with this information in the long run.   The Protection of Source Code Act is a bipartisan bill intended to  reduce some of the cybersecurity risks to our financial markets posed  by the SEC when it gathers highly sensitive trading or source code  information as part of their oversight duties.   The Protection of Source Code Act establishes a process for the SEC  with respect to requesting source code and other intellectual property  that forms the basis of source code.   It does not preclude the SEC from requesting data that it determines  it needs for market oversight. It merely puts a process in place for  how the SEC seeks access to certain intellectual property.   Having a process in place for how the SEC requests source code and  similar intellectual property will better protect registrants and their  clients and investors from inadvertent disclosure or cyber theft of  their most valuable and important intellectual property.  [[Page H1159]]    Such disclosure or theft could destroy the American businesses that  own the intellectual property. Worse, it could undermine investor  confidence and create significant volatility in our financial markets.   In general, the SEC should not be requesting source code or  intellectual property that forms the basis of source code. They  shouldn't be collecting that on a regular basis. Such information is  generally unnecessary for the SEC to perform its market oversight  function and, as we have learned from recent cyber hacks, could create  a very inviting treasure trove of sensitive data for computer hackers.   This bill ensures that the SEC will gather source code when it is  truly needed, under a subpoena process that provides appropriate due  process for the information.   Under this bill, the SEC, in conducting an exam, may continue to ask  a registrant for general information about a registrant's trading  system or trading strategies.   So let's break this down a little bit. We have source code that is  highly sensitive. It is intellectual property. If you are the SEC, you  can actually go onsite and look at the source code. I am fine with  that.   But if you are going to collect the source code and take it back to  the SEC and store it and you have a whole bunch of intellectual  property from American businesses stored at the SEC, this is one-stop  shopping for hackers. You have just got to do it once. Get in the SEC  and you get it all.   My friend across the aisle, the ranking member, wants to talk about  volatility. Wait and see if there is an SEC hack where they get all  this information, all this source code. That is a risk we don't want to  have.   We want due process. If you want to come in and take the source code,  get a subpoena.   Do we believe in due process in America?   For the most sensitive data, the most sensitive information, get a  subpoena and you can take it. But those are basic measurers, basic  protections that we offer in America that we should employ at the SEC  when they want this intellectual property that is of great value to  these firms.   My bill, contrary to the ranking member's point, Madam Speaker,  doesn't offer exemptions to exams. Exams will still happen. Also, it is  still illegal to manipulate markets. Those things haven't changed.   This is just about due process.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.    It is important that we have truthful and honest  information on the floor. This does not prohibit exams. This doesn't  make legal manipulation of the markets. It is still illegal. All we are  saying is we have sensitive source code, and if you want to take it to  the SEC, you get a subpoena.   Frankly, we think there are problems with that. The SEC has been  hacked. The NSA has been hacked. Everybody has been hacked. If you  compile all this information, the risk that poses to our markets and  volatility to our markets, I think, is unacceptable. That is why it is  bipartisan.   I would encourage all Members of this House to take a step forward  for due process.   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, given the extreme volatility in the stock markets over  the past few weeks, I am particularly troubled by title II of this  bill, which would make it easier for high-frequency traders to evade  regulatory oversight of their potentially disruptive automated trading  algorithms.   This provision is widely opposed by nonpartisan consumer and investor  advocacy groups who recognize the impact automated trading has on our  markets.   Let me read for you excerpts from a few letters from these groups  that highlight the dangers of title 2.   Americans for Financial Reform--a coalition of more than 200  consumer, civil rights, investor, retiree community, labor, faith- based, and business groups--wrote: ``Title II would prevent regulators  from inspecting not only their raw source code used in automated  trading, but also any related intellectual property that `forms the  basis for the design of' source code. Examination of such intellectual  property would only be possible in an enforcement context pursuant to a  subpoena. This implies that the SEC would have to wait until the damage  was done through a `flash crash' or similar market disruption before  taking any action, which would have to be retrospective.   ``In light of the significance of automated trading to modern  markets, and the potential risk of high-frequency trading, it makes no  sense to tie the hands of regulators in examining detailed trading  strategies and methods of high frequency traders.''   The Center for American Progress cautioned that: ``But in an era of  fast-moving, `flash-crash'-prone markets, the SEC may have a wide range  of regulatory reasons for why it may need to examine source codes,  including approvals of new trading products or the supervision of  trading venues. The SEC should only exercise that authority carefully  and under the strictest protections for confidential information, but  blocking it by law dangerously limits the SEC's ability to address the  significant technology-based challenges to financial markets.''   The Consumer Federation of America, an association of nearly 300  consumer advocacy groups, similarly opposed title 2 because it ``would  weaken SEC oversight of algorithmic trading and hamstring the agency  from responding quickly to flash crashes or other market breakdowns.''   Further, the CFA wrote that: ``At a time when algorithmic trading is  taking on increased importance in our capital markets, this bill would  make it more difficult for the SEC to properly oversee such trading.                                time  1545    ``The bill would require the SEC to first issue a subpoena before it  could compel a person to produce or furnish to the SEC algorithmic  trading source code or `similar intellectual property.' This would  undermine the SEC's examination authority by creating a gaping hole in  its ability to gain access to firm records relevant to the examination.  It would also have a devastating effect on the agency's ability to  respond quickly in the event of another `flash crash' or such events in  the future. In order to oversee the markets effectively, the SEC needs  to be able to accurately and efficiently reconstruct order entry and  trading activity, including for algorithmic traders.''   Public Citizen, a consumer rights advocacy group with over 400,000  members and supporters, wrote: ``Market volatility caused not by real  events such as outbreak of a war, but by computers, including computer  glitches, threatens to erase savings to some innocent investors and  erodes general investor confidence. The recent swings in the markets  attest to the need for robust and urgent supervisory inspection. The  May 6, 2010 `Flash Crash,' where markets collapsed by more than $1  trillion in less than an hour, revealed that such a robust and urgent  supervision has been lacking. The SEC required nearly a half year to  investigate this incident before identifying a flawed algorithmic at  one major trader. SEC oversight should be streamlined, not hampered.  Trading instructions and records of human traders are already subject  to inspection, so it should be no different for those instructions and  records generated by a machine. Hiding source code from regulatory  scrutiny will leave those responsible for mistakes as well as those  attempting to manipulate markets unaccountable.''   These letters demonstrate the wide opposition to title II by groups  that truly understand that robust oversight of algorithmic trading is  necessary for the help of our makers.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record letters from these groups.                                                  February 13, 2018.      Please vote NO on H.R. 3299 and H.R. 3978.       Hon. Member,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Hon. Member: On behalf of more than 400,000 members       and supporters of Public Citizen, we ask you to vote NO on       H.R. 3299 and H.R. 3978, which are expected to be considered       by the full House on Wednesday, February 14, 2018. Provisions       in these bills would expose borrowers to abusive loans,       investors to dubious securities, and Americans generally to a       riskier financial system.  [[Page H1160]]         H.R. 3299, the Protecting Consumers' Access to Credit Act       of 2017, would allow predatory lenders to escape state limits       on high interest rates. The bill would nullify the Second       Circuit Court ruling in Madden v. Midland Funding. That       decision provided that a financial institution that buys       loans originated by a national bank could not benefit from       the National Bank Act's preemption of state interest rate       caps. While the Madden decision did not limit interest rates       that banks charge on credit, it does limit nonbanks from       evading state interest rate caps. This bill would pave the       way for payday lenders, financial technology (fintech)       companies and others to exploit that loophole and use a       ``rent-a-bank'' arrangement in order to charge high interest       rates. Twenty state Attorneys General have written to oppose       this measure, noting that it undermines their efforts to       protect borrowers from abusive loan rates. We urge you to       oppose this bill.        H.R. 3978, the TRID Improvement Act of 2017, is actually a       package of bills that were considered separately in the House       Financial Services Committee. One of these is the Financial       Stability Oversight Council Improvement Act (formerly H.R.       4061). This measure would add numerous procedural       requirements for the Financial Stability Oversight Council       (FSOC) when it considers the designation or continued       designation of a nonbank firm as a systemically important       financial institution (SIFI). Current rules already make SIFI       designation a high hurdle. The case of MetLife, for example,       shows that firms enjoy more than ample methods to contest       designation. After FSOC designated MetLife as systemically       important, it contested it in court and the case is pending.       Increasing the government's burden for designation would       restrict its ability to apply enhanced supervision to major       institutions. However, the largest bailout of the 2008       financial crash went to AIG, a nonbank engaged in reckless       derivatives activity beyond the purview of banking       supervisors. We oppose this measure.        Another bill contained in H.R. 3978 is the Fostering       Innovation Act (previously H.R. 1645). This bill amends       Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) law by increasing       from five to 10 years the time that CEOs of firms with less       than $50 million in revenue must attest to the accuracy of       their financial reporting. Congress approved SOX in response       to the accounting scandals at the turn of the millennium. The       rules are designed to promote accounting accuracy to the       shareholders who have entrusted their savings to these firms.       A Government Accountability Office (GAO) report found that       companies with inferior financial reporting controls have a       significantly higher likelihood of issuing a restatement of       their financial accounts. Firms that are unwilling to oblige       SOX should not be trusted with the capital of savers.       Extending the CEO attestation requirement from five to 10       years exacerbates the problem. From an investor perspective,       accounting safeguards are more important for smaller       companies, since larger companies generally attract a larger       and more sophisticated base of stock and bond holders who can       perform effective oversight. We oppose this measure.        A third bill that is part of the H.R. 3978 package is the       National Securities Exchange Regulatory Parity Act (formerly       H.R. 4546). This bill would eliminate state supervision of       securities if they are listed on an exchange, even if the       exchange has reduced standards compared with those of major       exchanges such as the New York Stock Exchange. Under current       law, state supervision is pre-empted only if the security is       listed on exchanges with rules overseen by the Securities and       Exchange Commission (SEC). Rules may differ between       exchanges, but they must be approved by the SEC to ensure       that they prevent fraud, serve the public interest and       protect investors. Moreover, exchanges must adopt and enforce       rules that are ``substantially similar'' to the major       exchanges, known formally as ``Named Markets,'' under current       law. The existing system deters a race to the bottom, where       an exchange may attempt to attract companies with weaker       rules. Conversely, this bill would actually promote that race       to the bottom by removing the requirement that the exchange       adopt rules that are substantially similar to those of the       Named Markets. We oppose this measure.        A fourth measure in H.R. 3978 is the Protection of Source       Code Act, (formerly H.R. 3948). This measure would impede the       ability of the SEC to conduct effective compliance       examinations of market volatility involving computer-driven       algorithms. The bill imposes a strict subpoena requirement       before staff could inspect otherwise routine business records       that involve source code. Market volatility caused not by       real events such as the outbreak of a war, but by computers,       including computer glitches, threatens to erase savings to       some innocent investors and erodes general investor       confidence. The recent swings in the markets attest to the       need for robust and urgent supervisory inspection. The May 6,       2010 ``Flash Crash,'' where markets collapsed by more than $1       trillion in less than an hour, revealed that such robust and       urgent supervision has been lacking. The SEC required nearly       a half year to investigate this incident before identifying a       flawed algorithm at one major trader. SEC oversight should be       streamlined, not hampered. Trading instructions and records       of human traders are already subject to inspection, so it       should be no different for those instructions and records       generated by a machine. Hiding source code from regulatory       scrutiny will leave those responsible for mistakes as well as       those attempting to manipulate markets unaccountable. We       oppose this measure.        Because of our opposition to these elements in H.R. 3978       and to H.R. 3299 we urge you to vote NO on these bills. As we       are marking the 10th anniversary of the Wall Street Crash,       it's clear that American consumers and investors deserve       stronger financial reforms, not weakened protections that       will make our economy more susceptible to another collapse.        Thank you for your consideration. For questions, please       contact Bartlett Naylor.            Sincerely,      Public Citizen.                                   ____                                                       Americans for                                                Financial Reform,                                  Washington, DC, February 13, 2018.        Dear Representative: On behalf of Americans for Financial       Reform, we are writing to urge you to vote in opposition to       H.R. 3978, which is being considered on the House floor       today. This legislation is a grab bag of bad legislative       ideas that should never have advanced through the House       Financial Services Committee. Especially notable given the       recent wild swings in stock prices, Title II of this bill       would sharply limit the ability of the Securities and       Exchange Commission (SEC) to investigate high-frequency       automated trading strategies that can disrupt markets. But       that is hardly the only harmful bill in this package. There       are several other provisions that would weaken consumer and       investor protections.        Title I, ``TRID Improvement,'' would amend the TILA/RESPA       Integrated Disclosure Rule (also known as TRID) to change how       title insurance fees are disclosed, in a manner that would       increase confusion and potentially misinform consumers as to       the final cost of these important fees. The title insurance       market already lacks transparency and fairness; fees are       grossly inflated in relation to the value of the insurance.       The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) carefully       studied this issue in its rulemaking to determine the       clearest and most accurate way to disclose fees in light of       varying state laws on title insurance and differences in       practices by different companies. The changes in the       statutory language here would limit the CFPB's authority to       create a consistent method of disclosure across different       companies and different states, and to reflect ways in which       title insurance costs can change at closing. Further       refinement in title insurance disclosures can be addressed       through rulemaking by the CFPB itself in consultation with       stakeholders.        Title II, ``Protection of Source Code,'' would severely       restrict the ability of the SEC to examine the detailed       trading strategies of high-frequency traders or automated       traders, even in cases where such traders posed a risk to       markets or the financial system. Title II would prevent       regulators from inspecting not only the raw source code used       in automated trading, but also any related intellectual       property that ``forms the basis for the design of'' source       code. Examination of such intellectual property would only be       possible in an enforcement context pursuant to a subpoena.       This implies that the SEC would have to wait until the damage       was done through a ``flash crash'' or similar market       disruption before taking any action, which would have to be       retrospective.        In light of the significance of automated trading to modern       markets, and the potential risks of high frequency trading,       it makes no sense to tie the hands of regulators in examining       detailed trading strategies and methods of high frequency       traders. At any brokerage, trading instructions to a human       trader, including the conditions under which such a trade       would be carried out (e.g., a limit order) are part of the       books and records routinely open to inspection by FINRA or       the SEC. Trading instructions must not be exempt from       inspection simply because they are automated. They should be       part of the books and records of the organization, just as       other order-related documents are. Intellectual property       related to source code clearly involves trading strategies,       which have always been a subject for regulatory inspection       and oversight.        The continued high volatility on Wall Street is giving       evidence of the potential systemic dangers of high-frequency       automated trading. Now is not the time to tie the SEC's hands       in doing oversight of such trading.        Title III, ``Fostering Innovation,'' would double the time       for which certain new public companies are exempt from key       financial reporting controls, most notably attestation by an       auditor that their earnings and accounting are accurate. It       grants this exemption to a class of companies, newly public       companies with low revenue growth, which have a particular       strong incentive to manipulate their financial statements and       deceive investors. This piece of the legislation would both       harm investors and undermine the integrity of our capital       markets.        Title IV, ``National Securities Exchange Regulatory       Parity,'' would dangerously expand Federal pre-emption from       state securities laws designed to protect investors from       securities fraud. Under current law, a national securities       exchange needs to meet listing standards similar to those of       a major national exchange--e.g., the New York Stock Exchange,       NASDAQ--for its securities to be deemed ``covered       securities.'' Under this  [[Page H1161]]       classification, securities enjoy the advantages of exemptions       from state-level regulations.        Title IV in H.R. 3978 would amend the Securities Act of       1933 to remove the requirement that companies meet listing       standards rigorous enough to be considered similar to those       of major exchanges, effectively allowing riskier, less liquid       securities to qualify as ``covered securities'' and avoid       state securities laws designed to protect investors and       financial markets. Under this section of H.R. 3978, a       security would be exempt from state-level fraud protections       as long as it is traded on a national exchange that is a       member of the National Market System. This would mean that       securities could be pre-empted from the oversight of state       securities regulators without meeting the strong standards       that the SEC has laid out for individual securities to       qualify for preemption under Section 18 of the Securities       Act.        Both the North American Securities Administrators       Association (NASAA), the main body of state securities       regulators, and the chief securities regulator for the       Commonwealth of Massachusetts have made the dangers of this       legislation clear in strongly worded opposition letters. In       these letters, they advocated for fair and rigorous listing       standards as essential to protect retail investors and       savers, to maintain high standards for corporate governance,       and to avoid conflicts of interests that harm investors.       Title IV of H.R. 3978 unacceptably weakens these listing       standards.        The sections of H.R. 3978 discussed above are,       individually, bad bills for consumers and investors rights       and protections. Packaging them together only worsens the       harm. We urge you to reject H.R. 3978.        Thank you for your attention to this matter. For more       information please contact AFR's Policy Director, Marcus       Stanley.            Sincerely,      Americans for Financial Reform.                                   ____                                     Mortgage Bankers Association,                                  Washington, DC, February 13, 2018.      Hon. Paul Ryan, Speaker of the House,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Jeb Hensarling,      Chairman, House Financial Services Committee, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Minority Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Maxine Waters,      Ranking Member, House Financial Services Committee, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Ryan, Leader Pelosi, Chairman Hensarling and       Ranking Member Waters: On behalf of the Mortgage Bankers       Association (MBA), I am writing to express our support for       H.R. 3978, the TRID Improvement Act, which the House of       Representatives will vote on this week. I would highlight       MBA's strong support for the inclusion of two individual       bills--H R. 2948 and the previously free-standing H.R. 3978--      within this updated vehicle.        MBA enthusiastically supports the inclusion of Title V,       Section 501, entitled ``Eliminating barriers to jobs for loan       originators,'' within the newly re-packaged bill. The Secure       and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing (SAFE) Act of       2008 created two parallel but asymmetrical regimes for       mortgage loan originators (MLOs) that have resulted in uneven       consumer protections and an un-level playing field for       mortgage originators. The SAFE Act requires MLOs employed by       non-bank lenders to be licensed, which includes pre-licensing       and annual continuing education requirements, passage of a       comprehensive test, and criminal and financial background       reviews conducted by state regulators. These MLOs are also       registered in the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System and       Registry (NMLS). By contrast, MLOs employed by federally-      insured depositories or their affiliates must only be       registered in the NMLS, and do not have to pass a test or       meet specific education requirements.        The result is a two-tiered system that inhibits job       mobility for loan officers and makes it difficult for non-      bank lenders to compete for talented employees. Rather than       leaving a job on a Friday and starting a new job on a Monday,       an MLO who moves from a bank to a non-bank lender must sit       idle for weeks, and sometimes months, unable to engage in       loan origination activities while they complete the SAFE       Act's licensing and testing requirements -- despite the fact       they have already been registered in the NMLS and originating       loans. This bill promotes a fair and competitive labor market       by eliminating barriers to the ability of non-bank lenders       (especially small lenders) to compete for talented staff, and       allowing MLOs to more easily move to the employer that offers       them the best chance to succeed.        Section 501 of the bill is a bipartisan, narrow solution       that would provide ``transitional authority'' to originate       mortgages for individuals who change corporate affiliation       from a federally-insured institution to a non-bank lender, or       move across state lines, while they work to meet the SAFE       Act's licensing and testing requirements. Transitional       authority would be available only to MLOs that have a clean       history as an originator (e.g., no license denials,       revocations or suspensions, cease and desist orders, or       felonies that preclude licensing).        MBA is especially grateful for the leadership of the bill's       author, Representative Steve Stivers (R-OH), as well as its       bipartisan original cosponsors: Representatives Joyce Beatty       (D-OH), Bruce Poliquin (R-ME), and Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ).       Last Congress, the bill was unanimously reported from the       House Financial Services Committee, and shortly thereafter       passed the full House of Representatives under suspension of       the rules. Again, late last year, the bill was reported from       committee by a unanimous vote of 60-0.        MBA also supports Title I, Section 101, entitled ``TRID       Improvement'', of the newly re-packaged bill, as originally       introduced as a free-standing vehicle by Representatives       French Hill (R-AR) and Ruben Kihuen (D-NV). This section       would amend the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA)       to require the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to       allow the accurate disclosure of title insurance premiums and       any potential available discounts to homebuyers. Under       current regulations, the CFPB does not permit title insurance       companies to disclose available discounts for lender's title       insurance on the government-mandated disclosure forms. This       creates inconsistencies in mortgage documents and causes       confusion for consumers. This section would minimize that       confusion by allowing title insurance companies to disclose       available discounts and accurate title insurance premiums to       consumers across the country.        MBA urges all members of the House to support the newly       reframed H.R. 3978. Thank you for your consideration of our       views on this bill, which will help promote a more       competitive real estate finance market and thereby enhance       overall economic development and growth.            Sincerely,                                                   Bill Killmer,                                  Senior Vice President, Legislative                                             and Political Affairs.    Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance  of my time.
