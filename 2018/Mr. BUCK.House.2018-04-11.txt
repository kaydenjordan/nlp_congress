 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I call  up House Resolution 811 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 811         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 4790) to       amend the Volcker rule to give the Board of Governors of the       Federal Reserve System sole rulemaking authority, to exclude       community banks from the requirements of the Volcker rule,       and for other purposes. All points of order against       consideration of the bill are waived. In lieu of the       amendment in the nature of a substitute recommended by the       Committee on Financial Services now printed in the bill, an       amendment in the nature of a substitute consisting of the       text of Rules Committee Print 115-67 shall be considered as       adopted. The bill, as amended, shall be considered as read.       All points of order against provisions in the bill, as       amended, are waived. The previous question shall be       considered as ordered on the bill, as amended, and on any       further amendment thereto, to final passage without       intervening motion except: (1) one hour of debate equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on Financial Services; and (2) one       motion to recommit with or without instructions.        Sec. 2.  (a) It shall be in order at any time on the       legislative day of April 12, 2018, for the Speaker to       entertain motions that the House suspend the rules, as though       under clause 1 of rule XV, relating to the joint resolution       (H.J. Res. 2) proposing a balanced budget amendment to the       Constitution of the United States. Debate on such a motion       shall be extended to four hours. (b) The Chair may postpone       further consideration of a motion considered pursuant to       subsection (a) to such time as may be designated by the       Speaker.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr.  McGovern), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume.  During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the  purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule and the  underlying legislation.   The rule makes in order one bill reported favorably by the Committee  on Financial Services. The committee held several hearings on the  topics within this bill in the spring of 2017.   Additionally, it was marked up in committee, and a Democrat amendment  in the nature of a substitute was adopted by voice. The bill was  reported by a strong, bipartisan vote of 50-10. The rule makes in order  no amendments to the bill. Why? Because there were none offered.   Additionally, the rule provides the opportunity for this House to  consider a balanced budget amendment and more than quadruples the time  for debate on the floor than it would otherwise be provided.   Mr. Speaker, once again, I have the opportunity to come down to the  floor and manage debate for a Financial Services bill. Thinking of the  process that I just referenced a moment ago, one thing routinely  strikes me: so many of these Financial Services bills are  overwhelmingly bipartisan within the Committee on Financial Services.   There always seems to be a common theme and political rhetoric that  Republicans are shills for the banking industry. Setting a rebuttal to  that aside for now, the underlying bill before us contains a wholly  bipartisan piece of legislation.   That a committee run by Republicans would have a process whereby we  bring to the floor a major piece of reform legislation offered by both  a Republican and a Democrat is a real testament to the fact that this  House can work. I commend Chairman Hensarling for running the committee  in such a way.   Mr. Speaker, our small town and community banks are a much bigger  part of our lives than many may realize. Often here in Washington, we  get caught up in big players in industry. We talk about Wall Street and  Silicon Valley. We speak of countries and international relations.  However, all across this great land, Americans in small, medium, and  large communities go about their business and conduct their day-to-day  affairs without any of the issues that consume Washington touching  their lives.   Most Americans just simply want Washington to leave them in peace, to  allow them to live their lives without politics and government  intruding at every step. This Financial Services bill before us speaks  to those concerns. This is legislation for Main Streets all across this  Nation.   Mr. Speaker, there are nearly 6,000 community banks across this  country with 52,000 locations. These banks are the backbone of our  communities' finances. Collectively, they hold more than $3.2 trillion  in loans to consumers. They provide nearly 50 percent of all small  business loans and nearly 80 percent of all agriculture loans.   How is it that they claim such a huge portion of loans within our  communities? It is simple. They are also part of the community that  they serve, and they extend credit based on personal knowledge of their  neighbors and their local economy.   But they are more than just organizations that lend and offer banking  services. They are small businesses that employ more than 750,000  Americans. Clearly, community banks are key partners in our  communities. They are particularly important lenders in rural towns and  counties, such as the ones I represent in eastern Colorado.   Former Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen summed it best when she  said: ``We know that community banks serve many customers that large  banks do not and provide services that are not offered by large banks  in many communities. This circumstance is especially true in rural  areas and other small communities, where community banks are sometimes  the only retail financial institutions.''   However, even with their importance to Americans, they have borne the  brunt of regulation under Dodd-Frank. Each new regulation drives up  costs and forces personnel resources to be diverted to compliance  efforts. Even if a particular institution is not ultimately subject to  a rule, it must spend resources on each new regulation released to  verify whether any part of its operations are impacted or not.   These costs place a drain on operations which consumes resources that  otherwise would be used for growth.   The Federal Reserve Board recently released data that showed that  small bank lending in rural areas had declined by 46 percent since  2005. According to the Independent Community Bankers of America, a 2014  survey of community banks revealed that 78 percent of banks reported  adding personnel just to deal with increased regulation.   By consuming resources that could otherwise be placed into serving  customers and increasing lending, community banks are many times forced  to consolidate just to remain alive. Today, there are 1,700 fewer  community banks than there were in 2010. As of May 2017, only three new  banks were formed since the financial crisis.   It is clear that our community banks are suffering under an  unbearable regulatory burden. And when our community banks suffer, our  small towns and rural communities suffer also.    The underlying bill before us today exempts community banks from yet  another regulation that lumps small institutions with big banks. The  Volcker rule was implemented by Dodd-Frank. It was intended to keep  banks from engaging in a practice known as proprietary trading.  Proprietary trading is a practice where a financial institution such as  a bank uses its own finances to buy and sell stocks and other  investments so as to make a profit for itself.   Because of their importance to each individual American, but also to  our broader economy, we should consider carefully how we allow  financial institutions to operate. However, the real  [[Page H3106]]  impact of the Volcker rule on community banks has served to undermine  investment options in our smaller communities.   All across this country, particularly in rural communities,  entrepreneurs, farmers, and others sell their equity or bonds in order  to raise capital to grow and expand. However, if community banks were  prohibited from buying these financial instruments, then the sellers  would have to find buyers on their own. That is a highly impractical  situation.   Under the Volcker rule, an entrepreneur cannot approach their  community bank and offer to sell a portion of their equity to the bank.  Why? Because Dodd-Frank prohibits the banks from making its own  investments. What sense does this make? Where is the entrepreneur  supposed to go to find a buyer for their equity? Are they supposed to  go door-to-door looking for someone who might want to invest? That is  nonsense.   Community banks play a vital role in purchasing these financial  instruments and holding them until the bank is approached by a willing  buyer. Or maybe the bank holds them for a brief period as they know  they have a customer who is searching for this type of investment.   Either way, this is not an evil practice that we should prohibit. The  community bank's actions are making a marketplace for these investment  transactions, and this should be encouraged. It increases access to  capital for small businesses and farms in our communities.   But it is not just on the selling side of the equation that this  practice benefits. It also benefits the buying side of the equation.  Many Americans have invested a portion of their retirement savings in  pension funds, mutual funds, or similar types of investments. These  funds need for their investments to be liquid so as to meet demands for  cash from the people who have chosen to save their money in the funds.   These funds often place these cash investments into smaller financial  institutions through purchasing the stocks or bonds that these banks  own. The banks allow these larger funds to purchase the bank's assets  and also to sell back to the bank the same assets when the funds need  cash.   This isn't a shady practice. This is an extraordinarily important  practice and benefits every single American who has saved or is saving  money in a pension or other retirement account.   The Volcker rule prohibits this activity. Washington, in its  typically arrogant way, decided that it knew better than Americans and  banned this under Dodd-Frank.   On December 10, 2013, the five--I repeat, the five--separate agencies  tasked with writing and enforcing this regulation released a final  regulation that is 932 pages long and contains nearly 300,000 words.   That is astounding. What small town community bank can, on top of all  of the other regulations heaped upon them, carve out the necessary  resources to comply with such a burden?   When we had this bill at Rules Committee yesterday, one of my  colleagues on the committee related a story of visiting one of his  community banks. He indicated that it was a fairly small bank. The  owner of the bank walked him into the back operations office and  pointed to 14 staff members working. All of them were working  exclusively on complying with regulations. That is 14 people not  serving customers, or seeking new depositors, or helping the community  grow. What a sad state to which we have arrived.   Washington heaps, and heaps, and heaps burdens on the backs of  Americans day in and day out. Technocrats make it harder and harder to  achieve success in this land.   We are still a land of opportunity, but that gift is threatened daily  by our bureaucracy. Endless regulation of every meaningful detail of  our lives is antithetical to the American way.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1230     Mr. Speaker, I have no speakers, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time to close.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Before us we have a rule that makes in order an important change to  the banking laws. We have seen what happens when arduous regulations  are removed from the backs of Americans.  [[Page H3110]]  Our economy is booming, growth is strong, even stronger than many  expected it would be at this point.   The Volcker rule, passed under Dodd-Frank, is a solution in search of  a problem. Our community banks should not have to bear the weight of  this overarching regulation. Our small town and rural lenders are  active members of our communities. They participate in improving our  lives in many ways, even beyond lending. They sponsor little league  teams. They are boosters for the local high school. They counsel small  businessmen and women. They contribute to our churches and charitable  organizations. They offer help to needy neighbors.   We should actively seek policies that free them to do their jobs.  That is what the underlying bill does. It exempts them from a  regulation that has frozen in place their ability to invest in local  startups and farming operations. We should exempt them from this  burdensome regulation.   I hope this House will follow in the steps of the Financial Services  Committee and approve this bill in an overwhelming bipartisan fashion.  I urge support of the rule and the underlying legislation.   The material previously referred to by Mr. McGovern is as follows:            An Amendment to H. Res. 811 Offered by Mr. McGovern         In section 2(a), insert ``as amended by the amendment       specified in section 3 of this resolution'' after ``United       States''.        At the end of the resolution, add the following new       section:        ``Sec. 3. The amendment referred to in section 2(a) of this       resolution is as follows:        `After section 7, insert the following section (and       redesignate the subsequent section accordingly):       SECTION 8. EXEMPTION OF SOCIAL SECURITY, MEDICARE, AND                     MEDICAID FROM FEDERAL BALANCED BUDGET                     REQUIREMENT         Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the following       programs and any outlays resulting therefrom shall be exempt       from any Federal balanced budget requirement:        (1) All Social Security benefits payable under title II of       the Social Security Act.        (2) Payments under the Medicare program under title XVIII       of the Social Security Act.        (3) Payments to States under the Medicaid program under       title XIX of such Act.' ''.                                   ____           The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a       vote about what the House should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to       a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to       yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first       recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no       substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''       But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the       Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in       the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,       page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous       question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally       not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member       controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule . . . When the       motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the       time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering       the previous question. That Member, because he then controls       the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for       the purpose of amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on       Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further       debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:       ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a       resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control       shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous       question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who       controls the time for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools for those who oppose the Republican       majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the       opportunity to offer an alternative plan.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.
