 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the Rules Committee for  bringing this bill to the floor tomorrow. I appreciate the due  diligence they did on scrutinizing those amendments that could be  additive to it and also the one from my colleague, Representative  Titus, so we can really put aside this debate on a consensus-based  issue because we need to help educate the American people. We need to  help educate our colleagues.   In the State of Nevada, 90 percent of all the land is owned by the  Federal Government, and a big portion of that is at this location.   When people say ``not in my backyard,'' we think they are talking  about the Rayburn Building. Not in my backyard, in this debate, we are  talking about Baltimore. But in between here and Baltimore, there is  desert; and in the 60-mile radius is a fenced-in enclosure where we  used to set off atomic weapons and groundbursts. So there is a place in  this land that is called Yucca Flats, and some of us have seen that.  Yucca Flats is where we did atomic testing.   We need to make sure people understand this debate. Big area of land,  Federal Government, really, the local consensus is us. It is the  Federal Government. We are the landowners of this property.   This is a tough decision. No one wants nuclear waste or defense  waste. I am glad my colleague, Mr. Newhouse, is managing this bill,  because I have been out to his location. In Hanford, we have a lot of  defense waste there.   So what are we trying to do? We will flesh this out more, obviously,  tomorrow, but this issue is a multigeneration debate which we in this  Chamber get a chance to move forward again after a long delay.  [[Page H3848]]    This goes back to World War II. This goes back to the atomic age.  This goes back to winning the Cold War. This goes back to our weapons  programs. When that occurred, they said: Now we have got this  technology; let's use it for civil electric generation.   The government wanted to encourage that because we wanted to have  nuclear scientists and we wanted to have energy generation, but we also  wanted to have the experience and the expertise of nuclear scientists  and engineers who could move back and forth from the private sector to  the defense sector for our Nation's security, and, hence, we agreed.   In 1982, we had to address the spent nuclear fuel at nuclear power  sites and we had to address the defense waste that is predominantly in  Congressman Newhouse's district, a lot of it in South Carolina. There  is a little bit in New York. We have some left in Colorado. That is  just the defense waste, not including the 39 States and 121 locations  that have nuclear fuel--a national issue, a national concern, and we  are moving forward to a national solution.   In 1982, under the Reagan administration, they said: Well, how are we  going to pay for this? So they decided to charge ratepayers who are  using electricity that has been generated by nuclear power a fee, a  fee-based system to help the industry find a location to store their  spent fuel and for us to clean up the defense sites--pretty good  proposal.   Years later, they are trying to find the location. They do three  analyses. Yucca Mountain was on the top three of these three. Then, as  I will mention tomorrow, Senator Johnson and a guy named John Dingell  said: Yucca Mountain, we need to move forward.   So that was in 1987. Then we started generating the movement to get  to a point where, under the law, the State of Nevada could say, ``We  reject the proposal,'' which they did. The law then said the Federal  Government could veto their objection, which we did.                                time  1300     Mr. Speaker, we had an administration that put a pause  on that for about 8 years, and now we are ready to move forward again.  We have got an administration that wants to fund the licensing process.   I see my good friend from California (Ms. Matsui) is on the floor,  and she has worked on interim; what do we do with the waste before we  put it in the final repository?   There are what I call dead plants--probably not the proper word--we  have plants that are no longer generating electricity, but they have  waste on site.   Can't we consolidate those for the benefit of the Nation and get them  away from some of our more pristine areas?   The answer is ``yes.'' That is what we tried to with the bill. We are  going to accept a couple amendments that have been brought forward by  some Democrat colleagues on, I think, financing, or evaluation of the  money and what do we do to the cities and how do we help them  redevelop. And I will encourage my colleagues to support those when we  have that debate.   Mr. Speaker, I know it is not an easy process in the Rules Committee.  This is a step to get it to the floor. I appreciate the kindness that  was shown to me yesterday, and I look forward to joining with you all  tomorrow.
