 Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague from Louisiana (Mr.  Johnson) for his leadership on all of these pro-life issues.   Madam Speaker, in the wake of the Dobbs decision, pro-abortion  radicals have waged horrific attacks on our pro-life community.   Pro-life institutions are on the front line of meeting the needs of  women, youth, and, yes, men. They provide critical services and support  and have saved so many lives. Nobody should be in fear for their safety  when seeking medical care and spiritual support.   This body has an opportunity to express its unwavering support for  women and families across America and condemn this violence by voting  for this act.   I am proud to be part of this effort. Madam Speaker, I encourage my  colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote ``yes'' on this  resolution.
