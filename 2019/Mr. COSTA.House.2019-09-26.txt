 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor an incredible  individual, a man who is a beloved member of the San Joaquin Valley  from Fresno, California, Mr. Ray O'Canto.   Sadly, Ray passed away 2 weeks ago after a short battle with cancer.   He was a native of the San Joaquin Valley, born in Visalia, and  played baseball at the College of the Sequoias and his beloved Fresno  State Bulldogs. He also served for many years as the voice of the  Fresno State baseball team.   In 2008, when the Bulldogs went from the underdogs to the wonder dogs  and made their improbable run to win the College World Series, the  collegiate national championship, Ray was there with his excitement and  his enthusiasm that spread throughout the valley.   He was also a popular media personality, hosting a show that  showcased the food and history of the great San Joaquin Valley and the  incredible cornucopia of products that we produce.   Those who knew Ray said he radiated positivity and enthusiasm in  everything he did, and that was the case.   He loved our community, and his loss will be felt for a very long  time.   Madam Speaker, it is with great respect that I ask my colleagues to  join me in honoring our friend, Ray O'Canto.                       National Hispanic Heritage Month     Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize National Hispanic  Heritage Month and the countless Hispanic Americans who have  contributed so much to the richness and diversity of our Nation.   Ray O'Canto was an example, but there are so many, many, many  examples.   In my district, again in the San Joaquin Valley of California, the  majority of our constituents trace their origin to Hispanic  communities. Actually, in California, it goes back to the very origins  of the State, about 400 years ago.   They, in so many different ways, reflect the diversity and the  breadth and the width in our community and in our Nation in business,  in education, in the military, in labor, in sports; meaningful  contributions, working people that make a difference every day giving  back.   The Hispanic community throughout our country reflects the American  story, and that is the story, I believe, of the immigrant, immigrants  past and immigrants present, all wanting to make a contribution and to  live what we call the American Dream. The dream that is held near and  dear by everyone throughout the world who admires and appreciates that  America is a beacon of light, and certainly it has been for the  Hispanic communities.   There are so many different individuals that I could recognize in my  congressional district. I would like to mention a couple of individuals  that I think reflect the temerity, the tenaciousness, and the  willingness to give back.   Mr. Aguilera, a first-generation immigrant, worked his way from being  homeless to owning his own business. He founded the Merced Soccer  Academy, a local nonprofit organization which brings young people  together to compete and to learn from one another. Every Monday, he  hosts meetings for community members to share in events.   Another individual that I work with from the California Highway  Patrol is Officer Aldo Garcia, also known as ``El Protector''. ``The  Protector'' is a community outreach officer that focuses toward the  Hispanic community. His emphasis on education, not just law  enforcement, has broken down barriers for peace officers and created a  more approachable situation.   There are so many examples: Jose Ramirez, a world champion boxer and  an Olympic competitor; Tom Flores, two-time Superbowl championship  coach for the Oakland Raiders. The list just goes on and on and on.   And guess what? All of these individuals and their families reflect  immigrant origins coming to live the American Dream.   Isn't that really what it is all about? I believe so.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in recognition of  National Hispanic Heritage Month and the noteworthy accomplishments  that Hispanic Americans make throughout our country, serving in our  Armed Forces, making the sacrifices that all Americans make. It is what  makes our country the great country it is.                            ____________________
