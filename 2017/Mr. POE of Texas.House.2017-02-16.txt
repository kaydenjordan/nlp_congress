 Mr. Speaker, Weingarten Realty owns several  shopping centers in Texas. Recently they were sued by plaintiffs who  had never visited the shopping center.   The complaint?   Allegedly, nine designated ADA van-accessible parking spaces were not  dispersed far enough apart.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        February 16, 2017, on page H1280, the following appeared:  Allegedly, nine designated ADA van accessible parking spaces were  not dispersed far apart enough.      The online version has been corrected to read: Allegedly, nine  designated ADA van accessible parking spaces were not dispersed  far enough apart.    ========================= END NOTE =========================     The plaintiff did not notify Weingarten of the alleged violations  before filing the lawsuit, so Weingarten couldn't comply.   The real estate company believes they were in compliance with the  ADA. But often companies like Weingarten decide the best economic  decision is to settle the lawsuit rather than an expensive court trial.  Businesses are told to either pay a settlement or face an expensive  trial.   The bipartisan bill, the ADA Education and Reform Act of 2017,  requires plaintiffs to give businesses notice and time to fix the  alleged ADA infraction before a lawsuit is filed.   Mr. Speaker, the ADA was designed to improve access for the disabled,  not allow a handful of greedy plaintiffs who have never been on the  premises to use a loophole to extort unsuspecting businessowners of  money.   And that is just the way it is.  [[Page H1281]]                                ____________________
