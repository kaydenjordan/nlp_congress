 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, on Saturday, we lost a remarkable former  colleague: Senator Orrin Hatch.   Orrin rose from poverty to become one of the longest serving Senators  in U.S. history and the longest serving Republican Senator ever. During  his more than 40-year Senate career, he built a record of  accomplishment that included landmark legislation like the Americans  with Disabilities Act; the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act; and the Religious  Freedom Restoration Act, which he authored with his close friend from  across the aisle, Senator Ted Kennedy. At the time of Orrin's  retirement, no Senator alive had had as many pieces of legislation  signed into law.   I was privileged to serve under Orrin's leadership at the Senate  Finance Committee, one of three influential Senate committees that he  chaired during his tenure in the Senate. In addition to being an  outstanding legislator and a principled conservative, Orrin Hatch was  also a cherished and good-humored colleague and a deeply kind human  being. It is no surprise that his friendships spanned both sides of the  aisle or that both the Democrat and Republican leaders paid tribute to  him yesterday.   Mr. President, I know I speak for more than myself when I say that I  have missed his presence in the Senate. His death is a loss for our  country and especially for his beloved State of Utah, which he served  so faithfully and so well during his long career.   My thoughts and prayers this week are with Orrin's wife of more than  64 years, Elaine, with Orrin's six children, and with his dozens of  grandchildren and great-grandchildren.
