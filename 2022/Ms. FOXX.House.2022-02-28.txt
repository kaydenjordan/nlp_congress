 Mr. Speaker, President Zelensky of Ukraine is a rock-ribbed  leader who will fight and deliver for his country, and Americans are  standing with the Ukrainians, who are fighting so bravely for their  country.   It is damning that Americans can't say the same for the person who is  supposed to be the leader of the free world as we can for President  Zelensky.   Our leader kneecapped American energy production by eliminating the  Keystone XL pipeline and empowered Putin by waiving sanctions on the  Nord Stream 2 pipeline in Europe. Due to that abysmal decision, the  U.S. is now explicitly not targeting Russia's energy sector with  sanctions. It is as if he wanted America to be dependent on Putin and  autocrats in Russia indefinitely.   We could have done more to stop what has happened in Ukraine.  Americans support the Ukrainians and want to see a change in our energy  policy. What is happening now is damaging our country and our standing  in the free world.                            ____________________
