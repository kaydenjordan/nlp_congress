 Madam President, over the last several years, much has been  made about the digital divide that exists here in America. The more  digital the economy becomes, the bigger the divide between big cities  and small towns.   As someone who still lives on a family farm in Davie County in North  Carolina, I have always made it a priority to stand up for North  Carolinians who don't have the advantage of large population centers.  Rural Americans across our State and our Nation shouldn't have their  economic opportunities diminished because of their ZIP Code.   One of the biggest challenges we face in bridging the digital divide  is politicalization. An example of this is the Broadband, Equity,  Access, and Deployment--or BEAD--Program. This program provides ``over  $42 billion to expand high-speed internet access by funding planning,  infrastructure deployment and adoption programs'' across the country,  but once the Biden administration got a hold of this funding, they  began funneling it toward their liberal wish list instead of toward  commonsense broadband deployment.   Another example is the Biden administration's Notice of Funding  Opportunity, which gives favorable treatment to government-owned  networks over private ones, and they load up that funding with climate  mandates that drive up costs for these communities. This is  fundamentally the wrong approach.   At the end of the day, what rural Americans are looking for is pretty  straightforward: They want the highest quality internet for the most  affordable price as quickly as possible.   This is not the time or place for social agendas or for partisan  distractions. We have to keep our eye on bridging the digital divide so  that rural Americans have a fair shot at opportunities where they can  achieve their God-given potential. This is just one more way we can  build a strong nation.   I yield the floor.
