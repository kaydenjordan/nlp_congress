 Mr. Speaker, I thank our distinguished ranking member of  the Appropriations Committee for yielding this time, but, more  importantly, for exceptional leadership. To her and to the other  members of the committee, Mr. Frelinghuysen, I thank them for their  leadership as well. And to the chairs and ranking members of the  subcommittee, all the members of the Appropriations Committee, Mr.  Hoyer and I and Mr. Clyburn are from the culture of the Appropriations  Committee, and we know that, left to your own devices, the  appropriators can get the job done.   It is not until the leadership rains its poison pills on the process  that the delay sets in. And I want to thank Congresswoman Ranking  Member Lowey for ridding this bill of so many of those poison pills.   Mr. Hoyer very eloquently presented the situation as we see it now  that the Republicans have this bill. They didn't even have three days.  It was last night to today, and here we are on the floor with a yard--a  yard--of bill. And he said they are rushing because people have codels,  trips, fundraisers, and this and that.   I contend there may be another reason why they are rushing it  through. First of all, they don't want anybody to know what is in the  bill, because this is a tremendous victory for the American people in  terms of what Mrs. Lowey was able to negotiate, in a bipartisan way, on  the domestic side. We all take an oath to protect and defend our  country, so the defense investments are important to our Nation; but  one-third of the domestic budget is security: homeland security,  veterans affairs, State Department, antiterrorism activities of the  Justice Department, and the list goes on.    But it is also a fact that we can measure the strength of our country  not only in the important military might and security measures but also  in the health, education, and well-being of the American people; and  this bill goes to a place for that.   So yes, a yard of bill, certainly not read or read to the Members.  But I contend, in addition to Mr. Hoyer's list of why they are rushing  this to the end instead of having this negotiation take place much  earlier, it is because they really don't want the Members to see what  is in this bill, A; and, B, because they really want to get out of town  before the March for Our Lives, before the young people come from all  over the country to ask Congress to give us responsible, commonsense  gun violence prevention legislation. That is what I heard about the  Republicans: they just don't want to be around when these young people  come to town.   So here we are. We could have had this happen weeks ago and had a  much more transparent way to deal with it. But having said that, we are  here, and I think it is very important to set the record straight on  some of the contentions that the Republicans are making about this  bill.   Let me start with the President of the United States. He has said, in  one of his tweets this morning, how happy he was because he got the  $1.6 billion to start the wall and more to come. That is not completely  true, Mr. President. There are some resources for fencing and repairs  and the rest there, but some of that money is for technology and other  ways to protect our borders. We all have a responsibility to protect  our borders, north and south. But if you want to think that you are  getting a wall, you just think it and sign the bill.  [[Page H2023]]    In addition, he said he is so pleased that he got this big increase  in defense. We did not oppose that. We want to have our men and women  in uniform have everything they need to keep our country safe and  themselves safe. But the President went on to say it is too bad he had  to waste money on the Democratic giveaways. On the Democratic  giveaways.   ``Democratic giveaway'' is the way the President characterizes  funding for our heroic veterans facing a dire shortfall at the VA. We  say on the battlefield, no soldier is left behind. When they come home,  no veteran is left behind. And that was part of the fight that we had  in the caps fight, that we wanted additional money for our veterans.   What about fighting the opioid epidemic? Is that wasteful, a  giveaway, fighting the opioid epidemic, in your districts? There isn't  a person who serves in this Congress who doesn't have need in their  districts for this opioid funding. And that was a major part of our  fight on the caps, to get the funding to fight opioids; but the  President calls that a waste, a Democratic giveaway.   Is that what he would call--he probably would call protecting the  integrity of American elections from Russian meddling and attack  Democratic giveaways, protecting our democracy, our electoral system,  our Constitution that we take an oath of office to protect and defend.   And how about for hardworking parents who struggle to succeed and  afford quality childcare, a very important part of this legislation.  Democratic giveaway? No. Family values. Supporting our families. The  list goes on and on. And by the way, by the foot. By the foot.   Mr. Hoyer referenced a statement made by the Speaker on the floor of  the House when we had the caps fight, which, by the way, was a glorious  victory for our values as a country, that we could say, yes, we want to  increase funding for our national security, and, in doing that, we need  to have a commensurate increase in funding for our domestic agenda, as  I said, which contains many security measures.   But when that bill was brought to the floor, the Speaker came to the  floor, and he made a statement, right here in the well. Well, Steny  quoted what he said in the well, but in another venue he said: In order  to shift our focus and get on to the next big priority, which is a DACA  solution, we have got to get this budget agreement done.   That was the caps bill.   And I will say it once, Mr. Speaker said, and I will say it again, we  will bring a DACA solution to the floor.   Yes. And when will that be?   Now, you will hear rumors of them saying: Oh, we offered this and we  offered that. They did not offer anything that added to the protection  of our Dreamers and our DACA-qualified children. So I want the Record  to show the facts are these: We proposed, over and over again, a real  fix that we should have in this bill because it is timely. And if you  are dealing with a yard of issues and provisions, you certainly can  have room for protecting our Dreamers. And that is just an indication.   Now, to lead is to take risks. The Speaker does not seem willing to  take a risk with his caucus to bring a bill to the floor, any bill you  want, in terms of including some bipartisan bills. Mr. Hurd and Mr.  Aguilar, Ms. Ros-Lehtinen and Ms. Roybal-Allard, any other bill you  want. Make it clean at the Hill. Let everyone have his or her say. Let  Congress work its will.   Why? Why not? And why, in light of this statement, ``And I'll say it  once, and I'll say it again, we will bring a DACA solution to the  floor''?   When might that be? When might that be?   So again, while we address so many provisions in this bill, wasn't  there room in the hearts and minds of our Republican colleagues to  insist? Because I know many of you care about our Dreamers, have  publicly offered your support. Why can't you convince the Speaker to  bring what he said, ``We will bring a DACA solution to the floor''?   So again, I go back to the caps agreement. It was a great victory for  us in the appropriations world as to what priorities need to be  addressed. As we always say, the budget should be a statement of our  national values; what is important to us as a nation should be  reflected in how we allocate our resources to invest in the security of  our country, the well-being of our people, the future of our children,  and to do so in a way that commands respect, that is bipartisan, that  is done in an open and transparent way, and brings unity.                                time  1215    Our Founders, who were so brilliant in so many ways, were taking 8  hours to even start to talk about how brilliant they were.   But they did give us instruction. They gave us a signal: E Pluribus  Unum--from many, one; from many, one. They couldn't possibly have  imagined how many we would be or how different we would be, but they  knew we had to be one.   And these children, and everyone in our country, these Dreamers are  part of that one, and they are part of that many, and let us treat our  country by honoring the vows of our Founders.   So I leave it up to Members as to whether they want to vote, weigh  the equities in this bill and take the vote and respect whatever  decision they make. But I am so glad that we had such an overwhelming  vote on our side against a rule that undermines the regular order of  the House, undermines the Speaker's own statements about that regular  order.   Why?   In an attempt to keep from all of you how much investment in the  future is in this bill and also to get you out of town before the March  for Our Lives begins. That is why I think we are doing this so rushed.  I don't know why it has been pushed to the end except for dysfunction  on the part of the Republican leadership, whatever, if it's called  communication with the White House.   But I will say this: This is five CRs. Are you proud of that? Five  CRs. Take us to the floor with a yard-high bill, no transparency. But  it does have some bipartisanship, and for that I salute Mr.  Frelinghuysen and Mrs. Lowey and respect whatever decisions our Members  make on this. This is a missed opportunity to show the American people  that, even when we are on the right course, we can't seem to get there  in a transparent way.   I say, Mr. President, when you sign this bill, you will be signing  something--in spite of what you say about spending on wasteful  Democratic funding, I don't really think you mean that about opioids  and the rest. Set the record straight for yourself and out of respect  for the people who are pinning their hopes on what this legislation  will do for them.
