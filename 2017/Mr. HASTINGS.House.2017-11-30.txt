The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 3, line 18, strike ``The length'' and insert ``Except       as provided for in paragraph (2), the length''.        Page 4, after line 8, insert the following (and redesignate       accordingly):        ``(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), in the case of an       individual who has successfully completed a term of service       in a national service program under the National and       Community Service Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12501 et seq.) or       the Domestic Volunteer Service Act of 1973 (42 U.S.C. 4950 et       seq.), or as a volunteer or a volunteer leader under the       Peace Corps Act (22 U.S.C. 2501 et seq.), the length of a       probationary period established under paragraph (1) or (2) of       subsection (a) shall--        ``(A) with respect to any position occupied by such an       individual that requires formal training, begin on the date       of appointment to the position and end on the date that is 1       year after the date on which such formal training is       completed;        ``(B) with respect to any position occupied by such an       individual that requires a license, begin on the date of       appointment to the position and end on the date that is 1       year after the date on which such license is granted; and        ``(C) with respect to any position occupied by such an       individual that is not covered by subparagraph (A) or (B), be       a period of 1 year beginning on the date of the appointment       to the position.        Page 4, line 9, strike ``paragraph (1)'' and insert ``this       subsection''.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 635, the gentleman  from Florida (Mr. Hastings) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida.    Mr. Chairman, for far too long, the Republican majority  in Congress has treated Federal workers as if they are the problem.   We have spent years beating up Federal employees, implementing pay  freezes, implementing hiring freezes, and cutting benefits in order to  drive employees away from government service. The legislation we are  debating today continues this offensive unfair trend.   This bill doubles the probationary period for employees of the civil  service, in an effort to make it easier to fire the employees without  giving them any chance to challenge that decision. In doing so, my  Republican friends are sending a clear message, and that message is  that they see Federal employees as untrustworthy and unworthy of being  secure in their employment.   The amendment I am offering would exempt those who have served this  country through programs such as the Peace Corps and AmeriCorps from  the 2-year probationary period under this legislation, instead keeping  them at the 1-year level of probation already in effect.   Last night, I offered an amendment at the Rules Committee to extend  this same exemption for veterans, but it was blocked from  consideration.   Let me say that again because I want every one watching to hear me  loudly and clearly. Last night, the Republican majority on the Rules  Committee voted to block an amendment that would have protected  veterans employed in the government from being fired without cause.   I was told by my colleague who introduced this measure that being  able to fire veterans within a 2-year probationary period--footnote  right there: veterans would have already served 2 or more years before  becoming civil servants at that level--but I was told that, without  giving them any legal protections, recourse, or even an ability to  improve ``helps the veterans, just like it helps everyone.''   Well, Mr. Chairman, I am here to tell you that is hogwash. Veterans  should not need to prove themselves worthy of a government job for a  full 2 years before they are afforded the rights that should be  inherent their position.   We ought to be spending time working to strengthen our Federal  workforce through better training and more plentiful diversity  programs. Instead, this bill needlessly undermines our civil service  and the fine people who work within it, while simultaneously making it  a less attractive place of employment for our best and brightest at a  time when we are in desperate need of such people.   This amendment would protect those who have already served our  country in the national service from this bill's intentions. In my  opinion, we should be expanding protections for everyone--for veterans,  women, minorities, LGBTQ Americans, and especially for disabled  Americans.   Let me say one more thing that I said last night, and this is with  due respect to my colleague, Mr. Connolly, who is managing for the  minority in this case, and the extraordinary number of constituents  that he and the Members, both Republican and Democrat, in the near  curtilage of this area here in metropolitan Washington, they do an  incredible job. Their constituents virtually all are saying to them  that this is an unnecessary measure.   I am sure that Mr. Connolly has made that very clear. I heard him  introduce measures that I introduced in the Rules Committee last night  from a variety of organizations. I will not burden you more but to say  that we should be about the business of trying to build a Federal  workforce and not put obstacles in their way.   Mr. Chair, I urge a ``yes'' vote, and I yield back the balance of my  time.
