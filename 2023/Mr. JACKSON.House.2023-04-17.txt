 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to confront a multitude of  challenges that have relentlessly gnawed at the very soul of our  Nation, the devastating plague of gun violence, the erosion of our  democratic values, and the insidious persistence of racism that  continues to cast its dark shadow over our society.   As we stand today, hearts heavy with sorrow, we remember the innocent  lives lost in the tragic mass shooting at The Covenant School in  Nashville. Three young children and three adults were mercilessly taken  from us, leaving a void in their families and communities that can  never be filled.   The Metropolitan Nashville Police Department identified the victims  as Evelyn Dieckhaus, 9 years of age; Hallie Scruggs, 9 years of age;  William Kinney, 9 years of age; Katherine Koonce, 60; Cynthia Peak, 61;  Mike Hill, 61.   In the wake of this unspeakable tragedy, the Tennessee State  Legislature, a body that was meant to protect its citizens and uphold  the values of this great Nation, chose to abdicate its  responsibilities.   Instead of working tirelessly to keep their communities safe from the  horrors of gun violence, they opted for an unprecedented and unjust  course of action; expelling two Black members of the Democratic Caucus  who stood with families, who stood with teachers, and who stood with  the will of the students in their righteous demand for gun safety  reform.   Representative Justin Jones and Representative Justin Pearson, two  Black and duly elected representatives, were silenced, their voices  snuffed out like candles in a storm.   The GOP-led House's actions have sent a chilling message that racism,  the vile scourge that has blighted our Nation's history, is still alive  and well.   My fellow colleagues, it is high time we stand up and speak truth to  power. We must stand tall, shoulder to shoulder, and declare that we  will no longer tolerate this blatant racism and anti-democratic  behavior. We will not let the echoes of the past define our presence,  nor dictate our future.   To truly understand the gravity of the situation in Tennessee, we  must delve into the sordid history of State legislatures in the South  and their treatment of Black lawmakers.   During the Reconstruction era, we saw the rise of Black political  representation. However, this progress was met with fierce resistance  from the white supremacists who sought to maintain their grip on power.                                time  1945    In Georgia, 32 Black legislators, known as the Original 33, were  expelled from the general assembly in 1868. They were among the first  African-American State legislators in the United States. Twenty-four of  their members were ministers. Their only crime was the color of their  skin.   This blatant act of racism sets a dangerous precedent for future  generations.   In the turbulent times of the civil rights and antiwar movements, Mr.  Julian Bond, a key figure in the founding of the Student Nonviolent  Coordinating Committee, was elected to the Georgia House of  Representatives in 1966. Amidst the struggle for justice and equality,  the Georgia House refused to seat Mr. Julian Bond, alleging that his  opposition to the Vietnam war rendered him unfit to serve.   It took a Supreme Court ruling to overturn the decision and affirm  Bond's right to serve in the State legislature.  [[Page H1745]]    Moreover, we cannot forget that even the United States Congress has  denied African-American lawmakers their rights to seats.   On February 27, 1869, Congress rejected John Willis Menard, the first  Black man elected to the House of Representatives. Mr. Menard, a poet,  newspaper publisher, and politician, secured a resounding victory in  Louisiana's Second Congressional District.   In November 1868, despite his triumph, his election was met with  fierce opposition led by the defeated White candidate, Caleb S. Hunt.  Then-Congressman James Garfield argued it was too soon ``for a Negro''  to join the Congress and that the seat should be declared vacant to  save the $5,000 salary.   As a result, Mr. Menard was never seated, and his constituents were  denied representation until the next election.   It is both disheartening and infuriating that even after more than  150 years since the end of the Civil War, we continue to grapple with  the same injustices that have plagued our Nation since its inception.  Racism remains deeply entrenched in our society, and the expulsion of  Representative Justin Jones and Representative Justin Pearson in  Tennessee is a stark reminder that our struggle for equality, justice,  and fair representation is far from over.   We as a nation have not made as much progress as we should have  despite the countless sacrifices of our forebearers. Black people in  America continue to face systemic oppression and are silenced in  various forms.   The legacy of slavery, segregation, sedition, and racial violence  casts a long shadow over our society. However, it is in the face of  adversity that we find our strength.   Throughout history, Black Americans have persevered, united, and  fought for their rights, standing tall against the forces that sought  to silence them. From the brave men and women who stood up against  racial segregation to the pioneering lawmakers who broke barriers in  the State legislatures and Congress, their resilience and determination  have paved the way for future generations.   Now, it is our turn to carry the torch of progress. We must stand to  demand an end to the injustices that continue to suppress the voices of  our brothers and our sisters. We must actively dismantle the structures  that perpetuate racism and inequality, ensuring that every citizen,  regardless of the color of their skin, has the opportunity to thrive  and make their voices heard.   Let us draw inspiration from those who have come before us and forged  a new path toward a brighter future. Let the bold parallels of the past  guide us as we reshape the narrative, ensuring that the sacrifices of  our ancestors were not made in vain. It is our responsibility as a  nation to guarantee that every American, irrespective of race, has the  right to be heard, respected, and valued.   We are one Nation, indivisible, bound by our shared history and our  common aspirations. Let us rise together and demand change not only for  ourselves but for our children and our children's children.   We must break the chains of injustice, end the cycle of  discrimination, and ensure that our voices, the voices of Black  Americans and all marginalized people, will never again be silenced.   Mrs. CHERFILUS-McCORMICK. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman  from New York (Ms. Clarke).
