 Mr. Chair, it is interesting what we hear from the  other side of the aisle. I will have to depart from my prepared text to  comment on what we are hearing.   I always come back to what was once put on the Black Lives Matter  website, that they wanted to get rid of the Western-prescribed nuclear  family.   There is this hostility to traditional values that is seeping into  the public schools today. We recently read a poll showing that over 60  percent of people in the baby boom generation are proud to be American,  whereas people under 25 are no longer proud to be American.   Where do they get this? They get this because some members of the  schools--too many; and you can hear it from that side of the aisle--are  obsessed with racism. This in such an open country. People are coming  here from all over the world. You would have to be blind to think that  racism is a huge problem here.   Their obsession over racism, the obsession over LGBTQ, their  hostility to guns are all things that are pounding, pounding, pounding  out of that side of the aisle, and we don't like our kids having to  pick up on that.   When parents do show up, we have now found out that the FBI may  become involved. They are so scared to death of parents sticking their  noses into their own children's business.   Our country was made for a moral and religious people. Instead, the  other side wants us to become a progressive group of people, whatever  progressive stands for. I would have to say it is hostility to religion  and an ever-growing government where the government is more and more  responsible for everything in society.   Particularly in an age in which elected officials apparently side  with the FBI getting involved with parents who stick their noses in  their children's lives, it is vital that we pass a bill today  clarifying that parents do have the right to get involved in their  children's education, and it doesn't matter what the President orders  or allows his FBI to do.
