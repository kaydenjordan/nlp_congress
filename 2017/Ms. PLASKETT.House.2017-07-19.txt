 Mr. Speaker, I am happy to congratulate the Virgin  Islands women's basketball team on winning the gold medal at the 2017  Centrobasket Championship and finishing the tournament with a 4-1  record. They beat out teams from Mexico, Central America, and the  Caribbean.   I particularly want to congratulate Natalie Day, who was named MVP,  with a tournament double-double average, 18.6 points and 11 rebounds  per game.   Good luck to the Virgin Islands women's team at the FIBA Women's  AmeriCup 2017 in Buenos Aires, Argentina. We are rooting for you.   I also want to congratulate another Virgin Islander, Rakeem  Christmas, who, for the last 2 years, has played center for the NBA's  Indiana Pacers.   I want to thank Rakeem for returning home to St. Croix repeatedly and  hosting a series of youth events, and for opening a basketball court  funded by his foundation for the Frederiksted Boys and Girls Club. He  and other athletes will coach basketball camps on St. Thomas and St.  Croix this week, with the highlight of an all-star competition on St.  Croix's Educational Complex.   Finally, to the Hillsiders, who host their annual picnic this  weekend, thank you so much for continuing the tradition of the  Hillsiders of Christiansted. I will be there to celebrate with you as  we remember culture and family, united in pride and hope.                            ____________________
