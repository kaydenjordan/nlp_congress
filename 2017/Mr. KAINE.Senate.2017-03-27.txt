 Mr. President, today I am introducing a bipartisan,  noncontroversial, technical provision pertaining to two proposed  hydroelectric projects at U.S. Army Corps of Engineers dams in  Virginia.   This bill would give the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, FERC,  authority to extend commence-construction deadlines for the 3.7 MW  project at Gathright Dam, FERC Project No. 12737, and the 1.8 MW  project at Flannagan Dam, FERC Project No. 12740. The timelines for  these projects have been set back due to challenges with securing Army  Corps permits. FERC does not oppose this legislation, as the requested  extensions are still within the overall 10-year window for extension of  licensing deadlines. There is no known local opposition.   This provision was passed by the Senate last year as part of the  Energy Policy Modernization Act, S. 2012. It was also introduced in the  House by Representative Morgan Griffith and passed the full House  separately. I am pleased to reintroduce the bill again today and hope  the Energy & Natural Resources Committee and the full Senate will  consider it soon.                                  ______                                         By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself and Ms. Harris):   S. 731.
