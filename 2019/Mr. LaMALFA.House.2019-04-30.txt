 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Arizona, Mr.  Gosar, for hosting this Special Order on this important topic and for  his very good work on the Congressional Western Caucus.   As we know, this week, the House will vote on H.R. 9, the Climate  Action Now Act. In light of the United States' incredible efforts and  achievements in becoming more energy independent and a global leader in  energy development and production, we should call it the U.S. Energy  Disadvantage Act.    This shortsighted legislation would seek to prevent President Trump  from withdrawing from the misguided 2016 Paris Agreement enacted by  President Obama. Of course, this agreement was passed without consent  from Congress and no economic impact or cost-benefit analysis.   The American people deserve to know what a plan like this is going to  cost them. According to several reports, the Paris Agreement could cost  the U.S. $250 billion and 2.7 million jobs by just 2025 and many more  jobs over a longer period, and even as much as $3 trillion by 2040.   Furthermore, this bill is completely one-sided. It received no  congressional hearings or feedback from the administration,  stakeholders, or outside experts.   Bottom line, this bill would result in an unfair economic playing  field against the United States and in favor of all the other  countries.   We have already seen the results of this agreement in the city of  Paris itself, where protests have erupted over their own gas price  increases.   Just like the Green New Deal boondoggle, enacting this legislation  would have an almost insignificant effect on decreasing global  emissions. Indeed, the United States is already by far the leader in  reducing greenhouse gas emissions and has lowered our levels of  emissions by 18 percent between 2000 and 2014, leading other major  countries and producers.   Why do we need to be in the Paris accord when we are already leading  the way? We need to drag the others along in this process and have them  do more about their own emissions, such as China, which emits more  carbon dioxide than the U.S. and the European Union combined.   Why are they let off the hook in this until the year 2030? Why is  India let off the hook until 2030? I guess American consumers and the  higher prices they are paying at the pump, especially Californians at  over $4, would like to know the answer to that question.   It is another attack by the left to undermine the responsible  production of energy in America. We don't need to be in the accord to  achieve these reductions, as we have already seen these results.   If forced to stay in the Paris climate agreement, the U.S. economy  will suffer while achieving no meaningful benefits or reduction in  global emissions.   This is like many climate change schemes that are focused on  transferring power via taxation and regulation to the government away  from the producers of this country.                                time  1445    Are we going to have the power in the hands of elected officials and  bureaucrats or the people that innovate better ways of doing things,  better forms of energy, and more efficient forms of energy, and have  them produced right here in the U.S., including California, which is a  leading producer of energy?   Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to reject this measure and  any other climate change scheme that hurts our economy and our energy  production when we are the innovators of doing things better around the  world.
