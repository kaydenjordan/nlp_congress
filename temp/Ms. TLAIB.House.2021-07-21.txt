 Madam Speaker, I still remember how I felt when I learned  that one of the worst PFAS sites in the entire country was discovered  right in my backyard in my district at the Marathon petroleum refinery.  Shock, horror, and a sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach just  happened instantly.   I called Congresswoman Dingell, because that site borders our  districts. And it is a community that continues to struggle with air  quality and clean water. That ZIP Code, where Marathon Oil Refinery is  now, that is the most polluted ZIP Code in all of the State of  Michigan. So we wonder why the forever chemical was found right there  and how it is impacting people's public health.   We are finding in Michigan, as folks know, where we lead in the  country in  [[Page H3786]]  PFAS testing, if you start looking for these toxic forever chemicals,  you are going to find them.   Madam Speaker, we have an urgent crisis in front of us that requires  swift and decisive action. So it is great news that the House is now  considering passing PFAS Action Act of 2021 today.   The bill will require EPA to take urgent PFAS action by requiring  site cleanups, identifying health risks, and developing a drinking  water standard to keep our community safe. We cannot wait another day  to start taking strong action to protect our residents from forever  chemicals.    As a Member of Congress, I was shocked--I think many of my residents  were shocked--that we weren't protected from PFAS in the Clean Air Act.  Today, we, at least, get closer to changing that. Again, our residents  deserve to live without being poisoned.
