 Mr. Chairman, I thank the ranking member. I am here to  support the Matthew Young Pollard Intelligence Authorization Act.   Mr. Chair, I was just placed on the Intel Committee a year ago  January, and I have learned an awful lot, most notably, how incredibly  difficult it really is to do the work of an intelligence officer. And I  want to, frankly, take this opportunity to thank all of the members of  the IC for their dedication and service.   For as difficult a job as it is, it is even more difficult, if not  impossible, to do it without a security clearance. In the first  quarter--you are hearing this number correctly--of this year, the  average processing time for a top security clearance was 534 days. That  backlog creates difficulties in hiring in the intelligence and defense  agencies. And, frankly, it is creating a legacy problem for our future.   And you are hearing this number correctly, too. The backlog of people  waiting for those clearances is now over 700,000, and that is what has  led the Government Accountability Office to declare this ``a high risk  issue,'' and that means that it is one of the areas that the GAO  believes is most in need of reform.   The country cannot wait 2 years to recruit top talent for our IC.  Applicants for clearance, of course, should be carefully scrutinized,  and the United States should take care that only responsible and  trustworthy parties gain access to our Nation's classified information.                                time  1400    We absolutely should guard it as a national treasure. But we need to  give the IC the people it needs to collect, process, analyze, and  distribute information, pure and simple. So the bill before us today  does, in fact, include language to address the issue of security  clearances.   As we progress forward, we must do so methodically, with feedback  from the most affected. We have a long process ahead of us, but if we  don't take steps now, frankly, pretty soon it is going to be too late.  We must address the security clearance dilemma, and we must pass this  bill to begin that process.
