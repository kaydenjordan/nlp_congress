 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.            Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.            Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act     Mr. President, last year, Congress passed the Countering  America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, which imposed tough new  sanctions on Russia, Iran, and North Korea.   There was broad bipartisan agreement on the need to put these  enhanced sanctions into place. The legislation passed in the Senate by  a vote of 98 to 2 and in the House by a vote of 419 to 3. In combining  both Chambers, the vote was 517 to 5 in favor of enacting these  sanctions. The legislation passed with a veto-proof, broad, bipartisan  majority. It can be very difficult to get 500 Members of Congress to  agree on anything, but imposing sanctions on Vladimir Putin's cronies  and those who do business with him should be a no-brainer.   Just last week, we learned that the Trump administration had chosen  not to enact these sanctions. Yet, on the same day that the Trump  administration argued the sanctions were not necessary, President  Trump's own CIA Director said that Russia will continue to attack our  democracy. He said: ``This threat is not going to go away. The Russians  have been at this a long time, and I fully expect they'll continue to  be at it.''   In January 2017, the CIA assessed: ``Russian President Vladimir Putin  ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the U.S. Presidential  election.''   In January of 2018, the CIA Director confirmed he believes that  Russia will continue to assault the 2018 elections.   Yesterday, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said that Russia is  already trying to impact the 2018 U.S. election and that it will be  difficult for the United States to preempt it.   It is clear that we have not done enough to deter Russia from  interfering in our democracy, but the Trump administration is choosing  not to put in place sanctions on Putin's cronies whom over 99 percent  of the Members of Congress supported.   I am a member of the Armed Services Committee. Earlier this week, we  received a briefing from Secretary of Defense Mattis on the recently  completed national defense strategy. That strategy identifies that  Russia is seeking to  [[Page S809]]  discredit and subvert democratic processes all across the world and to  shatter the NATO Alliance. Russia is expanding and modernizing its  nuclear arsenal and has a permanent seat on the U.N. Security Council  that provides it veto power in a critical international organization.   In quoting directly from the national defense strategy, Russia is  attempting to ``change European and Middle East security and economic  structures to its favor.'' What does it mean, and I quote again, to  attempt to ``change . . . security . . . structures to its favor''?   One example is Russia's continued support of the Assad regime in  Syria, which continues to use chemical weapons against its own people.  Russia uses its role on the Security Council to prevent the  international community from holding Assad responsible for these  obvious crimes against humanity.   At the same time that President Trump's Ambassador to the U.N., Nikki  Haley, has called Assad's use of chemical weapons against the Syrian  people a tragedy and has called on Russia to allow the Security Council  to adopt a resolution that condemns the use of chlorine gas to  suffocate children, President Trump is refusing to enact sanctions to  punish Russia.   Russia presents real challenges to the security and prosperity of the  United States. The purpose of economic sanctions is to impose a cost on  Putin and demonstrate that the United States will punish those who  threaten this country. That is why over 500 Members of Congress came  together to enact new sanctions.   If the United States cannot take meaningful action by enacting  sanctions that have been passed on a bipartisan basis, how can we  expect to take on the more vexing challenges? This one should be easy.   What kind of signal does it send to Vladimir Putin when the  administration puts the Kremlin and Russian plutocrats ahead of the  U.S. Capitol, duly elected Members of the U.S. Congress, and the  American people?   I urge President Trump to take action on behalf of the American  people and follow through on the will of Congress by enacting these  sanctions, which are already law. The administration should use the  power provided by Congress to punish Vladimir Putin, his inner circle,  and those who do business with them to enrich the Putin regime.   I thank the Presiding Officer.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.
