 Mr. Speaker, I rise for the purpose of making a  scheduling announcement.   Mr. Speaker, Members are advised that votes are no longer expected in  the House tomorrow. We still have more work to do. Don't celebrate too  early. Last votes for the week and the month are expected now at  approximately 2:50 today. We will have one more vote series today and  then we will be finished for the August work period.   Mr. Speaker, I will remind the House that just this month, this House  has completed the National Defense Authorization Act, the FAA  Reauthorization Act, the Schools Not Shelter Act, and we just passed,  of course, the Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related  Agencies Appropriations Act to make sure that we fully fund healthcare  for our veterans, we support suicide prevention, and we also fund  housing and other services for our men and women in uniform who keep us  safe.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Massachusetts (Ms.  Clark), the minority whip.    Mr. Speaker, I would agree with the gentlewoman on one  thing that she just said: The American people are watching. What the  American people just watched is every single Democrat vote against  funding veterans benefits--every single one.   Nevertheless, thank goodness this Republican majority stuck together  and put the votes on the board, $138 billion, so our veterans will get  the benefits that they deserve and earned.   If the Democrats are going to be extreme and walk away from that  responsibility, we will be here standing to make the call, to make the  tough votes, and to get that work done as the Appropriations Committee  has done over and over again on bills that in committee Democrats have  walked away from over and over again. So it is a little rich to  complain about going home. We could stay here and watch you vote  against every single other appropriations bill.   We are going to continue the negotiations during the August recess to  make sure we get back to funding the priorities of the Nation.   By the way, Mr. Speaker, when I talk about funding the priorities of  the Nation, let's talk about our Nation's defense, as we just funded  our Nation's veterans.   Let's get back to funding things that actually help our military  focus on the threats from China, not teaching hatred of America from  within. Yes, we defunded that.   So, Mr. Speaker, we will continue to do our job through the next  weeks and months. We invite all to come to work, as we have, to try to  come to an agreement, not just to vote ``no,'' but to come to an  agreement to solve these problems and to pass these bills. If both  sides won't, we still will do that work.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Massachusetts (Ms.  Clark).    Once again, Mr. Speaker, it is interesting that the  other side would talk about cutting healthcare benefits when we just  had a bill to fund healthcare benefits to the tune of $138 billion, and  every Democrat voted ``no.'' We passed the bill with Republican votes.   We will continue to do our work. We will continue standing up to the  extremists on the left who want to bring our country to a socialist  direction with lies and misrepresentations. We heard it. They said that  benefits would be cut. We just passed a bill that strengthened those  benefits. They voted ``no,'' so maybe that means they wanted to cut  those benefits.   We didn't. We stood in the brink, and we voted to support our  veterans.   We are going to continue negotiations during this work period to keep  working to get the job done and to work for the people who sent us  here; not to work for the people who want to change this country to  something that is unrecognizable in socialist nations.   Let's stand up for America. Let's keep getting the job done. We have  more work to do.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
