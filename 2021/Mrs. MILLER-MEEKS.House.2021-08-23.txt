 Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak on the  ongoing disaster in Afghanistan.   As a Vietnam-era veteran, I have seen the outcome of a poorly  executed withdrawal, with tragic images of our allies hanging off of  aircraft.   The scene that unfolded at Hamid Karzai Airport in Kabul last week is  a betrayal to the American military, American citizens, our Afghan  partners who aided American troops in the global war on terrorism, and  the Afghan people.   The catastrophe that we have seen over the last few weeks was  completely avoidable. We have watched as the Taliban quickly took  control of the country, released terrorists from prison, and began  implementing sharia law on those we left behind.   Just as important, we will have less safety of our homeland, and it  will have lasting repercussions.   Madam Speaker, one of the most basic things you learn in the military  is to never give your enemy the upper hand. We gave the Taliban the  upper hand when we broadcast our withdrawal plans to the world but not  to our allies and our coalition partners. The arbitrary and symbolic  timeline the administration gave to get our troops out is during the  peak of the fighting season.   The administration needs to take full responsibility for this  debacle. They are making the decisions and need to be held accountable  for those decisions. The President said that the buck stops with him,  but he has continued to point fingers and blame others.                            ____________________
