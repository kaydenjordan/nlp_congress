 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the beginning of  Diwali. Diwali is an anniversary of lights for the Sikhs, Jains, and  Hindus here in our country and around the world. It represents times  for new beginnings, and what a joyous occasion it is for new  beginnings. We certainly reflect upon that.   Families will light dozens of candles in their homes and streets to  light up the dark night.   It reminds us that light always triumphs over darkness, as Dr. Martin  Luther King was reminded as a follower of Gandhi. It is about good over  evil.   I am proud to join my colleagues in introducing a resolution  recognizing the historical and cultural significance of Diwali for all  of those who celebrate it throughout the world.   Mr. Speaker, may the festival of lights inspire us to lift up our  communities, to live with hope instead of despair, and to stand up for  what is right.   Happy Diwali.                            ____________________
