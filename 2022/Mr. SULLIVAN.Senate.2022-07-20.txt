 Madam President, I want to join my colleagues here in  an important discussion as it relates to American energy.   My colleague from the great State of Missouri said it well in so many  different ways: Now we are pleading with dictators to import more  energy. That is one element of what, certainly, has been the Biden  administration's most colossal, strategic mistake of its entire first  year in office. Trust me. There have been a lot of mistakes on the  Biden administration's watch. There has been nothing that has  undermined American interests in terms of working families, in terms of  skyrocketing inflation, in terms of national security, in terms of  energy security, and--yes, I am going to talk about it--in terms of  environmental policy for America and the world. Nothing has been more  harmful to America's interests and the interests of American working  families than the reckless policies of the Biden administration's  approach to American energy.   I have talked about this issue a lot because a lot of those policies  are zeroed in on my State and my constituents, but as many have already  said and as Senator Blunt has already said, it can be summed up, in my  view, in kind of four key areas.   No. 1, from day one, they have come in and said: We are going to  limit the production of American energy.   That is happening. It is certainly happening in Alaska. On day one,  the President made an order on ANWR. We got ANWR done in this Congress,  but he shut that down, and they are canceling lease sales. As for the  National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska, they are taking half of that off  the table. Everywhere you look, they are trying to limit the production  of American energy. That is a fact. It makes no sense, but it is a  fact. That is No. 1.   No. 2 is the slow rolling and killing of energy infrastructure, the  ability to move energy through pipelines or LNG terminals. They are  stopping it, slow rolling it, or killing it. That is a fact, OK? That  is what they have been doing from day one.   No. 3, they are going to the American financial community--John  Kerry, Gina McCarthy, and all of these far-left, crazy, policy folks-- and saying to American banks and insurance companies: Don't invest in  American energy.   This is choking off capital to this incredibly important sector of  the U.S. economy. When they are not doing that, they are appointing  senior officials--just think Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal  Reserve, the SEC Chairman--who are undertaking policies to choke off  capital to the American energy sector. That is happening.   No. 4, when they have seen prices spike and hard-working American  families paying hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars more to get to  work in their cars or trucks, the administration is going around,  begging dictators for more energy production.   This is an insult. We have the highest standards with regard to the  environment and American energy production in Alaska and in other  places. Do you think the Saudis care about their environment? Do you  think the Venezuelans care? Do you think the terrorists in Iran care?  They don't, but the administration is going and begging dictators for  more energy.   So those are the policies of the Biden administration on energy, and  we all know it is not working. It is having the predictable consequence  of driving up energy costs on all American families--and, of course,  giving pink slips to American energy workers, who I believe are heroic  workers: union workers and others--and empowering our adversaries. So  that is what is happening.   Today, the President is in Boston, so I want to talk about a couple  of policies--energy policies--emanating from people and the communities  of Boston that further show just how irrational the far-left Democratic  Party is on energy.   Let me first talk about this issue, which I like to trot out a lot,  on this chart. This is a factual chart of emission changes from major  economies in the world from 2005 to the present. You don't hear about  this a lot, but take a look. Take a look at this chart.   What does it show?   Of all of the major economies in the world, the one economy with the  biggest reduction in greenhouse gas emissions is America, the United  States of America, by far. Take a look. We have reduced emissions since  2005 by almost 15 percent. EU didn't do that. Germany didn't do that.  Japan didn't do that. And here you go: In China, there is a new coal  plant every couple of days, it seems. In India, it is the same thing.   Why am I bringing out this chart? A, people need to know that we are  the leader; we are not the bad guy. I know John Kerry keeps thinking we  are the bad guy; he goes around telling everybody we are. We are not.  If every other country in the world had emissions profiles like we had,  you would see a much, much cleaner and less emitting planet. That is a  fact. So let me talk about a couple of these policies.   John Kerry, the climate envoy, has been reported as going to certain  countries in Asia, saying: You know, we really don't like hydrocarbons  in America, so don't buy any of that American LNG.   What? We are paying this guy's salary to say that? Whose side is he  on?   By the way, exporting clean-burning American LNG to places like India  or China or Japan is exactly what we need to do to reduce global  emissions. So you have got this one guy out there--and I am not sure  why he is being paid by the U.S. Government; he should be paid by the  Chinese Communist Party Government. There are recent press reports that  John Kerry's private jet--that he flies all around the world on--last  year, emitted over 300 tons of CO2.   What? Yes.   Look, he is smug, hypocritical, and his policies are hammering the  middle class--and now this. John Kerry is one of the single biggest  polluters and greenhouse gas emitters in the world for an individual.   In Boston, one of the best things the President can do today is to  either fire John Kerry or ask him to resign. That would be great. That  would probably do a lot for climate in America.  [[Page S3517]]    Let me give another policy that should be raised in Massachusetts.   Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that this Boston Globe  editorial--a very long one--from February 12, 2018, be printed in the  Record. It is called ``Our Russian `pipeline,' and its ugly toll.''   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                [Editorial: Boston Globe, February 12, 2018]                 Our Russian `Pipeline,' and Its Ugly Toll         To build the new $27 billion gas export plant on the Arctic       Ocean that now keeps the lights on in Massachusetts, Russian       firms bored wells into fragile permafrost; blasted a new       international airport into a pristine landscape of reindeer,       polar bears, and walrus; dredged the spawning grounds of the       endangered Siberian sturgeon in the Gulf of Ob to accommodate       large ships; and commissioned a fleet of 1,000-foot       icebreaking tankers likely to kill seals and disrupt whale       habitat as they shuttle cargoes of super-cooled gas bound for       Asia, Europe, and Everett.        On the plus side, though, they didn't offend Pittsfield or       Winthrop, Danvers or Groton, with even an inch of pipeline.        This winter's unprecedented imports of Russian liquefied       natural gas have already come under fire from Greater       Boston's Ukrainian-American community, because the majority       shareholder of the firm that extracted the fuel has been       sanctioned by the US government for its links to the war in       eastern Ukraine and Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea.       Last week, in response to the outcry, a group of       Massachusetts lawmakers, led by Senator Ed Markey, blasted       the shipments and called on the federal government to stop       them.        But apart from its geopolitical impact, Massachusetts'       reliance on imported gas from one of the world's most       threatened places is also a severe indictment of the state's       inward-looking environmental and climate policies. Public       officials, including Attorney General Maura Healey and       leading state senators, have leaned heavily on righteous-      sounding stands against local fossil fuel projects, with       scant consideration of the global impacts of their actions       and a tacit expectation that some other country will build       the infrastructure that we're too good for.        As a result, to a greater extent than anywhere else in the       United States, the Commonwealth now expects people in places       like Russia, Trinidad and Tobago, and Yemen to shoulder the       environmental burdens of providing natural gas that state       policy makers have showily rejected here. The old       environmentalist slogan--think globally and act locally--has       been turned inside out in Massachusetts.        But more than just traditional NIMBYism is at work in the       state's resistance to natural gas infrastructure. There's       also the $1 million the parent company of the Everett       terminal spent lobbying Beacon Hill from 2013 to 2017, amid a       push to keep out the domestic competition that's ended LNG       imports in most of the rest of the United States.        And there's a trendy, but scientifically unfounded,       national fixation on pipelines that state policy makers have       chosen to accommodate. Climate advocates, understandably       frustrated by slow progress at the federal level, have put       short-term tactical victories against fossil fuel       infrastructure ahead of strategic progress on reducing       greenhouse gas emissions, and so has Beacon Hill. They've       obsessed over stopping domestic pipelines, no matter where       those pipes go, what they carry, what fuels they displace,       and how the ripple effects of those decisions may raise       overall global greenhouse gas emissions.        The environmental movement needs a reset, and so does       Massachusetts policy. The real-world result of pipeline       absolutism in Massachusetts this winter has been to steer       energy customers to dirtier fuels like coal and oil,       increasing greenhouse gas emissions. And the state is now in       the indefensible position of blocking infrastructure here,       while its public policies create demand for overseas fossil       fuel infrastructure like the Yamal LNG plant--a project       likely to inflict far greater near and long-term harm to the       planet.        ``ALL IS GLOOM AND ETERNAL SILENCE,'' wrote a 19th century       English traveler in an awestruck account of the Kara Sea,       then still a largely uncharted domain of ice floes and fog.       Though more powerful vessels and melting ice have enabled       more human activity in the Arctic, the area around Yamal, an       indigenous name meaning ``edge of the world,'' remains a       refuge. An estimated 2,700 to 3,500 polar bears live in the       Kara Sea region, along with the ring seals that form a       crucial part of their diet.        Opening a gas export facility in such a harsh environment       required overcoming both political obstacles--the US       sanctions delayed financing--and staggering triumphs of       industrial engineering by a workforce that reportedly reached       15,000 people. Dredgers scooped away 1.4 billion cubic feet       of seabed to make room for the ships and built a giant LNG       facility on supports driven into the permafrost, all in       temperatures that can plunge to less than minus 50 degrees       Fahrenheit.        The oil and gas industry poses serious threats, especially       in an area like the Arctic that recovers slowly from damage,       and in 2016 the Russian branch of the World Wildlife Fund       issued a report warning of Yamal LNG's potential dangers.       White toothed whales, a near-threatened species, breed in the       vicinity of the facility, and the noise from shipping and the       presence of more giant vessels ``may force toothed whales to       leave this habitat, which is crucial for their living,       feeding, and reproduction.''        The giant ``Yamalmax'' ice breaking tankers, longer than       three football fields and designed to mow through ice up to       six feet deep, are also ``extremely bad news for any ice-      associated mammals that should be in the vicinity of their       path,'' said Sue Wilson, who leads an international research       group based at the University of Leeds in the United Kingdom.       The group has recently published a paper in the journal       Biological Conservation on the impact of icebreakers on seal       mothers and pups in the Caspian Sea and is currently studying       shipping impacts in the Arctic.        ``The captain is unlikely to notice--or even be able to       see--seals in the vessel's path ahead,'' she said. ``Even if       the captain does notice, the fact that the ship is designed       to proceed at a steady pace means that it is unlikely to       attempt to stop for seals or maneuver around them, even if       the ship can be slowed or stopped in time.''        Advocates also worry that increased Arctic production and       shipping will hurt indigenous people; sever reindeer       migration routes; import invasive species to an environment       ill-equipped to deal with them; and introduce the very       remote, but potentially cataclysmic, danger of an LNG       explosion.        Finally, the gas pumped there will contribute to global       climate change. In some parts of the world, especially China,       LNG may provide climate benefits by displacing dirtier coal.       If LNG displaces gas carried by pipeline, however, the math       works out differently: Liquefied natural gas generally       creates more emissions, since the process of cooling it to       minus 260 degrees Fahrenheit and then shipping and       regasifying it requires more energy than pumping natural gas       through all but the longest and leakiest pipelines.        ``The bottom line is that because of the nature of the       liquefaction process, LNG is fairly carbon intensive,'' said       Gavin Law, the head of gas, LNG, and carbon consulting for       the energy consulting firm Wood Mackenzie. The exact       difference depends on factors like how much pipelines leak,       carbon impurities in the gas, age of equipment, and distance       shipped, but generally LNG produces 5 to 10 percent more       emissions over its whole life cycle from start to finish, he       said.        From a planetary perspective, it doesn't matter where those       emissions occur: Whether from the plant in Yamal, or the       power plant in Everett, they have the same impact. The       science should make the state's decisions straightforward.        ``Natural gas has shown itself to be an important bridge to       a clean energy future,'' said Ernest J. Moniz, the former       secretary of energy in the Obama administration. ``For New       England, expanding the pipeline capacity from the       Marcellus''--the area of shale gas production in       Pennsylvania--``makes the most sense.''        ``Life cycle emissions for LNG imports to Boston certainly       are higher than they would be for more Marcellus gas,'' he       said.        But the upstream emissions typically don't show up on the       books of states like Massachusetts, which judge the success       of their climate efforts based only on how much greenhouse       gas they emit within their own borders.        That's an accounting fiction. But it's a convenient one for       lawmakers who've bowed to pressure to legislate based on       what's visible inside the Commonwealth's own borders.        FROM MASHPEE TO SPRINGFIELD, Taunton to Sudbury, the       message was clear: To fight climate change, the state       shouldn't allow more fossil fuel pipelines or other       infrastructure in Massachusetts.        That's what state senators Marc Pacheco and Jamie Eldridge,       the heads of the state Senate's Committee on Global Warming       and Climate Change, heard when they conducted a listening       tour of the state--whose results they released on the same       day the Russian gas was unloading in Everett--to help prepare       a new energy bill.        The resulting legislation was introduced this Monday. It       contained many fine ideas, including boosting the state's       renewable energy requirements. But it also would raise       obstacles to pipelines that would lock in the state's       reliance on foreign gas, with its higher carbon footprint.        In an interview, Pacheco said ``Obviously any fossil fuel       investments are problematic,'' no matter where they occur,       but that ``we have no control over what happens in Russia or       anywhere else in the world.'' Eldridge said, ``I think this       bill takes a big step to preventing pipelines,'' and also       expressed concern about the LNG the state imports instead.       ``I think activists need to think about where a large amount       of this gas is coming from, and that could be something the       Legislature could take a look at'' in the future, he said.        Theirs isn't the first analysis to miss the larger picture.        In 2015, the Conservation Law Foundation, a prominent       environmental advocacy group in Boston, released a report       dismissing the need for new pipeline capacity in New England,       and called on the region to rely on a ``winter-only LNG       'pipeline,' ``including imported gas, to meet its winter       energy needs instead.  [[Page S3518]]         After the first shipload of Russian gas arrived, David       Ismay, a lawyer with the group, stood by the recommendation       and shrugged off the purchase of Russian gas from the Arctic       as simply the nature of buying on the worldwide market. ``I       think it's important to understand that LNG is a globally       traded commodity,'' he said in an interview with the Globe.        The foundation, he said, hadn't compared the overall       greenhouse gas emissions from LNG to pipeline gas from the       Marcellus to determine which was worse for the climate, nor       had it factored the impact on the Arctic of gas production       into its policy recommendations.        But a state policy that doesn't ask any questions about its       fuel until the day the tanker floats into the Harbor       abdicates the state's responsibility to own up to all       consequences of its energy use--and mitigate the ones that it       can.        WHEN AN ICEBREAKER BEARS DOWN on a mother seal during the       springtime breeding season, the terrified animal tries to       scurry away with her pup. The two may leave a trail of urine       and feces on the ice, telltale signs of their distress. Even       if the animals survive the collision, the disruption may       separate the mother and pup, leading to the pup's death.        Conscientious companies can minimize the cruel realities of       global shipping--or conscientious governments can force them       to. American law, for instance, requires ships to maintain a       safe distance from seals and walruses in ice habitats.       Wilson, the seal researcher, also suggested that icebreakers       can change routes to avoid known seal habitats, especially       during the breeding season, and carry trained observers       onboard to advise vessel captains and record any adverse       impact, particularly on mothers and young.        The Globe attempted to contact Sovcomflot, the Russian       state-owned shipper in St. Petersburg that handled the first       leg of the first shipment from Siberia to Everett, about what       policies, if any, it employs to avoid killing seals and other       wildlife, and whether it would halt LNG shipments during the       spring as mother seals nurse their pups in the Arctic.        As of Monday night, it had not responded to e-mails.        The policy of Massachusetts, apparently, is to hope that       the Russians are on top of it--and that the world beyond the       state's borders manages the impacts of fossil fuel production       and transportation that the Commonwealth buys and uses, but       considers itself too pure to handle itself.        As of Monday night, the next shipment of Russian gas was       anchored about 70 miles off Gloucester.     Again, these are far-left policies that are having a  negative impact on actual environment and climate issues. This is the  Boston Globe editorial page, not some rightwing editorial page, and  they are writing about how the Massachusetts State legislature said: We  are not going to have any pipelines coming across Massachusetts to be  able to take gas from Pennsylvania and let people in Boston use it.   Here is the editorial page on Massachusetts' reliance on imported  gas. So what happens? They are importing all of their gas from Russia  in the Arctic. How does that help America? You have American gas from  American pipelines that is produced by Americans, with the highest  environmental standards, coming across Massachusetts to Boston.   No. The Massachusetts State legislature says: We are too good for  that. We are not going to build pipelines.   So what do they do? They import all of their gas from Russia.   This is an editorial that says: This policy is insane, and that is,  in essence, the definition of what we are seeing by the Biden  administration, by John Kerry, and by the Massachusetts State  legislature--all of these woke pronouncements that actually have the  impact of degrading our environment, empowering dictators, laying off  Americans, and raising the price of energy on our economy, small  businesses, and working families.   So I am hopeful that today, in Boston, the President starts to get  serious about American energy policy and that he starts to reverse his  administration's focus on shutting down the production of American  energy, on permitting pipelines and infrastructure, and on helping to  finance energy projects and production. That is the reversal he could  make and announce today. That would help the American people. It would  help my constituents.   Unfortunately, I think that it is unlikely to happen. The people of  our great Nation are going to continue to suffer, and the environment  is going to continue to suffer because of these policies on energy that  undermine American interests everywhere you look.   I yield the floor.    Thank you to my friends from the great State of Utah  and the great State of Florida, Senator Scott and Senator Lee.   Mr. President, I want to explain to any American who is watching just  what happened here because, to be honest, it is kind of shocking what  just took place.   Senator Scott came down to the floor. He had a bill, S. 3086.  Normally when you have a bill that is considered pretty  noncontroversial, you can come down and do what is called a unanimous  consent, which is you ask the Senate: Do you want to pass the bill? And  if anyone objects, they actually have to come down and object in the  Senate Chamber.   So what does S. 3086 bill do? Here is the language: ``to require the  Energy Information Administration to submit to Congress and make  publicly available an annual report on Federal Agency policies and  regulations and Executive orders that have increased or may increase  energy prices in the United States.'' That is it. That is it. That is  the bill. It is one page--less than one page. It is two paragraphs.   All we were doing was asking, why are energy prices in America going  through the roof, and is the Federal Government contributing to that  through its actions and regulations? It is a really important question.  Why is it an important question? It is an important question because  when you get out of this bubble in DC and you go home--like I was just  home in Alaska last weekend--energy costs and inflation are the No. 1  issue hurting American families--the No. 1 issue. So shouldn't we in  the Senate want to know why it is happening?   Now, look, what else happened here--a little bit of inside baseball  in the Senate--when a Senator comes down and objects to a UC, usually  he gives a strong reason why--strong: Here is my reason why this bill  is bad for the country, and I am going to object.   You may have seen my colleague object and say ``I am getting the heck  out of here; I am not going to explain this'' because there is no  reason to object to this--none. So he objected and left. He didn't try  to defend objecting to this, because every American wants to know.   It is the biggest issue back home, but here is another reason we need  the bill: because this President has come up with excuse after excuse  after excuse on why energy costs since he got into office have gone  through the roof. Let me give you a couple of examples.   He first said: Well, we are emerging from the pandemic, and the  supply chain couldn't keep up with demand.   All right, if that is really true, let the Energy Information  Administration--of the Biden administration, by the way--see if that is  one of the reasons.   OK. Then he said: Well, shoot, the pandemic is kind of over so it is  Putin's invasion of Ukraine that is driving the increase in energy  prices. Putin's unprovoked, brutal war--which it is unprovoked and  brutal--has led to higher energy prices.   And President Biden then started to say it is Putin's price hike. No  one is buying that one either because energy prices were spiking way  before the brutal invasion of Ukraine.   So then the President started saying: Well, it is COVID and Putin.  OK. Then he started blaming the oil companies. Then he started to say:  Well, we have all these amazing permits that we want the oil companies  drilling on, but they are not using them.   So we need Senator Scott's legislation because the Biden  administration, the President himself, has put out all these ideas on  why Americans are getting crushed by inflation and high costs at the  pump. Yet the one thing the President hasn't done, has never talked  about, is he hasn't looked internally and said: Hmm, maybe it is my own  administration's policies that are driving up energy costs. Maybe. By  the way, it is not maybe; it is certainly. And my colleagues have  talked about this. Heck, I talked about this earlier today. I talk  about it every day because it is crushing my home State and my  constituents.   But what we want the Energy Information Administration to look at is  possibly these reasons: Day 1, this administration came in and said: We  are going to limit production of American energy.   Anyone who went to econ 101 in college knows that when you start to  limit supply, prices go up. Well, that is a culprit.   No. 2, from day 1, they said: We are going to shut down, kill, and  delay moving energy through infrastructure--pipelines, LNG terminals.  They are doing that all the time. So that is a policy, those are  Executive orders limiting the ability to move energy. That sends up  costs.   No. 3 is that they have actively gone to the American financial  sector--the Biden administration--and told them not to invest in  American energy, choking off capital. That increases prices.   So Senator Scott's bill would simply ask the experts in the Federal  Government, the Energy Information Administration, to just take a look:  What is driving up the cost of American energy? What is crushing  middle-class working families?   And the reason my colleague objected and then ran off the floor  without saying anything is because everybody here knows what the answer  is going to be: Joe Biden has done this. It is his policies that are  driving up energy costs.   And here is the thing that Senator Lee touched on, and this is the  thing that should scare everybody. It is likely purposeful. Pain is the  point. They are all talking about this wonderful, glorious transition.  Gina McCarthy talks about: Hey, if the prices go up, it will accelerate  the transition to renewables. They don't give a damn about the people  who are suffering. It is all this green utopia stuff.   All we are asking for is what is driving up the cost of energy on the  backs of working-class Americans? That is it. A two-paragraph bill, and  my colleagues came and objected to it. And  [[Page S3524]]  every American should know this. They don't want you to know what we  all know, which is this: The pain at the pump is the purposeful  policies of the Biden administration, and the American people are  paying for it.   We want the Federal Government to look into the details of this, and  the Democrats were just now objecting to that transparent information  request. And, in my view, it is shameful.   I yield the floor.
