 Madam President, I rise today in support of my bipartisan  legislation to protect funding for hunter safety programs.   Senator Cornyn is going to make a UC here in a bit. I just want to  thank him and Senator Murkowski for the work that they have done on  this bill. It has been incredible.   You know, in Montana and across rural America, our schools have long  offered hunter safety classes and taught our kids gun safety and  personal responsibility, but recently the Biden administration and the  bureaucrats here in this city who really don't understand rural America  very well decided to block funding for these important education  programs.   I want to be clear. That was a poor decision that will hurt thousands  of students who benefit from these resources and these programs every  year. That is why I am pushing for this bipartisan fix that would  require the Department of Education to restore a school district's  ability to use Federal dollars for school archery or gun safety or  hunter education programs.   Look, folks, when Republicans and Democrats came together to pass the  Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, we did so to ensure that our kids are  safe when they go to school. This commonsense bill will make sure that  we stay true to that intent by educating future generations on the  importance of responsible gun ownership and hunting, which will only  make our students and our communities safer. It will protect Montana's  longstanding and proud tradition of hunting and shooting sports, which  are essential to Montana's way of life.   I would urge my colleagues in this room today to support this  bipartisan solution.   With that, I yield the floor.
