 Madam Speaker, I am just heart sick today to hear some  of my colleagues talking about how they were celebrating the 44th  anniversary of Roe v. Wade. That is 60 million babies--little girls,  little boys--who have been aborted and no longer have a chance to live.  We could have had perhaps a cure for cancer or Alzheimer's. Who knows  what the potential of those 60 million lives could have been.   So it is hard to hear my colleagues talk about a celebration of that  and using the terminology that this bill deals with abortion care.  Abortion isn't care and abortion isn't services. It is taking a life.   This bill does nothing to change Roe v. Wade, although I wish it  could, but it simply says that taxpayers do not have to participate in  it. The taxpayers all across this country who believe that every life  is precious work hard and send in their money every April 15. They  entrust it to us, their elected officials. We have national security  issues, we have roads, we have education. They don't want to see it go  to something like taking a life through abortion.   So this is what we are doing today, simply making permanent a policy  that we have had to put in as an amendment to appropriations every year  and fight for. This is just making sure that, here in Washington, in  America, the taxpayers invest in women's health care and are not  investing in abortion.   We should be about saving lives, not taking them. That is what this  bill does. I urge my colleagues to support it.
