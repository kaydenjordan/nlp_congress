 Madam Speaker, Lunar New Year is a time of celebration for  so many people in Los Angeles and millions around the world.   As we welcome the Year of the Tiger--a symbol of bravery--we honor  the history and heritage of the Asian Pacific Islander communities  across America and stand in support and active defense in the face of  challenges,  [[Page H922]]  like the rise of anti-Asian violence and hate.   Over the past 2 years, I have been greatly alarmed and concerned by  what I have seen and heard from businessowners, restaurant owners,  teachers, parents, and young people in my district and across the  country.   To honor the celebration of the Lunar New Year, I have cosponsored  legislation led by my colleague Grace Meng to make Lunar New Year a  Federal holiday in the U.S.   I want to wish everyone warm wishes of health, success, and happiness  in the years ahead. Though many were not able to gather in person with  their families to celebrate this week, we continue to forge ahead in  our recovery from the pandemic.                            ____________________
