 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 1161 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 1161         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to take from the Speaker's table the bill (H.R. 925)       to extend the authorization of appropriations for allocation       to carry out approved wetlands conservation projects under       the North American Wetlands Conservation Act through fiscal       year 2024, with the Senate amendments thereto, and to       consider in the House, without intervention of any point of       order or question of consideration, a single motion offered       by the chair of the Committee on Appropriations or her       designee that the House: (1) concur in the Senate amendment       to the title; and (2) concur in the Senate amendment to the       text with an amendment consisting of the text of Rules       Committee Print 116-66. The Senate amendments and the motion       shall be considered as read. The motion shall be debatable       for two hours equally divided and controlled by the chair and       ranking minority member of the Committee on Appropriations.       The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the       motion to its adoption without intervening motion or demand       for division of the question.    Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Cole), the  ranking member of the Rules Committee, pending which I yield myself  such time as I may consume. During consideration of this resolution,  all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only.                                time  1630                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  be given 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, the Rules Committee met and reported a  rule, House Resolution 1161, providing for consideration of the Senate  amendments to H.R. 925, America's Conservation Enhancement Act.   The rule makes in order a single motion offered by the chair of the  Committee on Appropriations or her designee that the House: One, concur  in the Senate amendment to the title; and, two, concur in the Senate  amendment to the text with an amendment consisting of the text of Rules  Committee Print 116-66, which is identical to H.R. 8406, the Heroes  Act.   Finally, the rule provides for 2 hours of debate equally divided and  controlled by the chair and the ranking minority member of the  Committee on Appropriations.   Mr. Speaker, we are here today because the American people are tired  of waiting.   It has been more than 4 months since this House passed the Heroes Act  in response to the coronavirus pandemic to help our first responders,  healthcare workers, struggling businesses, and local governments.   This bill passed this House on May 15, Mr. Speaker. But what did the  Senate do, Mr. Speaker? Nothing.   They apparently couldn't be bothered to bring this bill up for a vote  in over 4 months, but it took Mitch McConnell roughly 80 minutes after  Justice Ginsburg passed away to announce a vote on a Supreme Court  nominee.   Now, you can't make this stuff up. Something is terribly, terribly  wrong here.   More than 205,000 Americans have lost their lives due to coronavirus  and more than 7 million more have been affected.   Millions of people are out of work, small businesses are struggling,  and some have had to shut their doors forever. Our economy hasn't taken  a hit like this since the Great Depression. Many families are  struggling every day to make ends meet. Kids are going hungry.   This pandemic isn't going to just disappear overnight, as the  President has suggested. It is going to take a whole-of-government  response for quite some time, and that requires Congress to act.   The Republicans in the Senate may be able to sleep at night telling  the American people to wait and then wait some more and then wait some  more  [[Page H5091]]  while they rubber stamp another judge, but I cannot ask our people, our  communities, our small businesses, our workers and their families to  wait any longer. No one in this majority can.   Our country is suffering, and our people are in pain. That is why we  have tried over these past 4 months to strike a fair and commonsense  deal with Senate Republicans, but they couldn't even come to an  agreement on a package among themselves. Republicans are fighting with  Republicans over there, so they just abandoned doing anything at all.   Doing nothing is unconscionable.   I am proud that our Speaker, Nancy Pelosi, has never given up. She  has spoken with Treasury Secretary Mnuchin again and again and again  and again trying to come up with an agreement.   Her offer to this administration was simple: let's meet halfway.  Let's take the $3.4 trillion in relief contained in the initial Heroes  Act and reduce it by $1.2 trillion. We would still fund our first  responders, our small businesses, and our State and local governments,  but we would meet Republicans in the middle. We would come down $1  trillion and they would come up $1 trillion.   That is called compromise. That is what you do, and it is what you  have to do from time to time in divided government. The bill included  in this rule, H.R. 8406, reflects that give-and-take.   There is funding here for State and local governments to avert  layoffs and continue critical services; for coronavirus testing,  tracing, and treatment; for our hospitals and for our healthcare  providers; for continuing unemployment insurance; and for families to  pay for necessities like food, utilities, and rent during this  pandemic.   This revamped Heroes Act totals $2.2 trillion. Many Democrats,  including myself, favored the original larger bill. My friends on the  other side wanted something much smaller. But disagreement should never  result in inaction.   One in four children in this country are at risk of going hungry this  year because of this pandemic, Mr. Speaker. The lines for food banks in  some communities already go for miles.   People are hurting today, right now. We all know that. And if you  don't know that, you don't go back to your district.   We all know what it takes to truly do something about it.   We have pleaded with the Senate to take this bill up for months, we  have negotiated over and over again, and today we are back with a  compromise proposal.   The only question, Mr. Speaker, is whether my Republican colleagues  are finally ready to take ``yes'' for an answer.   On behalf of the most vulnerable among us, those who are out of work,  going hungry, and struggling to get by, I pray the answer is finally  ``yes.''   Once again, Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues, all my colleagues, to  support this rule and the underlying Heroes Act so we can finally,  finally get relief to where it is so badly needed.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I just want to say that when my friend says this is a  Democratic wish list of things, I mean, the fact of the matter is, we  are trying to respond to a pandemic. We haven't had to deal with  something like this since 1918.                                time  1645    It has basically impacted our economy in ways that have resulted in  millions of people losing their jobs. We have schools that have not  fully reopened because it is not safe. We have had shortages of PPE. We  don't have adequate testing. I can go on and on and on.   But the wish list that this bill addresses has things like we support  small businesses. We improve the Paycheck Protection Program. That is  hardly--I would like to think Republicans share that, too.   Additional assistance for the airline industry workers: Is that so  controversial?   More funds to bolster education and childcare: Given what we are  going through, is that controversial?   We honor our heroes. We provide assistance to State, local,  territorial, and Tribal governments that desperately need funds to pay  first responders. Is that a point of contention?   It supports testing, tracing, and treatment; provides additional  direct payments for those who are unemployed; protects payrolls;  ensures worker safety; preserves health coverage; restores unemployment  benefits; bolsters housing assistance; strengthens food security at a  time when a record number of Americans are going hungry.   Again, just to put this in context, we passed something 4 months ago.  Four months ago, we sent it over to the Senate. Now, they should have  passed something, and then we could have negotiated the differences.  That is the way it usually works.   The Republicans are fighting with Republicans over in the Senate.  There is a big chunk of Republicans who don't want to appropriate one  more penny for the American people. No, they don't have the time. But  they have the time to rush through another Supreme Court Justice, in  record time.   I guess what is so frustrating is that some of my friends act like  this is not an emergency, like, you know, we can just kind of go along  and everything will be fine. This is an emergency.   We haven't faced a crisis like this in our lifetime, and if we don't  have an all-out comprehensive approach, not a scalpel approach--it is  not just about PPP. It is also about our schools, our healthcare  workers, our first responders. It is about a whole bunch of stuff. But  if we don't have an all-comprehensive approach, then this economy is  going to have a very difficult time recovering.   It is just frustrating to me. I was home in Massachusetts. I did  tours of restaurants in my district, and people have been visiting some  of our restaurants, eating outside. But in Massachusetts, we get  winters. It is going to get cold soon, and pretty soon, people are not  going to want to eat outside. They won't be able to.   If people don't feel safe going inside because, as we are seeing now  in a number of States that aren't following some of the recommendations  of the CDC, we see case numbers going up. So if we had another surge,  how are these restaurants going to survive? They are going to shut  their doors forever.   We have an opportunity to provide a lifeline until we get through all  of this. I mean, there are so many aspects of our economy that have  been impacted by this, so many people who are just struggling to get  by.   It is unconscionable to me that this hasn't occupied a greater sense  of urgency in the Republican leader's mind over in the Senate. I just  don't get it. It really is so disappointing to me.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Before I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas, I just want to say a  couple of things for the Record.   I guess the new Republican tactic--if anybody watched the debate  yesterday--is to try to twist and turn and confuse people.   The gentlewoman implied that this somehow defunds police. I mean,  there is $436 billion in here to provide assistance directly to State  and local governments to support the police.   If my friend was so interested in supporting the police, she should  know that the bill that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell brought  up provided no money for State and local governments. I mean nothing.   In fact, that bill didn't provide money for a lot of the most needy  people in this country who are suffering as a result of this virus: no  money for nutrition to help our families who are going hungry, no money  for a lot of the priorities that I know are priorities not only in my  district but all over the country.   The bottom line is, my friends can come up with excuse after excuse  after excuse to not support this. But by not supporting it, we are not  supporting the American people at a time of desperate need.   Again, we have come down $1.3 trillion from what we originally put  forward, not because we think it is necessarily the right thing to do,  because the need is so great. We are doing it to try to find ways to  accommodate, to move this process forward. And obviously, my friends  make up ways to justify their voting ``no'' on this.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms.  Jackson Lee).    I yield the gentlewoman from Texas an additional 1  minute.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   The gentleman would be happy to know that, in this bill that we are  bringing before here, we have most of what he requested but more. Our  PPP language is more expansive, because a lot of businesses didn't  qualify under the old formula.   But I do have to say that it really pains me that my friends don't  understand that it is not just about small businesses. It is about our  cities and towns and our first responders.   We have communities that are about to fire firefighters and police  officers. Isn't that important to my friends?   Or helping to pay for schools to reopen safely or to be able to help  kids get an education remotely or in a hybrid way, doesn't that fall on  the top list of my Republican friends?   Healthcare coverage, the airline industry, which is about to lay off  thousands of workers, we provide some help for them, but yet that  doesn't make the cut.   So, yes, we can have a scalpel approach to this. We will do a little  bit here and maybe we will do a little bit there, but that fails to  recognize the severity of the crisis that we are now in.   Open your eyes and look at what is happening in this country, in  large part, due to the mismanagement of this President, which is  unconscionable.   But here in Congress, we can't deal with him. We can't fix the way he  approaches his job. But we can provide direct resources to businesses  and to local governments that can help keep our economy afloat until we  can get by this.   Madam Speaker, I yield 3\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from Oregon  (Mr. Blumenauer).    Madam Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Oregon an  additional 1 minute.  [[Page H5095]]         Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, I have served in this House for many years. I have  been here through unimaginable tragedies, like September 11. Every time  this Nation has been challenged, we came together--not as Democrats or  Republicans, but as Americans. Never could I have imagined that after a  shock like the coronavirus, that has taken more than 205,000 lives,  that we would struggle to reach a compromise.   The House did its job more than 4 months ago when we passed the  original Heroes Act; the Senate abdicated its responsibility. But we  have not walked away. We have not stopped trying to help protect the  lives and livelihood of people that we represent. We are back today  with a bill that puts on paper the compromises that we are willing to  make, not to get a win for one side or the other, but to help the  American people in the middle of a pandemic. That is what this is all  about.   Madam Speaker, to my friends on the other side of the aisle, I beg,  please don't abandon the American people. Don't throw up your hands and  walk away because you don't like every line of this bill. Take ``yes''  for an answer.   Madam Speaker, this bill doesn't Federalize elections. It provides  safeguards for elections and provides funding to States to be able to  carry out elections safely in the middle of a pandemic. To object over  the fact that this bill protects Americans from losing their health  coverage is startling to me, although it shouldn't be, because the  President, as we speak, is in court trying to get the Affordable Care  Act repealed outright, where millions of people would lose their  healthcare, people with preexisting conditions would lose that  protection, and you wouldn't be able to keep your kids on your  insurance until they are 26.   Think about it: In the middle of a pandemic, that is the priority of  this White House--to rip healthcare away from people. It takes my  breath away what a disconnect there is about what the American people  need and what some of my friends' priorities are.   Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join us in compromising to get  something done. I get it. This is an election year and people are used  to running to their political corners, but this crisis demands more  than just business as usual. It demands action. And it demands more  than a scalpel approach: ``Well, let me do a little bit here,'' or  ``let me do a little bit there.''   I am told that the White House doesn't want to fund nutrition  programs to help make sure that no one in this country goes hungry. I  can't believe anybody would take that position, but we are told that is  one of the hot button items that people don't want to fund, that it is  one of the Democratic priorities that is so controversial.   Really? Even before this pandemic, we had 40 million people in this  country who didn't know where their next meal was going to come from;  and every year it is a battle to make sure they don't cut nutrition  programs. But now we are in a pandemic and hunger has increased  dramatically in this country. Every one of us should not only be  concerned about that, but we should be ashamed that that is a reality  in the richest country in the history of the world.   Madam Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to come together. This is an  [[Page H5096]]  opportunity to meet this moment. Vote ``yes'' on this rule and on the  underlying bill.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Cole is as follows:                     Amendment to House Resolution 1161         At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 2. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution, the       House shall proceed to the consideration in the House of the       bill (H.R. 8265 to amend the Small Business Act and the       CARES Act to establish a program for second draw loans and       make other modifications to the paycheck protection program,       and for other purposes. All points of order against       consideration of the bill are waived. The bill shall be       considered as read. All points of order against provisions in       the bill are waived. The previous question shall be       considered as ordered on the bill and on any amendment       thereto to final passage without intervening motion except:       (1) one hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the       chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Small       Business; and (2) one motion to recommit.        Sec. 3. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 8265.    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and  I move the previous question on the resolution.
