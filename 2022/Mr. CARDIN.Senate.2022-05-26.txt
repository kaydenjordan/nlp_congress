 Madam President, another mass shooting, another  elementary school; 19 children, ages 7 through 10, gunned down; two  adults killed. They were in our schools--an elementary school, a place  that parents send their children expecting it to be a safe zone where  they can learn and interact with other children and be safe from things  like being attacked and shot. An elementary school we are talking  about, the anguish of the families who have lost their children or lost  their loved ones.   Children who witnessed this will be traumatized for life, scarred by  what happened in Texas.   And then last week, we saw in Buffalo 10 people gunned down while  shopping in a grocery store, very much racially motivated by a White  supremacist. This is happening throughout our country.   We have had gun violence in Baltimore. A few years ago, we had gun  violence at Great Mills High School in Maryland. We are seeing this  happen over and over and over again.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        On page S2732, May 26, 2022, first column, the following  appears: A few years ago, we had gun violence at Great Oaks School  in Maryland.      The online Record has been corrected to read: A few years ago,  we had gun violence at Great Mills High School in Maryland.    ========================= END NOTE =========================      I and all Marylanders and Americans are sad. We are angry; we are  fearful; and we are frustrated. Yes, we have to deal with the mental  health issues here; there is no question about that in my mind. Let me  just point out for my colleagues that I join with Senator Wyden and  Senator Crapo and Senator Thune in releasing the draft on the  telehealth recommendations as part of the mental health work that is  being done by the Senate Finance Committee. Our Presiding Officer has  been one of the leaders on this issue. We recognize we have to do more  for mental health.   Our draft discussion documents are dealing with telehealth. We really  learned during COVID-19 how valuable telehealth is for access to care.  Individuals who could not get to their healthcare providers were able  to do that through telehealth services. We also recognize how valuable  telehealth services are in regard to mental health and behavioral  health. It was gaining access that could have been denied before. This  is all-important that we move forward on these recommendations. And we  are looking at ways that we remove obstacles in the way for people in  our community to be able to get telehealth services, removing some of  the restrictions of the law prior to COVID-19 to make it easier not  only for public insurance programs but private insurance programs to  provide for telehealth.   By the way, as you know, we have other task forces that are working  in regard to children's mental health needs. All of that is important.  We need to move forward on extending the resources and access to mental  health services so we can identify people in need, give them the  services they need, and protect our communities.   But we need to do much more than mental health services in regard to  protecting Americans from gun violence. Let me quote from the Baltimore  Sun's editorial this morning. It is titled ``Real Insanity Is Doing  Nothing About Assault Weapons Again.''         The terrible tragedy raises all kinds of questions from the       mental health of the killer, the inadequacy of community-      based psychiatric care and the bullying by classmates that       might have contributed to his instability to the failure of       those around him to recognize this potential threat. But one       element stands out above so many others: easy access to       assault weapons.    This editorial was clearly done, I should have mentioned, with the  Texas tragedy that occurred this week.   The United States is an outlier among the nations of the world. We  stand alone on the number of guns we have per capita and amount of gun  violence. That is not a category that we want to lead the world in, and  we do. We have to take action. In 2021 alone, 45,000 Americans lost  their life through gun violence. Of that number, over 20,000 were  killed as a result of murder or homicide--20,000. Over 300 children  lost their lives through gun violence in 2021.   As the Washington Post editorial noted in yesterday's editorial, the  elementary school shooting in Texas was ``one of at least 24 acts of  gun violence of K-12 campuses so far this year in which at least 28  people have been killed . . . [this] came a day after a FBI report  showing a sharp increase last year in active-shooter attacks  nationwide. In 2020, for the first time, firearms became the leading  cause of death for American children and teenagers, supplanting car  accidents.''   We lost our way. We need to do much more. How many children have to  die before we act? When is enough enough? Congress needs to take up and  pass commonsense gun safety legislation.   I am going to give a few examples of legislation I hope we can take  up and consider. First, the Assault Weapons Ban Act. Ban the sale. We  have legislation, S. 736, that bans the sale, manufacture, transfer,  and importation of assault weapons, including military-style weapons.   The Baltimore Sun also talked about this. This is the Sunday paper's  editorial:         These are not components one needs in self-defense, not the       essentials required for target practice [or] local shooting       range, not an asset [that] the average deer hunter [needs].       They are, however, the common tools of mass shooters. It's       been estimated that about one-quarter of such incidents have       involved individuals armed with assault weapons.    The public does not need assault weapons for self-defense. They don't  need it for recreational use. They don't need it. These are military- style weapons and should have no place in private ownership. We should  take action in order to make our communities safer and our children  safer. We should pass the Bipartisan Background Check Expansion Act,  which would require checks for all gun sales, including those from  unlicensed sellers. By the way, the House has already passed this  action.   And we should pass the Enhanced Background Check Completion Act. That  is an act that would eliminate the so-called Charleston loophole that  allows for gun sales to go forward if a check is not completed within 3  days, which is an unrealistic requirement that we have.   These are just commonsense gun safety bills that could be passed. We  should pass the Keep Americans Safe Act, S. 1108, which would prohibit  importation, sale, manufacture, transfer, or possession of magazines  that hold more than 10 rounds of ammunition. Why does anyone, for a  lawful purpose, need an ammunition magazine that holds more than 10  rounds? The mass killers use it. We shouldn't make it easier for them  to carry out these atrocities.   Let me just mention the one option that should not be on the table,  and that option is to do nothing. How many children have to die before  enough is enough? Doing nothing about the epidemic of guns across this  country is killing our children. We must work together to translate our  grief into collective action. Enough is enough. Let us act.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
