 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for his support on  this, as well as the ranking member on our side.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor an individual who represents the  very best of West Virginia and recognize him as one of our country's  most respected and thoughtful jurists, the Honorable Frederick P.  Stamp, Jr.   Judge Stamp began his tenure as a Federal judge when he was confirmed  in 1990 to the United States District Court for the Northern District  of West Virginia, where he would preside as chief judge.   In West Virginia, Judge Stamp is known for his commitment to service  above self. This is evident from his military service, his time spent  in the West Virginia legislature, his work as a private attorney, and  for his support of countless community organizations. He has been a  steadfast and respected pillar of West Virginia, living there his  entire life.   Having raised two adult children, Judge Stamp and his wife, Joan, are  valued members of the Wheeling community. And Judge Stamp has already  been honored by his selection to the Wheeling Hall of Fame.   Humble to the extreme, but humble by nature, it is a testament to his  character that Judge Stamp would never personally seek this type of  recognition. But he has earned it and his peers would like to see that  recognition for him.   Mr. Speaker, I am so proud that Congress is taking this opportunity  to honor such a great American by naming the building in which Judge  Stamp has spent the majority of his professional service and public  life, the Frederick P. Stamp, Jr. Federal Courthouse in Wheeling, West  Virginia.   Mr. Speaker, I urge the adoption of this resolution and I thank the  chairman for his support.
