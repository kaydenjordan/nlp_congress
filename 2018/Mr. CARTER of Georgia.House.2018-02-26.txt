 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Congenital Heart Futures  Reauthorization Act. This legislation was introduced by the gentleman  from Florida (Mr. Bilirakis), a colleague and good friend, to address a  very serious issue.   Congenital heart disease is the leading cause of infant mortality and  is the most common birth defect found in young children. These children  grow up facing a wealth of health issues that will have a tremendous  impact on them for the rest of their lives. They often require  specialized care, including cardiac care, and are subjected to a  lifetime of risk for disability or premature death.   This legislation enhances research and surveillance at the CDC to  ensure that our medical community and the research to support their  efforts are the best available for treatment. It also establishes  grants to further study congenital heart disease so that we can better  combat this disease and the harm it causes in so many people's lives.   Mr. Speaker, this is a terrible disease that leaves people never  knowing when it could strike. Like other diseases, we need to better  understand how it develops and impacts people so that we have a better  chance of fighting it and saving lives.   I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for getting this  legislation passed through the Energy and Commerce Committee, and I  support its passage.
