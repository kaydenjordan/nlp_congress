 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6735, the Public-Private  Cybersecurity Cooperation Act.   Mr. Speaker, protecting our Federal information systems is an  enormous task.   As ranking member of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Protection  Subcommittee, I hear more often than I would like about the challenges  of recruiting and maintaining the Federal cyber workforce. That is true  even at the Department of Homeland Security.   As DHS works to address ongoing workforce challenges, we have to  think creatively and leverage untapped resources of talent.   Across the country, there are white hat hackers who want to apply  their considerable cyber skills to report vulnerabilities found on  government information systems to Federal authorities. But today, these  ethical hackers cannot research and report bugs on DHS' systems without  being in violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.   In 2016, the Department of Defense piloted Hack the Pentagon, which  gave white hat hackers 24 days to find unique vulnerabilities in  certain DOD information systems and report them for a reward.   The program was so successful, DOD established a permanent  vulnerability disclosure program to allow ethical hackers to search for  and report bugs on DOD information systems without violating the law.   That program has enjoyed similar success to Hack the Pentagon.   Members of the Homeland Security Committee have been urging DHS to  establish a vulnerability disclosure program for several years.   At a hearing with Secretary Nielsen in April, my colleague on the  Cybersecurity Subcommittee, Mr. Langevin, asked the Secretary whether  the Department had in place a mechanism for vulnerabilities to be  reported. Secretary Nielsen testified that the Department had no clear  process in place to accept information about bugs in DHS information  systems and agreed to work with the committee to establish one.   Five months have passed, and the Department is not any closer to  establishing a vulnerability disclosure program of its own.   Vulnerability disclosure programs are an emerging industry best  practice and are recommended by the updated NIST Cybersecurity  Framework.   White hat hackers are an enormous pool of talent that the Federal  Government has largely failed to leverage. DHS can no longer afford to  leave that kind of talent on the table.  [[Page H8748]]    H.R. 6735 would push DHS in the right direction by requiring it to  put in place policies to ensure that civic-minded hackers can research  and report bugs found on certain information systems without breaking  the law.   Before I close, I would like to express my disappointment that S.  1281, the Hack DHS Act, is not being considered on the floor today.   S. 1281, which would create a bug bounty pilot program at DHS, was  approved by voice vote in the committee and is consistent with the  objectives of H.R. 6735, which I support.                                time  1415    It is unclear why S. 1281 is not being considered today. I urge House  leadership to bring S. 1281 to the floor later this fall.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 6735. In the  current security environment, vulnerability disclosure policies have  emerged as a critical component of cybersecurity without any  organization. DHS is the lead Federal Department charged with securing  government civilian networks.   DHS should be leading by example, not playing catchup. Today, the  Department of Defense and the GSA have vulnerability disclosure  programs in operation. It is time for DHS to join them.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 6735, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6740, the Border Tunnel Task  Force Act. H.R. 6740 formally authorizes the Department of Homeland  Security's Border Tunnel Task Force.   The first illicit cross-border tunnel under the United States-Mexico  border was discovered in 1990. Since then, law enforcement has  uncovered more than 200 tunnels, primarily in Arizona and California.   Cross-border tunnels are exploited by smugglers to move all types of  contraband, currency, and people into the United States without  detection. Unearthed tunnels range from crudely formed, shallow  tunnels, to elaborately constructed passages that include lighting or  railways and emerge on the U.S. side in facilities large enough to  accommodate deliveries by tractor-trailers.   Incredibly, some tunnels are interconnected with municipal stormwater  and sewer systems on both sides of the border. In one case, a 2016 law  enforcement operation uncovered a tunnel half a mile inland with a ton  of cocaine and 7 tons of marijuana in it.   Just last month, about 200 yards from the border, there was a traffic  stop arrest of an individual with more than 300 pounds of illegal  drugs, which resulted in the execution of a search warrant on his  property and the discovery of a tunnel that went from a long-abandoned  Kentucky Fried Chicken that was on his property directly to a house in  Mexico. Inside that 600-foot-long tunnel, Federal agents discovered $1  million worth of hard drugs.   These discoveries did not just happen. They were the result of  collaborative, binational law enforcement operations under the auspices  of the Border Tunnel Task Forces that the Department of Homeland  Security maintains. H.R. 6740 seeks to authorize the task forces to  ensure that this valuable work continues.   I ask my House colleagues to join me in supporting DHS' efforts to  head off smuggling through illicit cross-border tunnels and vote in  favor of H.R. 6740.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6620, the Protecting Critical  Infrastructure Against Drones and Emerging Threats Act.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 6620 would require the Department of Homeland  Security to take action to better understand and address an emerging  threat posed by unmanned aerial systems--or drones--to our Nation's  critical infrastructure.   These technologies are not new, but their applications have evolved  rapidly in recent years. Some of these uses are important to keeping  the public safe, growing our economy, and providing new ways to explore  the world, including giving first responders better information in an  emergency, for example. But, we also know that drones can be used for  espionage, be weaponized, or even to carry out a terrorist attack.   My district in Louisiana has one of the Nation's highest  concentrations of critical infrastructure, including pipelines,  refineries, ports, airports, stadiums, and a wide range of other key  assets and resources.   When I speak with critical infrastructure owners and operators, they  recognize the benefits of drone technology. Many of them even put them  to good use in their own businesses. At the same time, they are  troubled by the risks posed by unknown, unauthorized drones operating  over their facilities.   Over the past year, I have asked owners and operators what we in  government can do to help them address this threat. What I heard is  that, at a minimum, they need a way to report potentially dangerous  drone activity to DHS when they detect it.   In a hearing this spring before the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure  Protection Subcommittee, where I serve as ranking member, stakeholders  from the chemical industry testified about this challenge on the  record. They told us that when a facility detects a drone in their  airspace, they aren't sure what to do about it, or even who to tell.   H.R. 6620 would address this gap in a few ways.   First, it would require DHS to establish a channel for reporting  information on drones, as well as other emerging threats, securely,  through a communications infrastructure, developed in conjunction with  the Department's chief information officer.   This bill would also direct DHS's Under Secretary for Intelligence  and Analysis to develop and disseminate a threat assessment on unmanned  aerial systems and other emerging threats associated with drone  technology. The assessment would be informed by Federal, State, local,  and private sector partners, and prepared in consultation with other  DHS components, like the National Protection and Programs Directorate,  that have relevant expertise.   Finally, H.R. 6620 would require DHS to report its findings to  Congress within 1 year.   Together, these provisions call on DHS to take a closer look at a  significant threat to our Nation's critical infrastructure--the threat  of drone-enabled attacks--while also creating an enduring mechanism for  DHS to continue gathering information on emerging threats from the  owners and operators who stand on the front line of defense.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 6620 would direct the Department of Homeland  Security to do more to understand, assess, and respond to the threat  posed by drones, while also creating an avenue for two-way information  sharing about emerging threats.   My bill creates a new channel for critical infrastructure owners and  operators to report potentially dangerous drone activity in their  airspace, and other new threats as they evolve. Creating a way for  owners and operators to relay this information, on a voluntary basis,  would give DHS access to better data and a more comprehensive view of  the threat environment.   Before I yield back, I would like to also express support for a  related provision in the FAA package that is expected to be considered  tomorrow. It would allow DHS to research technologies to counter  threats of unmanned aerial systems being exploited to carry out  terrorism or dangerous activity.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 6620, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6742, the Secure Border  Communications Act.   Mr. Speaker, it is essential that the men and women of the Department  of Homeland Security have reliable and effective communications  equipment in the field.   Unfortunately, in recent years, U.S. Customs and Border Protection  has been unable to achieve and maintain baseline communications  capabilities, with devices exhibiting a range of issues from system  incompatibility to outright inoperability. For Border Patrol agents in  remote areas of the border, particularly along the U.S.-Canadian  border, such issues give rise to troubling operational and officer  safety challenges.   In response, H.R. 6742 directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to  ensure that CBP agents and officers are equipped with secure radio  technologies that are interoperable regardless of where used along the  border.   Additionally, it authorizes the Secretary to evaluate new and  emerging communications technologies to determine their suitability for  use along the border.   On a related note, a recent positive development came this summer  when CBP awarded $26 million in contracts to upgrade their mission  critical equipment.   While CBP is slowly upgrading their communication networks and  equipment, H.R. 6742 underscores Congress' interest in seeing  meaningful progress. As such, I support H.R. 6742 and ask my colleagues  to do the same.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, it is our duty as Members of Congress to  ensure that the men and women who patrol and protect our border are  trained and equipped to do their jobs.   Unreliable communication in areas between ports of entry or remote  areas due to system inoperability is an issue H.R. 6742 aims to fix. It  seeks to do so by placing on the shoulders of the Secretary of Homeland  Security the responsibility for ensuring that each agent or officer is  equipped with secure, reliable radios.   Mr. Speaker, I support this approach. I urge my colleagues to join me  in supporting H.R. 6742, and I yield back the balance of my time.
