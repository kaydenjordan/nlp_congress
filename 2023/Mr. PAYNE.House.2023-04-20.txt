 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss the Protection of  Women and Girls in Sports Act, or H.R. 734. This bill is yet another  attack by the Republicans on a vulnerable population in America. It is  nothing more than an attempt to score cheap political points and bully  transgender youth. I question why the Republicans are so eager to pass  this bill now.   Do you remember what the Republicans said before the last election?  They told Americans that they would work with President Biden to lower  inflation, that they would work with the President to lower gas prices,  they would protect the economy, support a rise in the debt ceiling, and  offer an alternative budget.   Now that they have the House majority, they have done none of those  things. The Republican priorities are not aligned with the needs of the  American people, and the American voters are paying attention to it.                            ____________________
