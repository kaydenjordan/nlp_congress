 Mr. Speaker, I join you in thanking God for the return of  our colleague, Steve Scalise, and to have him do so in such a strong  way.   You were brief, Mr. Speaker, I will be even briefer.   Thank God, our prayers are answered.   I take great pride in Steve because we are both Italian Americans,  and I think that is a source of some of his strength.   I, too, want to say how proud we are of Jennifer, Harrison, and  Madison, of your staff, and of our first responders--our Capitol  Police--who took such good care of you.   But if it is, as you said, an attack on you is an attack on all, then  we all came through this magnificently because of your strength. So it  is the power of Steve Scalise.   The day we came to the floor when you weren't here, we were all Team  Scalise. Today we are Team Scalise.   Thank you for being so wonderful.   God bless you.
