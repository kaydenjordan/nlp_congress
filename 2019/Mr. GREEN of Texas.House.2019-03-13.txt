 Mr. Speaker, and still I rise; and I rise today  because I love my country and because I love the people, and I love  their lives and I care about them. And because I love them and I care  about them, I call upon the President of the United States of America  to ground the 737 MAX 8.   This plane is unfit to fly. We have had two go down in the last 6  months. Two down within 6 months is two too many.   We cannot put profits above people, Mr. President. This is an  opportunity for you to exert your executive power in a positive way on  behalf of people who fly these planes.   It is not about the pilots; it is about the planes. These planes are  unfit to fly, and we cannot put profits above people, and they are to  be grounded until they are fit.  [[Page H2684]]    Ground them until they are fixed. They are unfit to fly. Fix them  before we fly them.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I would like to join the chorus of  persons who are complimenting the chairwoman for many jobs well done.  This, of course, is just another of the many wonderful things that she  is doing to help people across the globe.   Mr. Speaker, I support H. Res. 206 because it addresses the  launderability of money at the foundation of criminality.   When it comes to arts and antiquities, according to an Art Basel  report by UBS, the United States remains the largest art market, valued  at $26.6 billion, and it accounts for 42 percent of the global total in  2017.   This means, of course, that the United States is likely to be the  largest destination for stolen ethnic and cultural arts--black market,  black market art, black market money. That is why we have to find a way  to prevent the laundering of this money.   The United States of America should not allow ourselves to be the  financier for those who perpetrate dastardly deeds in many countries  around the world. An example might be Syria, where you have terrorists  who will take stolen artifacts, find a way to put them into commerce,  and use that money to support terrorist activities.   That is not what we are about. We must find a way to close the  loopholes that allow persons in this country to purchase these  artifacts and allow that money to get back to those who would perform  these dastardly deeds. I call them dastards. That is with a ``D,''  dastards.   These dastards must be stopped. This resolution is a great step in  the right direction to prevent the perpetration and perpetuation of  this activity.    Madam Speaker, and still I rise because I love my  country. And I rise tonight on the Republican side of what we call the  aisle.   I do so, Madam Speaker, because the issue that I will call to the  attention of this august body is not an issue that I consider a  Republican issue. I don't consider it a Democratic issue. I consider  this an issue for the American people, past, present, and the future.   This is an issue that has plagued our country almost since its  inception. It is an issue that we have avoided with intentionality,  avoided because of discomfort, avoided through the years. But it is an  issue that we have to address.   So I rise tonight, Madam Speaker, with love of country at heart on  the Republican side of the aisle. And I rise to announce, as I have  before, that we have to take up the question of impeachment.   I rise, Madam Speaker, to say this and to give some explanations.  There are many things that are being misunderstood. I trust that I can  bring some degree of clarity to the issues that are misunderstood.   And I know, Madam Speaker, as I rise, and understand that this will  come to a vote in this House; I know that it will be a tough vote for  many people. I understand. It will be a tough vote for a multiplicity  of reasons. It will be a tough vote.   I know what tough votes are like, so I understand. I have people in  my community, one example, members of the clergy that I have had to  explain some very tough votes to. I have some that have, to this day,  not agreed with the tough votes that I have had to take.   Tough votes. I came here to take tough votes. I came here to deal  with tough issues, the difficult. I came to do what I believe should  have been done long before now; but the opportunity to do it has  presented itself since I arrived in Congress, so I take on this  challenge. And I understand that this will be a tough vote.   Before I get to some of the nuances of the explanation that I would  like to give, let me just tell you who I will be voting for when I take  this tough vote. I will be voting for the slave mother who had a baby  ripped out of her arms, taken to the auction block.   This is why I can relate to those mothers on the border who had their  babies ripped out of their arms; and still, many have not been returned  to their mothers, their fathers. I can relate because I understand the  historical context. I will be voting for them.   Tough vote, but I will be voting for the slave father who never got  to see his child because the mother and the child were taken away,  auctioned off, sent to some distant plantation; never allowed the  opportunity to enjoy the love that a father ought to with a  [[Page H2712]]  child. That is the historical context of why I will be voting and what  I will be voting for.   I will also be voting for the elderly mother who was of African  ancestry, who had to say ``yes, ma'am'' and ``yes, sir'' to the 3-year- old children of the master. At that time it would have been called the  boss, but it was the master; had to say ``yes, ma'am'' and ``yes, sir''  to the children.   To the father, I will vote for the father who was called ``boy,''  demeaned in the presence of his son. I know. I saw that happen to my  father. I know about that elderly mother. I saw it happen to her, the  elderly black mother. I will be voting for them. They have come through  the years to get me here. I won't forget them.   I will be voting for the LGBTQ person who was fired for showing up at  work and saying I married the love of my life, who happens to be the  same sex as that person was. I am an ally of the LGBTQ community.   I am going to vote for those persons who have been discriminated  against.                                time  1530    I will be voting for those who lost their lives in the Tree of Life  synagogue, lost their lives to bigotry, hate.   I will be voting for those who lost their lives at the church in  Charlotte.   I will be voting for the woman, who was a peaceful protestor, who  lost her life in Charlottesville among the bigots, the KKK, the neo- Nazis, the xenophobes, the homophobes. I will be voting for her.   And here is why I will be voting for all of them: because these  Articles of Impeachment will be about bigotry emanating from the  Presidency--in policy, I might add, bigotry in policy. There is clear  and convincing evidence that we have bigotry in policy. I will be  voting for the people who are the victims.   To those who would tell me this is not something that the Congress  ought to entertain, here is what I would say. I would say, if the  Congress of the United States of America could, in 1868, impeach  President Andrew Johnson for speaking ill of Congress, this Congress  can impeach for bigotry in policy.   It is just a question of whether 218 people, assuming all are  present, will vote for it. That is what it is. It is just a question of  whether we have the will to do it. The way is before us.   Article II, Section 4, all of the noted constitutional scholars-- maybe there is some exception; there probably is one someplace--have  concluded that Article II, Section 4 not only allows a President to be  impeached for criminality, a President can also be impeached for  misdeeds.   As a matter of fact, those who desire to edify themselves can read  Federalist 65, read the words of Hamilton and Madison and Jay. Read  their words. Let them communicate with you through the vista of time.   You will find, when you read their writings, that they were prophetic  in their thoughts, that they understood that there would be a time such  as this, and they have given us the recipe for this time and the means  by which we can take corrective action.   When you read, you will find that, without question, they indicate  that impeachment is not something that will be done without some degree  of turmoil, that impeachment will be something that will sometimes be  along party lines. Party lines occur when impeachment is brought before  this august body.   By the way, I brought impeachment twice before, so I am talking about  something that has occurred and something that will occur again.   So impeachment is something that was anticipated. It is something  that is a remedy that is constitutional, and I plan to bring that  remedy before this body so that we may take a stand.   Dr. King was a great man and somebody I admire, and I talk about him  quite regularly. Dr. King reminded us that the truest measure of the  person is not where you stand in times of comfort and convenience, but  where you stand in times of challenge and controversy. When you have  hard votes to take, where do you stand?   I don't believe bigotry should be a talking point, something that we  use to get the base out at election time. We go out and we talk about,  oh, how bad certain people are and we announce that they are racist,  that they are bigots. I don't think it ought to be a talking point. I  think it should be an action item.   I am bringing the vote because it is going to be an action item for  Congress at last. Again, it will be an action item, not just a talking  point. I am going to put the moral imperative to vote for all of these  people that I called to your attention and countless others above  political expediency.   Political expediency allows us to push this issue to the next  generation. Political expediency has allowed us to reach this point in  our history where bigotry is rearing its ugly head. It is no longer  covert, but it is now overt. We have reached this point in our history.  So I refuse to except political expediency as a remedy.   Why not wait? Let's defeat at the polls as opposed to impeach here in  the House.   I don't buy into that.   Now, there are many who would say let's wait on the Mueller report.  The Mueller report has nothing to do with bigotry. It most likely has  to do with criminality associated with obstruction of justice, probably  has something to do with emoluments, could have something to do with  collusion, which is a layperson's way of saying conspiracy. It could  have something to do with all of these.   But I assure each and every person who is within the sound of my  voice by whatever means, it will have nothing to do with bigotry. So  there is no need to wait for the Mueller report because the Mueller  report won't address bigotry. Those who would rather impeach for some  other thing, then wait for the Mueller report.   By the way, I don't plan to get in the way of the Mueller report, but  I will say this: The Framers of the Constitution never intended for the  executive branch to investigate itself, and that is what is going on.   The Framers of the Constitution understood the implications of having  the executive branch investigate itself. One such implication that we  see now is that the Mueller report may not be presented to Congress. It  is going to the President before it gets to Congress.   The Framers never intended for the executive to investigate itself.  That is the responsibility of Congress. That is why I brought Articles  of Impeachment.   Pardon me for using a personal pronoun. My mother taught me better.   That is why I brought Articles of Impeachment in a previous Congress  when we had Republicans in charge.   I am not going to be hypocritical and conclude now that Democrats are  in charge, we don't have the same duty, responsibility, and obligation.  I am not that kind of guy. We are going to go on record. It will be a  hard vote, but we are going to go on record.   Some would say: Well, how do you get the proof of the bigotry?   Easy answer--it appears to be a tough question. Easy answer: the same  way we got the proof that we brought to the floor of the House for  colleagues who had resolutions that were to condemn for bigoted  statements. Same way, we get them from news sources.    We have plenty of empirical evidence to show us by clear and  convincing evidence as a standard, or whatever standard the House uses,  because there is no standard codified in the law for the House. But by  whatever standard the House should use, there is plenty of empirical  evidence to support bigotry in policy emanating from the Presidency,  plenty of them: S- - - -hole countries; and then you go out, by the  way, where people of color happen to reside, I might add, and you go  out and develop an immigration policy that adversely impacts those  people of color, changing the law to adversely impact them.   Bigotry in policy? Ha. I talked about the babies at the border-- people of color, I might add--separating them. We didn't do that at  Ellis Island. We didn't do that when 12 million people came from  Europe, Scandinavia. We didn't do that. We didn't separate them from  their children. We didn't have a flotilla out there to stop them. We  didn't try to build walls to keep them out. They came.   The people who are at the border, by the way, are exercising their  rights under the law that we promulgated, that we, the United States of  America,  [[Page H2713]]  put in place that says that they can come up and ask for asylum.   By the way, I do not contend that all who seek asylum should be  granted asylum. I do think that the process, the law that we put in  place, ought to be honored. And if we don't like the law, then we  should change the law. There is plenty of opportunity to do so. There  has been plenty of opportunity to do so. Change the law if you don't  like the way we have decided to deal with these issues.   There is plenty of evidence that in the past we have accommodated  persons who were trying to flee harm's way, bringing their children  with them. When those persons were fleeing Castro's Cuba and traversed  the shark-infested waters of the Gulf of Mexico--I say ``shark- invested'' because there are so many people who are saying: Well, we  don't want them to do this because they can be harmed along the way.   We didn't say that about the people who were traversing the shark- infested waters of the Gulf of Mexico. We created a policy called wet  foot, dry foot. One foot on dry land, and you had a pathway to  citizenship. That was the policy of the United States of America, to  accommodate.   I am not saying bring the world in. I am saying follow the law. It  seems to me that is what we are all about. I believe in the law of the  land that I live in and that I love. And I love my country.   So I want to assure persons that we will use the same standard of  proof that we have been using on previous occasions.   Now, the next question: Impeachment is like voting to go to war.  Casting a vote to impeach is comparable to casting a vote to go to war.   I visit the VA hospital annually, Madam Speaker, and I take flags to  every veteran in that hospital. This year, we took 600 flags, and we  needed more.   I would ask persons who believe that this is comparable to casting a  vote to go to war, go to the place where you can see the price of  freedom. Go to the place where you can see what the cost is, where you  will see that it is not in silver and gold. Go to a VA hospital, a VA  hospital where you will see persons who have lost an arm, lost a leg,  no longer have vision. Many of them leave and don't return the way they  left. Just go and see what the price of freedom is like.   They fight for our freedom. They are willing to give their lives for  our freedom. That is what a vote for war is all about. Many don't ever  return. They are the liberators. They accord us our freedom by putting  their lives on the line, and it is that freedom that we have that  allows us to vote to impeach.   Voting for impeachment is not a vote to go to war. You ask somebody  who has lost a leg in those hospitals, talk to them. Oh, you may find  one person whom you can use and try to equate that to the rest of the  world, but I assure you, those veterans don't consider impeachment  comparable to voting to go to war.   I would also add this: There are those who believe that bigotry is  something that the Senate won't take up.   If we use that line of logic, I shouldn't have gone to law school for  fear of failure.   If we use that line of logic, we shouldn't have sent H.R. 1 over to  the Senate, because it has been prognosticated that the Senate won't  take it up in any meaningful way.                                time  1545    If we use that line of logic, there are bills that we send to the  Senate quite regularly that we would not send because of a belief that  the Senate won't take up these bills. So I don't buy into that logic.  But I do believe that we should give the Senate an opportunity to do  its job. It ought to have that opportunity.   Remember now, this is not about Mueller, this is about bigotry  emanating from the Presidency. This is about having the country, by and  through its representatives, go on record in terms of where we stand in  this time of challenge and controversy as it relates to bigotry  emanating from the Presidency.   Impeachment is something that we all should respect because it is  constitutional. It is what the Constitution permits. It is also what I  believe I have a duty to bring before the Congress. I will do so.   I don't guarantee more than one vote, and that is my vote. There are  people who seem to think that if they can convince me, that the people  who voted for it previously won't be voting for it this time. That the  people who voted for it previously, they have changed their minds, they  are going to be against you. They are not against me. I am not against  them. I say to them, vote your conscience. Stand where your convictions  are now.   But there are people who seem to think that by convincing me that I  will be alone, that somehow this will cause me not to act. My dear  brothers and sisters, how you have underestimated me. My dear brothers  and sisters, I didn't come here to go along so that I could get along  and move along. My dear brothers and sisters, you have grossly  underestimated me.   If I stand alone and there is but one vote cast, I assure you that  one vote will be cast and I will stand alone. I understand that in the  eons to come, people will look back on this time and they will query  what was wrong with them. What was wrong with them? How could they  tolerate an unfit person holding the highest office in the land? How  could they tolerate it? They will want to know what was wrong with  them.   But I also know this. They will see that there was at least one  person who stood on the ground of righteousness, who put the moral  imperative above political expediency.   And I will know also that the world will know where this country  stands on the issue of bigotry. I didn't come here to manage bigotry.  That is what we do. We always want to get back to bigotry as usual  after it rears its ugly head. Let's put that head down and get back to  bigotry as usual. Let it be covert, but not overt.   My guess is some people have said to the President: Mr. President,  you can do all of these things without displaying your bigotry. They  didn't say it that way, but they probably tried to convince him. You  don't have to be raw. Do it the way others have done it and you will be  appreciated.   I don't want to get back to bigotry as usual. I think we send a  message to the world when we impeach a President for bigotry and  policy, and that is what I am talking about: bigotry and policy. Not  just his words--I don't think that we ought to have a bigot in office,  but not just his words--but for what his words have been transformed  into, what they have metamorphosed into: bigotry and policy.   I think that we would send a positive message to the world in terms  of where we stand, and we would also send a message to many of the  people in this country as to how much we care about them, those who  suffer from bigotry on a daily basis. If you take out the head bigot,  you will send a message to the bigots along the way at the lower end of  the ladder.   Now, about the people who are suffering; they have elected us time  and time again, many of them, on the belief that this time they are  going to take up racism. This time they are going to take up  homophobia, xenophobia, Islamophobia, anti-Semitism, and nativism. This  time they are going to take up the issues that impact my life on a  daily basis. Yes, it is still here. The glass ceiling exists because of  bigotry. There is a glass ceiling. Yes, it is still here.   There are people who have jobs of color and they have to train  persons of a different hue to take the job that they have and become  their supervisor. It still happens. It is still occurring in the United  States of America. The country I love, by the way.   You can love your country and want to see it improve. That is what  all of these bills are about here. Everybody that is filing a bill  wants to improve the country. That is all I want to do, too. The  unfortunate circumstance for a good many people is I want to deal with  an issue that we have, for too long, placed on the back burner of our  contemporary agenda. I am going to place it on the front burner. There  will be a vote.   How do you know there will be a vote? Well, the rules allow it. The  rules allow any Member of this august body to come forward with a  privileged resolution.   Now, if you want to change the rules, you can do so. Republicans  didn't do it  [[Page H2714]]  when they were in control of the House. But you can do it. Let's let  history show that because one Democrat wanted to bring articles of  impeachment, that a Democratic Party did what a Republican Party did  not do. Let history reflect that. Change the rules. You have to live  with the history. I don't. I am going to be on the right side of the  history.   Now, someone would say: But, Al, you will be on the wrong side of  politics. Do you know what? The people that I know suffered, the people  who lived and died so that I could have this opportunity, the people  who found out what a billy club hits like, found out what a 90-pound  German Shepherd bites like, found out what a high pressure water hose  stings like, the people who lost loved ones to a cause so that I could  have this opportunity, I don't know that they want me to be on the  right side of politics. I think they want me to be on the right side of  history. But I also believe that they want me to be on the right side  of this moral issue of our time, and that is whether we will tolerate  bigotry emanating from the Presidency.    So to everyone, understand this is not going to be about obstruction  of justice. I came to the floor and called that to the attention of the  country. There is evidence to move forward on obstruction of justice,  but I choose not to do so. It is not going to be about conspiracy.  There is evidence, but I choose not to do so.   This is going to be about bigotry, and it is going to be about where  do you stand? The truest measure of the person is not where you stand  in times of comfort and convenience, but where do you stand in times of  challenge and controversy? Where do you stand when bigotry is the issue  that you have to vote on?   And to all of my colleagues, I want you to know I love you. It  doesn't matter what side of the aisle you are on. I respect you. And I  only say to you, vote your conscience. Decide what side of bigotry,  what side of history, what side of righteousness you are going to be  on.   I know where I will stand. I will hold my head up high,  notwithstanding all of the slings and arrows that are going to come  against me. They are coming. They are going to demean me in every way.  My mother probably wouldn't know who I am when they are done with me. I  understand it.   Gandhi gave us the formula. First they ignore you. These are the  words of Gandhi. Then they laugh at you. Then after they have ignored  you and they have had a moment of laughter and they see that you are  not going away, then they fight you. Then they demean you. I  understand.   So do what you may. Say what you may. But I know, within me, that I  am doing the right thing.   I know that Gandhi is right. He said that after they have ignored  you, after they have laughed and had their moment of pleasure about it,  then they fight you, but then, Gandhi reminded us, then you win.   I am prepared to suffer through until victory. I won't give out. To  quote my good friend, Mr. Lewis, who crossed the Edmund Pettus Bridge  on Bloody Sunday, ``I won't give up. I won't give in.'' I will do that  which my ancestors call upon me to do. I pray to God that this House  will vote its conscience. Vote your convictions.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move that the House do now  adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 3 o'clock and 56 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Thursday, March 14, 2019, at 9 a.m.                            ____________________
