 Madam Speaker, and still I rise. I rise today to  address the indication that what we Democrats are doing is meaningless.   Meaningless to ban bump stocks. Well, tell that to the 60 people who  were murdered at the Mandalay hotel where a gunman fired more than a  thousand rounds in short order.   Meaningless to raise the age to 21 to purchase an assault weapon.  Explain that the ghosts of the 10 people who were killed at Tops  grocery store. Make it clear to those 19 babies who were murdered at an  elementary school in Texas.   Meaningless? Tell that to the lives of those that have been lost. No,  it is not meaningless.   Madam Speaker, I tell my dear friends that what we are doing right  now is more than common sense. It is just good sense to prevent people  from killing other people.
