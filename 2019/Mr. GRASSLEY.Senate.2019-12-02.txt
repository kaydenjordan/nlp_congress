 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to address the  Senate for 1 minute as in morning business.    I have come to the floor many times to speak with my  colleagues about the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement. I recently  spoke with my colleagues in the House of Representatives and also  officials within the administration about the same subject. By all  accounts, the deal is close on the United States-Mexico-Canada trade  agreement.   I urge House Democrats to act quickly and be reasonable so we can  finally deliver certainty on this issue to the American people. It has  now been more than a year since the leaders of Canada, Mexico, and the  United States signed the agreement, so Americans have waited a year for  what can happen now. This modernized trade agreement will create  hundreds of thousands of new jobs and help Americans grow wages for our  workers.   The end of this year's legislative session is rapidly approaching, as  we all know. If a deal cannot be reached by the end of this week, I do  not see how the USMCA can be ratified in the year we are in. As it is,  the window of opportunity for 2019 is extremely tight. Now is the time  for the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives to finally act  so we can act in the Senate.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, on the Saturday before Thanksgiving, my  wife Barbara and I traveled to Carroll, IA, for the induction of our  youngest son, Jay Grassley, to the Iowa Girls Coaches' Association Hall  of Fame. Jay earned this honor through his work over the last 29 years  as a volleyball official. Jay has officiated the most Iowa high school  volleyball finals in history with 14 games. With one exception, Jay has  officiated at every Iowa State volleyball tournament since 1995. This  outstanding record demonstrates Jay's dedication to his work as an  official.   In addition to his officiating, Jay has been a coach and mentor to  volleyball players for more than 30 years. His interest in volleyball  started when he was a student at the University of Northern Iowa. Jay  started the Six Pack Volleyball Club in 1990, and after years of  building a strong reputation, his team earned the USA Volleyball 18s  Division National Championship title in 2011.   As I travel across Iowa for my annual 99 county meetings, I often run  into Iowans whose relationship with Jay has had a lasting impact. They  commonly ask that I tell Jay ``hi'' and follow with a story of how he  was a mentor and coach to them or one of their children. As a father,  those are heartwarming sentiments for me to hear. Jay's kind nature and  motivational spirit help him to connect with people of all ages and  make his influence all the more worthwhile. At the hall of fame  induction, Jay's fellow coaches and officials described him as ``one  of, if not the best, official(s) out there.''   Barbara and I are very proud of Jay being named to the Iowa Girls  Coaches' Association Hall of Fame.                            ____________________
