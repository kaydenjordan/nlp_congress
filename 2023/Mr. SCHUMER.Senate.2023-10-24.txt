 Mr. President, last week, President Biden addressed the  Nation from the Oval Office to affirm that America will stand with her  friends and allies in the face of authoritarians like China, Russia,  and Iran, who seek to annihilate democracy.   The future of democracy around the world faces the greatest threat  since the end of the Cold War. At this pivotal moment in history,  America is once again called upon to rise to the occasion and to lead  the way.   President Biden has now sent Congress a supplemental funding request  with aid for our ally and partner Israel, aid for our friends in  Ukraine, and funding to outcompete the Chinese Government and secure  our southern border from threats like fentanyl. We must pass this  supplemental as soon as we can with bipartisan support for a simple and  important reason: It will make the world safer for the United States,  for our allies, and for our democratic values.   In Europe, Vladimir Putin continues his onslaught against the  Ukrainian people, and it is foolish to think he will stop there. In the  Middle East, Hamas's brutal terrorism murdered the most Jewish people  in a single day since the Holocaust and threatens our strongest ally in  the Middle East. Democrats and Republicans alike know that if Putin,  Hamas, or other adversaries succeed, it would endanger Americans around  the world.   Now that Congress has received the President's request, I will make  it a top priority for the Senate to act quickly, decisively, and most  importantly, with strong bipartisan conviction.   Bipartisanship must lead the way as we take up the President's  supplemental request.   To my Republican colleagues, let's work together to ensure that this  process remains bipartisan, because only things that win support from  both sides will make it to the President's desk.   Democrats and Republicans agree we must stand with Israel. So let's  pass this supplemental, with humanitarian aid to help civilians in Gaza  and elsewhere, as soon as we can.   Democrats and Republicans also agree we must stand with Ukraine.  After all, over 70 Members voted for Ukraine funding last month in our  CR. So let's pass this supplemental as soon as we can.  [[Page S5126]]    And both sides want to outcompete the Chinese Government, secure our  border from threats like fentanyl, and provide humanitarian aid to  minimize civilian casualties in both Israel and Gaza.   All of these priorities are bipartisan. All of these provisions are  included in the President's request. So let's get to work in the coming  weeks to pass this supplemental package quickly and with strong  bipartisan support.   With the House of Representatives in paralysis, the Senate will not  wait to act. We will step into the breach and make sure the business of  legislating continues. And if we act with enough bipartisan conviction,  I believe it would go a long way to pushing the House to getting its  act together and following suit.   The world will watch very closely what actions we take in Congress  over the next couple weeks. We must send an unmistakable message to the  country, to our allies, and to our adversaries that America will always  spring to the defense of our allies in their hour of need. That is why  we must pass this supplemental as soon as we can.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.
