 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that for the  duration of the Senate's consideration of S. Con. Res. 14, the budget  resolution for fiscal year 2021, the majority and the Republican  managers of the resolution, while seated or standing at the managers'  desks, be permitted to deliver floor remarks, retrieve, review, and  edit documents, and send email and other data communications from text  displayed on wireless personal digital assistant devices and tablet  devices.   I further ask unanimous consent that the use of calculators be  permitted on the floor during consideration of the budget resolution;  further, that the staff be permitted to make technical and conforming  changes to the resolution, if necessary, consistent with the amendments  adopted during Senate consideration, including calculating the  associated change in the net interest function and incorporating the  effect of such adopted amendments on the budgetary aggregates for  Federal revenues, the amount by which the Federal revenue should be  changed, new budget authority, budget outlays, deficits, public debt,  and debt held by the public.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there be 2  minutes for debate, equally divided, prior to each vote during  consideration of S. Con. Res. 14.    Mr. President, let me begin by thanking President Biden  and Majority Leader Schumer for their leadership in the arduous process  which has gotten us to where we are right now.   I do understand that many of my Republican colleagues are in a bit of  shock. They are in a bit of shock now. They are finding it hard to  believe that the President and the Democratic Caucus are prepared to go  forward in addressing the long, neglected needs of working families and  not just the 1 percent and wealthy campaign contributors. That is not  the way things usually happen around here.   Usually, it is the big money interests, the campaign contributors,  and the lobbyists who call the tunes. But not today. Today, we move  this country in a very different direction.   The American people are sick and tired of growing income and wealth  inequality in our country, where two people now own more wealth than  the bottom 40 percent, where the top 1 percent owns more wealth than  the bottom 92 percent, and where 45 percent of all new income has gone  to the top 1 percent since 2009.   In other words, the people on top are doing phenomenally well.   Meanwhile, while the very rich have become much richer, the gross  unfairness of our current tax system has allowed, in a given year, some  of the wealthiest people in our country and some of the largest and  most profitable corporations to not pay a nickel in a given year in  Federal income tax--not one penny.   Well, that is about to change. The American people want a government  which represents all of us and not just the few. And this legislation  is going to ask the wealthiest people in our country to start paying  their fair share of taxes so that we can address the needs of working  families, the elderly, the children, the sick, and the poor.   And despite what some of my Republican colleagues may be saying, no  one in America who makes less than $400,000 a year will pay a nickel  more in Federal taxes. In fact, what we are looking at in this budget  proposal is a historic tax cut for working families and the middle  class.   Further, and importantly, at a time when California is on fire, when  Oregon is on fire, when Greece is burning, and when countries  throughout the world are experiencing unprecedented drought, which will  clearly impact food production, this legislation begins the process of  combating climate change so that our kids and grandchildren can live in  a country and on a planet which is healthy and habitable. It would be  immoral and an absolute dereliction of our responsibilities as elected  officials to do anything less. We cannot ignore climate change any  longer. Now is the time for our great country to lead the world out of  this existential crisis.   And, by the way, as we address the long neglected needs of working  families and as we combat climate change, we are going to create  millions of good-paying jobs, many of them union jobs.   Let me very briefly take this opportunity to describe some of what is  in this budget proposal. First, we are going to address the disgrace of  the United States having the highest rate of childhood poverty of  almost any major country on Earth. This is the wealthiest country on  Earth, and we should not have millions of our children living in  poverty.   This budget is going to provide the long-awaited-for help that  working parents all over this country desperately need, and when we do  that, we will substantially reduce childhood poverty in America. And we  are going to do that by extending the child tax credit so that families  continue to receive monthly direct payments of up to $300 per child.   We began that process in the American Rescue Plan. It has been  enormously successful in Vermont and all over this country as parents  finally get the help that they need to raise their kids, and, in fact,  it has helped reduce childhood poverty in our country by 61 percent.  And we are going to extend those child tax credits.   Further, we are going to help working parents by addressing the  crisis in childcare by making sure that no working family in our  country pays more than 7 percent of their income for childcare. And all  over this country, in talking to parents in Vermont and elsewhere,  people are paying 20 percent, 25 percent of their income for childcare  so that they can go to work. That makes no sense at all. Under our  proposal, no working family will pay more than 7 percent. And when we  do that, when we make childcare more affordable and accessible, it will  allow over a million women who are now home with their kids to reenter  the workforce and improve our economy.   Further, in terms of addressing the needs of our working parents and  their kids, we will expand public education by providing universal pre- K to every 3- and 4-year-old in the country.   This budget proposal is going to end the international disgrace of  the United States being the only major country on Earth not to  guarantee paid family and medical leave as a right. Somebody who is  sick today should not be forced to go to work and maybe, by expanding  their illness by contagion,  [[Page S6205]]  make other people sick. Parents should be able to stay home with their  sick children. When a woman has a baby, she should not be forced back  into work a week after giving birth simply because she has no income to  stay home.   Yes, in America, we will join every other major country and guarantee  paid family and medical leave.   We will begin to address the crisis in higher education by making  community colleges in America tuition-free, and this will give millions  of young people and working people the opportunity to get the education  they need to acquire the skills so they can go out and get the good- paying jobs that are out there. It will also give people the  opportunity to transfer the 2 years of credits earned at a community  college to a 4-year school. Now, I hope in years to come we will go  further, but 2 years of free community college is no small thing.   This budget proposal begins the process of taking on the greed of the  pharmaceutical industry and saving taxpayers hundreds of billions of  dollars by requiring that Medicare negotiate prescription drug prices  with the pharmaceutical industry. It is not acceptable to me and to the  American people that we continue to pay, by far, the highest prices in  the world for prescription drugs. Medicare must negotiate prescription  drug prices, and this budget sets the stage for that to happen.    And we will use the savings acquired by negotiating prescription drug  prices in Medicare by expanding Medicare. We are going to use those  savings to expand Medicare to cover the dental care, the hearing aids,  and the eyeglasses that seniors desperately need. This is the  wealthiest country on Earth, and yet we have millions of senior  citizens who lack teeth in their mouth. They need dentures; they can't  afford to get them. They need hearing aids in order to communicate with  their grandkids; can't afford to do that. They need a decent pair of  glasses; can't afford that.   And in terms of healthcare, we will also substantially increase the  number of doctors, nurses, and dentists who practice in underserved  areas and expand the Community Health Centers Program into new areas as  well.   This budget proposal will combat homelessness in America and address  the reality that nearly 18 million households are paying over 50  percent of their limited incomes for housing through an unprecedented  investment in affordable housing. We will ensure, further, that people  in an aging society--we are getting older as a society, and we will  ensure that those people can receive the healthcare they need in their  own homes instead of being forced into expensive and inadequate nursing  homes and that the workers who provide that important care to the  elderly and the disabled are not forced to exist on starvation wages.  This is such important work and such emotionally draining work; those  folks deserve a decent paycheck.   We will bring undocumented people out of the shadows and provide them  with a pathway to citizenship, including those very brave workers who  have courageously kept our economy going in the middle of a deadly  pandemic.   As I mentioned earlier, we will take on the existential threat of  climate change by transforming our energy system toward renewable  energy and energy efficiency. Among many other provisions in terms of  climate change, we will establish a Civilian Climate Corps which will  give hundreds of thousands of young people good-paying jobs and  educational benefits as they roll up their sleeves and get to work to  help us save the planet.   This budget proposal will make it easier, not harder, for workers to  join unions in America.   My Republican colleagues are upset that we are using the  reconciliation process and only 50 votes to pass this budget. They are  very upset about that. But let us be clear. This idea of using  reconciliation is certainly not a new idea. When Republicans controlled  the Senate, they used reconciliation to pass trillions of dollars in  tax breaks to the top 1 percent and large corporations.   When Republicans controlled the Senate, they used reconciliation to  make climate change worse by opening up the Arctic National Wildlife  Refuge for oil drilling.   When Republicans controlled the Senate, they tried to use  reconciliation to repeal the Affordable Care Act and throw 32 million  Americans off of the healthcare they had.   Well, today, it is true we will also use reconciliation, but we will  do it in a different way. We will use it to help the working families  of our country and not just the wealthy and the powerful.   It is no great secret that millions of Americans are giving up on  democracy, are moving toward authoritarianism, and are losing faith in  their government. Many of those people are working longer hours for  lower wages; they can't afford healthcare; they can't afford to send  their kids to college; and they worry very much about the future of  their kids and the future of this country.   This legislation will not only provide enormous support-- unprecedented in recent American history--to the children in our  country, to the parents in our country, to the elderly people in our  country, to the working families of our country, but it will also, I  hope, restore the faith of the American people in the belief that we  can have a government that works for all of us and not just the few.   Thank you.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in  order to call up the following amendments, that they be reported by  number, and that the Senate vote in relation to the amendments in the  order listed with no amendments in order prior to a vote: Barrasso No.  3055, Carper No. 3330, Thune No. 3106, and Cortez Masto No. 3317.    I yield the majority's remaining time on the resolution.    Madam President, Mr. Barrasso's amendment is  interesting, when he talks about the Green New Deal. The only problem  is what he is talking about has nothing to do with the Green New Deal.   Despite what Senator Barrasso says, the Green New Deal would not ship  jobs overseas. In fact, it will create millions of good-paying jobs in  the United States of America. It will not raise electricity prices. It  will not make the United States dependent on dirty sources of energy  from other countries.   In case the Senator from Wyoming has missed it, Oregon is burning,  California is burning, Greece is burning. There is a drought hitting  virtually every country on Earth. News flash: Climate change is real  and the United States and other countries have got to address it.   Madam President, as a supporter of the Green New Deal, I have no  problem voting for this amendment because it has nothing to do with the  Green New Deal.                          Vote on Amendment No. 3055     Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that following  the Cortez Masto amendment the following amendments be in order and  that the amendments be reported by number with no amendments in order  prior to a vote in relation to the amendment: Lummis, No. 3104; Hassan- Young, No. 3278, Crapo, No. 3099; Wyden, No. 3365; Cramer, No. 3105;  Scott, No. 3073; and Rubio, No. 3097    Mr. President, I would urge my Republican colleagues to  read the recent IPCC report. And if they did, they would find that it  is now unequivocal that climate change is caused by human activity.   We are seeing what climate change is doing with our own eyes. We can  no longer be blind to this reality. We are seeing the intensity and the  increase in forest fires. We are seeing more extreme weather  disturbances. We are seeing rising sea levels that will soon threaten  the habitability of great American cities like Miami, New York, and  Charleston. We are seeing the acidification of the oceans that threaten  fishing and marine life. And we are seeing an increase in disease.   We have got to move away from fossil fuel. We have got to end  fracking.   I urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment.                          Vote on Amendment No. 3105     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following  the Rubio amendment, the following amendments be in order; that the  amendments be reported by number, with no amendments in order prior to  a vote in relation to the amendment: Shelby, No. 3293; Grassley, No.  3251; Wyden, No. 3569; Mr. Tuberville, No. 3113; Ms. Klobuchar, No.  3731.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that, following  the Braun amendment, the following amendments be in order, that the  amendments be reported by number, with no amendments in order, prior to  a vote in relation to the amendment: Fischer 3128, Ernst 3115, Scott of  Florida 3383, Young 3444, and Lankford 3792.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following  the Lankford amendment, the following amendments be in order; that the  amendments be reported by number, with no amendments in order prior to  a vote in relation to the amendment: Sullivan, No. 3627; Paul, No.  3150.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following  the Sullivan amendment, the following amendments be in order; that the  amendments be reported by number, with no amendments in order prior to  a vote in relation to the amendments: Wyden, No. 3805; Paul, No. 3150.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following  the Paul amendment, the following amendments be in order, the  amendments be reported by number with no amendments in order prior to a  vote in relation to the amendment: Baldwin 3648, Romney 3652, Moran  3795.    Mr. President, Senator Paul's amendment would slash  Federal spending by trillions of dollars. It would mean massive cuts to  Medicare, to Medicaid, to food stamps, to virtually every Federal  program that impacts working people and low-income people. It would  cause massive suffering.   I urge a ``no'' vote.                          Vote on Amendment No. 3150     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  following amendments be in order; that the amendments be reported by  number, with no amendments in order prior to a vote in relation to the  amendment: Cotton, No. 3680; Blackburn, No. 3062; Cruz, No. 3781.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following  the Cruz amendment, the following amendments be in order, that the  amendments be reported by number with no amendments in order prior to a  vote in relation to the amendment: Hawley 2734; Booker 3823; Hoeven  3243; Marshall 3797; Kennedy 3758.    Mr. President, I rise in opposition to this amendment  that makes it more difficult for Congress to respond to an emergency  when one occurs.   Let us be clear. There is no reason to hold up Federal dollars to  help people recover from a natural disaster while Congress searches for  revenue or spending cuts to pay for emergency assistance.   This amendment would create a supermajority hurdle for the Senate to  declare something an emergency. When people are suffering after a  hurricane or a wildfire, we should not be creating additional barriers  to them getting the help they need.   Congress has provided exemptions for emergency spending ever since  the budget process started a pay-as-you-go system. This helps Federal  dollars respond to emergencies in a more timely manner.   Importantly, the 60-vote threshold still exists for emergency  legislation, meaning any bill that includes emergency spending will  still face a 60-vote hurdle. There is simply no need to make getting  urgently needed money out of the door one step harder. I urge my  colleagues to vote no on this amendment.    Madam President, this amendment is a poison pill that  would defeat everything that many of us are trying to accomplish  tonight in this historic budget: no reduction in childhood poverty; no  expansion in childcare, pre-K, or Medicare; no investment in affordable  housing or home healthcare; no paid family and medical leave; no effort  to combat the existential threat of climate change; no creation of  millions of good-paying jobs. Using an arbitrary inflation number, it  would end all of that. This amendment must be defeated.                          Vote on Amendment No. 3815     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  following staff members from my staff and from Senator Graham's staff  be given all-access floor passes for consideration of the resolution:  majority staff, Michael Jones, Joshua Smith, Melissa Kaplan-Pistiner,  Billy Gendell, and Liam Fagan; Republican staff, Nick Myers, Matthew  Giroux, Matthew Joe Keeley, Becky Cole, and Krisann Pearce.
