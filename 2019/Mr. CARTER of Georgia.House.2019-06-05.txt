 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Fort  Stewart-Hunter Army Airfield for winning the 2019 Commander in Chief's  Annual Award for Installation Excellence.   Conferred by the Department of Defense, installations compete based  on a number of categories, including unit morale, installation  management, safety, health, community relations, and environmental  stewardship. Fort Stewart-Hunter Army Airfield has won the award a  staggering seven times, most recently in 2015.   I want to thank everyone at Fort Stewart-Hunter Army Airfield, but  especially Garrison Commander Colonel Jason Wolter, whose hard work  enabled the installation to reach such a consistent height of quality.   This award is the culmination of his statement: ``There's no place  other than Fort Stewart or Hunter Army Airfield our soldiers would  rather call home.''   I am proud to have them in the First Congressional District of  Georgia and proud of the work they are doing serving our country.                            ____________________
