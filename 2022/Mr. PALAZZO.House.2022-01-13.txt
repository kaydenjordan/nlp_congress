 Mr. Speaker, today I rise in opposition to H.R. 5746.   Late last night, the Democrats hijacked a bipartisan piece of  legislation that I helped draft to allow NASA to lease property and  help fund their own budget shortfalls. This bill would have been vital  to America's space program and Mississippi's Fourth District, with  Stennis Space Center in our backyard.   To no one's surprise, Democrat socialists, hell-bent on minimizing  the power of American voters, have jammed through their radical agenda  to include this so-called voting rights legislation.   This legislation only does one thing: It ensures that Democrats  remain in power by tipping the scales by limiting your First Amendment  and slashing States' rights.   Why else would the Democrats spend so much time catering to  noncitizens, giving them taxpayer benefits, allowing them to stay in  our country, and now giving them the ability to unconstitutionally vote  in American elections?   Democrats believe that behind every illegal immigrant is a Democrat  voter only waiting for a bill like this to pass.  [[Page H160]]    This legislation shreds our founding documents and bastardizes the  sacred rights of American citizens only to appease a group of  socialists.   We all know that Democrats need every advantage to give them any hope  in November after seeing their Commander in Chief's gross incompetence  and tanking approval ratings. They have the slimmest House majority in  history and an even split in the Senate, stalemated by a few Democrats  who refuse to bow to the demands of this socialist agenda.   Democrats know the American people reject their ridiculous policies,  and we cannot allow them to cheat their way back into power with this  bill.   I strongly urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this hijacked bill.    Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory of the  late Granville Crane, surviving crew member of the USS Indianapolis and  recipient of the Congressional Gold Medal.   Mr. Crane was born in 1925 and turned 95 years old this year. He  joined the ship's crew at the age of 16, one of the youngest crew  members to join at the height of World War II.   In 1945 he participated in a top-secret trip to deliver parts for the  first nuclear weapon ever used in combat and was aboard the same ship  when it was torpedoed and sunk that year.   Hundreds of men went down with their ship, and many more faced  dehydration, shark attacks, and exposure before there was any hope of  rescue. Of 1,195 men aboard, Mr. Crane was one of only 316 who  survived. As Mr. Crane waited to be rescued, he clung to his faith.   Mr. Crane will be remembered as a family man, a hero, a survivor, a  patriot, and a great man of God.   On behalf of the Fourth Congressional District and our great Nation,  we are forever in Mr. Crane's debt. Our prayers are with Mr. Crane's  family at this time. May he rest in peace.                            ____________________
