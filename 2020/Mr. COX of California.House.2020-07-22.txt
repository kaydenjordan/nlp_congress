 Mr. Speaker, today is a great day for public  lands, for land conservation, for outdoor recreation, and for every  American who values these gifts that Mother Nature has provided for our  country.   Last year, we made a promise to the American people to protect their  public lands, our national treasures, by permanently reauthorizing the  Land and Water Conservation Fund as part of the John Dingell  Conservation, Management, and Recreation Act. Today, we are poised to  make good on that promise by passing the Great American Outdoors Act,  which will permanently and fully fund the LWCF. I am proud to be an  original cosponsor of that bill.    These funds have not just protected our Nation's most well-known  national parks, but, over the years, LWCF dollars have also created  parks, ball fields, and other outdoor recreational spaces in every  corner of our country from Alaska to Florida, from Maine to Hawaii.   This also includes many communities in my district, such as Mendota,  Huron, Selma, Sanger, Parlier, Lemoore, Corcoran, Allensworth, Shafter,  Buttonwillow, McFarland, and Arvin, just to name a few.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the bipartisan team of my colleagues and  activists who have worked hard to make this legislation a reality.   There is an old East Asian proverb that says: One generation plants  the trees for another generation to enjoy the shade. Today, we are  replanting those trees.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote in support of this bill.
