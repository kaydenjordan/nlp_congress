 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  Louisiana for holding this Special Order and for his leadership, for  having these discussions at such an important time.   Mr. Speaker, right now, millions of refugees have been displaced from  their homes. Children are being forced to go without food, clothing,  and shelter, and thousands of civilians are being murdered in the  streets.   These are the effects of the Russian Federation's war against the  free and sovereign people of Ukraine. The human cost of this war is  devastating. We need to bring an end to the hostilities. The United  States must stand ready to support the people of Ukraine with the tools  and the weapons necessary to fight against and defeat the Russian Army.   There is another component to our mission that cannot be overstated.  As our NATO allies continue to support President Zelenskyy in Ukraine,  they will face economic retaliation from Russia.   Just this morning, Russia announced that it would halt the sale of  natural gas to Poland and Bulgaria. While this decision will create  difficulties for the people living and working in these NATO countries,  it also provides the United States an opportunity to stand with our  allies and show Putin that his cheap and dirty gas is not needed to  power this war.   President Ronald Reagan once said, ``We know only too well that war  comes not when the forces of freedom are strong, but when they are  weak. It is then that tyrants are tempted.''   Unfortunately, President Biden's energy policies have so far not  shown the strength that this moment requires. It is time to approve the  permits needed to bring more American energy, like coal, oil, natural  gas, and Marcellus shale to the market. We need to supply our neighbors  and our allies with affordable American energy. It is time to promote  American energy dominance and show Russia that its energy reserves do  not give Putin a blank check to attack his neighbors.   America can provide the energy that our friends and allies need. It  is time to come to the aid of Poland and Bulgaria, and it is time to  produce and supply American energy.   Again, I thank Mr. Johnson for his leadership.                                time  1900
