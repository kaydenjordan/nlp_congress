 Mr. Speaker, I rise to address one of the greatest threats  to American safety--Iran.   Iran is the largest state sponsor of terrorism, and from past  actions, we know the regime cannot be trusted. However, over the past 4  years, progress has been made:   Our maximum pressure campaign and sanctions have reined in Iran's  power;   Normalization agreements between Israel and numerous nations in the  region continue to isolate Iran;   The United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Sudan have embraced peace and  cooperation.                                time  1100    At this moment of success, the United States cannot back down. We  cannot return to one-sided deals that strengthen Iran.   There is little doubt that without our efforts, Iran will continue  its pursuit for a nuclear weapon and regional dominance. We must  maintain pressure on the regime.   Just last month, the IAEA confirmed what we suspected all along: that  the Iranian regime continues to ramp up its nuclear program. In fact,  it is accelerating its efforts. This is not the time to appease the  Iranian regime. We must stand strong.   Under the Obama-Biden administration, we saw years of failed foreign  policy. We saw years of policy that allowed Iran to continue developing  a nuclear weapon, years of policy that sent pallets of cash to Iran,  years of policy that neglected our alliance with Israel, and years of  policy that allowed Iranian terrorism to thrive across the region.   After the failed Obama-Biden Iran deal was implemented, Iran  continued perpetuating violence, terrorism, and proxy wars across the  Middle East. Iran came closer and closer to obtaining a nuclear weapon.   President Trump has shown there is another way. We do not need to  appease terrorist states and turn our backs on Israel. Instead, the  Trump administration's strength has helped set the conditions for  regional peace. Cooperation between Israel and other Middle Eastern  states is continuing to grow. This change of policy has brought hope.   Peace is possible. But peace does not happen through capitulation,  and it will not happen if we go backwards.   It is clear the U.S. sanctions targeting Iran are working. We need to  [[Page H6056]]  maintain our sanctions against Iran and take decisive steps to prevent  evasion. Sanctions have cut off vital resources that Iran's leaders use  to enrich themselves and spread terrorism. U.S. financial sanctions  make it harder for Iran to fund its ambitions to become a nuclear  power.   Unfortunately, bad actors work hard to get around United States'  sanctions. That is why I co-introduced the Preventing Illicit Finance  Act. This bill supports our maximum pressure campaign and creates a  public-private group to limit the abuse of the financial system by bad  actors like Iran. My bill strengthens the United States' ability to  enforce financial sanctions against Iran, Russia, and other  adversaries.   Our maximum pressure campaign is working. We cannot turn a blind eye  to Iran's aggressions and pursuit of terrorism. Iran must be held  accountable.   By strengthening our sanctions enforcement and maintaining our tough  approach, we can prevent Iran from becoming a nuclear power.                            ____________________
