 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to acknowledge the work of  Chairman Lamar Smith of the Congressional Dyslexia Caucus. His work on  this important issue has brought much-needed attention in Congress to a  learning disability affecting as many as one in five Americans.   He championed the READ Act, which mandated that the National  Institutes of Health direct specific funds towards dyslexia research.  This law is deepening our understanding of dyslexia and providing  additional tools for us to help those with this learning disability.   Last week, I began serving as co-chair of the Dyslexia Caucus,  alongside Congresswoman Julia Brownley. It is my hope that we can work  together to continue the impressive work of Chairman Smith and effect  positive change for those living with dyslexia.   Individuals can overcome dyslexia and achieve greatness in their  education and careers when they have the right tools and instruction.  We will work hard in Congress to give them what is necessary to  succeed.   Mr. Speaker, I again thank Chairman Smith for his leadership and  lifetime of dedication.                            ____________________
