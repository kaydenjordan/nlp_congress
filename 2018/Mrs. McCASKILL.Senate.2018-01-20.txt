 Mr. President, I would like to once again state for  the record of this august body that the very first effort that was made  after the vote was declared to not pass the CR was my standing at this  podium and asking unanimous consent for us to pass my amendment that  would pay the military and the death benefits. That was objected to by  the majority leader. I am hopeful that this will get worked out  quickly. The last time we had this kind of dysfunction in the  government, we did this by unanimous consent very quickly, so there  wasn't even a hint that anybody in this body was not 100 percent behind  making sure our military got the pay they deserve. I am hopeful that  this will be done yet today. I think it would be good if we could do it  today, but certainly no later than tomorrow we need to take care of  that because I am guessing every single Senator will support it without  anyone objecting.                       Remembering Frankie Muse Freeman    Mr. President, the reason I rise today is because I had to miss a  very, very important event in St. Louis this morning. There was a going  home celebration for a warrior in St. Louis this morning.   I have been blessed to have the opportunity to meet so many amazing  people in my journey serving the public. I don't think anybody I have  met could in many ways stand up to Frankie Freeman. Frankie Freeman was  a woman who had a very simple goal in life. Her goal was to do  everything she could to eliminate discrimination.   Frankie was born in November of 1916. She was one of eight children.  She was raised in a segregated neighborhood in Virginia, and she said  that from the time she was a very young girl, she wanted to change the  world.   She met her husband of over 50 years in New York, where he was  attending graduate school. Why was he in New York attending graduate  school when he was from Missouri? He was in New York attending graduate  school because after graduating from Lincoln, a historically Black  college in Missouri, the University of Missouri refused to admit him  and said: Rather than allow you on our campus, we will pay to send you  to New York for graduate school.   Frankie was in New York, and her husband was in New York. They met,  they fell in love, and they got married. Then they moved to the  Washington, DC, area, and Frankie then decided she was going to law  school. She went to Howard Law School. She was 9 months pregnant when  it was time to sign up for her third year of law school.   She went to the dean of the Howard Law School and said: Could you  allow me to join a few weeks late in the term?   He took one look at her, 9 months pregnant, and said: You are going  to have to sit out a year.   She said: I don't want to sit out a year. I have to get this done. I  have work to do. I have justice to seek. I will not sit it out.   So she went out and stood in line to sign up for her third-year  classes literally within days of giving birth. Four  [[Page S384]]  days later, after she finished registering for her third year of law  school, she gave birth. Did that slow her down? No. She went on to  graduate from Howard Law School that year and was No. 2 in her class.   Keep in mind, she graduated from law school. An African-American  woman in America graduated from law school in 1944. That is almost 10  years before I was born. Imagine what life was like for a young Black  woman lawyer in America in 1944.   She had two children--her daughter Shelby and her son, who was also  named Shelby but called Butch. She moved to St. Louis with her husband  and two children.   Butch, by the way, died when he was 11. Shelby remained at her  mother's side and helped her remain active until the last days of her  life.   She moved to St. Louis as a young African-American woman lawyer, and  you can imagine there were no law firms that wanted to hire Frankie, so  Frankie opened her own law office. Her mission was to go after the  institution of discrimination through the courts, and she was fearless,  strong, kind, and polite.   One of the most famous cases Frankie had occurred in 1952--Davis v.  the St. Louis Housing Authority. Keep in mind that in 1952, there was  written policy of the St. Louis Public Housing Authority that said that  the races should not mix; it was unnatural for the races to mix.  Frankie decided she would take that on. She won that case in 1952, and  she went on. It was appealed, appealed, and she went on and won the  appeal in front of the Supreme Court in 1954. I was 1 the year she won  that appeal.   One of the stories about Frankie's life that I think is important to  put in context happened in 1961. You see, she was a Delta. In fact, she  went on to be the president of the Deltas in 1967--a very important  sorority for many accomplished African-American women in this country.  In 1961, the Delta chapter down in Hayti in the Bootheel--right on the  heel--asked her to come down and give a speech. She was famous for  having won this case, and she was honored to be asked to give the  speech.   She didn't have anyone to drive with her, and she was worried about  driving by herself into the Bootheel in 1961. This was a year after  President Kennedy was elected President.   She got on a Greyhound bus. The Greyhound bus stopped at a restaurant  along the way so that people on the bus could use the restroom and get  a bite to eat. Frankie walked into that restaurant in a small town  between St. Louis and the Bootheel, and she was told by the waitress  that she couldn't come in the front door. Keep in mind, she had been  all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, arguing ugly discrimination in  public housing, and this waitress in this restaurant in this small town  told her she could not come in the front door.   Even worse, when Frankie ignored her and walked toward the restroom,  a customer got up and blocked the door so she could not use the  restroom. Frankie wrote about this in her book ``A Song of Faith and  Hope.''   I think about the strength that this woman had by herself in that  situation, and I am filled with awe and admiration. In 1964, Frankie  was the first woman on the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, and she did  so much more than all of the famous cases and trials.   In the midst of her landmark trials and court cases, she became the  president of the Deltas. She later went on to travel and visit many  African nations, serving as a U.S. representative of the United Nations  Conference on Housing.   In 1978, President Carter appointed her inspector general of the  Community Services Administration. She continued to show her commitment  to service as an active member on several boards, including the Howard  University Board of Trustees, the Urban League of Metropolitan St.  Louis as the board chair, and also as the board chair of the National  Council on Aging.   In 2007, Freeman was inducted into the International Civil Rights  Walk of Fame at the Martin Luther King, Jr. National Historic Park in  Atlanta, GA, for her leadership in the civil rights movement. Frankie  had a nickname among people who were touched by her passion and  commitment to that elusive quality known as justice. She was known as  ``Frankie Freedom.''   I had an opportunity to get to know Frankie in the last decade of her  life. I treasured the time I had with her, the encouragement she gave  me, the stories she told me, and the legend that she was. She would  always say to me when I would express frustration--and Frankie said  this throughout her life; she would quote Luke 9:62: ``No one who puts  a hand to the plow and looks back is fit for service in the kingdom of  God.''   Frankie would always say: Keep your hand on the plow. Keep your hand  on the plow. Keep your hand on the plow.   Frankie lived 101 glorious years. She had personal tragedy and  countless setbacks, but she never lost her attitude of love and  commitment to justice. I was so sad to miss her coming home celebration  this morning. She has gone home. There is no question she is reviewing  legal briefs for the Good Lord Himself in Heaven above.   Thank you, Frankie Freedom, for a life well lived.   Thank you, Mr. President.   I yield the floor.
