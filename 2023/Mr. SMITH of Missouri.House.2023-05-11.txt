 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 383,  I call up the bill (H.R. 1163) to provide incentives for States to  recover fraudulently paid Federal and State unemployment compensation,  and for other purposes, and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, this crucial legislation will finally protect taxpayers  and victims of fraud against the largest theft of tax dollars in  American history.   Americans are suffering under a cost-of-living crisis fueled by  Democrats' reckless spending. It has brought us to the brink of  recession and spurred the highest increase in interest rates in 16  years.   It must be infuriating for folks to also see that it is not just the  American Dream that is being stolen from them but their identities and  their tax dollars.   Criminal organizations and foreign fraudsters exploited the pandemic  to steal hundreds of billions in payments intended to keep workers  afloat amidst government lockdowns, and the victims need our help.   How much has been stolen? The Department of Labor inspector general  told the Ways and Means Committee that taxpayers may be on the hook for  at least $191 billion in improper payments, and that is just the lower  estimate. Outside experts estimate up to $400 billion of improper  payments.   While working Americans were trying to piece their lives back  together during the pandemic, Democrats did nothing to fight fraud.  When Democrats held the majority on Ways and Means, they ignored,  blocked, and shot down commonsense safeguards and refused to hold even  one hearing on this fraud.   That inaction made it clear that their soft-on-crime agenda does not  just apply to carjackings and looting department stores. It applies to  defrauding the Federal Government, as well.   During his State of the Union, President Biden said the watchdogs are  back. He rolled out the position of chief pandemic prosecutor at the  Department of Justice. Since then, even as we have discovered more  instances of fraud, the Biden administration official responsible for  prosecuting it has resigned, and the position sits vacant for months.   That is not accountability. We couldn't afford inaction for the last  2 years, and we can afford it even less today.   These are stolen tax dollars, which makes every person in America a  victim of this fraud. Today's vote is an important step toward ending  suffering and delivering accountability.   The Protecting Taxpayers and Victims of Unemployment Fraud Act gives  States the tools they need to go after fraudsters and shores up  vulnerabilities by improving identity verification and modernizing  State UI systems.   It allows States to retain 25 percent of fraudulent Federal funds  recovered. This is a real incentive for States to pursue what can be  costly investigations and prosecutions because now they can use  recovered funds to improve UI program integrity and fraud prevention.  These dollars can go toward hiring investigators and prosecutors to go  after criminals to recover fraud payments. This will also give States  the resources to modernize systems and technology to better verify  identity and income for unemployment and deter, detect, and prevent  improper payments.   This legislation also allows States to keep 5 percent of UI  overpayments recouped in the future to continue to improve benefit  delivery and eligibility verification. This includes matching State  lists against databases, which will help reduce payments to deceased  and incarcerated individuals.   Many of these reform ideas are bipartisan and very long overdue. Some  are supported by the Department of Labor inspector general and were  even included in past budget requests from President Trump and  President Obama. Even Biden has included several of the ideas in the  Protecting Taxpayers and Victims of Unemployment Fraud Act in his most  recent budget request.   I am hopeful House Democrats will join here to also protect taxpayers  and support this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Illinois (Mr. LaHood), chairman of the Work and Welfare  Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds  to the gentleman from Illinois.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Smucker).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds  to the gentleman from Pennsylvania.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the  gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Tenney).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   My colleagues on the other side have noted their objection to this  bill's rescission of unobligated COVID funds sitting unused at the  Department of Labor. They claim these funds are important in combating  UI fraud, but the reality couldn't be further from the truth.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a February letter from the  Missouri Department of Labor and Industrial Relations.                                                 Department of Labor                                          & Industrial Relations,                               Jefferson City, MO, February 6, 2023.      Hon. Jason Smith,      Chair, House Ways and Means Committee, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Smith: Thank you for the opportunity to share       the Missouri Department of Labor & Industrial Relations,       Division of Employment Security's experience in administering       and combatting fraud in the unemployment insurance (UI) and       federal CARES Act programs throughout the duration of the       COVID-19 pandemic.        Missouri's Governor declared a state of emergency on March       13, 2020, and Missouri entered into an agreement with the       United States Department of Labor (USDOL) to administer the       federal CARES Act program on March 28, 2020. In a span of       only three weeks, Missouri realized an increase of over 3000%       in unemployment insurance claims. In addition to the historic       increase in workload, the combination of state and new       federal programs expanding eligibility and dramatically       increasing monetary benefits, rapidly evolving federal       guidance, rampant media coverage, and misinformation made for       an extremely challenging environment for program       administration.        Federal programs, such as Pandemic Unemployment Assistance       (PUA), initially only required self-attestation to qualify       and allowed individuals to backdate their PUA claims, lacked       the checks and balances inherent within the state's regular       Unemployment Insurance program that are a key component of       program integrity. Additionally, eligibility for a single       dollar of benefit under any unemployment program       automatically qualified the individual to receive a       substantial supplemental Federal Pandemic Unemployment       Compensation (FPUC) payment, inviting and incentivizing       individuals and bad actors to attempt to collect benefits to       which they were not entitled. Constantly changing guidance       for the CARES Act programs added to the burden by creating       additional workloads, complexity and confusion. For example,       PUA guidance from the USDOL was amended four times in a       period of less than 6 months, and much of the amended       guidance applied retroactively to the beginning of the       pandemic assistance period for claims already processed.        Fortunately, in 2016 Missouri replaced its legacy mainframe       system with a modernized unemployment insurance application.       Prior to the pandemic, Missouri had existing identity       verification and fraud detection tools in place. This gave       Missouri the ability to address the CARES Act program       implementation challenges and successfully identify potential       threats and prevent both small and large-scale fraud attacks       that plagued some states, with nationwide estimates of       potential fraud overpayments exceeding $45 billion according       to the USDOL--Office of Inspector General (OIG). However, in       response to unprecedented fraud attacks, Missouri       continuously reviewed and modified its fraud detection tools       and methods. As a result, funding administered by the USDOL       for improved program integrity was mostly leveraged for the       provision of additional staffing resources to address the       increased volume of work and support enhancement of the       existing technologies.        More recent funding opportunities, such as the Equity and       Tiger Teams grants, provide limited flexibility to address       program integrity and ongoing fraud prevention strategies.       The Equity Grant is focused on improving recipiency and       equitable access to the UI program. The Tiger Teams grant       identifies three focus areas to be addressed, ``equity and       access, backlogs and timeliness, and integrity.'' Bad actors       are constantly striving to find new innovative ways to       defraud benefit programs and avoid detection. As such,       Missouri must continue to innovate and invest in fraud       prevention strategies and tools that prevent our states and       our citizens from becoming the next victims. The existing       use, at the federal level, of the Resource Justification       Model for funding UI administration and one-time grant       opportunities, fall short in meeting this need. Therefore,       prioritization should be given to consistent funding that not       only permits states to implement proven strategies and tools       to combat fraud but also provides states the ability to       support and maintain these solutions into the future.        Missouri will continue to place UI program integrity as a       critical priority. I appreciate this opportunity to share       Missouri's experience with the challenges we faced       administering the federal programs throughout the pandemic.            Sincerely,                                                       Anna S. Hui,                                               Department Director.     In it, my State's workforce directory notes  their experience with tiger teams.   It says: ``More recent funding opportunities, such as the equity and  tiger team grants, provide limited flexibility to address program  integrity and ongoing fraud prevention strategies.''  [[Page H2288]]    This doesn't sound like a glowing review.   I welcome Democrats to share any information that they have that the  Department of Labor's efforts have helped us recover dollars for  American taxpayers.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Kansas (Mr.  Estes).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds  to the gentleman from Kansas.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Steel).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Carey).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Utah (Mr. Moore).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Murphy).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Malliotakis).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Democrats are falsely claiming that this bill claws back relief funds  from Americans who received an overpayment through no fault of their  own.   The language in this bill is crystal clear. It is focused on  recovering overpayments due to fraud. That means intent on the part of  the individual. Existing law already protects individuals who receive  overpayments through administrative error or otherwise. In fact,  section 2401 of the CARES Act allows States to waive overpayments on a  case-by-case basis if the payment would be contrary to equity and good  conscience.   This bill also explicitly states in section 2(a)(2) and section  2(a)(3) that ``the State agency may retain 25 percent of any amount  recovered from overpayments of pandemic emergency unemployment  compensation''--this is the one you need to understand--``that were  determined to be made due to fraud.'' Not overpayment. Due to fraud.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Yakym).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   The only way that this bill punishes American families are American  families who are fraudsters, American families who intentionally create  and commit fraud. Give me a break.   After years of inaction when Democrats held the majority, taxpayers  have lost anywhere from $191 billion upward to $400 billion in fraud,  and their identities have been stolen.   Democrats ignored it. They blocked it, and they shot down commonsense  safeguards. Guess what? They refused to hold even one hearing on fraud.   American workers, families, and small businesses are already dealing  with a cost-of-living crisis, and they deserve better. That is why they  elected a Republican majority on the promise of a government that is  accountable.   Today's bill delivers on that accountability with commonsense reforms  that empower the States to make things right. With this vote, we will  end the greatest theft of taxpayer dollars in American history.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to do  the right thing and vote in favor of this bill and against fraud.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
