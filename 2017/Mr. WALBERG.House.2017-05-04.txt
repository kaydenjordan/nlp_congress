 Mr. Speaker, regardless of the myths being spun by the  other side of the aisle that refused to read 129 pages of a bill, the  Affordable Care Act is anything but affordable.   My constituents have been asking for relief from this collapsing law  for years. They can no longer afford to pay more for less; and refusing  to act is not an option.   Under ObamaCare, out-of-pocket expenses have skyrocketed not just for  people on exchanges, but for all patients. Premium increases are nearly  four times larger than previously projected.   Unfortunately, our colleagues on the other side of the aisle, Mr.  Speaker, seem content with the current flawed system which puts the  government in charge of people's health and promises coverage that is  going away.   Let's vote to increase choice, lower costs, enhance protections,  truly cover preexisting conditions, and get Washington out of the way  so that patients and their doctors are once again at the center of  healthcare decisions.
