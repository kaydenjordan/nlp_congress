 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  be in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak  therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for as  long as I may require.    Mr. President, the Senate majority leader, Senator  Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, will become the longest serving Senate  Republican leader in history, surpassing former Senator Bob Dole of  Kansas. This is according to the Senate historical office. Today is  Senator McConnell's 4,179th day as Senate Republican leader--a position  he assumed on January 3, 2007, after Republicans lost control of both  Chambers of Congress.   I would like to take a few minutes to put Senator McConnell's  leadership in perspective. That perspective begins in the year 1969. I  was 29 years old and working in the Nixon White House. Senator Howard  Baker, Jr., of Tennessee, said to me: ``You might want to get to know  that smart, young legislative assistant for Marlow Cook.'' Marlow Cook  was Kentucky's newly elected Republican Senator. That smart, young  legislative assistant was 27-year-old Mitch McConnell.   If one has known him for a long time, the evolution of Mitch  McConnell's Senate leadership isn't hard to trace. To begin with, when  he was 2 years old, the doctor said: ``Mitch has polio.'' It is hard to  imagine today how terrifying those words were for parents then.  McConnell remembers:         It was 1944. There was a serious epidemic that year all       over the country. And the disease was very unpredictable.       First, you'd think you had the flu, and a couple of weeks       later, some people would be completely normal and some of       them would be in an iron lung or dead.    He continued:         In my case, it affected my left quadriceps, the muscle       between the knee and your thigh. And in one of the great good       fortunes of my life, my mother was living with her sister in       this little crossroads of Five Points, Alabama, where there       was not even a stoplight--while my dad was overseas fighting       the Germans--and it happened to be 60 miles from Warm       Springs, where President Roosevelt had gone [to treat his own       polio]. My mother took me to Warm Springs. They taught her a       physical therapy regimen, and said to do it four times a day       and to keep me off my feet. She watched me every minute and       prevented me from really walking.        My first memory in life is when they told my mother I was       going to be okay, that I'd be able to walk without a limp,       and we stopped at a shoe store in LaGrange, Georgia, on the       way back to Alabama to get a pair of low top shoes, which       were a kind of symbol I was going to have a normal childhood.    If one knows about the determination of Mitch McConnell's mother, it  is not hard to imagine how her son determined as a college student to  be a U.S. Senator, and did; determined to be his party's Senate leader,  and did; and then determined to hold that leadership position longer  than anyone in U.S. history, and has. This was an arduous, two-decade  leadership journey: chairman of the National Republican Senatorial  Committee, counselor to Majority Leader Trent Lott, majority whip,  minority leader, and finally, majority leader.   As for his mother's example, this is what Mitch McConnell said: ``It  sure had to have an effect on me, which was that if you stick to  something, you keep working at it and giving it your best, the chances  are you may actually overcome whatever problem you're currently  confronting.''   A second leadership quality that Mitch McConnell learned early--in a  fistfight--was to not be pushed around. According to McConnell, ``I was  about 7. We lived in Athens, Alabama, and I had a friend across the  street named Dicky McGrew who was a year older than I was and  considerably bigger. He was also a bully and he kept kind of pushing me  around. And my dad called me over and said, `Son, I've been watching  the way he's been pushing you around and I want you to go over there  and I want you beat him up.' ''   So, McConnell says, ``I went across the street and started swinging  and I beat him up and bent his glasses, and it was an incredible lesson  in standing up to bullies and I've thought about that throughout my  life at critical moments when people are trying to push you around.''   As a junior Senator on the Foreign Relations Committee, Mitch  McConnell surprised colleagues when he sponsored sanctions against the  apartheid regime in South Africa, and then  [[Page S3755]]  in 1986, he voted to override President Reagan's veto of those  sanctions, but these colleagues would not have been surprised had they  known McConnell 25 years earlier when he was a student at the  University of Louisville.   He remembers:         The civil rights movement was the defining issue of our       generation. Working as an intern in Congress during the       summer of 1963, I got to see [Martin Luther King, Jr.'s] ``I       Have a Dream'' speech. Then, in 1964, I was an intern in       [Kentucky Senator] John Sherman Cooper's office. Two       important things happened in 1964. Cooper was in the middle       of breaking the southern Senators' filibuster on civil rights       and we nominated Barry Goldwater, one of the few people who       voted against the Civil Rights bill. Honestly, I was mad as       hell about it. And I was so irritated about Goldwater voting       against the Civil Rights bill and defining the Republican       Party in a way that I thought would be unfortunate that I       voted for Lyndon Johnson, which in retrospect was a huge       mistake. But it was a protest vote.    That willingness as a college student to buck his own political party  resurfaced 40 years later in his leadership on First Amendment free  speech issues. In 2006, he cast the deciding vote against the adoption  of a constitutional amendment to prohibit flag burning when most of his  Republican colleagues and almost all of his constituents had a  different point of view. He argued that the First Amendment protects  even personally offensive messages, and McConnell became the Senate's  leading voice against restrictions on political speech under the guise  of ``campaign reform.'' Again, some in his own party disagreed,  including President George W. Bush and Senator John McCain, but he  persisted and on multiple occasions, the Supreme Court has agreed with  McConnell's view of protecting political speech under the First  Amendment.   Two of the three U.S. Senate office buildings in Washington, DC, are  named for Philip A. Hart of Michigan and Richard B. Russell, Jr., of  Georgia, two Senators who were never elected to formal leadership  positions by their colleagues. In this book, Senator McConnell  discusses ``leaders without portfolio'' in some of his writings,  describing occasions when a Senator assumes a major policy role outside  of the confines of formal party or committee leadership. His favorite  was Senator Cooper, whom Mitch has described as ``my role model as a  young man, a man of great conviction, very smart.'' In his  autobiography ``The Long Game,'' Senator McConnell tells of when Cooper  took him to the signing of the Civil Rights Act and, later on, of  watching Cooper's principled questioning of the Vietnam war.   Senator Cooper's example must have influenced his young intern's one- man crusade 20 years later against a repressive junta in faraway Burma.  According to the New York Times, on September 15, 2016, Senator  McConnell ``has been a lead sponsor of every major sanctions measure  against the Burmese government over the last 20 years and has worked  quietly and tirelessly with several administrations to try to bring  democracy to the country.''   ``Unlike South African apartheid, it was a totally unknown cause,''  his foreign policy adviser, Robin Cleveland, told the Times. He  championed the cause of Burma's pro-democracy leader, Daw Aung San Suu  Kyi, who for years was under house arrest. In 2012, when San Suu Kyi  came to Washington, DC, as the new head of government, she traveled to  Kentucky ``to thank [McConnell] for everything he did for us over,  well, two decades. That's a long time,'' she said.   Of course, in order to be the Senate leader, one first has to be  elected to the Senate. In Mitch McConnell's early career, one can find  multiple clues that point to his fascination with political campaigns  and the pugnacious style with which he wins them. Of course, an early  signal was the fistfight with Dicky McGrew. Another: ``I was the only  14-year-old in America watching political conventions from gavel to  gavel [and] I began to practice the craft and see if I could get good  at it.'' When he was elected president of his high school student body,  he remembers, ``I was hooked.'' At the University of Louisville, he  campaigned for president of student council both in college and in law  school, participated in civil rights marches on the State capitol, and  as president of the College Republicans, persuaded Barry Goldwater to  come to campus to speak.   He did learn the craft of the politics, and he did get good at it. He  is undefeated in his own political campaigns, winning six Senate races  in Kentucky, more than any other Commonwealth Senator. He has been  elected Republican leader more than any other U.S. Senator, each time  unanimously, and he has been proficient in not just his own races.   In 2010 and 2012, the Senate Conservative Fund helped nominate  Republican candidates in five States who lost the general election when  more mainstream conservative nominees might have won. So, in 2014 and  2016, McConnell organized an effort to defend incumbent Republican  Senators who were challenged in primaries. He was successful in every  case, including his own primary. This is what he said:         We were not going to allow [what happened in 2010 and 2012]       to happen anymore. And so we got the most electable people       nominated who basically took them on, because if you're       dealing with a group of people who think compromise is a       dirty word and who always want to make a point but never want       to make a difference, the only thing to do if you want to win       the election is to beat them.    Mostly, Mitch McConnell's political skills were born of necessity. In  July 1984, he was 34 points behind in his challenge to incumbent  Democrat Senator Dee Huddleston. McConnell discovered that his opponent  had been making speeches for money--now, that was legal then--but Dee  Huddleston had been missing Senate votes to make those speeches. So  McConnell ran an ad featuring a Kentucky hunter with bloodhounds  looking for Senator Huddleston to get him back to work. In another ad,  the dog treed the Senator right at the end of what became known as  ``the bloodhound campaign.'' McConnell defeated Huddleston by fourth- tenths of 1 percent of the vote.    I have searched in vain for early clues to one more aspect of Mitch  McConnell's leadership style: his parsimonious use of words. Sometimes  he reverts to absolute silence. In his autobiography, he admits he only  speaks to the press when it is to his advantage. He also tells of when  Microsoft founder Bill Gates visited him and the two of them just sat  there waiting for one to speak, making others in the room  uncomfortable. At another time, someone once told President George W.  Bush that Mitch McConnell was excited over a certain vote, and  President Bush replied: ``Really, how can you tell?''   Why so few words? McConnell's answer is, ``I learn a lot more by  listening. And so frequently I start out by listening and think about  what I want to say before I say it. You don't get in trouble for what  you don't say. There's nothing wrong with being cautious about your  comments. I certainly don't mind talking but I usually like to know  what I'm talking about before I venture down that path.''   He is not the first Senate leader to be frugal with words. According  to columnist Bob Novak, former majority leader Mike Mansfield was the  most difficult interview on ``Meet the Press'' because ``I would ask  Mansfield a question and he says `Yep,' and then I would ask him  another one and he'd say, `Nope' and I'd run out of questions.'' Former  Vice President Dick Cheney, in his constitutional capacity as President  of the Senate, would attend weekly luncheons of Republican Senators,  rarely saying a word. This made certain that, when Cheney did rise to  speak, Senators listened. And silence, after all, was one of Benjamin  Franklin's 13 virtues and a tactic Franklin often employed in his  leadership style.   In July 2014, when he was minority leader, Senator McConnell spoke on  the Senate floor about what kind of majority leader he would be if  Republicans won the majority in the November elections. His model, he  said, would be Mike Mansfield, the Democrat who was majority leader 45  years earlier when McConnell and I were Senate aides. ``What I meant by  that,'' he said, ``was . . . first of all, you have to open the Senate  up. The last year of the previous [Democrat] majority (2014) there were  only 15 roll call votes on amendments the entire year. In the first  year of our majority, in 2015, we had over 200. Open the Senate up, let  people vote. Number two, we needed regular order, which means the bill  is actually worked on together in committee, comes out to the floor,  with bipartisan support, and has a better chance of success. The best  example I can think of  [[Page S3756]]  was the bill to rewrite `No Child Left Behind.' The law had proved to  be unworkable and unpopular. And by the time it came out of committee,  you had the Democrats and the Republicans lined up, it went to the  floor, it was relatively open for amendments, not that absolutely  everybody got everything they wanted, and in the end, it passed with a  very large majority. President Obama called it a `Christmas Miracle'  and the Wall Street Journal said it was `the largest devolution of  federal control to the states in a quarter-century.'''   McConnell is quick to list a series of bipartisan accomplishments  during his time as majority leader which he regards as ``concrete  legislative results for the American people.'' In addition to the first  significant education reform since 2002, these accomplishments include  the first significant reforms to Social Security since 1983, the first  trade promotion authority bill since 2002, the first long-term highway  bill since 2005, and the first major legislation to confront the  Nation's opioid crisis. And don't forget, he says, measures to protect  victims of human trafficking, to address Puerto Rico's fiscal crisis,  to sanction North Korea, to strengthen the Nation's cybersecurity  defenses, to reform Medicaid and to provide permanent tax relief for  families and small businesses. These are serious accomplishments for a  legislative body many had written off as irredeemably broken.   ``Now, what do all these things that we have done time after time  under our majority have in common?'' he asks. ``In a time of divided  government, we're focusing on the things that we can agree on, and do  those. Because when people elect divided government, I think what  they're saying is, I know you have big differences, but why don't you  look for the things you agree on and do those. And that's how this  majority is totally different from the previous one.''   To gather other clues for what kind of majority leader McConnell  would be, one only had to look to previous Congresses when he was  minority leader and was at the center of four major, bipartisan  legislative efforts that helped to keep the American economy from being  seriously damaged. At the end of 2010, the country was facing a tax  ``cliff.'' Republicans controlled neither the White House nor Congress.  With an economy still reeling from the Great Recession, the expiration  of tax relief threatened to further imperil the economy; yet Senator  McConnell led a bipartisan effort to ensure that taxes were not raised  on any Americans.   The next year, the United States was on the verge of defaulting on  its debt payments for the first time in history. With the clock ticking  on the full faith and credit of the United States and calamitous  economic consequences staring policymakers in the face, Senator  McConnell negotiated an eleventh hour deal with Vice President Joe  Biden. This measure avoided the devastating economic consequences of  default and resulted in the most significant spending reductions in  recent memory.   In late 2012, the United States risked prolonging the Great Recession  and increasing unemployment due to a series of expiring tax policies  and indiscriminate spending cuts scheduled to take effect on January 1,  2013. Once again, Senator McConnell crafted a bipartisan compromise  with Vice President Biden to avert this fiscal crisis by preventing a  tax increase on a majority of Americans and making the spending cuts in  a more prudent manner.   Finally, in 2013, a standoff involving Federal spending and the debt  limit led to the second longest Federal shutdown since 1980,  threatening thousands of public and private sector jobs, and putting  the economic health of the country in jeopardy. Despite these  challenges, Senator McConnell orchestrated an agreement with then- Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid that reopened the government and  raised the debt ceiling, allowing the United States to continue making  payments on its debt.   The humorist Roy Blount, Jr., who grew up in Georgia has written,  ``You start getting in trouble when you stop sounding like where you  grew up.'' The political corollary is you start getting in trouble when  you stop coming home. This is advice McConnell has not forgotten. He  and his wife, Elaine, go home to Kentucky almost every weekend. He has  kept his eye on Kentucky matters, both large and small, including  disposal of chemical weapons that have long been stored in the middle  of Kentucky, enacting a tobacco buyout to help local farmers, support  for the State's public universities, and his advocacy for workers at  the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant. Kentucky anglers and tourists  appreciate his helping to enact a law to require the Army Corps of  Engineers to allow fishing below the dams on the Cumberland River.  Twenty years ago, he created the McConnell Center at the University of  Louisville, attracting a bipartisan parade of national leaders to visit  with 10 scholars chosen each year from each undergraduate class.   Each year, Mitch McConnell buys 12 season tickets to the University  of Louisville football games. He said:         I have some regulars. We go to every home game and       occasionally an away game. We make a day of it. We go out       early. One of my friends has an RV in the parking lot and we       will talk about what will happen in the game and then go to       the game and then we talk about what did happen after the       game and it's a complete, lengthy exercise. And one of the       great joys of life.    Mitch McConnell's University of Louisville honors thesis on Henry  Clay tempted him to pursue a Ph.D. in American history and a career as  a professor, but those of us who know him doubt that he would have been  satisfied interpreting the action rather than being in the middle of  the action, but his devotion to American history and his understanding  of the importance of the U.S. Senate as a unique institution in  American life have contributed a valuable extra dimension to his Senate  leadership.   In a 2016 C-SPAN interview, he was asked: ``What would you like for  high school American history teachers to tell their students about the  United States Senate?''   He replied:         That the Senate has been the indispensable legislative       body. Because that's the place where things are sorted out,       the place where only rarely does the majority get things       exactly their own way, the place where stability can occur.    And at a time when many Americans are not optimistic about our  country's future, he was asked: ``What would you want those teachers to  tell students about their future in this country?''   Mitch McConnell replied:         Because of our woeful ignorance of American history we       always think the current period we're in is tougher than       others. We've had nothing like the Civil War period. We       haven't had a single incident where a Congressman from South       Carolina came over and almost beat to death a Senator from       Massachusetts. America's had plenty of tough challenges.       World Wars. Depressions. This is a great country. We're going       to deal with whatever our current problems are, and move on       to another level. And I'm just as optimistic as I ever was       that this generation is going to leave behind a better       America than our parents left behind for us.    I thank the Presiding Officer.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
