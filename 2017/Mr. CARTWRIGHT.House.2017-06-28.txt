 Mr. Chairman, here we are dealing with some amount of  irony with H.R. 1215. The year 1215 was the year the Magna Carta was  signed, something that created the seeds of the American right to jury  trial, for Heaven's sake.   You know, we were pleased to hear Representative Duncan from  Tennessee say: ``Conservatives believe strongly in the jury system.''  And I do, too, and Americans do, too. Our Founding Fathers believed in  it.   Here in America, where we trust juries to decide life and death for  criminal defendants, why wouldn't we trust them to set a proper and  fair dollar amount on a malpractice case?   By definition, these are meritorious cases, cases where there was  actual negligence, actual recklessness, actual intentional harm by  healthcare providers or nursing homes.                                time  1515    But maybe most importantly, none of us, nary a soul in this House  would deny that standing up for veterans and our military families is a  core value for all of us. This is a bill that prevents accountability  for harm done to military and veterans of the VA system.
