A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide  a credit to small employers for covering military spouses under  retirement plans; to the Committee on Finance.   Mr. President, I rise today, along with my colleague Senator Hassan,  to introduce the Military Spouses Retirement Security Act. This  bipartisan bill would help spouses of active duty service members save  for retirement by expanding access to employer-sponsored retirement  plans.   According to the Employee Benefits Research Institute, American  households face a retirement savings gap of $3.7 trillion. The Center  for Retirement Research estimates an even larger gap of $7.1 trillion.  When asked about their retirement preparedness, only 57 percent of  Americans believe they will be able to live comfortably in retirement.   There are many reasons why American households struggle to save for  retirement, including the shift away from employer-based ``defined  benefit'' plans and rising health care and long-term care costs. Longer  life spans increase the risk of outliving retirement savings. The  economic and health impacts of the COVID-19 crisis are also posing a  threat to retirement security.   Spouses of active duty service members face an additional hurdle to  saving for retirement. According to the Department of Defense, about  one-third of military service members experience a permanent change of  station move every year. When a service member moves, their spouse  often relocates with them, putting their own career on hold.   Following a move, a military spouse may face periods of unemployment,  where they are not able to participate in an employer-sponsored  retirement plan. A 2017 survey found that the unemployment rate for  active duty military spouses was 24 percent, more than five times the  rate for the U.S. population as a whole at that time.   When military spouses find a new job, they often work part-time,  despite preferring full-time work, or are only able to spend a few  years with their employer before moving again. Their limited hours and  short tenure often preclude them from being eligible to receive  employer contributions to their retirement plan or from being fully  vested in their plan.   Increasing access to employer-sponsored retirement plans would  improve the financial security of many military spouses. The bill I am  introducing today would help address this need by providing a tax  credit to small employers who provide military spouses with accelerated  eligibility for retirement plan participation, employer contributions,  and vesting.   My bill would allow small employers--those with up to 100 employees-- to claim a tax credit of up to $500 per year per military spouse. The  credit would be available for three years per military spouse. The  amount of the credit would be equal to $200 per military spouse, plus  100 percent of all employer contributions for that spouse, up to $300.   To receive the tax credit, small employers must make a military  spouse immediately eligible for retirement plan participation within  two months of hire. Upon plan eligibility, a military spouse must be  eligible for any matching or non-elective contribution available to a  similarly situated employee with at least two years of service, and  must be 100 percent immediately vested in all employer contributions.   Military spouses are the unsung heroes of our country's national  defense. They often put their professional lives on hold, threatening  their long-term retirement security. The Military Spouses Retirement  Security Act would help by encouraging small employers to provide  military spouses with accelerated access to retirement plans and  employer contributions. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.   Thank you, Mr. President.                                  ______                                         By Ms. COLLINS (for herself, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Daines, Mr.          Jones, and Mr. Tester):   S. 4174. A bill to provide emergency appropriations to the United  States Postal Service to cover losses related to the COVID-19 crisis  and to direct the Board of Governors of the United States Postal  Service to develop a plan for ensuring the long term solvency of the  Postal Service; to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental  Affairs.   Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Postal Service Emergency  Assistance Act. I am pleased to be joined by my colleague, Senator  Feinstein, in sponsoring this legislation that would ensure the United  States Postal Service survives the COVID-19 pandemic and advance the  conversation needed to put it on a path to long-term solvency. I would  also like to recognize Senators Daines, Jones, and Tester, who have  joined as original cosponsors.   Throughout its 245-year history, the United States Postal Service has  played a vital role in bringing our country together and moving our  economy forward. The Postal Service allows us to remain connected with  family and friends and helps small businesses reach their customers  around the country.   The Postal Service is also the linchpin of a $1.6 trillion mailing  industry that employs more than 7.3 million people. These jobs are as  varied as paper manufacturers, publishing, printing, catalog companies,  online retailers, and transportation providers.   The COVID-19 pandemic has changed our daily lives in fundamental  ways, and the Postal Service is needed now more than ever. USPS is a  lifeline for Americans across the country, particularly seniors and  others living in rural areas. In a Harris poll conducted in May,  Americans ranked the USPS as the most ``essential'' company amid the  pandemic.   The agency's dedicated employees, like the rural letter carrier in  Columbia Falls, go to work each day, facing increased risk as they  continue to ensure reliable delivery of needed prescriptions, safety- net benefits, and other critical services that might otherwise be  unavailable.   While COVID-19 has underscored the essential nature of the Postal  Service, it has also caused significant declines in first-class and  marketing mail revenues and increased costs, as the Postal Service has  taken additional steps to protect its employees and the public from the  virus.   Even with substantial increases in package volumes during the first  phase of the pandemic, USPS estimates that COVID-19 will increase net  losses and accelerate its cash crisis. If Congress does not act, the  Postal Service warns it could run out of money for payroll within the  next year. This would threaten its ability to continue providing  essential services to the public, as well as support its 630,000  employees, including 3,300 in Maine.   I am committed to ensuring this vital institution survives the COVID- 19 crisis and is positioned to support economic recovery. The  legislation we are introducing today would provide the Postal Service  with up to $25 billion in emergency funding to cover COVID-19- related  losses and other operational expenses.   The legislation also includes several safeguards to ensure these  funds are used only for their intended purpose. The funds would be  appropriated to a separate ``Postal Service COVID-19 Emergency Fund''  rather than the general Postal Service Fund, and these funds would only  be available until September 30, 2022. Prior to accessing these funds,  the Postal Service would be required to certify in its quarterly and  annual reports to the Postal Regulatory Commission that the expenditure  of any such funds is necessary to cover losses or expenses resulting  from  [[Page S4227]]  the COVID-19 pandemic. The Postal Service would also be required to  prioritize the purchase of personal protective equipment for its  employees and conduct additional cleaning and sanitizing of its  facilities and delivery vehicles.   In addition to providing emergency relief, this legislation would  clarify the terms and conditions of the $10 billion loan that Congress  provided to the Postal Service as part of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief,  and Economic Security or CARES Act.   Although the COVID-19 emergency is contributing to the Postal  Service's financing challenges, it did not cause all of its financial  problems. According to the Government Accountability Office, USPS lost  about $78 billion from fiscal year 2007 through 2019. This is why the  legislation we are introducing today would also require the new  Postmaster General and the Board of Governors to present to Congress a  plan to ensure the long-term solvency of the Postal Service.   Growing up in Aroostook County, I experienced the essential nature of  the United States Postal Service every day. As Chairman of the Senate  Aging Committee, I've also seen the indispensable role that the Postal  Service plays for our nation's seniors. The Postal Service Emergency  Assistance Act would ensure the Postal Service is able to continue  fulfilling its essential mission, while also providing for responsible  stewardship of taxpayer funds and laying the groundwork to put the  Postal Service on a path to long-term viability. I urge my colleagues  to support this bill.   Thank you, Mr. President.                                  ______                                         By Mr. REED (for himself, Mr. Brown, Mr. Booker, Mr. Blumenthal,          Mr. Udall, Mr. Cardin, Ms. Warren, Mr. Whitehouse, Mr.          Heinrich, Mr. Van Hollen, Mr. Menendez, Mr. Wyden, Ms. Hirono,          and Mr. Markey):   S. 4181.
