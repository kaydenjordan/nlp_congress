 Mr. Chief Justice, I send a question to the desk for the  House floor managers.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. The question from Senator Wyden for the  House managers:         The Intelligence Community is prohibited from requesting       that a foreign entity target an American citizen when the       Intelligence Community is itself prohibited from doing so. In       2017, during [Director] Mike Pompeo's confirmation hearing to       be the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, he       testified that ``it is not lawful to outsource that which we       cannot do.'' So when President Trump asked a foreign country       to investigate an American when the U.S. government had not       established a legal predicate to do so, how is that not an       abuse of power?    Mr. Manager SCHIFF. It is absolutely an abuse of power. And what is  more, if you believe that a President can essentially engage in any  corrupt activity as long as he believes that it will assist his  reelection campaign and  [[Page S704]]  that campaign is in the public interest, then what is to stop a  President from tasking his intelligence agencies to do political  investigations? What is to stop him from tasking the Justice  Department? If it can come up with some credible or incredible claim  that his opponent deserves to be investigated, their argument would  lead you to the conclusion that he has every right to do that, to use  the intelligence agencies or the Justice Department to investigate a  rival. And when they become a rival, it is even more justified.   But you are absolutely right. If Secretary Pompeo was correct and you  can't use your own intelligence agencies, you sure shouldn't be able to  use the Russian ones or the Ukrainian ones.   And here we have the President on that phone call pushing out this  Russian propaganda, this Russian intelligence service propaganda-- CrowdStrike, the server, as if there was just one server and it was  whisked away to Ukraine; the Ukrainians hacked the server and not the  Russians. A made-for-you-in-the-Kremlin conspiracy theory that  undermines our own intelligence agencies but suits the political  interests of the President.   And his legal agent, Rudy Giuliani, is out there peddling this  fiction. The President himself is out there promoting this fiction,  standing side by side with Vladimir Putin.   But you are absolutely right. It would be a monumental abuse of  power, and it is a monumental abuse of power. And if you don't think  abuse of power is impeachable, well, don't take my word for it. Don't  take, earlier, Professor Dershowitz' word for it or Jonathan Turley's  word for it. Let's look to our Attorney General. This is what he said:  ``Under the Framers' plan, the determination whether the President is  making decisions based on improper motives''--something that Professor  Dershowitz says we are not allowed to consider--``based on `improper'  motives or whether he is `faithfully' discharging his responsibilities  is left to the People, through the election process, and the Congress,  through the Impeachment process. . . . The fact that [the] President is  answerable for any abuses of discretion and is ultimately subject to  the judgment of Congress through the impeachment process means that the  President is not the judge in his own cause.''   Their own Attorney General doesn't agree with their theory of the  case. But again, we don't have to rely on Bill Barr's opinion or Alan  Dershowitz' opinion or my opinion or the consensus of constitutional  scholars everywhere; we can rely on our common sense. The conclusion  that a President can abuse his power by corruptly entering into a quid  pro quo to get a foreign intelligence service or a foreign government  or foreign leader to do their political dirty work and help them cheat  in the election--our common sense tells us that cannot be compatible  with the Office of the Presidency.   If we say it is, if we say it is beyond the reach of the impeachment  power, or we engage in this sophistry and we say: Because you put it  under the rubric of abuse of power--even though that was the Framers'  core offense--and you didn't put it under some other rubric, well, we  won't even consider it--if we are going to engage in that kind of legal  sophistry, it leaves the country completely unprotected from a  President who would abuse his power in this way. That cannot be what  the Framers had in mind.   The Constitution is not a suicide pact. It does not require us to  surrender our common sense. Our common sense, as well as our morality,  tells us what the President did was wrong. When a President sacrifices  the national security interests of the country, it is not only wrong,  but it is dangerous. When a President says, as we saw just a moment  ago, over and over again, he will continue to do it if left in office,  it is dangerous. The Framers provided a remedy, and we urge you to use  it.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, Mr. Manager.    Mr. Chief Justice, on behalf of Senator Menendez, Senator  Brown, and myself, I send a question to the desk for the House  managers.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. Senators Wyden, Menendez, and Brown ask  the House managers:         The President's counsel has argued that the President's       actions are based on his desire to root out corruption.       However, new reporting indicates that Attorney General Barr       and former National Security Advisor Bolton shared concerns       that the President was granting personal favors to autocratic       foreign leaders like President Erdogan of Turkey. The       President has also acknowledged his private business       interests in the country like Trump Towers Istanbul. The       Treasury Department has not denied that the President       directed Treasury and the Department of Justice to intervene       in the criminal investigation of Halkbank, the Turkish state-      owned bank, which has been accused of a scheme to evade       Iranian sanctions. Has the President engaged in a pattern of       conduct in which he places his personal and political       interests above the national security interests of the United       States?    Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I also want to  thank the Senators, again, for your hospitality and for listening to  both sides as we have endeavored to answer your questions. Thank you  for that question.   I think, first and foremost, there has been a troubling pattern of  possible conflicts of interest that we have seen from the beginning of  this administration through this moment, but the allegation here  related to the abuse of power charge is that, in this specific  instance, the President tried to cheat by soliciting foreign  interference in an American election by trying to gin up phony  investigations against a political opponent.   Now, what counsel for the President has said is that what the  President was really interested in is corruption, that he is an anti- corruption crusader. For you to believe the President's narrative, you  have to conclude that he is an anti-corruption crusader. Perhaps his  domestic record is part of what Senators can reasonably consider, but  let's look at the facts of the central charge here.   The President had two calls with President Zelensky, on April 21 and  on July 25. In both instances, he did not mention the word  ``corruption'' once. Released the transcripts. The word ``corruption''  was not mentioned by Donald Trump once.   We also know that in May of last year President Trump's own  Department of Defense indicated that the new Ukrainian Government had  met all necessary preconditions for the receipt of the military aid,  including the implementation of anti-corruption reforms. That is  President Trump's Department of Defense saying there is no corruption  concern as it relates to the release of the aid.   Now, I think we can all acknowledge, as the President's counsel  indicated, that there was a general corruption challenge with Ukraine.  I think the exact quote from Mr. Purpura was: ``Since the fall of the  Soviet Union, Ukraine has suffered from one of the worst environments  for corruption in the world.''   Certainly I believe that that is the case, but here is the key  question: Why did President Trump wait until 2019 to pretend as if he  wanted to do something about corruption? Let's explore.   Did Ukraine have a corruption problem in 2017, generally? The answer  is yes. Did President Trump dislike foreign aid in 2017? The answer is  yes. What did President Trump do about these alleged concerns in 2017?  The answer is nothing.   Under the same exact conditions that the President now claims  motivated him to seek a phony political investigation against the  Bidens and place a hold on the money, the President did nothing. He did  not seek an investigation into the Bidens in 2017. He did not put a  hold on the aid in 2017. But the Trump administration oversaw $560  million in military and security aid to Ukraine in 2017.   In 2018, the same conditions existed. If President Trump is truly an  anti-corruption crusader--but what happened in 2018? He didn't seek an  investigation into the Bidens. He didn't put a hold on the aid. Rather,  the Trump administration oversaw $620 million in military and security  aid to Ukraine, which brings us to this moment.   Why the sudden interest in Burisma, in the Bidens, in alleged  corruption concerns about Ukraine? What changed in 2019? What changed  is that Joe Biden announced his candidacy. The President was concerned  with that candidacy. Polls had him losing to the former Vice President,  and he was determined to stop Joe Biden by trying to cheat in the  election, smear him, solicit foreign interference in 2020.   That is an abuse of power. That is corrupt. That is wrong.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, Mr. Manager.   The Senator from Maine.
