 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize National  Clean Energy Week and the benefits of alternative energy sources.   National Clean Energy Week is a time to recognize and celebrate  innovative policies that allow the United States to limit greenhouse  gas emissions.   Iowa leads the Nation in clean energy production, and Iowans are  constantly seeking ways to make clean energy more affordable,  accessible, and abundant. Just last year, the American Clean Power  Association reported that over 50 percent of Iowa's electricity is  generated by renewable sources, ranking it highest in the United  States.   Clean energy sources, including renewable fuels, organic materials,  wind, and solar, create affordable electricity and power our  transportation sector. Additionally, alternative energy sources bring  jobs and revenue while allowing the United States to remain a global  leader in energy production.   Since taking office, I have advocated for conservative, climate- friendly legislation that promotes alternative forms of energy.  Consumers should always be provided with choices as it promotes  competition for businesses and lowers the cost of goods and services,  which is crucial now with record-high inflation.   I have also introduced bipartisan legislation, such as the Biochar  Research Network Act of 2022, to expand clean energy in the United  States. This bill would create a national biochar research network,  where the benefits of biochar can further be tested and explored.  Research would include how well biochar works to sequester carbon, how  biochar increases crop production, improves marginal soil health,  improves water quality, and reduces the amount of fertilizers and  pesticides regularly used. I was proud that Senator Grassley introduced  the same bill in the U.S. Senate last week.   Additionally, I have supported numerous bills, such as the Lower Food  and Fuel Costs Act, which expands year-round E15, and the Home Front  Energy Independence bill, which would prohibit the imports of petroleum  from Russia while expanding production and availability of biofuels.   Increasing domestic energy production and the use of biofuels would  also help our allies around the world wean off from Russia's dirty oil  and cut off the funding for the Russian war machine.   Iowa's vast farmland is why alternative forms of energy like biofuels  and wind and solar are successful. However, when determining our  Nation's energy strategy, we must analyze geographic composure and  natural resources in the area. Different geographical features allow  for clean energy to succeed, such as solar in the Southwest, natural  gas in Texas, hydropower in the Pacific Northwest, or nuclear energy in  the South.   As we continue pursuing clean energy production, I hope my colleagues  will look to Iowa as an example of an any- and all-of-the-above  approach. In order to leave a healthier planet for our children and  grandchildren, we must enact policies that benefit a wide variety of  energy sources where they work best and flexibility within the States  to do so.   I also wish a happy birthday to Kendyl Willox, who is an amazing  health policy portfolio manager in our office. Happy birthday to  Kendyl.                            ____________________
