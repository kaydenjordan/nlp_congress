 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Last week, the Senate Judiciary Committee considered  several of President Biden's recent judicial appointments.   I would have thought that they would have figured out by now that  they hit rock bottom a few months ago with some of these nominees that  are not out of the mainstream, but they really are far left.   Here are some examples: Nancy Abudu, she endorsed political violence  against conservatives; Todd Edelman used his authority to release a  known criminal who then went on to participate in the murder of a  child; Marian Gaston opposed residence restrictions for convicted child  sex offenders; and DeAndrea Benjamin released violent criminals on  bond, only to watch them offend again.   But not to be outdone, the White House has continued this trend with  Seth Aframe's nomination to the First Circuit. The White House and  Senate Democrats don't have a great track record when it comes to  putting a nominee forward for this seat.   Back in February, I came to the floor to oppose Michael Delaney's  nomination to the First Circuit bench. You will remember that Mr.  Delaney threatened to expose a 15-year-old sexual assault survivor if  she came forward with her story. That is right--he threatened to expose  a 15-year-old sexual assault survivor if she went public.   Well, that was a shameful debacle. Everyone saw it. You would think  the President's team would have learned their lessons. But I think we  were wrong on that, because out of all the talented attorneys and  judges that are in the State of New Hampshire, the President has  nominated Seth Aframe, who is disturbingly similar to Mr. Delaney in  his disregard for victims.   I want to walk you through two of the cases that Mr. Aframe  prosecuted. And these cases are things that should disqualify him from  ever having a seat on the Federal bench.   Now, the first case that we will go to is U.S. v. Carpentino. This  involved a criminal defendant guilty of extreme sexual violence against  a 14-year-old girl with a hearing impairment.   Now, this defendant kidnapped this precious child and took her to an  abandoned motel in Vermont, and he raped her. This defendant had just  been released from a 13-year prison sentence for sexually assaulting  minors in particularly violent ways. In one case, he smothered a little  girl with a pillow while he raped her. This is a violent repeat  offender.   There was no doubt this person was a clear and present danger to the  community. Despite all of this, Mr. Aframe, as the prosecutor in this  case, recommended a sentence far below the probation officer's  suggested guidelines. Can you even imagine hearing this? And then  saying: Let's go light on this guy. Let's go light. Let's go easy on  him.   Now, what we have learned is that it is clear that Mr. Aframe wanted  the low sentence. And I will tell you why, and I am going to use his  own words.   And I think when the Presiding Officer hears this, you will see, this  is someone who is not qualified for the Federal bench. He wanted the  low sentence. He wrote he wanted the low sentence.   And I quote, he said he felt the low sentence will ``incapacitate the  defendant until he is in his 60s. Hopefully, by that time, the danger  that the defendant presents will have subsided.''   Now, think about this. He wants the low sentence because at the end  of that low sentence, the guy would be in his sixties and, you know,  hopefully, by then he won't be such a danger. I tell you, imagine this:  ``hopefully,'' using that. Can you imagine telling this little girl's  family that, hopefully, this rapist won't do it again? Bear in mind, he  had already been in prison for 13 years. He gets out, and he does it  again. And Mr. Aframe is the prosecutor. What does he do? He wants a  low sentence because the guy is going to be in his sixties and maybe he  won't do it. Hopefully, he won't do it again. Hopefully, he won't be a  danger. Hopefully, he will be too old and frail to go rape little  girls. Unbelievable.   This is sickening. And this case alone should disqualify Mr. Aframe.  But there is more. And let's go to this second case.   Mr. Aframe was the prosecutor in United States v. Smith. And this  case, reading this made me absolutely sick to my stomach. It is  repulsive.   Mr. Smith was found guilty of conduct connected to the manufacturing  of child pornography. He created not one or two, but six videos of  himself sexually abusing a 3-year-old girl. Six videos. The details of  the case are far too disgusting to repeat aloud. But to be clear: He  raped a 3-year-old girl on camera.   As prosecutor in this case, Mr. Aframe said the most poignant  evidence of the harm this defendant caused was--and I quote--``the look  of fear in the young victim's eyes.''   Poignant evidence, the look of fear in a toddler's eyes while  somebody is raping her.   Despite this, Mr. Aframe recommended a 60-year sentence, nowhere near  what this sick and depraved and disgusting human being deserved. Mr.  Aframe noted that the perpetrator was a close friend of the victim's  family. He worked to gain their trust for years just to commit these  heinous acts, but Mr. Aframe still recommended a lenient sentence.   But what did the sentencing guidelines recommend? Life in prison. Mr.  Aframe himself noted this in his sentencing memo, but when I pressed  him under oath on why he refused to follow the guideline, he  misrepresented the facts.   So let me set the record straight. The sentencing memo, that Mr.  Aframe wrote himself, stated that the guidelines recommended a sentence  of life in prison. That is what he should have gotten.   Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that a portion of that  sentencing memo be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:   United States District Court District of New Hampshire: United States                          of America v. Brad Smith                         Crim. No. 1:16-cr-00091-JL      united states' sentencing memorandum and objection to defendant's                       motion for a downward variance       I. Background        On May 26, 2015, defendant Brad Smith created six videos of       himself sexually abusing a three-year-old girl. From 12:42       p.m. to 1:47 p.m., the defendant instructed his victim to       perform various sexual acts on him and ultimately placed her       on her back, pulled her diaper around her ankles, and raped       her. The defendant wore Google glasses while he did so in       order to surreptitiously film the abuse.        On April 7, 2017, a jury found the defendant guilty of six       counts of manufacturing child pornography in violation of 18       U.S.C. Sec. 2251(a), for which the Sentencing Guidelines       recommend a sentence of life imprisonment (Total Offense       Level 43, Criminal History Category V). For the reasons set       forth in greater detail below, the government proposes an       incarcerative sentence of sixty years (720 months) to be       followed by lifetime  [[Page S5352]]       supervised release, a sentence which meets the objectives       described in 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3553(a) and accounts for the many       aggravating circumstances in this case.     I think it is so important that we include that in  this. This should have been a life in prison sentence for what was  done.   You know, I will say to my Democratic colleagues what I said about  Michael Delaney's nomination: For the sake of men, women, and children  around this country who are victims of sexual assault, join me in  opposing this nomination if the President refuses to withdraw this  nomination.   Someone who has gone light on sentences that affect these children.  Someone who has committed crimes against these children and then they  have sought to get lesser sentences against these pedophiles and  predators, they have no place on the Federal bench.   Now, this week, my Democratic colleagues will have two opportunities  to oppose individuals that I feel are unfit judicial nominees. The  Judiciary Committee will mark up Mustafa Kasubhai to serve on the  district court in Oregon. Now, there is a reason that, in my opinion,  Mr. Kasubhai is not fit.   He has displayed a disturbing affinity for Marxism. This is something  that we found in his records. Someone who is displaying an affinity for  Marxism has no place on our Federal bench. So I would ask that our  colleagues vote no on him.
