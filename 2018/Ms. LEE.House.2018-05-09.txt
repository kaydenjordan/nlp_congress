 Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of every family  struggling to pay rent, every student facing homelessness, and every  city that is seeing historic communities displaced.   We are facing an affordable housing crisis, and we cannot ignore this  epidemic. Over 38 million families struggle to pay rent and put food on  the table every day because they spend more than a third of their  income on housing. Now, in my district, in the East Bay in northern  California, the average renter in Oakland would be forced to spend a  staggering--mind you, staggering--70 percent of their income on housing  if they were to move today. That is 70 percent. Clearly, the affordable  housing crisis is off the scale in my district.   In April, I sent an email to my constituents asking for their stories  and suggestions on how to address this very important issue. Today I  would like to share just a few of those stories which really touched my  heart.   One woman shared how, being unable to afford a place to live, she had  to put herself in harm's way to have shelter. She said: I stayed in an  unsafe and shared housing situation much longer than I would have had I  been able to find an affordable place to move. I have found a place now  but no longer have any disposable income. I worry that an unexpected  event could lead to being unhoused. I have many friends who are single  mothers with children who are sleeping in cars or bouncing from couch  to couch.   The housing crisis has also taken a devastating toll on seniors in my  district. One woman wrote: Many of my longtime friends and  acquaintances have been forced to move out of the State. My husband and  I have lived in an old place for a long time, and the rent is  relatively low; but the building may be sold, and I don't know what we  would do. I am a cancer survivor and fear moving out of the State would  make me lose my health insurance. I would also have a hard time finding  a new job at 62. We have applied at numerous senior housing apartments,  but all have long waiting lists.   These stories also highlighted the impact of the housing crisis on  public sector workers and students in our community.   One gentleman wrote: As a teacher, I cannot afford to stay in  Oakland. Home ownership is out of the question. Even as a dedicated  public servant, I can't afford to work in urban schools in the Bay  area.   A former student wrote me: I had to withdraw from classes at UC  Berkeley so I could find stable housing and enough income to afford my  monthly rent.   Mr. Speaker, our community, our country, cannot function without  nurses, teachers, or young people living in decent affordable housing.  We need to solve this crisis before it is too late. These stories  represent just a small number of the responses I received. I heard from  many constituents who are delaying having children and passing up  opportunities to open a business or switch careers because they cannot  afford to move or to live where they want to live.   I heard from some residents who live in cars, on couches, or on the  streets because the cost of rent has soared. Now I see, sadly, homeless  camps with sofas, chairs, and tables. So many people have been evicted  with nowhere to go.   Believe you me, there are many more in my district and across America  who are homeless right now: seniors, veterans, single moms raising  children. They have nowhere to sleep at night. We must do better so  that no one is forced to live on the streets. We must do better to  ensure that no child is homeless. And we must do better to ensure that  no senior has to choose between food and rent. We must do better  because there is no option. The affordable housing crisis is tearing  apart families and communities. This is not a partisan issue; it is a  human one.   That is why I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will  cosponsor my affordable housing resolution which I introduced  yesterday, H. Con. Res. 120, and affirm that all people deserve access  to basic living standards. We need to begin this debate, and it needs  [[Page H3838]]  to be bipartisan. People deserve to hear that from their  representatives.   And I hope that these stories which I shared will inspire all of my  colleagues to ask their constituents about this crisis and convince  them to join me in bolstering Federal resources for affordable housing.  We can't delay any longer.   Mr. Speaker, as a person of faith, there is no way that I can stand  by and watch so many people living on the streets without shelter,  without food. They deserve a chance at the American Dream, also.                            ____________________
