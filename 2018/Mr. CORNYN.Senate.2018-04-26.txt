Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that  notwithstanding rule XXII, the cloture motion with respect to the  Grenell nomination be withdrawn; that the time until 1:45 p.m. be  equally divided in the usual form; and that upon the use or yielding  back of that time, the Senate vote on the nomination with no  intervening action or debate; further, that if confirmed, the motion to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table and the President  be immediately notified of the Senate's action.    Mr. President, we have just voted to confirm Mike Pompeo  to be the next Secretary of State for the United States--an essential  member of the President's Cabinet.   There has been a tradition of sorts in this deliberative body to give  some deference to the President on his pick for chief diplomat,  recognizing that foreign governments view the chief diplomat or  Secretary of State as being the personal representative of the  President himself, the thought being that whoever wins the election  deserves the ability to assemble their own team and build a Cabinet  with top brass whom he respects and can work  [[Page S2461]]  well with. That is how the system has worked. The party that lost the  election accepted Cabinet nominees--absent some glaring or egregious  reason not to--and agreed to leave ongoing political battles for  another day.   This is not just some ancient history, by the way. In fact, this week  I have discussed at length many modern-day instances of it. For  example, Condoleezza Rice passed with 85 votes. Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton passed with 94 votes. Secretary Colin Powell sailed  through the process, needing only a voice vote--not even a rollcall  vote--to be confirmed.   All of these men and women were confirmed because all of them had the  qualifications to do the job, and so does Mike Pompeo. It is absolutely  clear that he has both the credentials and the character required to be  a successful Secretary of State. I won't recite all the lines of his  stellar resume because you have heard them before, and we have just  confirmed him.   The point is simply that the man has what it takes for the job. That  is why the ``no'' votes by our Democratic colleagues rang so hollow.  All of their statements have been lacking in any real, substantive  critique. It is clear that their ``no'' vote is primarily a way to lash  out at President Trump because anybody President Trump chooses, they  instinctively and reflexively oppose. It was disappointing, but in  today's environment, it is not all that surprising.   Their obstruction was not only a sad break from the tradition that I  mentioned a moment ago but was also a sorry continuation of the  hyperpartisanship that they have been engaging in with so many of the  President's Cabinet nominees since he took office. Not long ago, Mike  Pompeo was one of the exceptions. Fourteen Democrats and one  Independent supported his confirmation as CIA Director. Yet now, 1 year  later, after his unblemished service as CIA Director, only three are  voicing their support for him. Nothing has changed about the man, about  Mike Pompeo himself, but everything has changed about the way Democrats  view their responsibility in this Chamber, not just to their  constituents but to the Senate as a whole. What has changed is their  disdain for the President himself. It has grown, and they have decided  to take it out on his nominees, which is unfair, of course, but it is  also unwise. Any frustration they have is all the more reason why they  should support a man like Mike Pompeo, who throughout his career has  shown his capacity to exercise good judgment. He is no mere lackey or  political shill--anyone would tell you that--and his experiences speak  for themselves in that regard.   The worst part of this whole debacle is that those who have suffered  the most while we get our act together are the American people. They  are aware--more so, maybe, than some of us--of what is happening across  the world: threats posed by Russia, China, and North Korea, the  unravelling of Syria. They are right to wonder why in the world the  Senate would dawdle and politicize the confirmation of a well-qualified  person and leave the rest of the world in doubt as to who is going to  be representing us as our diplomat in chief. The American people  understand how precarious our situation is in North Korea, which  Admiral Harris of the U.S. Pacific Command has called ``the greatest  threat we face.'' This is not a time for partisanship, for  hyperpartisanship, or for voting reflexively against everybody the  President has proposed as a nominee.   The next Secretary of State will play a vital role in the  negotiations with North Korea. In fact, as we now know, Mike Pompeo has  already taken the initial steps, laying the groundwork and the  foundation for what we all hope will be a successful negotiation on the  denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.   Those are some of the reasons I strongly supported Mike Pompeo's  nomination to lead the State Department, and I hope our colleagues will  somehow find a way to overcome this reflexive opposition to everything  the President has proposed and their hyperpartisan response every time  the President proposes either a nominee or some policy provision.   I yield the floor.    The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator  from Arizona (Mr. McCain).
