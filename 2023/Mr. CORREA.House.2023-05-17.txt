 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, as you know, this week is National Police  Week. I thank every peace officer and law enforcement officer for doing  their service and for protecting our communities day in and day out.   I want to make clear, Mr. Chairman, that no Democrat or Republican  condones a serious assault on any peace officer, period. To the  contrary, we want to help our police officers do their job.   Yesterday, my local Orange County sheriff was here to testify to  address public safety issues. After that meeting, he pulled me aside,  and he reminded me of how hard and long we had worked in Orange County  to gain the trust of the immigrant community--trust that public safety  needs to do their job--to report crimes when they happen and to  cooperate with public safety because police officers need the help of  the immigrant community to do their job.   That is just the fact. This bill threatens to undo decades of hard  work and of building trust between public safety and the immigrant  community.   This bill, in fact, is so broad that individuals can be deported for  actions they are merely accused of.   Let me repeat: People can be deported for actions that they are  merely accused of. We are talking about the ability to deport lawfully  permanent residents, people with green cards.   Do we really want to deport these individuals--many of whom are close  to becoming U.S. citizens--not based on convictions but simply an  accusation?   What about the constitutional notion of innocent until proven guilty?   Mr. Chairman, in this bill a conviction is not required.   One would hope that someone who did not intend or did not cause harm  would never be charged let alone convicted of a crime. However, any  conduct could be considered an assault under this bill, and by the  bill's broad definition, it would make someone deportable even without  a charge and even without a conviction.   It is important to remember that convictions for serious assaults on  a law enforcement officer are offenses today that make someone  deportable under current law. In fact, we have a wide variety of  criminal grounds for deportation, almost all of which require a  conviction.   Mr. Chairman, my amendment is a simple amendment. It is simple. It  requires a conviction. My amendment simply requires a court--a judge-- to decide on the facts and the law before a green card holder can be  deported.   My amendment is simple. It asks for due process under the law.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Nadler).    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the winners  of the 2022 Congressional App Challenge from my district: Jessica  Nguyen, Henry Vu, and Jasmine Chau.   These constituents created a MnewNote study app that improves their  classmates' productivity and academic performance while preventing  mental burnout.   These students are part of the Garden Grove High School's first AP  computer science group where they learned coding and design skills.   Together, these students combined scientifically proven study  techniques, psychological studies on motivation and productivity, and  the result: The MnewNote app.   Madam Speaker, we are proud of Jessica, Henry, and Jasmine. Keep up  the good work.                            ____________________
