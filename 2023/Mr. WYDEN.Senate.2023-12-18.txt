 Madam President, I don't want to make this a bouquet- tossing contest. The fact is, the four Senators on the floor have  together put in decades and decades and decades prosecuting the cause  of clean energy. And the fact of the matter is, we had tried a lot of  things over the years. We tried cap and trade.   I was a strong supporter of Senator Markey's efforts. We tried carbon  taxes. We tried border adjustment. And particularly three of the four  Members over here are from the Finance Committee--they were willing to  take the risk of saying we ought to basically, if not throw the Tax  Code in the garbage can as it relates to energy, get pretty darned  close in terms of creating a whole new set of incentives.   I am going to speak about Martin O'Malley's candidacy here for a few  minutes. But I just wanted to say to these four, we would not have even  gotten a major climate bill out of the Senate Finance Committee to  break 50 years of gridlock. That is how the New York Times described  it: 50 years of trying. And the Finance Committee broke that gridlock.  It wouldn't have happened without these four Senators. I want them to  know that.
