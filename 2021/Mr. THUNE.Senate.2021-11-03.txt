 Mr. President, let me begin this morning by saying how  sorry we are to hear the news about the loss of the former First Lady  Jean Rounds of the State of South Dakota.   Mike and Jean have been friends of ours for many, many years. I was  involved in Senator Rounds' first campaign for office when he ran for  State Senate back in 1990. I have known Jean since I worked in the  administration of late Governor George Mickelson along with her at the  Department of Transportation, and I just can't tell you what a loss it  is for the State of South Dakota.   She was an individual who carried herself with incredible grace,  always kind, had a humility about her that I think people just found  infectious. She was very down-to-earth. She never lost that. As a First  Lady, she conducted herself in a way that represented a great model for  the State of South Dakota, both in her character and her conduct. The  style, the way in which she has served as First Lady, is something that  I think made every South Dakotan proud.   So, today, along with all South Dakotans, Kimberley and I mourn her  loss. We lift up the Rounds family in our prayers, and I hope and pray  that through this time they will feel God's grace and comfort in new  and profound ways. But just a tremendous loss, and I know for my  colleague Mike Rounds, who has been a great partner of mine--we have  been involved in politics together now, in South Dakota, for over 30  years--that he, too, is going to need our support and our prayers in  the days ahead.   This is a tough job under ordinary circumstances, but with the burden  that he has been and will be carrying now into the future, it is going  to be really important that we do everything we can to support him and  stand with him, and today especially with him and his family.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator  from South Dakota (Mr. Rounds).   The result was announced--yeas 78, nays 21, as follows:                        [Rollcall Vote No. 457 Ex.]                                  YEAS--78       Baldwin      Barrasso      Bennet      Blumenthal      Blunt      Booker      Brown      Burr      Cantwell      Capito      Cardin      Carper      Casey      Cassidy      Collins      Coons      Cornyn      Cortez Masto      Cramer      Crapo      Daines      Duckworth      Durbin      Feinstein      Fischer      Gillibrand      Graham      Grassley      Hassan      Heinrich      Hickenlooper      Hirono      Hyde-Smith      Inhofe      Johnson      Kaine      Kelly      King      Klobuchar      Leahy      Lee      Lujan      Lummis      Manchin      Markey      McConnell      Menendez      Merkley      Murkowski      Murphy      Murray      Ossoff      Padilla      Peters      Portman      Reed      Risch      Romney      Rosen      Sanders      Sasse      Schatz      Schumer      Shaheen      Sinema      Smith      Stabenow      Tester      Thune      Toomey      Van Hollen      Warner      Warnock      Warren      Whitehouse      Wicker      Wyden      Young                                  NAYS--21       Blackburn      Boozman      Braun      Cotton      Cruz      Ernst      Hagerty      Hawley      Hoeven      Kennedy      Lankford      Marshall      Moran      Paul      Rubio      Scott (FL)      Scott (SC)      Shelby      Sullivan      Tillis      Tuberville                               NOT VOTING--1               Rounds           The nomination was confirmed.                            ____________________     The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator  from South Dakota (Mr. Rounds).
