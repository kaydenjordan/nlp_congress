 Madam President, the Constitution is the guarantor of our  liberties. So it should come as no surprise that those who crave power  to rule over their fellow men always seek to suspend the Constitution  by declaring and perpetuating emergencies. This is the trick that  always seems to work: Declare an emergency, and exempt yourself from  the constitutional restraints on power that are necessary for the  preservation of a free society. It is a strategy that has existed since  antiquity.   As our Founders enshrined in the Constitution a system of checks and  balances, so too did the founders of the Roman Republic. But when the  crisis emerged, the Romans dissolved the restraints on power. That is  how the Roman Republic died and how Caesar became dictator for life.   There is a touch of Caesarism in the COVID national emergency. The  President told us that the pandemic is over, yet the national emergency  remains.   When the Senate last voted to terminate the COVID national emergency  in March, the White House issued a veto threat. At the time, the White  House said: Although we have made tremendous progress in combating the  virus, the virus continues to pose a risk to the American people and  our healthcare system.   Caesar could not have said it better himself. The administration  demands credit for how it wielded extraordinary powers, but it can  never claim total success, for doing so would rob the administration of  the power it so craves.   Have we forgotten what emergency powers look like? They look like  lockdowns, where livelihoods and lives are destroyed. They look like a  travel mask mandate. They look like robbing children of a full  education. They look like the closure of places of worship. They look  like a vaccine mandate for those working in large companies and the  military. They look like an eviction moratorium in which the CDC claims  the power to destroy contracts and effectively seize private property.   When was the last time you heard the President tell the country it  was time to relax emergency powers?   His actions validate the argument made in Robert Higgs' classic work  ``Crisis and Leviathan.'' Higgs demonstrated that governments justify  the exercise of extraordinary powers during an emergency; but when the  crisis ends, even if government gives back some of the powers, it will  never voluntarily relinquish all its newfound authorities.   We are free from these monstrous policies only because the courts  forced the President to abide by the Constitution. In restoring the  Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment, the Supreme Court held  that ``even in a pandemic, the Constitution cannot be put away and  forgotten.'' It bears repeating.   The Constitution doesn't go away. We don't dissolve the Constitution  just because there is an infection out. The rights you were granted  under the Constitution, the rights that are guaranteed by the  Constitution, remain in place even in a pandemic.   When the Supreme Court ended Biden's eviction moratorium, it found  that ``[T]he C.D.C. has imposed a nationwide moratorium on evictions in  reliance on a decades-old statute that authorizes it to implement  measures like fumigation and pest extermination. It strains credulity  to believe that this statute grants the C.D.C. the sweeping authority  that it asserts.''   The Supreme Court further concluded that our system does not permit  [[Page S6685]]  agencies to act unlawfully. And when the Court struck down the vaccine  mandate, the Court stated:         This is no ``everyday exercise of federal power.'' It is .       . . a significant encroachment into the lives--and health--of       vast number[s] of employees of Federal power.    When the courts restored the people's liberty, you could count on the  Biden administration to express disappointment and claim that disaster  was just around the corner. But the administration, time and time  again, was proven wrong; and, now, even the President himself  acknowledges what is plain to see for anyone willing to recognize what  is in front of one's own face. We are learning to live with COVID.   The one thing he does not seem to acknowledge is that the time for  emergency measures has long since passed. A President should not be  able to unilaterally aggrandize his powers by saying a magic word. If  he will not terminate the national emergency himself, it falls to us,  the people's representatives in Congress, to act and, in the wise words  of one court, remind President Biden that ``there is no pandemic  exception to the Constitution.''   Let us end this national emergency and restore the Constitution.
