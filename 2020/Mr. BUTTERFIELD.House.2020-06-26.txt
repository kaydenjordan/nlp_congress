 Mr. Speaker, I thank Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton  for her years of leadership on this issue.   Mr. Speaker, from 1910 through 1970, thousands of African Americans  from my district, and from your district, Mr. Hice, migrated to  Washington, D.C., seeking employment and better opportunities than  existed in the segregated South. They work and worship, and they pay  their taxes. They own and operate businesses here in D.C. They teach in  the public schools. They are Capitol Police. They clean our offices.   I know very well that some of Ms. Holmes Norton's ancestors  originated in my congressional district.   Mr. Speaker, D.C. residents pay the highest per capita Federal income  taxes in the country. They pay more Federal taxes than residents of 22  States. It is a grave injustice that they don't have representation in  this body.   It is time to say to the citizens of this city that they, too, are  American citizens and deserve to be part of this great Union, with full  rights of citizenship.   What they don't need to hear on this floor today is for Members to  say, ``I will never vote for D.C. statehood.'' That is irresponsible.
