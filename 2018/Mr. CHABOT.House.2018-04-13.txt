 Mr. Speaker, this is National Crime Victims' Rights Week,  and back in 2004, I introduced the Crime Victims' Rights Act, which was  signed into law by President Bush as part of the Justice for All Act.   Under that landmark legislation, crime victims were finally awarded  criminal rights in Federal criminal cases, including the right to  protection, the right to timely notice not to be excluded and to be  heard at all public hearings, the right to confer with the prosecutor,  the right to restitution, the right to a speedy trial, and the right to  privacy.   Several years later, the GAO found that too many victims were not  aware of these important rights and that more needed to be done to  educate victims. You see, in civics class, we all learned about the  rights of the accused, but very little attention is given to the rights  of victims.   Mr. Speaker, as we commemorate National Crime Victims' Rights Week  this week, it is important that we make sure victims know what their  rights are under the law. It is the least we can do to show victims the  respect and dignity that they deserve.                            ____________________
