 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to bring up H.R.  724, which would rescind President Trump's refugee ban on individuals  like the student from Afghanistan who was denied entry, sent back, and  had her visa canceled.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. As previously announced, that unanimous  consent request cannot be entertained.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida.
