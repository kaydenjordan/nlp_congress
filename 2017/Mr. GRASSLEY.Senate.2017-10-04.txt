 Mr. President, I request unanimous consent that the  text of the resolution urging the President of the United States to  allow for the full public release of all remaining records pertaining  to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy that are held by the  National Archives and Records Administration and to reject any claims  for the continued postponement of the full public release of those  records, be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the resolution was ordered to  be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. Res. 281         Whereas May 29, 2017, marked the 100th anniversary of the       birth of President John F. Kennedy;        Whereas nearly 54 years have passed since the tragic       assassination of President Kennedy on November 22, 1963;        Whereas the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records       Collection Act of 1992 (44 U.S.C. 2107 note; Public Law 102-      526) (referred to in this preamble as the ``Records       Collection Act''), directed all Federal agencies to transmit       to the National Archives and Records Administration all       records in their custody related to the assassination of       President Kennedy;        Whereas former President and ninth Director of Central       Intelligence George H.W. Bush declared in his signing       statement for the Records Collection Act that ``[b]ecause of       legitimate historical interest in this tragic event, all       documents about the assassination should now be disclosed'';        Whereas the Records Collection Act established the       Assassination Records Review Board to ensure that Federal       agencies complied with the law;        Whereas the Records Collection Act established a deadline       25 years after enactment for the full public disclosure of       all assassination records whose disclosure was postponed or       that were subject to redaction;        Whereas the 25-year deadline for the full public disclosure       of all remaining assassination records is October 26, 2017;        Whereas the Assassination Records Review Board uncovered       records that were withheld from the staff of the President's       Commission on the Assassination of President John F. Kennedy,       the House Select Committee on Assassinations, and other       Government entities;        Whereas the former Chairman of the Assassination Records       Review Board has publicly commented that records held by the       National Archives and Records Administration should be made       public;        Whereas the National Archives and Records Administration       holds approximately 3,100 fully redacted records and       approximately 31,000 partially redacted records concerning       the assassination of President Kennedy;        Whereas Congress declared in the Records Collection Act       that all Government records related to the assassination       should be preserved for historical and governmental purposes       and eventually disclosed to enable the public to become fully       informed about the history surrounding the assassination;        Whereas Congress declared in the Records Collection Act       that legislation was necessary because the implementation of       the Freedom of Information Act (section 552 of title 5,       United States Code) by the executive branch prevented the       timely public disclosure of records relating to the       assassination of President Kennedy;        Whereas public opinion surveys suggest that a large       majority of the American public supports the full release of       all remaining assassination records;        Whereas Congress recently reaffirmed its commitment to       transparency, accountability, and the public disclosure of       Government records by enacting the FOIA Improvement Act of       2016 (Public Law 114-185; 130 Stat. 538), which codifies a       presumption of openness;        Whereas there is legitimate interest from the academic       community, historical researchers, and the general public in       having access to withheld records for research purposes and       general knowledge; and        Whereas the National Archives and Records Administration       was formed to preserve and document Government and historical       records and to increase public access to those documents:       Now, therefore, be it        Resolved, That the Senate urges the President of the United       States to--        (1) allow for the full public release of all remaining       records pertaining to the assassination of President John F.       Kennedy that are held by the National Archives and Records       Administration; and        (2) reject any claims for the continued postponement of the       full public release of those records.

Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992 and  release all records related to the assassination of President John F.  Kennedy by October 26, 2017, be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the resolution was ordered to  be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. Res. 282         Whereas the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records       Collection Act of 1992 (44 U.S.C. 2107 note; Public Law 102-      526) directed the National Archives and Records       Administration (commonly known as ``NARA'') to establish a       collection of records to be known as the President John F.       Kennedy Assassination Records Collection (referred to in this       preamble as the ``Collection'');        Whereas the Collection includes all Federal Government       records relating to the 1963 assassination of President John       F. Kennedy, including records of Presidential commissions,       congressional committees and investigations, executive branch       agencies, and the judiciary, in addition to a variety of       donated historical materials;        Whereas NARA has compiled a JFK Master System database of       319,106 documents comprising 5,000,000 pages of       assassination-related records, photographs, motion pictures       and recordings, and artifacts; and        Whereas the processing team at NARA, including archivists       and technicians from the Special Access and Freedom of       Information Act staff, staff from the Office of Innovation,       and Public Affairs staff, have worked diligently to fully       release records related to the assassination of President       Kennedy: Now, therefore, be it        Resolved, That the Senate commends the National Archives       and Records Administration and its staff for working to       comply with the President John F. Kennedy Assassination       Records Collection Act of 1992 and release all records       related to the assassination of President John F.
