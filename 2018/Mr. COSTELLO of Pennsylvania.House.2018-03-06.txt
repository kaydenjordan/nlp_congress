 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R.  4986, RAY BAUM'S Act of 2018, named after the late Ray Baum, who  dedicated his life to public service.    Mr. Speaker, this bill includes important provisions to modernize our  telecommunications agencies and to craft policies that will fuel next  generation services like gigabit service and 5G networks. We are going  to increase access to information and services for millions of  Americans with this bill, Mr. Speaker.   5G networks mean doctors can more effectively treat patients that  live hours away from the closest hospital, automated vehicles can offer  mobility to our Nation's most vulnerable, small or rural businesses can  compete beyond their local markets, and it means that first responders  can more quickly reopen critical lines of communications in the  aftermath of a natural disaster.   By passing this bill, we can fully realize the benefits of an  interconnected and increasingly wireless world. I urge my colleagues to  support H.R. 4986.
