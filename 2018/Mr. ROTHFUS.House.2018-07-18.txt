 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of this amendment,  a narrow amendment which simply prohibits any funds from going toward  the District of Columbia from seizing property of citizens not in  compliance with the District's individual healthcare mandate. It is a  narrower amendment than the one we just debated.   My amendment does not take away the mandate. It simply says one of  the remedies cannot be the seizure of property if an individual does  not comply with the mandate to buy health insurance.   The individual mandate is, of course, controversial. Even Barack  Obama opposed it when he was running in 2008. In one of the debates in  the 2008 primary, then Senator and Presidential candidate Obama said:  ``A mandate means that in some fashion, everybody will be forced to buy  health insurance. . . . But I believe,'' then candidate Obama said,  ``the problem is not that folks are trying to avoid getting healthcare.  The problem is they can't afford it.''   He separately said:         If the mandate was the solution, we could try to solve       homelessness by mandating that everyone buy a house. The       reason why they don't have the house is they don't have the       money. So our focus has been on reducing costs and making it       available.    Regardless of what anyone on either side of the aisle thinks about a  requirement to buy health insurance, it seems ill-advised and unjust to  take away property from people that cannot even afford insurance.   I have to imagine that this was an oversight in writing the law,  because surely no legislators could have intended such a harsh result.   I would note, Mr. Chairman, that in 2015, 6,902 residents of the  District of Columbia were forced to pay the mandate penalty. Seventy- five percent of them made less than $50,000.   I hope that my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will join me in  supporting this commonsense measure, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, I would hope that the gentlewoman would  realize that this amendment scores points for the 75 percent of the  people who were subject to the penalty who made less than $50,000 a  year. That is what happens when we have the mandate.  [[Page H6540]]    And it is Federal policy now, Federal policy, that holds that people  should not be punished if they can't afford to purchase health  insurance. They certainly shouldn't be punished by having their  property seized.   And if it is only a few people, as the gentlewoman says, I would  wonder why she is opposed to this amendment.   This is the Federal city. It is Federal policy that people should not  be so punished.   President Obama, when he was running for President in 2008, was  pretty clear. He knew what would happen. He observed what was going on  with the Massachusetts mandate. He said:         Now, Massachusetts has a mandate right now. They have       exempted 20 percent of the uninsured because they've       concluded that that 20 percent can't afford it. In some       cases, there are people who are paying fines and still can't       afford it. So now they are worse off than they were. They       don't have health insurance and they're paying a fine. And in       order for you to force people to get health insurance, you       have to have a very harsh, stiff penalty.    President Obama understood that. He understood, as a candidate, that  it would be wrong to seize property.   Again, when you look at the people who were being levied the penalty  in 2015, when the ACA had a penalty, 75 percent of the people who paid  the penalty in the District of Columbia made less than $50,000 a year.   Again, President Obama as a candidate:         I think it is important to recognize that, if you are going       to mandate the purchase of insurance and it is not       affordable, then there is going to have to be some       enforcement mechanism that the government uses. It may charge       people who don't already have healthcare fines or have to       take it out of their paychecks.    And candidate Obama said:         And that, I don't think, is helping people without health       insurance.    Again, he liked to keep on going and talking about Massachusetts.  What is happening in Massachusetts, then-candidate Obama said:         There are articles being written about it which are that       folks are paying fines that don't have healthcare. They would       rather go ahead and take the fine, because they cannot afford       coverage.    Mr. Chairman, this is for the folks who may not be able to afford it,  people making less than $50,000 a year. They shouldn't have their  property seized.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to accept this commonsense, narrow  amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.
