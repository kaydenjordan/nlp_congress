 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Neal for yielding.   This Build Back Better bill is the third leg of a three-legged stool  that balances the American Rescue Plan signed by President Biden last  March and the bipartisan infrastructure bill signed by President Biden  last Monday.   These three bills provide the wherewithal to fix our roads and  bridges, repair our rails, deepen our harbors, and provide long awaited  broadband to households and neighborhoods.   Mr. Speaker, I have often remarked that America is not in need of  being made great. It is great and has been for a long time.                                time  2030    I often quote Alexis De Tocqueville's observation that America's  greatness is not that it is more enlightened than any other nation, but  rather, that it has always been able to repair its faults.   The Build Back Better Act will repair some longstanding faults, many  of which have been exacerbated by COVID-19 and our feckless early  response to it.   This Build Back Better legislation will make healthcare accessible  and affordable for 2.2 million low-income, uninsured Americans that  exist in the Medicaid coverage gap. It makes benefits accessible and  affordable to millions of children who will be able to continue  receiving the child tax credit. It will make childcare and preschool  accessible and affordable for children who have been struggling to get  a fair start in life; and it will make housing accessible and  affordable for their parents.   The Build Back Better Act will make clean air and plant life on this  planet accessible and affordable for future generations by taking  historic steps to combat the climate change.   The coronavirus pandemic didn't just cause great harm for some; it  exposed great harm that has existed for far too long, denying far too  many of our citizens access to America's greatness.   Build Back Better provides an opportunity to make more of our  Nation's greatness accessible and affordable for all.
