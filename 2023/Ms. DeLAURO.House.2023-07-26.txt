 Mr. Chair, I rise today in opposition to the military  construction and veterans affairs appropriations bill, which falls  short of our commitments and backtracks on our promises to our  veterans, our servicemembers, and their families.   This bill cuts funding for critical military construction by over  $1.5 billion compared to its current level. It is built on a house of  cards that will crumble as this body and the American people come to  realize the full scope of cuts the majority is pursuing.   This is not the only bill that supports programs and services that  our veterans rely on. Republicans cannot credibly claim to fully fund  veterans programs. The American people can clearly see how veterans are  being treated when they look at the rest of the majority's domestic  funding bills.                                time  1430    Make no mistake. If it were not for the Democrats, this bill would  have decreased funding for veterans' medical care by $2 billion. In  addition to that, the funding for the Honoring our PACT Act would not  have been there. In 2024, they were going to underfund it. For 2025,  they completely eliminate it.  [[Page H3978]]    We should not be in this position, and the global economy should  never have been used as a bargaining chip to extract cuts to domestic  spending. However, to prevent a catastrophic default, the President  reached a deal with the Republican Speaker to lift the debt ceiling and  to set spending levels. We have a path to fund the United States  Government on time, a path that this Congress agreed to on a bipartisan  basis, and we ought to take that path.   Instead, this bill offers cuts to vital programs our veterans,  servicemembers, and their families depend on. It cuts $200 million in  dedicated funding for PFAS remediation and cleanup. These chemicals do  not easily break down in the environment. They are a source of  groundwater contamination on military bases, which can lead to serious  health problems. Failure to quickly clean up contaminated areas puts  the surrounding communities, including military families and civilians,  at risk.   This bill ignores the national security risk that will directly  affect all of our bases at home and abroad--climate change. Additional  dedicated funding for resilience projects is leaving America's  servicemembers and veterans completely exposed in the line of fire.   Instead of responsibly funding our veterans in a bill palatable to  both sides of the aisle, this bill is loaded up with hateful riders  that have no business in appropriations language. Prohibitions on  equity and inclusion programs and flags demonstrate grossly misplaced  priorities, fighting culture wars, leaving our veterans, hardworking  families, and the economy out to dry.   The bill places the Federal Government in the room with women and  their doctors. By making it harder for veterans to access healthcare,  we take a step closer toward a national abortion ban. Our veterans did  not volunteer to serve this country and defend our freedom to have  their freedom and their autonomy stripped by this Congress.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill.
