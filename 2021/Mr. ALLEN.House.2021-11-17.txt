 Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague, Mr. Keller, for  leading this important effort in letting the American people know that  we are fighting for you.   As I said since day one, folks should consult with their doctor and  get the vaccine if they are able. But instead of allowing local  healthcare providers and communities to instill confidence in the  vaccine, the Biden administration is choosing to push a top-down  government mandate, which does not work and will never work.   It comes down to this: Workers across the country are facing the  choice to get vaccinated or lose their job.   This is the epitome of government overreach. Every American has the  right to earn a living.   While I believe this mandate is likely unconstitutional, I look  forward to watching it continue moving through the courts.   It is also our duty as Members of Congress to fight this  legislatively. That is why it is important to exercise our authority  under the Congressional Review Act to nullify this rule.   I am proud to fight for over 80 million workers who will be impacted  by this overreaching mandate by ensuring this rule has no force or  effect.
