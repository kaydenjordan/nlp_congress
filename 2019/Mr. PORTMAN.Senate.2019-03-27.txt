 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I am on the floor today to talk about  career and technical education and specifically legislation we have  introduced that would provide a lot more training opportunities for  people who need the in-demand jobs that are out there.   When people hear about career and technical education, sometimes they  wonder what we are referring to. High school programs used to be called  vocational education. Many in my generation might remember it as that.  But it is not your father's Oldsmobile. It is not the old voc-ed  programs you might remember. In fact, it is very impressive. If you go  to these CTE schools today--and Ohio, luckily, has a lot of great  career and technical academies and schools--you will see something  amazing. You will see young people being trained for some of the most  sophisticated jobs out there in bioscience and technology, welding, of  course, and manufacturing--in Ohio, it is a big deal--and also CDLs for  truckdrivers, commercial driver's licenses. You might see somebody  there who is interested in going into firefighting or EMS. This  morning, I had a chance to visit with a young man who is in a CTE  program where he is going to be immediately hired by a fire department.   These are great opportunities for our young people. Right now, these  CTE schools are incredibly important because the skills are needed, and  the training is needed.   One of the challenges we have had, frankly, is that sometimes parents  who are advising their kids are saying ``You need to go to a 4-year  college or university like I did'' or maybe like their uncle or aunt  did. Maybe that is the goal they have for their kids, and that is fine.  For many young people, that is appropriate, but for others, what a  great opportunity, to be able to get out of high school, get a job  immediately--a good-paying job with good benefits--and then at some  point, because often in these schools, including in Ohio, you get  college credit while you are in high school, to go on to college later,  and perhaps your employer will pay for that.   This morning, I was with a young woman named Jordan. She is at the  Great Oaks career and technical center in Southwest Ohio. Jordan is  becoming a welder, and, as I explained to Jordan, she is going to have  amazing opportunities. She will have plenty of job opportunities  because she is going to have a skill that is so badly needed in Ohio  right now. Our manufacturing sector is desperate for welders, and they  are willing to pay good money for welders. She can make 45,000, 50,000  bucks a year with good benefits at 18 years old as a welder instead of  taking on student debt, which in Ohio is about $27,000 on average.  Somebody graduating from community college or a 4-year college or  university is taking on significant debt.   This is an opportunity for us to get more young people into career  and technical education. We think we ought to do it. We have a good  economy right now thanks to tax reform and regulatory relief. There is  a lot of hiring going on, and wages are actually higher right now. In  Ohio, we have a number of people who are looking for employees. The  ``help wanted'' signs are out there.   We have about 148,000 jobs available in the State, if you look at  OhioMeansJobs.com, which is the website that offers these positions.  Now, there are about 250,000 Ohioans out of work. How does that make  sense? Well, it makes sense because if you look at the jobs that are  being offered, for many of the jobs, you have to have a skill. You have  to be a coder or a machine operator or a welder, or you have to have  some bioscience background to be a tech. So if we had the skills  training, we would be able to fill these jobs, which is great for the  companies and for the economy but also, again, a great opportunity for  these young people.   In 2018, our economy added 223,000 jobs per month on average. That is  about twice what the pre-tax reform baseline estimate was from the  Congressional Budget Office of only 107,000 jobs per month. So we more  than doubled it. We have also had strong wage growth over the last 12  months. In fact, wage growth in the last year was higher than at any  time in the last decade.   In Ohio, frankly, for a decade and a half we have had flat wages.  Finally, we are now seeing wages going up. Last month, the average was  about 3.4 percent growth for private sector workers and, by the way, it  is more for blue-collar workers than for white-collar workers,  supervisory workers, which is all good news.   We have a lot of good things going on in terms of increasing jobs,  increasing wages, increasing benefits. Much of that is due to tax  reform. I have gone all around our State and talked to folks at  roundtable discussions. I have been to over 25 businesses to talk  specifically: What did you do with the tax savings? Every one of them  has a great story, but with all these pro-growth policies kicking in,  the thing I am hearing now is: Yes, the tax reform helped us. The  regulatory relief is a good idea, but we need workers, we need people,  and we need them to have the skills that go with the jobs we have. This  mismatch between the skills that are out there and these jobs, that  skills gap is the thing we need to close.   There are lots of ways to do that. The National Skills Coalition  estimates that nearly half of all job openings between now and 2022  will be middle-skill jobs that require education beyond high school but  not a 4-year degree. If you have a career in technical, with  opportunities in high school, and then when you get out of high school,  you have a certificate or you can get into a course where you can learn  how to do one of these skills--although you are not getting an  associate's degree or a bachelor's degree, you are getting a  certificate, often a stackable certificate that can lead to a degree  later--that is what is going to be needed.   In its most recent skills gap study, Deloitte and The Manufacturing  Institute highlighted the fact that there are so many jobs out there  that need these skills. They estimate there are about 2.4 million  positions likely to be unfilled between 2018 and 2028. The economic  impact of not having these jobs filled is about a $2.5 trillion hit to  our economy. This is why all of this is so important.   About 6 years ago, we started the Career and Technical Education  Caucus in the Senate. At first, there were two of us, Senator Kaine  from Virginia and myself. Now we have 27 Senators on the CTE Caucus.  Why? Because Members are hearing back home about this,  [[Page S2030]]  which has been good to raise awareness for career and technical  education. It has been helpful for us to put together some bipartisan  legislation that helps to promote career and technical education.   Last year, in the Perkins bill, for instance, Senator Kaine and I got  legislation in that helps to improve the quality of CT programs all  around the country, ensuring again that college credit can be offered,  helping to hold up programs to make sure young people and their parents  know about this opportunity.   Just a couple weeks ago, Senator Kaine and I reintroduced legislation  called Jumpstart Our Businesses by Supporting Students Act. The acronym  is the JOBS Act. The JOBS Act is something we introduced in the last  couple of Congresses, but I really feel its time has come. I feel it is  an opportunity right now for us to move forward with the JOBS Act. One,  we are hearing from all around the country the need for this, but,  second, we have the likelihood of a higher education bill moving this  year, which would be the perfect place to put the JOBS Act.   It is a commonsense solution to help solve the skills gap problem we  are talking about. It says, with regard to Pell grants--which is for  low-income students--instead of just making them available for  community colleges or 4-year colleges or universities or for longer  term courses, why not allow Pell grants to be used for shorter term  training programs? That is what is needed right now.   I think this is a fairness issue. When I talk to students, as I did  this morning here in Washington, as I do back in the State of Ohio,  what they tell me is: Rob, I don't have the money to get a driver's  license and go through that process, much less to get a certificate to  become a welder or to become a coder or to become a tech in a hospital  setting. The government will give me a Pell grant to go to a junior  college or a community college or a university, but I can't get a Pell  grant to help me get the training I need to actually get out there and  get a job that I know is right there, ready, good pay, good benefits.   To me, that shows how our system is not working with regard to the  modern economy and the needs we have right now, and it is not fair to  those students. I think we ought to allow students to use Pell grants  for shorter term training programs of less than 15 weeks. I also think  it is a matter of efficiency of the Pell grant and the taxpayer.   Unfortunately, most people who take a Pell who go to a college don't  graduate. There are lots of reasons for that. I think the main reason  is because many of them have to drop out because they have to work,  but, in the meantime, they don't have the degree. So they have the  Pell, but they don't get the degree, not even a certificate; whereas,  in these short-term training programs, a 15-week training program-- trust me, if somebody starts off in one of these training programs, it  is much more likely they will end up getting the certificate. They can  see just around the corner where the job is. In a sense, the  certificate is the ticket to that job, and it is a shorter term  prospect. I think it is a very efficient use of the Pell grant, and we  should expand the Pell grant, not take it away from colleges and  universities--not at all. Pell is an incredibly important program, but  let's allow it to be used for short training programs.   I was at the CT Program in Akron, OH, recently. I also went to Stark  State Community College. They have a new campus. We had a roundtable on  workforce development. We had a lot of local businesses there talking  about how great these programs have been for them. We had students  there. The chamber of commerce was there. Mayor Dan Horrigan of Akron  and Summit County executive Ilene Shapiro were there. I heard from  students in high school and in community college who were already  working for some of the local employers, businesses like the K Company,  an HVAC company based in Akron. They work with Stark State; they work  with local high schools; and they get young people on the right  educational track to be able to work in the HVAC field where there are  plenty of jobs right now. If you are an HVAC tech, you can get a job.  It has been a great example of where they are helping the economy, they  are helping a particular business, and they are really helping students  to get a great job.   Stark State president Dr. Para Jones is very innovative, working with  our high schools and working with the business community, trying to  ensure we are all working together on this. Dr. Jones, the employers  who were around the table, the educators who were around the table, and  the students who were around that table--all of them--were really  excited about the JOBS Act. They know it is going to work. They know  this will help them deal with exactly the problems they are seeing in  the local community.    Last week, I also toured a company in Hubbard, OH, Warren Fabricating  and Machining. As always happens, I heard about the need for skilled  workers. It is a great example of a company taking full advantage of  the tax reform and tax cuts. They bought a beautiful, new machine that  is incredibly important for their effectiveness as a company to be able  to compete with China and others. They have also been able to raise  people's salaries and increase the benefits with their tax savings, but  their issue now is getting the workforce. They want to operate at full  capacity, but they can't find the people. They have openings right now.   I also visited an advanced manufacturer called Rhinestahl Corporation  in Mason, right outside of Cincinnati. They manufacture high-precision  parts for the aerospace and defense industry. Other employers were  there, as well as Butler Tech, which is a local CTE program which has  done really incredible, innovative work.   There, I had the opportunity to meet with a lot of students. One of  them was a high school student named Jake. He is a chemical operator at  a nearby manufacturer called Pilot. He is a veteran who has completed  his certificate training, and his employer is now paying for him to  continue his education and get a degree while working for them. Connor  was there, a high school student who is running machines and learning  advanced manufacturing while working at a place called RB Tool. Torez  is a 19-year-old who went to the program and is now in charge of  calibration and making sure precision tools are up to speed at this  company, Rhinestahl.   The teacher of all these students, a guy named Dave Fox, was there.  He said his last class of 28 graduates had a combined total of more  than 100 job offers. Think about this. These young people going through  these certificate programs, 28 young people, had more than 100 job  offers. These are good job offers. We are talking about $40,000,  $50,000 a year, jobs that pay $18 to $20 an hour and good benefits, and  a lot of employers will pay for them to continue their education,  should they choose to do so.   Last week, President Trump came to the Joint Systems Manufacturing  Center in Lima, OH. This is an incredible manufacturing facility that  does something unique in America, which is they build tanks. The kind  of welding they have to be trained on is incredibly sophisticated and  difficult to do. The kind of machine work they have to do is really  difficult. Cutting the tanks' steel is an incredibly difficult task,  plus some other alloys they use to protect our troops in the field.  They need to hire about 400 additional workers in the next year or so,  partly because, with the defense buildup, we are putting more money  into the plant. I am very pleased to say President Trump in his budget  put more funding into the Lima plant this year, but they need workers,  and they need help training people. They need skilled welders,  machinists, assembly workers, and various types of engineers.   These are good-paying jobs and great opportunities for young people.  Whether they are coming up through the ranks in high school or whether  they are midcareer changing jobs, it would be great for us to help them  get the people they need, and the JOBS Act, they all say, would be  exactly what they need to help to do that.   At a roundtable discussion at Staub Manufacturing in Dayton recently,  the CEO of the company told me he believes welders coming out of high  school will be better off financially than many attorneys or doctors.   I asked him what he meant by that. He pointed out that while an  attorney  [[Page S2031]]  or another professional might make more coming right out of school, by  the time they get out of school--law school, as an example--and get out  of debt and start investing, the welder is well on his or her way to  building a significant nest egg.   It is true. When you think about it, a welder makes, let's say,  $50,000 a year starting at age 18. Let's say there is no student debt  because, again, through the certificate program and through a Pell--if  we get the JOBS Act passed, in particular--this person is able to do so  without any student debt. Using an online calculator and assuming about  8 percent growth, if that individual sets aside 10 percent of his or  her income toward retirement, from the age of 18 up to 67--and this  assumes a person gets no raise at all, which of course is not going to  happen. A person is going to have a higher salary over time as the  person gets more seniority, but assuming no raise, $50,000 a year: $2.8  million in retirement savings at age 67. That is a nice nest egg to be  able to live comfortably in retirement with peace of mind.   Compare that to an attorney, let's say, making $100,000 a year in a  big law firm, starts investing at least at 30 years old, after they get  through school and paying off their debt. It may be later, but let's  say 30 to be conservative. If that person sets aside 10 percent of his  or her income: $2.2 million by age 67. So even though the attorney had  a higher salary and was investing twice as much each month, the welder  making $50,000 a year is going to be better off.    Part of this is getting people into these jobs and getting them into  jobs when they are young, where they can begin to make investments in  their retirement but also make investments in a car, buy the house,  start putting money aside for their kids' education, just to have the  peace of mind that comes with knowing you are going to have this  profession and this opportunity to get ahead early in life.   I am hoping we can get the JOBS Act passed. It would help provide so  many people--particularly young people--these opportunities. If we can  shift the paradigm, stop this notion of thinking that everybody who is  going through high school needs to go to a 4-year college or university  right away and instead think about, how do you ensure that this young  person can have an opportunity to get ahead in life, learn a skill  where there is an immediate need, and actually help our economy?  Because our biggest challenge right now, as I see it--not just in the  manufacturing sector, where it is particularly obvious, but across the  board, in bioscience, certainly in moving, transportation,  truckdriving, and other professions, the biggest challenge we have  right now is workforce. This would do both.   The JOBS Act has been endorsed by the National Skills Coalition, the  Association for Career and Technical Education, the Association of  Community Colleges and Trustees--I know community colleges have put  this highest on their list--and other groups.   I am also pleased to say, again, it is in the budget. President Trump  puts together a budget every year. This year's budget actually has our  JOBS Act included in it. It is one that is totally bipartisan.   Senator Kaine from Virginia and I have been the coauthors of this  legislation over the years. We continue to work closely together on  this. We have 10 cosponsors already, having just introduced this a  couple weeks ago. It is a bipartisan group, mixed, Republicans and  Democrats. We also have a lot of outside stakeholders supporting it,  and, again, it is now in the President's budget.   The reason we are getting all this support is it works. It works. It  will cover programs that, at a minimum, require 150 hours and 8 weeks  to complete. There are some alternative programs that limit them by  requiring them to be 320 hours. I will tell you our community colleges  tell me none of their short-term training programs would qualify for  that higher number of hours--programs like welding, precision  machining, electrical trades. All those programs would fit into the  JOBS Act but not into some of the alternatives that are being  discussed.   We need the JOBS Act now, and we think there is a great vehicle for  it--which is the Higher Education Act--this year. A big fan of career  and technical education is the chairman of that committee, Senator  Lamar Alexander. He understands the need for us to provide the kind of  skills training needed to fill the jobs that are out there that  companies are desperate to fill. He sees this in his own State of  Tennessee, where he has a lot of manufacturing jobs, including auto  manufacturers that are looking for more skilled workers every day.   As we work to reauthorize the Higher Education Act, my hope is  colleagues on both sides of the aisle will join us in ensuring that the  JOBS Act is included in that. Let's be sure that we deal with the  fairness issue here and that we have a sense of understanding about our  economy and what the needs are right now.    A lot of that need is in skills and the kind of skills that the JOBS  Act would provide. It just makes too much sense.   If we make career and technical education a priority and if we enact  the JOBS Act I discussed today, we are going to help tens of thousands  of our young people be able to achieve their dreams, whatever they are,  and to have better opportunities. Just as important, we are going to be  able to help our economy--help to ensure that here in the United States  we have a growing economy where we have better tax policy, better  regulation policy, and also, for the workers, ensure that the companies  don't pick up and move because they don't have the workforce. Companies  tell me in Ohio: You know, Rob, we could do what we are doing here in  other places, and not just Indiana, which is next to Ohio, but maybe  India.   We don't want that. We want to have the workforce that is needed to  be able to keep these good jobs and keep these companies here in this  country, to ensure that we can keep moving in a positive direction,  and, again, to ensure that Ohioans can develop the skills they need to  grow in the career of their choice and to fulfill their potential in  life.   Thank you.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the  University of Cincinnati on their bicentennial celebration honoring 200  years of extraordinary research.   In January of 1819, two colleges were chartered by the state of Ohio:  the Medical College of Ohio and Cincinnati College. Both are  predecessors to today's University of Cincinnati. The opening  enrollment of Cincinnati College was roughly 70 students. Today, the  University of Cincinnati has an enrollment of nearly 46,000 students,  making it one of the largest universities in the Nation. UC stands as a  Carnegie Research 1 university, with a living alumni base of more than  300,000; a world-acclaimed campus and top programs in music, health,  design, science, and more; plus a $4.2 billion economic impact in its  tristate region of Ohio, Kentucky, and Indiana.   Next week, UC will be celebrating its Bicentennial Research and  Innovation Week. The week will be honoring UC's  [[Page S2036]]  past 200 years of extraordinary research by showcasing the impactful,  imaginative, and innovative work researchers at UC are doing today.  Examples of the research and innovation that will be highlighted during  the week include demonstrations of connected autonomous vehicles,  presentations on infrastructure to share data in smart secure cities,  pitches by student-inventors and entrepreneurs, discussions on  partnerships needed for the goal of ending the opioid epidemic,  highlights from experts in bioinformatics, neuroscience, and  engineering at the University of Cincinnati and its affiliated  institutions and how they are pushing the boundaries of clinical and  data sciences, and more.   UC is proud of the broad societal impacts the work of our researchers  have had on Cincinnati, the region, and beyond. Congratulations to the  University of Cincinnati for 200 years of research and innovation  excellence.                            ____________________
