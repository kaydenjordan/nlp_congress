 Madam Speaker, I am grateful that our  office is participating in the Veterans History Project. This project  is an ongoing effort by the Library of Congress to collect and preserve  personal accounts by American military veterans and families.   I have had the opportunity to meet with local veterans in Aiken and  the Midlands to encourage participation. The narratives recorded  through this project keep history alive for future generations.   Coordinating the project is Purple Heart recipient Jeffrey Crosby.  Across America, citizens can participate at website loc.gov/vets.   As a veteran, as the son of a Flying Tiger with service in India and  China, and as the father of four sons who have served overseas in the  Army National Guard and the Navy, I am thankful for the project.   Congratulations, President Donald Trump, with news today that his  policies of creating jobs have led to South Carolina's lowest  unemployment level in history at 2.6 percent--opportunities for all  according to WVOC.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.                            ____________________
