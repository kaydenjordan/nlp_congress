 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, on Saturday, on the final day of  Passover, our Nation once again came face to face with the violent  hatred of anti-Semitism--barely 6 months since the murders at the Tree  of Life in Pittsburgh, and, again, gunfire in a synagogue. Again, a  place of reverent worship for our Jewish brothers and sisters was  thrown into deadly chaos--this time at the Chabad of Poway synagogue in  California.   Three people--the synagogue's founding rabbi, an 8-year old girl, and  her uncle visiting from Israel--were injured by gunfire. Lori Kaye, who  attended the service with her husband and 22-year-old daughter to  deliver a prayer of mourning for her own late mother, was killed when  she threw herself between the rabbi and the shooter. Ms. Kaye has been  described as ``the example of kindness to the fullest extent,'' and  now, in the words of the rabbi who oversees Chabad of San Diego County,  she has ``lost her life solely for living as a Jew.''   According to some reports, that 8-year-old girl, in her young life,  has already had to flee incoming rocket attacks in Gaza and then, here  in America, has seen her family home subjected to anti-Semitic  graffiti, and now she has been shot--shot at her synagogue.   Here is what she said yesterday:         I never thought that was going to happen to me . . . it's a       safe place; you're supposed to feel safe.    Well, in an abhorrent way, it may be fitting that our Nation will  spend the week of Yom Hashoah, the Holocaust Remembrance Day observed  in Israel and worldwide, keenly focused on the disturbing rise in anti- Semitism within our own borders and around the globe.   Recent attacks on Muslims in New Zealand and Christians in Sri Lanka  remind us that religious hatred exists in many forms, but, of course,  the Jewish people have long been subjected to a unique degree of  disgusting prejudice, and it is paired too often with indifference from  others.  [[Page S2475]]    Just in the last few days, the New York Times published a  transparently anti-Semitic political cartoon in its international  edition--not just online. It ran in print. The Times compounded the  error by issuing an initial correction that failed to accurately  apologize for the blatant anti-Semitic tropes in which the cartoon  trafficked. Fortunately, the Times has since finally published what  appears to be a genuine apology.   This episode, as one of the New York Times own columnists explained,  ``was an astonishing act of ignorance of anti-Semitism . . . at a  publication that is otherwise hyperalert to nearly every conceivable  expression of prejudice.''   In other words, even important institutions that strive to meet  progressive sensibilities can often be blind to anti-Jewish prejudice  and attitudes in a way that would never be tolerated for a second where  most other vulnerable groups are concerned.   Combined with all the troubling statistics I have discussed on the  floor in the past, it could just not be clearer that rising anti- Semitism requires swift action. Here is just one example. We know that  anti-Semitism often masquerades as political opposition to Israel in an  attempt to appear--to appear--more legitimate. But today, as hate for  the Jewish people makes headlines with alarming frequency, this charade  is being seen for what it is, and the Senate recently took action to  condemn it flat out. Included in the S. 1 legislation the Senate passed  earlier this year was a provision to help State and local governments  push back against the influence of the BDS movement and to enable  communities to shut off the flow of taxpayer dollars to entities that  support these anti-Israel boycotters. Unfortunately, Democratic leaders  in the House have not seen fit to take up this straightforward measure.  Even as they have struggled to swiftly and clearly condemn instances of  anti-Semitism within their own ranks, they have also let this important  provision in S. 1 languish. It is still sitting over in the House.   The infectious threat of anti-Semitism is serious. Much more must be  done the world over to ensure that it finds no home in modern society.   I just want to close with the inspiring comments from the rabbi in  the San Diego Chabad. He said:         In the face of senseless hate, we commit to live proudly as       Jews in this glorious country. We strongly believe that love       is exponentially more powerful than hate.                                 Nominations    Madam President, on a totally different matter, when I last spoke  here on the floor, the Senate had taken an important step toward  restoring the sort of comity and efficiency that once governed our  consideration of uncontroversial nominations. In the face of across- the-board, systematic opposition and delaying tactics for even the most  politically uncontroversial of the President's nominees, the Senate  took action and brought this chapter of pure partisan calculation to an  end.   Subsequently, we began doing business at a more normal, more  reasonable pace. We confirmed a number of qualified public servants who  still went on to receive bipartisan support for confirmation and did so  in a fraction of the time it had been taking.   So today we will continue yet another slate of well-qualified  candidates for service in the executive branch and on the Federal  courts. We will consider three individuals to join the President's  team, beginning with William Cooper of Maryland to serve as General  Counsel to the Department of Energy. Then, we will consider five  nominees to fill Federal district court vacancies in Texas, Alabama,  Florida, Puerto Rico, and Pennsylvania.   There is still so much work to be done. Two years of unprecedented  obstruction can't be reversed overnight, but we have taken some  important steps in the right direction, and this week we will take  several more.                          Remembering Richard Lugar     Madam President, on one final matter, I know many of  our colleagues were as sad as I was to learn yesterday that our  esteemed former colleague, Senator Dick Lugar, had died at the age of  87.   Many Members, past and present, knew Dick Lugar as a senior peer who  always seemed to have the perfect advice or the exact perspective you  needed to hear. More recently, others got to know Dick as a wise  mentor. He felt a personal responsibility to help newcomers on both  sides of the aisle learn the ropes and make an impact.   As I was reflecting yesterday on Dick's towering legacy, I found  myself admiring all the ways he was really the consummate U.S. Senator.  He was a total patriot who put principle first but also a highly  talented politician and a savvy deal maker. Yet somehow his personal  reputation and character managed to be even more impressive than those  achievements. I literally don't think anybody on Capitol Hill had a bad  word to say about Senator Dick Lugar. His intellect, his commitment,  his prudence, his kindness, and his deliberate focus on mentoring the  next generation of leaders--this man was the complete package--a total  gentleman, thoroughly impressive.   So a lot of Dick's legacy lies in all the people he mentored and  encouraged. Here I can testify firsthand. Dick was running the  senatorial committee back in 1984 when I decided to try to run for the  Senate. As you can imagine, as a local official, I had not exactly  built a national profile, and I didn't have a whole lot of people in my  corner. But Dick, thankfully, saw some potential. That was an unusual  lapse of judgment, I would add, but he thought he saw potential and  took a chance on a young Kentuckian.   Of course, the rest of the world knows Dick Lugar best for his  towering impact on U.S. foreign policy and world affairs. His interest  in international affairs dated back to his and his brother's success at  drumming up more export business to turn around the family factory, and  it blossomed into something remarkable.   For years, he represented one of our Nation's most listened to and  most respected voices when it came to our role in the world. Whether he  happened to be chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee or ranking  member at a given time, the respect for his expertise was universal.   His most famous accomplishments, for good reason, involved his work  on arms control. The 1991 Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threats Reduction  Program stepped into the breach at a critical moment as the Soviet  Union was dissolving. It took action to dismantle and decommission  nuclear weapons before they could disappear or fall into the wrong  hands. Those efforts, which were expanded after September 11 into the  Global Threat Reduction Initiative, have neutralized literally  thousands of warheads, hundreds of missiles, and other deadly chemical  and biological weapons. Nations which once ranked in the global top 10  largest nuclear arsenals were certified as nuclear-free. The entire  world is safer as a result.   These early efforts helped set a new tone right from the start of the  post-Cold War era. Dick understood it was time to turn the page on Cold  War competition. America would extend our hand and seek to work  together with Russia and former Soviet states to build a safer world.   Consistent with Dick's leadership and guidance, Republicans and  Democrats alike took a deliberately magnanimous approach. For decades,  we sought to work with Moscow, instead of against it, to welcome Russia  back into the community of sovereign nations.   As an aside, the general foreign policy consensus about Dick's  approach to the former Soviet Union is especially worth remembering  today. It demonstrates that Putin's hostility toward the West and our  interests is not the result of American hostility toward Russia. The  source of this hostility emanates from the Kremlin.   ``Deliberately magnanimous'' is really the Lugar doctrine in a  nutshell, from friendship to foreign policy.   Dick also built a formidable legacy on agriculture and food security  as chairman and ranking member of the Agriculture Committee--everything  from working on the farm bill and fighting for Hoosier families to  international questions of aid and development.   The good news is, on these and other subjects, Dick's legacy did not  end with his Senate retirement, and it will not even end now. The Lugar  Center--which has thrived under not only his name but his active  leadership since retiring from the Senate--will continue  [[Page S2476]]  to serve as a home to thoughtful research and an important voice in  national policy conversations.   Of course, that Center isn't even the finest part of the ongoing  Lugar legacy. That would be the family Dick and his beloved wife Char  built together. They have been an inseparable team since their days as  coclass presidents at Denison University. Today that team includes  their four sons, Mark, Bob, John, and David, 13 grandchildren, and 17  great-grandchildren.   So we mourn Dick's passing, but we celebrate this life he lived so  well and so fully. Our friend left us at 87 years old with the  affection and gratitude of his colleagues, with the respect of his  country and leaders around the world, with the love of his beautiful  family, and with a world that is measurably safer for his work--a  remarkable legacy that suits a remarkable man.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that  notwithstanding rule XXII, the postcloture time on the William Cooper  nomination expire at 11:45 a.m. on Tuesday, April 30; further, that if  the nomination is confirmed, the motion to reconsider be considered  made and laid upon the table and that the President be immediately  notified of the Senate's action.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  injunction of secrecy be removed from the following treaty transmitted  to the Senate on April 29, 2019, by the President of the United States:  Protocol to the North Atlantic Treaty of 1949 on the Accession of the  Republic of North Macedonia (Treaty Document No. 116-1).   I further ask that the treaty be considered as having been read the  first time; that it be referred, with accompanying papers, to the  Committee on Foreign Relations and ordered to be printed; and that the  President's message be printed in the Record.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the consideration of Executive Calendar Nos. 207, 208, 210  through 213, and all nominations placed on the Secretary's desk; that  the nominations be confirmed; that the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or  debate; that no further motions be in order; that any statements  related to the nominations be printed in the Record; and that the  President be immediately notified of the Senate's action and the Senate  then resume legislative session.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  be in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak  therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, on behalf of myself and the  distinguished Democratic leader, Mr. Schumer, I send to the desk a  resolution authorizing the production of testimony, and ask for its  immediate consideration.   Mr. President, this resolution concerns a request for testimony in a  state administrative hearing regarding Medicaid benefits. A constituent  of Senator  [[Page S2490]]  Hyde-Smith is seeking testimony at the hearing from an employee in the  Senator's office who had assisted him. Senator Hyde-Smith would like to  cooperate with this request by providing relevant testimony from the  employee.   The enclosed resolution would authorize the employee to testify in  this action.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I understand there are two bills at the  desk due for a second reading.    In order to place the bills on the calendar under the  provisions of rule XIV, I would object to further proceeding, en bloc.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 172, submitted earlier today.    I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed  to, the preamble be agreed to, and that the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or  debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 173, submitted earlier today.    I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed  to, the preamble be agreed to, and that the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or  debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m., Tuesday,  April 30; further, that following the prayer and pledge, the morning  hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date,  the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the  day, morning business be closed, and the Senate proceed to executive  session and resume consideration of the William Cooper nomination under  the previous order.
