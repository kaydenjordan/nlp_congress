 Madam Speaker, I rise today to bring attention to the  storm damage impacting Alabama's Seventh Congressional District  following the devastating tornadoes that struck our State earlier this  month.   On January 12, severe storms, including multiple tornadoes, tore  through the Southeast, ravaging communities in Alabama, Mississippi,  Georgia, and destroying over 16,000 homes. In my district alone, 6,000  properties sustained damage, many to the point of irreversible repair.   Across Alabama's Black Belt, rural communities that were still  recovering from financial ruin of COVID-19 were once again devastated.   Hale County, with less than 15,000 residents, lost over 92 homes with  an estimated $2 million worth of damage. Greene County and Sumter  County, also in my district, sustained damage.   Just outside of my district, in Autauga County, seven precious lives  were lost that day. In my beloved hometown of Selma, Alabama, an EF-3  tornado tore through the town center, leveling homes, businesses,  churches, and community centers in the Queen City.   I spent much of last week in Selma, boots on the ground, to survey  the damage and to assist with the recovery effort. I will never ever  forget the scene as I entered Selma that evening. It was pitch black as  I crossed the bridge; no lights, just street after street of complete  devastation.   The following morning, I was joined by Governor Ivey, Senator Britt,  Selma Mayor James Perkins, and State and local officials to tour the  wreckage. My heart broke to see the depth of destruction in the light;  trees uprooted from the ground, homes destroyed, lives destroyed.   It is not lost on me that this devastation struck our community on  MLK weekend. But despite the debris and the horrific scenes that we  saw, I did see a vision of what Dr. King meant by a beloved community.  I saw neighbor helping neighbor and community members lending a hand to  take care of the place that we call home.   I am thankful that President Biden heard our cries and expedited a  major disaster declaration for the State of Alabama. This designation  will provide critical Federal resources.   I am endlessly grateful to our partners at FEMA who are on the ground  right now helping my constituents. Today, the Alabama congressional  delegation is sending a letter to President Biden requesting an  increase in disaster assistance to Alabama, increasing the Federal  share to 100 percent of the total eligible costs. We need this. We need  this desperately.   I also thank the many mayors and residents of surrounding communities  who offered a helping hand. We are indeed resilient people in Alabama's  Seventh Congressional District, and nothing about that will change. Out  of this destruction, I know that we have a unique opportunity to  reimagine Selma and surrounding areas and to build back better and  stronger than before.   We will do all we can, working together at all levels of government  to bring every resource at our disposal to those who have been  affected.   This evening, at 6:30 Central Time, I will be hosting a live  telephone townhall about disaster assistance to answer questions, and  for my constituents to hear directly from FEMA and the Alabama EMA on  disaster assistance.   I am asking my colleagues to keep Alabama's Seventh Congressional  District and all of Alabama that was affected in your thoughts and  prayers as we recover and rebuild. But for the grace of God go all of  us.   We do need to make sure that our Federal resources are adequate to  help those who have been impacted by disasters. We are, indeed, Selma  Strong.                            ____________________
