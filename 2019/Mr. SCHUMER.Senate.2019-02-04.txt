 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, tomorrow, President Trump will belatedly  report on the state of the Union before a joint session of Congress.  The reason for the delay, of course, is the 35-day government shutdown  that President Trump precipitated as an attempt to extract taxpayer  money for a wall he promised Mexico would pay for, a pointless  exercise, if there ever were one--a pointless exercise that punished  hundreds of thousands of innocent public servants and took billions of  dollars out of our economy.   We are all glad that the government is back open and Federal workers  are back on the job and getting paid, but the recent government  shutdown speaks to the fundamental uncertainty about the state of our  Union.   Tomorrow, the President will say, predictably, that the state of our  Union is strong, but the truth is that the state of the Trump economy  is failing America's middle class, that the state of the Trump  healthcare system is failing American families, that the state of the  Trump administration is embroiled in chaos and incompetence, and that  the state of the President's foreign policy is incoherent,  inconsistent, and cynical in the extreme and has undermined American  power and our national interests. In sum, the state of our Union is in  need of drastic repair.   Let's begin with the state of the Trump economy. Corporate America  has cashed in on the Trump tax bill, but working America has been left  behind. Since the tax bill passed over a year ago, corporations have  announced plans to repurchase more than $1 trillion of their own  stock--a practice that benefits corporate executives and wealthy  shareholders but not many average workers. Meanwhile, Reuters reports  that the tax bill had no major impact on whether businesses made  capital investments or hired more workers. The very wealthy--the big,  powerful corporations--fed this line: Help them, and everyone will be  helped. Our Republican friends swallowed that--hook, line, and sinker.   The only good news about this tax bill that passed last year is that  it showed what a false promise it was--$1 trillion for the wealthy  through stock buybacks and other things and virtually nothing for  American workers. The President promised--remember this?--that his tax  bill would deliver a $4,000 raise to the average household. The reality  is that wages for average workers have remained quite stagnant. Workers  are still making less today than they did in 1973 after adjusting for  inflation. The effect of the Trump economy has been a deepening of the  inequalities and wealth disparities that threaten the future of the  middle class and the future of the American dream. The rich are getting  richer. The middle class is being hollowed out. That is the state of  the Trump economy.   How about healthcare? The state of our healthcare system is dire.  Premiums are higher than they should be. Out-of-pocket costs are higher  than they should be. The uninsured rate is, once again, rising. This is  the result of a relentless sabotage by the Trump administration and  congressional Republicans. The Trump administration expanded junk  insurance plans. It supports a lawsuit that would end protections for  Americans with preexisting conditions. It all but eliminated programs  that help people find the right coverage for themselves and their  families, and it continues to routinely propose and approve policies  that cause people to lose coverage and cause health insurance markets  to spiral into chaos.   When any one of us goes home, one just has to be home for a short  time before hearing of people with horror stories of how they had  normal procedures and were told that this doctor was not covered, that  this procedure was not covered, and that it would be several thousand  dollars out of their pockets, which they can't afford. We are told of  one horror story or another--of the cost of something like insulin,  which is way through the roof, when it should be available because it  does so much for those who have diabetes. We hear story after story,  and those aren't isolated. That is the state of the Trump healthcare  system.   The past 2 years have been a wholesale assault by the Trump  administration on Americans' healthcare. I doubt President Trump will  mention that tomorrow, but if you ask American families of the No. 1  problem they face, it will be the cost of good healthcare, which seems  more and more out of reach. So the state of the Trump healthcare system  is dire.   What is the state of the Trump administration? The state of the Trump  administration is chaos. Underqualified staffers cycle in and out of  our  [[Page S819]]  government's most powerful positions. Cabinet Secretaries are fired  over Twitter. Hundreds of important positions are unfilled or are  covered by someone in an acting capacity, including for the Chief of  Staff, the Attorney General, the Defense Secretary, the Interior  Secretary, the OMB Director, and the EPA Director.   Hardly a week goes by without news of a high-profile firing or  resignation from the White House. President Trump publicly belittles  the people who are working for him. That is no way to incent people to  work hard. An NPR study found that the Trump administration has had the  most Cabinet turnovers of any administration in more than a century.  Three Cabinet Secretaries have been fired or have resigned in scandal-- Price, Zinke, and Pruitt. One has resigned in protest--probably the  best Cabinet member we had--General Mattis, who couldn't take Trump's  zigzags on policy and his lack of sharing information. Another had his  nomination pulled before it could be considered--Puzder--which is not  altogether rare for this President.   Since the start of the administration, more than 40 of President  Trump's nominees have been withdrawn. They don't know how to vet. The  President makes these off-the-cuff decisions based on how someone  looks, and we all pay the price. Oh, yes, the state of the Trump  administration and how he runs the government--chaos. The continuity  and effectiveness of American Government has been deeply compromised by  the turmoil and turnover at the White House.   Finally, the state of the Trump foreign policy is woefully backward.  From Brussels to Beijing, President Trump has alienated our allies and  emboldened our adversaries. Russia, China, North Korea--three of the  worst and least democratic countries on Earth, the countries that pose  the greatest threats to America--are treated with kid gloves, while our  allies, like those in NATO, get harsh words from this President. It is  inside out. It is topsy-turvy. It is what his instincts and gut show,  and they are totally wrong--without fact, without knowledge, and  without understanding history. Too often, the President has,  regrettably, failed to champion free speech, freedom of the press,  humanitarian rights, and democratic values. Dictators and strongmen are  ascendant in the President's circle while allies are pushed to the  fringe. Yes, the state of the Trump foreign policy is woefully  backward.   Concerning the speech tomorrow night, the President will not talk  like this, of course. What I expect the President to do is to ignore  reality and spin his own fiction. A looming question is just how many  falsehoods, distortions, and made-up facts will appear in the  President's speech. How many times will he say something is fake news  because it is true, and he doesn't like to hear the truth?   Yet the Democrats are not focused on the President's rhetoric--his  usual boasts or bluster or blame--that is so characteristic of this  administration. We are going to continue fighting for American workers  in this unequal economy, fighting for American families who are  struggling to afford quality healthcare, fighting to bring  accountability and stability to this government so in chaos, and  fighting for rational foreign policy that promotes both our interests  and our values.   The state of the Union is sad. Let me just say that the No. 1 reason  the state of the Union has such woes is the President. I hope he  changes in the next 2 years.                            ____________________     Mr. President, one other issue--I mentioned earlier that  one of the major consequences of the Trump tax bill was the explosion  of stock buybacks. In 2018 alone--just 2018--U.S. companies announced  plans to repurchase more than $1 trillion of their own stock. It is a  staggering figure and the highest amount ever recorded in a single  year.   When companies buy back their own stock, it boosts the earnings of  wealthy shareholders and executives but does little for average  workers. The vast majority of Americans don't own stocks. In fact, the  top 10 percent of Americans own 85 percent of stocks, total.   When corporations direct so much of their resources to buy back  shares, they restrain their capacity to reinvest profits in R&D,  equipment, higher wages, medical leave, pensions, worker retraining,  and more.   I would like to see a study of how many companies bought back their  stocks while leaving pensions underfunded. What is happening is that  corporations are promising their workers that they will have a good  life in retirement, and, instead, the corporate executives and their  top shareholders are enriching themselves.   Think about this. Between 2008 and 2017--the last 10 years--466 of  the S&P 500 companies did stock buybacks. Do you know how much? It was  $4 trillion. That is equal to 53 percent of their profits. More than $1  out of every $2 in profit just went to stock buybacks--not improving  our economy, not helping workers, and not helping communities. Then  another 30 percent went to dividends. It is the same thing. When more  than 80 percent of corporate profits are going to stock buybacks and  dividends, something is really wrong in the state of corporate America  and the state of our economy.   It wasn't always this way. From the mid-20th century up until the  seventies and even into the eighties, American corporations shared a  belief that they had a duty not just to their shareholders but to their  workers, to their communities, and to their country, which helped them  grow and prosper, along with our schools, our roads, and everything  else. That created an extremely prosperous America for corporate  America but also for American workers in the broad middle of this  country.   But over the past several decades, workers' rights have been  diminished, and corporate boardrooms have been obsessed, slavishly, to  shareholder earnings. The only people they seem to want to help are  their shareholders.   I hear it. I talk to CEOs, and they say: Well, maybe it is the wrong  thing to do this or that, but I just have to go for the shareholder.  And the shareholder often has only short-term interest. The explosion  of stock buybacks is, perhaps, the most pernicious way that this new  corporate ethos manifests itself.   My friend and colleague Senator Sanders and I have written a joint  op-ed in today's New York Times, outlining how we propose to curb the  overreliance on stock buybacks and, instead, encourage corporate  America to make more productive investments that help workers and  communities therein.   We are planning to introduce legislation that will prohibit a  corporation from buying back its own stock unless it invests in workers  and communities first, including doing things--there will be a list-- like paying people $15 an hour, providing 7 days of sick leave,  offering decent pensions, more reliable healthcare, putting money into  training workers, and providing equipment. These are the kinds of  things we always thought American corporations would do and now they do  scantily when compared to how much they do in terms of buybacks.   I know many of my Democratic colleagues have focused on these issues,  including Senators Baldwin, Booker, Casey, Warren, Schatz, and  Gillibrand. We all believe that this Congress, this Senate, should vote  on legislation that demands that corporations commit to addressing the  needs of their workers and communities before the interests of wealthy  shareholders.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
