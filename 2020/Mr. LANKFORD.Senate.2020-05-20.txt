 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to complete my  remarks before the vote begins.    Madam President, in a few minutes, the Senate will vote  on the nomination of John Heil to serve as a district court judge for  Oklahoma.   We have three areas in Oklahoma: the Northern District, Eastern  district, and Western district. This judge position covers all three of  those, and they move to wherever there is the greatest need, and we are  in great need. This is a position that we have needed for a while, and  I am proud that John Heil has gone through this process. He was  overwhelmingly confirmed in his nomination process through committee. I  expect him to have wide bipartisan support when it passes this floor in  a few moments and look forward to him transitioning from being a great  attorney in our State to being a great judge to serve the people of  Oklahoma and the United States on the Federal bench. So I am looking  forward to that vote being completed.
