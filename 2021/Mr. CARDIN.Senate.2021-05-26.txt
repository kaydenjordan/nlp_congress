 Madam President, I rise today in recognition of Asian  Pacific American Heritage Month. This annual commemoration offers the  opportunity to celebrate and reflect on the rich history of Asian  Americans and Pacific Islanders.   Representatives Frank Horton of New York and Norman Mineta of  California and later Senators Daniel Inouye and Spark Matsunaga, both  of Hawaii, first introduced a resolution in 1977 to establish an annual  commemoration of the contributions of this community. That first  resolution proclaimed the first 10 days of May as Asian Pacific  American Heritage Week. Congress passed a modified version of that  resolution in 1978, which President Jimmy Carter signed into law. In  1990, Congress expanded Asian Pacific American Heritage Week to the  entire month. Just 2 years later, Congress passed a final resolution  permanently designating the month of May as Asian Pacific American  Heritage Month. This timing is deliberate: It commemorates important  milestones--the arrival of the first Japanese to the United States on  May 7, 1843, and the completion of the Transcontinental Railroad on May  10, 1869.   The Asian-American population is the fastest growing population in  the United States, having risen from 10.5 million in 2000 to more than  23 million in 2020. More than 1.6 million individuals identify as  Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander. With these combined figures,  the Asian-American and Pacific Islander, AAPI, community makes up  almost 7 percent of the U.S. population and roughly the same percentage  of Maryland's population.   Nationwide, demographers estimate that this population, which  consists of over 40 subgroups, will more than double from 20 million to  more than 51 million by 2060.   Over the past year, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders have played  a vital role in our Nation's battle with COVID-19. Serving as frontline  workers, first responders, and emergency personnel, they have provided  lifesaving and critical care to hundreds of thousands of people during  unprecedented times.   The approximately 555,200 Asian-owned businesses in the United States  represent approximately 1 in 10 businesses in the United States. As the  chairman of the Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee, I know  the importance of each of these enterprises to our national economy and  to the local communities they serve. I also know the serious challenges  that all small business owners but particularly minority-owned  businesses have faced since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Some  research indicates  [[Page S3497]]  that these businesses may have suffered the most significant economic  effects of all demographic groups. Through the past year, I have sought  to ensure that the Small Business Administration's grants and loans  flow to smaller and minority-owned businesses.   Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders have also served our Nation in  important public service roles. Norm Mineta, after spending 20 years in  the House of Representatives, served two Presidents--Bill Clinton and  George W. Bush--first as Secretary of Commerce and then as the longest  serving Secretary of Transportation. I was proud to serve with him in  the House and with Senator Daniel K. Inouye of Hawaii from 2006 to 2012  during his tenure as President pro tempore of the Senate, a role that  made him the highest ranking Asian-American government official in the  history of the United States. Of course, Kamala D. Harris eclipsed that  distinction this year when she became Vice President--the first Asian  American ever to hold that role. I am also proud every day to serve  alongside Senators Mazie Hirono and Tammy Duckworth, two strong leaders  who are committed to promoting the well-being and progress of Asian  Americans and Pacific Islanders along with all Americans.   The Asian-Americans and Pacific Islander population has long endured  racism and prejudice. This discrimination reached a peak when President  Roosevelt ordered the incarceration of over 100,000 Japanese Americans  in internment camps as war began with the Empire of Japan in World War  II. Over the last year and a half, we have seen an alarming and  dangerous rise in prejudicial treatment and racially motivated hate  crimes and attacks. According to a recent report, there were nearly  3,800 reported cases of anti-Asian discrimination related to COVID-19  between March 2020 and February 2021. Dangerous rhetoric such as  calling COVID-19 the Chinese virus jeopardizes the safety and well- being of millions of Asian Americans.   It is time we stand up and protect our fellow neighbors, friends,  coworkers, and loved ones. We need an all hands-on-deck approach to  combat anti-Asian bias, prejudice, discrimination, hate crimes, and  violence. Congress overwhelmingly passed S. 937, the COVID-19 Hate  Crimes Act, which Senators Hirono and Duckworth introduced. This  legislation serves as a pledge to our Asian-American community that we,  as the United States of America, stand in solidarity with you and will  not tolerate violations of your civil rights. I was proud to cosponsor  Senators Hirono and Duckworth's resolution condemning discrimination  against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders stemming from the COVID- 19 pandemic. Working together with our local, State, national, and  international partners--along with our allies in the private sector and  faith community--we can stem this dangerous trend and provide a sense  of peace and security to our Asian-American brothers and sisters. In  doing so, I am committed to listening to and being guided by the voices  of those individuals and communities who have suffered harm.   Asian Pacific American Heritage Month offers all Americans the  opportunity to recognize and to appreciate the important role of this  community in our Nation, both throughout history and today. It is more  important than ever that we all take advantage of it.                            ____________________     Madam President, I rise to ask the Senate to join  me in recognizing the Maryland State Bar Association on the 125th  anniversary of its founding. Since its founding on August 28, 1896, the  Maryland State Bar Association, MSBA, has advanced and protected the  interests of Maryland attorneys, their clients, and the general public.   Over the past 125 years, the MSBA has grown into a premier  professional trade association comprised of over 20,000 members from  every segment of the legal profession. This includes large law firms,  solo and small-firm practitioners, government lawyers, in-house  counsel, nonprofit attorneys, judges, and legal academics. The MSBA has  steadfastly supported the Maryland legal community in its important  work to serve the public interest, facilitate commerce, and create a  more fair and just society.   In the decades since its founding, the MSBA has advanced and  supported the demographic diversification of the Maryland bar. In  partnership with the Judiciary of Maryland and numerous nonprofit  partners, the MSBA and in particular its Committee on Diversity &  Inclusion have fostered policies and programs to enhance the diversity  of the practice of law in the State to the benefit of all Marylanders.  The committee is charged with promoting recruitment, hiring, and  retention processes to create environments within the legal community  in which all individuals are encouraged to join, thrive, and lead the  legal profession regardless of race, color, gender, gender identity,  disability, sexual orientation, national origin, or any other  characteristic of identity.   Over the years, the MSBA has also expanded its vision and mission to  include efforts to promote access to civil legal services. The  association has advocated for legislation to support the Maryland Legal  Services Corporation, a critically important organization that raises  and distributes funds to nonprofit organizations that provide civil  legal assistance to low-income individuals in Maryland. As chair of the  corporation from 1988 to 1995, I know firsthand the extraordinary and  needed service that it provides. In addition, MSBA has in recent years  integrated the operations of the Maryland Access to Justice Commission,  an independent entity that convenes partners from the State attorney  general to the private sector, to academia, to advance equal access to  the civil justice system.   In the community at-large, the MSBA has played a significant role in  enhancing civic literacy in Maryland, including by hosting thousands of  high school students participating in mock trial and moot court  competitions. These programs offer students the opportunity to enhance  their skills and expose them to the practical implications and  importance of the law. As a Maryland lawyer myself, I ask the Senate to  join me in congratulating the Maryland State Bar Association for its  exemplary service to the Maryland legal community over the past 125  years.                            ____________________
