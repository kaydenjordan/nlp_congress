 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I first want to thank the gentleman from  Maryland for his work on this important topic, and I also want to thank  him for his willingness to work with Members of this body to address  our concerns regarding the finance of this bill.   Thanks to the changes that I supported and pushed for, we have  ensured that no taxpayer dollars will go towards financing political  campaigns. It is a testament to what we can accomplish when we work  together and compromise.   This bill has many important provisions which will make it easier for  working families to have their voices heard. My amendment would extend  these wins to the people of upstate New York who have been treated  unfairly for years by arbitrary restrictions on polling hours.   In New York State, voters in New York City and neighboring downstate  counties have 6 more hours to vote in Federal primary elections  compared to voters in my district. A voter in New York City can vote on  their way to work when the polls open at 6 a.m. A voter in Binghamton,  on the other hand, can't vote in that very same election until their  polls open at noon.   My amendment would fix this situation and institute some basic rules  to prevent States from reducing polling hours for people based solely  on where they live. This is an important step to ensure that all voters  across the State are treated fairly.   I urge adoption of my amendment, and I again thank the gentleman from  Maryland for his leadership on this bill, and I urge our colleagues to  pass the underlying legislation.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I again urge adoption of my amendment,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
