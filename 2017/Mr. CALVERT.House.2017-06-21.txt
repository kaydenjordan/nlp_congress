 Mr. Chair, I am pleased to be here today in strong  support of H.R. 1873, the Electricity Reliability and Forest Protection  Act.   As we enter wildfire season, it is of the upmost importance that the  federal government act to prevent these devastating disasters.   The Electricity Reliability and Forest Protection Act strengthens  electric grid reliability while reducing the risk of fires and fire  hazards caused by poor vegetation management in power line rights-of- way on federally managed public lands.   Currently, bureaucratic permitting delays impede electric utility  companies from effectively managing overgrowth near electric  infrastructure, which puts these areas at greater risk for a fire  event. This common-sense, widely-supported, legislation would require  an expedited federal review process for trees that are dangerously  close to power lines.   The effective management of this unruly vegetation is especially  important in my home state of California, where in 2016, an  overwhelming 6,986 fires destroyed over 565,000 acres of land  throughout the state.   I thank my Colleague from California, Mr. LaMalfa, for his leadership  on this legislation and I look forward to supporting the Electricity  Reliability and Forest Protection Act later today.
