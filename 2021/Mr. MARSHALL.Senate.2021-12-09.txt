 Mr. President, I rise today to honor and  recognize Micheal Mahoney of Kansas City. Micheal has been a reporter  in the KC area for over 40 years, starting with breaking news, then  making a career into politics with a fair, but always tough  sensibility.   I have known Mike for a few years now since coming to Congress, and  to me, he has one of the best reputations among reporters in the  region. The press and Congress are often thought of as adversaries,  with journalists always trying to dig into Members to get the best  scoop or ``gotcha'' moment, while Members are having to watch their  backs. With Mike, that has never been the case. Sure, he would always  try to dig, but that was simply to get the best possible info for  Kansans, not just to put someone on the spot. Any time I had an  interview with Mike, he truly was looking for the heart of a story,  with no cheap tricks. He gave everyone involved a fair shot to tell  their side and laid everything out crystal clear for viewers to see  when the story came on. It is easy to see in each story what was really  going on thanks to Mike's integrity in interviews, and talent for  storytelling.   As he finishes out his time with KMBC, I hope he is able to reflect  on the wonderful career he has had. He has been there to provide  outstanding coverage of every political event in Kansas for all to see  and even has an Emmy to his name for covering the 1993 flooding along  the Missouri River, along with a Mall Dodson National Headliners Award  in 1981 for his coverage of the Hyatt Regency Skywalk falling in KC.  Furthermore, Mike has been on the board of the Kansas City St.  Patrick's Day Committee and has even been the grand marshal for the St.  Patrick's Day parade. Through it all, he has been one of KC's finest. I  ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing the wonderful career of Mr.  Micheal Mahoney and wish him nothing but joy and happiness in his next  chapter of life.                            ____________________
