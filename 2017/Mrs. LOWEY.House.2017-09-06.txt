 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the devastation in Texas and Louisiana from Hurricane  Harvey warrants swift congressional action. I am pleased we are here  today to ensure that FEMA can continue to support the States affected  by this disaster.   The $7.4 billion for FEMA and $450 million for the Small Business  Administration in H. Res. 502 are only a first step in a long process  that will require a long-term Federal presence.   I represent areas, Mr. Speaker, affected by Superstorm Sandy and  understand, firsthand, the need for Federal intervention when storms  overwhelm State and local capacity. Following Sandy, the last  administration requested and Congress approved funding for resiliency  to ensure that future generations can mitigate the damage from storms  that have grown in intensity.   We can argue about the effects of climate change on storms, but we  must all agree that our communities must receive much-needed mitigation  funding to protect lives and livelihoods in future storms and to  prevent more costly damage.   Despite the fact that some of the Representatives for areas affected  by Hurricane Harvey heavily criticized and voted against the assistance  provided in the wake of Superstorm Sandy, I wholeheartedly support the  funding in this resolution and expect a much larger request from the  administration, including funding to mitigate damage from future  storms.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Cuellar), a member of the Appropriations  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Cuellar), a member of the Appropriations  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gene Green).   Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank our ranking  member not only for yielding to me, but also for her call a couple of  weeks ago.   And I want to thank our colleague from Lubbock, Texas. We have a lot  of water we can send to west Texas, but appreciate the support not just  from Texas, but all across the country. People are coming in  everywhere.   And I see me colleague, Brian Babin, who is my neighbor. We are not  Democrats and Republicans; we are Americans. And that is what we are  seeing. And our Speaker pro tempore of the House, also, is neighbor to  both of us.   But I rise in support of the hundreds of thousands of victims of  Hurricane Harvey in Houston and Harris County and throughout Texas, and  I call on Congress to immediately pass emergency funding to help  victims from this unprecedented disaster.   Our district is in northeast and southeast Houston and Harris County.  We are familiar with hurricanes and tropical storms. We were hit by  Tropical Storm Allison in 2001, hit by Hurricane Ike in 2008.   Harvey's disaster and destruction is beyond anything witnessed in  living memory in Texas, flooding over 100,000 homes in Harris County  alone and killing at least 60 people, including 12 innocent victims in  our district.   Countless lives in Houston and along the Gulf Coast have been put on  hold: families who cannot return to their flooded homes, children whose  schools were damaged, mothers and fathers who cannot go back to work.   I have a school district in northeast Harris County, Sheldon ISD.  They have eight schools. Four of those schools are so damaged they  can't be reopened.   Houstonians and Texans are proud and independent people. We take  pride in our can-do attitude, as witnessed by our brave first  responders and countless volunteers who rescued neighbors during the  worst of the flooding.   I urge all my colleagues to vote for this critical emergency funding  that will help the people of Houston and Texas on the road to recovery.  But this is not the only time we will need this emergency funding.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record an article in Monday's Houston  Chronicle on the dedication of our doctors and public health workers at  the Texas Medical Center in Houston during the worst of Harvey.                        [From the Houston Chronicle]             My 60-Hour Shift in the ER During Hurricane Harvey                             (By Benjamin Gold)         I was on call at St. Luke's when the major flooding began.       I decided to stay in the hospital, along with many other       residents, attendings, nurses and support staff.        It turns out that a hospital is a fantastic place to be in       a crisis--it has food, water, electricity, even Wi-Fi. I       ended up staying there until Monday, taking shifts with other       residents as we watched over our patients. We even saw some       new ones who somehow managed to make their way through       floodwaters to the emergency room.        Here are some of the things I saw during those 60 hours.        I saw nurses working for almost 20 hours straight and       managing way more patients than usual, refusing to leave       them--they didn't know when the next nurses would arrive.        I saw the cafeteria transformed into a support station with       round-the-clock free meals. The lunch tables transformed into       war rooms as the various medical departments strategized       about how to staff the hospital despite being desperately       under capacity. I got meals from the same cafeteria worker--      Anne--on Friday night, Saturday morning, Saturday evening,       Sunday morning, Sunday evening and Monday morning.        I saw patients placed in impossible circumstances. One, a       young man with a son in the ICU at Texas Children's, recently       heard that his house had flooded. He was having high fevers       and coughing up yellow sputum. His chest X-ray showed he had       developed a lobar pneumonia. He was pale and clammy, with       bloodshot eyes.        ``Doc, I need go,'' he told me. ``I have to see my son. I       have to call my wife and make sure she's safe. I can't stay       here.''        I was in the ICU when an impromptu meeting was held to       discuss the fact that no relief would be able to come in for       the foreseeable future. There were only two attendings, each       taking 12-hour shifts so the other could sleep. They'd       already been working for 48 hours.        Midway through one of the shifts, one of the sleeping ICU       doctors woke up and asked the active doctor if he was OK.        ``I'm cruising,'' he said, smiling. He was bleary-eyed and       weary, but it didn't matter. ``I'm rolling,'' he said and       gave a thumbs-up.        ``I'm good to go.''        My fiancee, who also is a doctor, told me that one of her       patients wanted to meet me after they found out that their       doctor had a significant other in the hospital.        ``Sure,'' I said, and went over to the room. They were so       appreciative of her care that they invited us to go fishing       with them in Corpus Christi when this was all over. ``I'm       telling you, you've never seen a more beautiful place to fish       your entire life. You'll stay with us, of course! It won't       cost you a penny.''        The man took out his iPhone and showed us pictures of a       gorgeous coastline, Texas-sized sunsets and smiling nephews       proudly holding up fish as big as they were. ``We'll make it       down there,'' he said. ``We'll get through this.''        Finally, on Monday morning, the first wave of relief       arrived, and those whose houses hadn't flooded and had clear       streets were able to go home. Others weren't so lucky.        The Texas Medical Center is what brought me to Houston. It       has more medical schools, hospitals and nursing facilities       per square foot than any other place on earth. It was       incredible to see the resiliency, camaraderie and       selflessness of those who work there in a crisis. Learning       about what to do in a crisis is standard in medical       education. But to see it in action, to see people refusing to       leave until they knew their patients would be cared for, is       something else entirely.        It's been a grim few days, and the worst is not over. We       don't know how many more casualties there might be. Untold       billions in property damage has already been done. But       Houstonians showed their true colors over this past weekend.       I've never been prouder to be a Texan.  [[Page H6663]]         Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to yield 3 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee), who we know was struggling  with her fellow Texans and trying to be as helpful as she could during  this horrible, horrible disaster.                                time  1045    Ms. JACKSON LEE. I thank the Speaker, and I thank the gentlewoman  from New York. Having known the devastation of hurricanes just a couple  of years ago, I thank her, and along with her as the ranking minority  member, the chairman as well, both coming from the region where they  faced the same devastation.   We come together united. We come bipartisan. We come as friends. As I  said at the NRG shelter just a few days ago, we have hope. We have  hope. We are grateful that we are beginning the process of recovery  with the over $7 billion now being allotted for disaster recovery, $450  million of that being for small businesses. The need is great.   Twelve days ago, on August 25, Hurricane Harvey hit this coast, and  it hit Texas in a very hard way. To put in perspective the devastation  brought by Hurricane Harvey, the volume of water that fell on Houston  and other affected areas of Texas and Louisiana could fill more than  24,000 Astrodomes. Hurricane Harvey was a thousand-year storm. It  claimed many, many lives. Twenty-one trillion gallons of rainfall fell  in Texas. Sustained winds exceeded 130 miles an hour.   I cannot thank, enough, those who gathered and helped, from the local  officials, from Mayor Sylvester Turner and Judge Emmett, to Mayor Aaron  in Humble, to Mayor Diaz in Jacinto City--cities in my congressional  district--to the many volunteers, the Cajun Navy. And might I thank the  Texas National Guard--they were standing up--the Marines, the Navy,  and, of course, the Army. We traveled with them. I thank the Military  Museum of Armed Forces that traveled with me to give out food. We are  still in need.   Thousands of people without apartments who have been evicted have  been told to go. As I walked the streets of Humble, Texas, in my  district, piles and piles and piles of rubbish, people's homes and  possessions, even though they had their family and lives, all of their  possessions out on the front.   This is a time for us to rise without obstacles. This is a time for  us to ensure that all people can be protected. I would like to  highlight the DREAMer that died, Alonso Guillen, who came all the way  from Lufkin, Texas, just be able to save those who he saw were in need.  We need to be able to ensure that he is not discriminated against or my  constituents in certain parts of my district who are afraid to seek  help simply because they are unstatused.   My friends, I know we can find a pathway forward. I know that we can  find a pathway to reauthorize DACA and to do it as soon as possible in  tribute to Alonso Guillen, who died with friends when he brought his  boat, of his own accord, to be able to come and save those.   Let me tell you what we need. We need housing resources. We need to  ensure that we have housing resources to make sure that the people who  were evicted can make sure that they have a way to have a home. We need  small business resources.   I want to thank the gentlewoman for her time, and I know that we will  be working together and making a difference for those who were impacted  by Hurricane Harvey.   My prayers for those who are impacted by Hurricane Irma.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3672, which provides $7.85  billion in supplemental appropriations as the Congress's initial  response to the massive damaged inflicted on Southeast Texas and  Louisiana by Hurricane Harvey.   The speed with which the bipartisan leadership drafted and shepherded  this legislation to the floor bodes well for the major challenges that  must be met and overcome if Congress if the victims of Hurricane Harvey  are to recover from the storm's awful wrath and rebuild their decimated  communities.   I thank Chairman Frelinghuysen and Ranking Member Lowey, and Speaker  Ryan and Democratic Leader Pelosi, for bringing this initial  supplemental funding bill to the floor in a timely manner and which  lets the people of Texas and Louisiana know that the American people  stand in solidarity with them in their moment of heartbreak and  anguish.   Mr. Speaker, just 12 days, on August 25, 2017, Hurricane Harvey made  landfall for the first time in the state of Texas, just north of the  city of Corpus Christi.   Before it was finished, Hurricane Harvey dropped 21 trillion gallons  of rainfall on Texas and Louisiana, most of it on the Houston  Metroplex.   To put in perspective the devastation wrought by Hurricane Harvey,  the volume of water that fell on Houston and other affected areas of  Texas and Louisiana could fill more than 24,000 Astrodomes or supply  the water for the raging Niagara Falls for 15 days.   Whole sections of Houston, Beaumont, Bayou City, Port Arthur, and  other cities were underwater for days.   Hurricane Harvey was a 1,000 year storm that has to date claimed the  lives of at least 30 persons, including a 34-year veteran of the  Houston Police Department and a family of six who perished in Greens  Bayou while trying to evacuate their flooded home and community.   It also claimed the life of a Dreamer, Alonso Guillen, a young  Houstonian who came to Texas from Mexico as a teenager, and who died  when his boat capsized while he was rescuing survivors of the flooding  caused by Hurricane Harvey.   Neither Houston nor any city in the nation has ever experienced  flooding of the magnitude caused by Hurricane Harvey.   The statistics are staggering.   21 trillion gallons of rainfall fell in Texas and Louisiana in the  first five days of the storm.   The estimated maximum sustained winds exceeded 130 miles per hour as  the hurricane made landfall near Rockport, Texas on August 25.   A record 4,323 days, which is nearly 12 years, elapsed since a major  hurricane (Category 3 or above) made landfall in the United States  prior to Hurricane Harvey; the last Category 3 hurricane to hit the  United States was Hurricane Wilma in 2005, the same year Hurricane  Katrina destroyed much of New Orleans.   The city of Cedar Bayou received 51.88 inches of rainfall, breaking  the record for rainfall from a single storm in the continental United  States; my city of Houston received more than 5o inches of rainfall.   More than 13,000 people have been rescued in the Houston area and  more than  [[Page H6664]]  30,000 persons are expected to be forced out of their homes due to the  storm.   More than 8,800 federal personnel were staff deployed to help respond  to Hurricane Harvey, supplying approximately 2.9 million meals, 2.8  million liters of water, 37,000 tarps, and 130 generators.   In the first three days of the storm, more than 49,000 homes that had  suffered flood damage and more than 1,000 homes were completely  destroyed in the storm.   Mr. Speaker, valiant emergency responders are overextended and  citizen rescues have become a critical source of assistance in saving  lives.   Local authorities closed major freeways, airports, and schools.   Emergency shelters are filled to capacity and efforts to rescue  residents continue around the clock.   The anticipated cost of removing debris is expected to dwarf the $70  million spent by Houston removing debris after Hurricane Ike in 2008.   We do not yet know the full cost in human lives exacted by Hurricane  Harvey.   But what we do know is that the costs of recovery and reconstruction  will far exceed any natural disaster in memory; best estimates place  the cost in the range of $150-$200 billion.   Mr. Speaker, there is much work to be done in my city of Houston, and  across the areas affected by the terrible, awesome storm that will be  forever known simply as Hurricane Harvey.   That is why I strongly support the legislation pending before us  appropriating $7.85 billion as the initial response of the Congress to  the damage caused by an epic storm.   I must emphasize that what we are considering here is the initial  response because much more funding will be needed for Houston--the  nation's fourth largest city--and Southeast Texas to recover and  rebuild.   For that reason, I urge all Members to join me in support of H.R.  3672 and to commit to providing our fellow Americans in Texas and  Louisiana all of the help and support they need to restore their  communities to their previous greatness.    Mr. Speaker, before I yield to our next speaker, I would  just thank Mr. Culberson. I just want to thank you, Mr. Culberson,  because, of course, we are all totally supportive of this aid package,  but I remember that you were the only Member from the majority in Texas  who supported our Sandy package. I just wanted to, at this time, thank  you again for your generosity and your warm heart for every American.    I yield to the gentleman from Texas.    Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Al Green).   Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I also thank the ranking member  for her kind words. I would like to thank the chairperson for bringing  this to the floor, both of them.   Mr. Speaker, this is a seminal moment in time, a moment in time that  can shape the rest of our time. This is an opportunity for those of us  who contend that we are our brother's keeper to, in fact, become our  brother's keeper. You see, you can't be your brother's keeper without  keeping your brother. This is a chance to be your brother's keeper.  This is a chance for the unity that we express when we are before the  cameras to manifest itself in the votes that we cast here in Congress.  This is a seminal moment in time.   This is a moment in time for us to care not only about those who live  in the suites of life, but also those who dwell in the streets of life,  those who live on benches, those who sleep under bridges. It is an  opportunity for us to cast a vote that will send aid, send assistance  to those in Houston, Texas, and all across the area that has been  devastated by this monster. It is a chance for us to help them.   But this is only a downpayment, only a downpayment. There must be  much more. We need help in Houston posthaste, as is the case with other  places around the country that have been devastated.   We need help for housing, not only for those who had homes before the  monster hit, but also for those who didn't have homes who need to  transition to a place that they can call home. If home is where the  heart is, where is the heart of the homeless, people who sleep under  bridges? Where is the heart of the homeless?   They have to be given a place that they can call home as well, which  means, at some point, we have got to have dollars appropriated for the  organizations that help those who live in the streets of life: the  homeless. We have got to help them, too. If we can help those in the  suites, we can help those in the streets.   I would also say to my colleagues: Please understand, people who are  here and undocumented have needs, too. They live in places that are  horrible. I have been in their homes. I have smelled the mold. I know  what it is  [[Page H6665]]  like to see the conditions that they dwell in. It is time for us to put  aside the politics that divide us from people who need help and help  those people, too. Let's send some more money to the organizations that  help them.   This is a moment in time. This is a seminal moment in time. It is  time for us to step up and help everyone that is harmed, not be  selective. If you are in this country and you are hurting, we ought to  help you. God bless you.   I thank you, Madam Leader on my side, the ranking member. I thank you  again, Mr. Chairman, and I beg that we do what we can to make sure  every person in this country receives the help he or she deserves.                                                City of Houston,                                     Houston, TX, September 1, 2017.      Mr. Brock Long,      FEMA Administrator, Department of Homeland Security,           Washington, DC.        Dear Administrator Long: The City of Houston has       experienced a catastrophic event, Hurricane Harvey, and the       assistance of FEMA is critical to the recovery of our       families and community. We are requesting your expeditious       action on the following:        100% federal reimbursement for Categories A (debris       removal) & B (emergency protective measures) as was approved       for Katrina, Rita and Ike.        Advance funding for the Public Assistance program (all       categories of work)        We are seeking the initial advance funding of $300 million       of which $100 million will be used for immediate debris       removal.        As we get more accurate damage assessment estimates, our       goal is to secure total advance funding.        At least 15-20 Disaster Recovery Centers to be adequately       staffed throughout the City of Houston to expedite assistance       to individuals        Deploy 4-5 centers for each quadrant of the City        Provide adequate staffing to ensure that disaster survivors       are promptly assisted        Funding of up to $1.75 billion for a FEMA Sheltering and       Temporary Essential Power (STEP) or Rapid Repair program to       expedite the return of families to their homes and contribute       to a whole community recovery for approximately 50k homes.        We are seeking to increase the cap of this funding to up to       $35,000/home        100% advance funding and expedited processing for First       Responders who lost property in the line of duty.        The City of Houston wishes to serve as a pilot program for       the 100 Houston Fire Department and 200 Houston Police       Department personnel who had significant damage to their       homes and losses due to Hurricane Harvey. Many of these First       Responders are not insured.        The City of Houston will also be asking HUD for an       immediate release for CDBG-DR funds and seek FEMA support in       this request to compliment the recovery efforts. The       coordinated and timely release of funds will enable the City       of Houston to become more resilient and recover faster.        Thank you for your consideration of my requests.

Mr. Brock Long,      FEMA Administrator, Department of Homeland Security,           Washington, DC.        Dear Administrator Long: The City of Missouri City has       suffered the worse catastrophic event it has ever seen with       Hurricane Harvey. The assistance of FEMA will be critical for       our families and our community to recover. We are humbly       requesting that FEMA assist us with the following need:        100% federal reimbursement for Categories A (debris       removal) & B (emergency protective measures) as was approved       for Hurricane Katrina, Rita, and Ike.        Advance funding for the Public Assistance (all categories       of work)        As we get more accurate damage assessment estimates, our       ultimate goal is to secure total advance funding.        Our city is ready to accept Disaster Recovery Centers where       we might have that ability, for Disaster Recovery Centers for       IA (individual assistance) and PA (public assistance) to be       adequately staffed to expedite assistance as we have in the       past with other disasters.        Funding of up to $20 million for FEMA Sheltering and       Temporary Essential Power (STEP) or Rapid Repair Program to       expedite the return of families to their homes and contribute       to a whole community recovery for approximately 1,000 to       1,500 homes.

The City of Missouri City will also be asking for HUD for       immediate release of CDBG-DR funds and seeking FEMA support       in this request to compliment the recovery efforts. The       coordination and timely release of funds will enable the City       of Missouri City to become more resilient and recover faster.            Sincerely,                                                  Mayor Allen Owen.     Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Roybal-Allard), a very distinguished  ranking member from the Homeland Security Subcommittee on the  Appropriations Committee.   Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Mr. Speaker, there is no question that this  supplemental funding is needed, and needed quickly. When the response  to Harvey began in late August, the major disaster account of the  disaster relief fund had approximately $2 billion available. The  response to this catastrophe, however, is costing close to $200 million  per day. This means that despite the recent $1 billion increase into  this account, FEMA could run out of money at any time.   Therefore, the enactment of the additional $7.4 billion for the  disaster relief fund in this supplemental is critical to help meet  FEMA's immediate operational needs for Hurricane Harvey, and to allow  for the resumption of recovery payments for prior disasters such as  Sandy.   The supplemental would also provide a small reserve to ensure that  FEMA can begin responding to Hurricane Irma, or any other new disaster  that occurs between now and September 30, 2017.   It is important to note, however, that if there is significant damage  from Irma, FEMA will quickly need either an additional reprogramming of  money, a second supplemental appropriation, or both.   I applaud the majority for quickly bringing the supplemental package  to the floor with the emergency designations.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  the Virgin Islands (Ms. Plaskett), who understands the impact of a  disaster of this kind not only in her district, but in other areas  where there has been so much suffering.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Crowley), the chairman of the Democratic Caucus.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Engel).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee), who has been right there helping, reaching out  to all of those families who are in desperate need.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, to the distinguished gentlewoman, I  come now to just stand on behalf of our delegation to be able to say,  as I said earlier, I acknowledge the pain of Sandy.   But I now come to make sure that we all understand that this first  crunch is only the beginning. We are going to put in legislation that  asks for $180 billion, recognizing the hard work of appropriators, and  letting you know that people's lives, as we walk through the debris  that is in front of every house--it is painful. It is long lasting.   So I just wanted to come to give my thanks and to ask: Will you  please stand with me for the long journey that is going to be needed  for the infrastructure we build; new dams that are 30 years old; and  housing issues that will not end today; and the massive eviction of  people in apartments? Not cruelly, I hope, but they are getting  eviction notices with no place to go.   Mr. Speaker, so I ask that we as Americans join for the long haul,  the long destiny, with prayers for all.   I thank Mrs. Lowey for yielding to me so that we can talk about the  long haul.   God bless America.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1115     Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 8 minutes.   Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to this bill, which would  turn back the clock on American excellence, following President Trump's  lead on divesting from education, health, foreign assistance, science,  and infrastructure.   The process for this bill has been outrageous, and this debate,  frankly, is an utter waste of time. Just hours ago, Congressional  leadership and the President agreed to pass a package including  Hurricane Harvey assistance as well as a debt limit extension and a  continuing resolution to keep government running until December 15. We  should be working to pass that measure now so that we can work toward a  bipartisan budget agreement instead of wasting days on a bill that  undercuts economic growth and priorities on which families rely, and is  so hyperpartisan it will never earn the Democratic support needed to be  enacted.   Breaking from longstanding tradition that enables Members to advance  amendments in an open process, the Rules Committee required amendments  be submitted 12 days ago during the District work period and reported a  restrictive, structured rule for relatively few of them so far.   The majority denied consideration of many amendments that would  address timely, high-profile challenges, some of which cut to the core  of our democracy, and would have been allowed under an open rule. In  one of the most egregious examples, the majority blocked an amendment  to provide safeguards to ensure the integrity of government reports on  violent domestic extremism, the likes of which erupted in  Charlottesville in recent weeks, resulting in the death of a young  woman exercising her right to freedom of speech.   Not only were amendments to address the President's revocation of  DACA deemed out of order, in an affront to the Appropriations Committee  and to this institution, the majority removed a bipartisan amendment  passed in committee that would have allowed DREAMers to work for the  Federal Government.   My friends, we have a responsibility to pass the DREAM Act now. It is  absurd that, after years of receiving bipartisan majority support,  Republican leadership has refused to allow a vote.   The Rules Committee should make in order amendments to protect the  integrity of our elections and the independence of the special  counsel's Russia investigation.   This bill also fails on the merits. The nondefense bills are below  sequestration levels set in law, slashing funding for teacher training,  apprenticeship grants to help young adults train for good jobs, law  enforcement grants that help keep our communities safe, environmental  protections that ensure we drink clean water, breathe clean air,  highway and transit grants that improve the quality of life for our  constituents, and a number of scientific and research programs that are  important for global competitiveness.   This bill is littered with riders with deep-rooted opposition, like  cutting funding for Planned Parenthood. If the majority is serious  about governing, loading must-pass spending bills with these policy  riders is a surefire way to fail.   Turning to the State and Foreign Operations division of the bill, I  want to thank Steve Marchese, Erin Kolodjeski, and Matt Washington with  the subcommittee; Liz Leibowitz and Dean Fischer from my office; Craig  Higgins, Susan Adams, Clelia Alvarado, David Bortnick, Winnie Chang,  Lacy Kilraine, Megan O'Donnell, and Alex Pinson with the majority.   Diplomacy and development efforts are critical to protecting our  country's national security and building stronger and more stable  communities around the world. That is why cuts in this division are so  deeply troubling.   As demonstrated through both the President's unworkable request and  the subcommittee's unsustainable allocation, the majority does not  fully embrace the vital role diplomatic and development activities add  to our national security and economic interests abroad.   On the positive side, the bill sustains our bipartisan and unwavering  support for our close ally and partner Israel, as well as Jordan. And I  do appreciate Chairman Rogers protecting resources for basic education,  water, sanitation, democracy, and some vital women's programs, which  provide communities the foundations for inclusive economic growth and  poverty reduction.   While he rejected the most extreme proposals in the President's  budget, the allocation is insufficient to respond to global challenges.  We must reverse dangerous and shortsighted cuts for programs such as  multilateral cooperation, international family planning, and climate  change, as well as the expansion of the Global Gag Rule to all global  health programs, and the prohibition on U.S. contributions to UNFPA.   The Rules Committee should have made in order amendments I submitted  to strike the expansion of the Global Gag Rule and the ban on funding  for the United Nations Population Fund, and to restore essential  funding for international development and diplomacy.   Despite the administration's professed hope that other nations will  fill the gaps created by cuts in this bill, we are at risk of that void  being filled by those who oppose our values and interests, leaving the  world far different from what we want for our children and  grandchildren.   It is time for the majority to set aside its most extreme proposals,  including the border wall and interior immigration enforcement, and  work with Democrats to write bipartisan legislation that could actually  be enacted.   Mr. Chairman, I urge a ``no'' vote, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Serrano), the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Commerce,  Justice, Science, and Related Agencies.    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Ohio  (Ms. Kaptur), who is the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Energy  and Water Development, and Related Agencies.    Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentlewoman.    Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentlewoman.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the distinguished Democratic whip.    Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman from Maryland.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  North Carolina (Mr. Price), the ranking member of the Committee on  Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies.   Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Chairman, I thank our ranking member  for yielding, and I thank her and our chairman for their good work.   I must still rise, however, in opposition to the fiscal 2018  Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies  bill, and the Republican Omnibus bill.   I want to stress, Mr. Chairman, that I am heartened, as I imagine  every Member of this body is heartened, by the bipartisan cooperation  we have been able to muster to reach out to our neighbors in Texas and  Louisiana who have been so devastated. It is the same kind of  solidarity and cooperation that I know we will muster, whatever the  need is after Irma reaches our shores. We anticipate that storm with a  great deal of concern and apprehension.   We have a history in this body of pulling together when it matters  for our neighbors whenever disasters strike. That kind of cooperation  is absolutely essential to who we are as a country and who we are as an  institution.   Mr. Chair, I want to urge that we bring that same spirit of  cooperation,  [[Page H6840]]  that same understanding of the historic cooperation that has  characterized appropriations, to our larger appropriations challenge.  After all, this is the power of the purse. This is our main  constitutional power, and history shows it works best when it is  exercised cooperatively, no matter who the President is or what the  party division is.   We need to work in a cooperative fashion to make sure that this power  is just as effectively and responsibly exercised as possible. This  eight-bill exercise in which we are engaged today is a deeply flawed  process. We need to overcome this, and I believe eventually we will,  with a bipartisan budget agreement such as we have had each of the last  4 years. This will let us cooperatively write appropriations bills that  address our country's needs. But that is not where we are today, Mr.  Chairman.   I do want to give the chairman of our subcommittee, Mario Diaz-Balart  of Florida, credit for an open and collaborative process, but he and  the subcommittee have been dealt an inadequate hand. We simply can't do  what needs to be done with this allocation.   In the case of the T-HUD bill, we have only appropriated $56.5  billion for vital transportation, housing and community development  programs, and that is $1.1 billion less than the enacted level. We have  got to do better than this. We have got to do right by our country's  infrastructure needs.   One of the most egregious omissions in this bill is funding for the  TIGER program. This is a program that has addressed infrastructure  needs across our country. Estimates are that we are addressing only 5  percent of the meritorious projects put forward under TIGER.   I can tell you about one project we are funding. I visited it last  week: Union Station in Raleigh, North Carolina, a beautiful multimodal  facility that is going to facilitate passenger rail, transit, buses,  intermodal transportation, and it is going to revitalize a landmark  downtown district.                                time  1715    That is an ideal use of TIGER funds. Communities all over this  country need that sort of investment, yet this bill zeros that program  out completely. It also cuts New Starts for transit--Capital Investment  Grants--by $659 million.   Now, I give the chairman credit for including bill language to ensure  that the FTA continues to rate and review projects in the New Starts  pipeline, but at this funding level, only a few of those projects can  actually be funded. Our cities across this country are eager to  institute transit programs. They have gone through all the steps to do  this responsibly. We need to keep faith with those communities by  improving on this aspect of our bill.   Over at HUD, the Choice Neighborhoods program--formerly called HOPE  VI--that has transformed dozens of public housing developments into  thriving, mixed-income communities, receives only $20 million in this  bill compared to $137 million in the fiscal '17 bill. Now, I recognize  this is a placeholder amount, and I look forward to working to improve  this number moving forward.   The CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.    Mr. Chairman, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman.   Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Additionally, the Community Development  Block Grant and HOME programs are each cut by $100 million in this bill  despite bipartisan calls from local elected officials across the  country to preserve those funding streams.   We are in the midst of a housing crisis nationally. Only one in four  people eligible for Federal rental assistance can receive it. We have a  huge public housing capital backlog, and our infrastructure continues  to crumble, resulting in decaying highways and bridges and congested  roads. We should be increasing our commitment to meet these housing and  transportation needs, not shortchanging them. We have done this for far  too long already.   We have returned again and again to appropriations, especially  domestic appropriations, to bear the whole brunt of deficit reduction.  The results are a disaster for our economy and for the work of our  appropriations committees.   It is truly the worst of both worlds. We are not really addressing  the main drivers of the deficit, yet we are doing untold damage to  critical national investments.   I strongly object also to several policy riders in this bill. They  unnecessarily attack high-speed rail, they roll back transportation  safety, and they harm labor rights.   No number of amendments offered today can fix this bill. I remain  hopeful that ultimately we can get a serious budget agreement. In the  meantime, I urge my colleagues to reject this omnibus bill.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro), who is the outstanding ranking member of the  Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and  Related Agencies.   Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this bill. While I  am glad to see the Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and  Related Agencies bill on the floor, this is the first time it has been  considered with amendments since the 2010 appropriations cycle. But  even with that, I cannot support the underlying bill.   I will be blunt. This process is a sham. The combined omnibus would  violate the Budget Control Act caps. It triggers a sequester of $72  billion from the Department of Defense. I am troubled to see the Labor- HHS bill, once again, bearing the brunt of Republican budget cuts.   The overall cuts to nondefense discretionary spending is $8 billion,  and the Labor-HHS bill is cut by more than $5 billion. This cut, by the  way, is completely unnecessary because the allocations that we approved  are approximately $5 billion below what they have said we need for  nondefense spending, which is allowed under the Budget Control Act. We  have the resources available, yet the majority refuses to allocate them  to the essential programs funded through this bill.   I will also note that when adjusting for inflation, the Labor-HHS  bill is approximately $30 billion below what it was in 2010.   Instead of moving this bill, we ought to be negotiating a bipartisan  budget deal to lift the sequestration caps on both defense and  nondefense programs, then we could begin working on a bipartisan basis  to draft a reasonable Labor-HHS bill that adequately funds the programs  that support the middle class.    The biggest economic challenge of our time is that too many people  are in jobs that just don't pay them enough to live on. The programs in  this bill provide opportunities for hardworking Americans to improve  themselves and for our economy to grow. We need a country that works  for the middle class and the vulnerable, not just the wealthy and those  with the most lobbyists.   Right now, we grow jobs, but not incomes. The Federal Government has  long played a key role in helping American workers learn and grow  through workforce development and connecting businesses with talent.  But the programs that help grow our economy, educate our students, and  protect our women and seniors cannot operate if the Labor-HHS bill is  starved for funding, which is why I oppose the underlying bill.   I admit that there are a few bright spots. I strongly support the  increases for NIH research, emergency preparedness, special education,  and the TRIO and GEAR UP programs. Unfortunately, the modest increases  in this bill are far outweighed by decimating cuts to programs that  ought to be seeing increases.   This bill fails our students and is fundamentally anti-teacher. It  fails to make new investments in Title I. It eliminates $2 billion for  supporting effective instruction grants--what that is is teacher  training.   This bill's approach to women's health pushes a dangerous and harmful  ideological agenda and eliminates funding for Title X Family Planning.  It also eliminates the Teen Pregnancy Prevention Program, and it  includes ideological riders that would block funding for Planned  Parenthood and effectively block lifesaving research that use stem  cells from fetal tissue.   The bill cuts access to the Mental Health Block Grant and the  Substance Abuse Prevention Program. It cuts nurse training, tobacco  prevention, and it completely eliminates the Minority HIV/AIDS  Initiative.   It hurts workers by eliminating the Employment Service, which helped  nearly 6 million unemployed workers, including veterans, find jobs in  2015. It eliminates grants expanding the highly effective Registered  Apprenticeship model that connects jobseekers with good-paying jobs  that employers are desperate to fill. It also cuts funding for other  job training programs like Job Corps and the Dislocated Workers  Program.   Why would we eliminate programs that for so long have been about  economic opportunity and a ladder to the middle class?   There are the riders, which I mentioned. This bill blocks funding for  the Affordable Care Act. It continues to prohibit funding for gun  violence prevention, which has had a chilling effect on gun violence  research.   Finally, it prohibits the Department of Labor from ensuring that  financial advisers act in the best interests of their clients. This  week we expect to see several more harmful riders added to the bill.   At full committee markup, we proposed more than 40 amendments to  strengthen and improve this bill, but the majority rejected all of  them.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to oppose this minibus because the  funding in this bill fails to meet our country's needs, and it breaks  our promises to women, to seniors, to students, and to our workforce.   While I am strongly opposed to this bill, I do want to thank the  committee staff--majority and minority--the ranking member; the chair  of the committee; and the chair of the subcommittee, Mr. Cole.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Indiana (Mr. Visclosky), the ranking member of the Subcommittee on  Defense.   (Mr. VISCLOSKY asked and was given permission to revise and extend  his remarks.)    Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Roybal-Allard), ranking member of the Homeland Security  Subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee.   Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Mr. Chairman, the FY 2018 Department of Homeland  Security funding bill addresses many bipartisan priorities, including  maintaining funding for first responder and antiterrorism grants and  the Emergency Food and Shelter Program. It provides increases above the  request for the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, Nonprofit  Security grants, new Coast Guard assets, and ICE child exploitation  investigations. It also restores funding for Science and Technology  Centers of Excellence.   The bill restores funding for flood mapping grants, which the  administration proposed to eliminate, and funding for pre-disaster  mitigation grants, for which the administration proposed a 60 percent  cut. These grants support precisely the kinds of programs that help  communities mitigate and prepare for the impacts of natural disasters  like Hurricane Harvey, and we should be investing in them even more.   The bill also provides the President's request for the Disaster  Relief Fund. We will, however, need to appropriate more money beyond  that approved by the House earlier today in order to address the damage  caused by Harvey and, potentially, Irma.   While there is much in this bill Democrats can support,  unfortunately, for several reasons, we cannot support this bill. For  example, we cannot support the bill's $705 million increase for  [[Page H6843]]  Interior immigration enforcement. This includes an increase of 4,676  detention beds, which is 10,000 above fiscal year 2016, and the hiring  of 1,000 additional ICE officers and agents.   The administration says its more aggressive enforcement approach is  critical to national security and public safety. In fact, ICE is now  arresting people with no criminal infractions who have lived, worked,  and paid taxes in this country for years--and even decades.   These arrests are not required for national security or public  safety. They have tragic consequences for families and communities all  over this country. The trauma being inflicted on them cannot be  overstated.   Mr. Chairman, we are dealing with a moral question as much as a legal  one. ICE has the discretion to enforce our immigration laws fairly and  justly, and Congress has the discretion to prioritize how we spend  taxpayer dollars.   Instead of overly aggressive immigration enforcement, we should be  investing more in real security vulnerabilities. These include  cybersecurity, human trafficking investigations, Coast Guard vessels  and aircraft, flood mapping, and pre-disaster mitigation.   We should invest in more Customs officers. We should restore funding  for research and laboratory facilities at the Science and Technology  Directorate and for TSA's Law Enforcement Officer Reimbursement  Program. Unfortunately, we are not doing any of this.   However, before concluding, I want to take a moment to talk about the  Trump administration's announcement yesterday on ending the DACA  program.   An amendment I offered in committee to clarify the basic authority of  DHS to continue the program failed on a party-line vote. It would have  given Congress time to enact a more formal authorization and given  DREAMers the peace of mind of knowing they would not have to go back  into the shadows. With the administration's announcement yesterday,  that peace of mind has been cruelly snatched away.   We shouldn't wait 6 months to fix this problem. The majority should  bring my bipartisan, bicameral bill, the DREAM Act, to the floor as  soon as possible so that DREAMers can continue to contribute to this  country free of the fear of being deported from the only home they  know.   In closing, Mr. Chairman, I want to extend my appreciation for the  efforts of the subcommittee chairman, Chairman Carter, and his staff,  who worked with the minority throughout the development of this bill.  Consistent with prior years, Chairman Carter has carried out his  responsibilities honorably, fairly, and collaboratively.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Bishop), the ranking member of the Subcommittee on  Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and  Related Agencies.    Mr. Chairman, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman.    Mr. Chairman, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Minnesota (Ms. McCollum), ranking member of the Interior, Environment,  and Related Agencies Subcommittee.   (Ms. McCOLLUM asked and was given permission to revise and extend her  remarks.)   Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chair, I would like to just take a brief second and  thank the full committee chair and the full committee ranking member  for their support as we move forward in this progress, and a special  thank you to all the great staff on both sides of the aisle, the  Democratic and Republican staff.   But my very special thanks to Chairman Calvert, and once again, for  his staff and our staff, for their work in an open and collaborative  approach. This committee has a challenging portfolio of issues, and I  commend the chairman's efforts to find solutions in yet another  difficult budget year.   Unfortunately, the fiscal year 2018 Interior, Environment, and  Related Agencies Subcommittee allocation is $824 million less than last  year's enacted level.                                time  1800    This devastating cut to the allocation shortchanges the protection of  our Nation's natural and cultural resources and has real consequences  for American families and communities.   Adequate funding for the Interior, Environment division is critical  at a time when the Trump administration is attacking the science behind  climate change and rolling back regulations that protect the water we  drink and the air we breathe.   We are at a defining moment in history. Our lack of action to combat  climate change now will impact the world we pass on to our children and  grandchildren. We can no longer afford to disregard the overwhelming  scientific evidence that the planet is warming, sea levels are rising,  and glaciers are melting.   We have all seen the destruction inflicted by Hurricane Harvey. As  the waters recede, the Environmental Protection Agency is playing a key  role in keeping Americans safe. Once again, we are reminded of the  importance of agencies like the EPA both during times of crisis and on  a daily basis.   Unfortunately, EPA receives the most significant programmatic cuts to  this division. Slashing the Environmental Protection Agency by $534  million will severely impact the Agency's ability to protect human  health and safety and ensure clean air and clean water for all  Americans.   The Agency's budget is already $2.2 billion below FY10 levels. It is  irresponsible to cut the EPA even further.   The bill also cuts programs critical to managing public lands and  reduces funding necessary for endangered species listing protection.  The American people expect us to be good stewards of our public lands  and wildlife, but this bill falls short on that commitment.   Despite the bill's shortcomings in environmental protection and  resource conservation, I want to express how proud I am of this  subcommittee's nonpartisan approach to addressing issues facing our  Native American brothers and sisters.   I am pleased that the bill recommends an increase of $108 million  over the fiscal year 2017 enacted level for programs critical to Indian  Country. The health, education, and safety of tribal communities is a  Federal responsibility that our subcommittee takes very seriously. That  is one bright spot in this bill.   Unfortunately, this bill falls far short in too many other areas,  both as a result of our low allocation and as a result of wildfire  suppression costs that are burning a hole in this bill. Since the start  of this year, more than 1.1 million acres have burned. As a result, the  U.S. Forest Service does not have adequate funding in the current  fiscal year to combat these disasters. They will need to borrow funds  from nonfire accounts, making it harder for the Service to conduct  preparedness activities to reduce the severity of wildfires. That is  why every member of the Interior Subcommittee is a cosponsor of  Chairman Simpson's Wildfire Disaster Funding Act.   I am very disappointed that the majority's leadership missed an  opportunity to include those commonsense reforms in this legislation.  That is why I have called for emergency funding for wildfire  suppression activities in the next disaster supplemental.   Finally, in addition to the irresponsible cuts to the EPA and natural  resource programs, I must express my concern and disappointment with  the partisan riders in this bill that pander to special interests at  the expense of the public good. These riders jeopardize protection and  recovery for vulnerable species, restrict protection of our oceans,  undermine clean water and clean air safeguards, and even prevent the  development of renewable energy.   Mr. Chairman, this bill is not sufficient to meet the needs of the  American people. I know that we can do better than this. Congress needs  a bipartisan budget agreement that increases nondefense discretionary  spending levels.   Despite my current opposition, I want to be clear that I will  continue to work with Chairman Calvert through this year's  appropriations process to produce a responsible bill that both parties  can support.    Mr. Chairman, I am very pleased to yield 4 minutes to the  gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Quigley), ranking member of the  Subcommittee on Financial Services and General Government.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Maxine Waters), the ranking member on the Financial  Services Committee.   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chair, I strongly oppose H.R.  3354, a bill that not only fails to make critical investments in our  Nation's future, but also eliminates important protections for everyday  Americans.   As ranking member of the Financial Services Committee, I am  particularly concerned that H.R. 3354 imposes such severe cuts on the  Department of Housing and Urban Development that it will result in  families losing their housing assistance and putting them at risk for  homelessness.   The bill also takes some of the worst provisions from the  Republican's ``Wrong'' CHOICE Act that would return our economy to the  reckless practices that caused the financial crisis.   One provision takes away the authority of the Consumer Financial  Protection Bureau to stop abusive practices by banks like Wells Fargo,  which ripped off more than 3.5 million of its customers. Another  provision repeals the Labor Department's commonsense rule that protects  seniors from conflicted retirement advice from unscrupulous financial  advisers.   There are so many gifts to Wall Street, one would think Christmas  came early. But it isn't Christmas, Mr. Chair. It is September, and we  are in the middle of hurricane season. Our cities are literally under  water, yet the Republican leadership has done nothing to prevent the  National Flood Insurance Program from expiring at the end of the month.   Republicans have also let us come dangerously close to defaulting on  our debt and the obligations owed to servicemembers, veterans, seniors,  and the most vulnerable among us. Just yesterday, 800,000 young  Democrats were told by our President that their future is in the hands  of a hostile Congress.   We must oppose this bill so we can get to work on what Congress  should really be doing.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
