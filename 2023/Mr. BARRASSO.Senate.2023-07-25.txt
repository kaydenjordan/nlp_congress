 Madam President, at the 111th Wyoming State Fair,  Senator Lummis and I will have the pleasure of introducing Jon and  Dianne Kirkbride as 2023 inductees to the Wyoming Agriculture Hall of  Fame.   Jon and Dianne Kirkbride have been devoted to each other and the  agriculture industry for over five decades. They have been married for  55 years while also running a multi-operational ranch, the Harding and  Kirkbride Livestock Company. Harding and Kirkbride Livestock company is  located 32 miles outside of Cheyenne, WY. The ranch has hosted tours  during the Cheyenne Frontier Days Fair and Rodeo, educating the public  on Wyoming ranch life.   Dianne devoted decades to the beef industry. She is a member of  Wyoming CattleWomen, of which she is the past president. She advocates  for American and Wyoming beef. Dianne was selected as the American  National CattleWomen's Woman of the Year in 2001 for her years of  dedicated service to the cattle industry. Dianne also worked for  Senator Mike Enzi as a field representative in Cheyenne for 20 years.   Dianne's service to her community doesn't end here. She is on the  Cheyenne Regional Medical Board of Trustees, the Laramie County  Community College Foundation Board, and the Congressional Award  Council, where she was the president for 6 years. Through her work in  the Wyoming Congressional Awards Program, Dianne mentored more than 80  students in volunteer and community service projects for the past 24  years. Dianne regularly follows up with kids that she worked with 20  years ago. She is delighted when she hears about all of their  impressive accomplishments. These students learned early on the value  of being involved and giving back to their communities. This is a great  example of how the Kirkbrides are influencing the next generation in  Wyoming.   Jon runs the ranch while also contributing to the beef industry on a  local, State, and national level. He is committed to agriculture in  Wyoming and to Wyoming public schools. Jon has served as president of  the Wyoming Stock Growers Association and as the Wyoming director of  the U.S. Meat Export Federation. Jon also spent 16 years on the Laramie  County School District No. 2 Board of Trustees. He served as president  of the Wyoming School Board Association and also served on the Wyoming  State Board of Education. In addition to serving his community, Jon  served his country in the U.S. Air Force.   Together, Jon and Dianne have garnered an impressive list of  accomplishments. Both Jon and Dianne exemplify the leadership in  Wyoming agriculture that the Agriculture Hall of Fame has recognized  for over 20 years. Jon and Dianne have three sons TJ, Jeff, and Glen.  TJ and his wife Michelle have two daughters Maddy and Bryn and two boys  Brady and Joel. Jeff and Jami have six boys Taylor, Carter, Jackson,  Jayden, Grayson, and Bennett, along with their daughter Savannah. Glen  and Rochel have three children Kayla, Morgan, and Shelby. Jon and  Dianne's son Jeff and grandson Taylor are both ranchers living in  Meriden. TJ is a counselor at Triumph High School, and Glen is also a  teacher and coach at Central High School. Dianne and Jon's children are  a testament to their dedication for education in Wyoming.   Jon and Dianne's unmatched passion for family, Wyoming agriculture,  wildlife and animal conservation, and cultivating partnerships make  them an outstanding choice for the Wyoming Agriculture Hall of Fame.   It is a great honor to participate in their induction. They continue  to represent Wyoming and Western interests with dedication and  distinction. My wife Bobbi joins me in congratulating Jon and Dianne as  2023 inductees into the Wyoming Agriculture Hall of Fame.                            ____________________     Madam President, I would like to take the opportunity  to express my appreciation to Haley for her hard work as an intern in  my Casper office.
