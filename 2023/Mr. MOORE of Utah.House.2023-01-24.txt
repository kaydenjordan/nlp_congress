 Mr. Speaker, I hereby remove my name as cosponsor  of H.R. 25.    Mr. Speaker, as our country grapples with how to  respond to this pressing moment facing women, families, and children, I  believe we must strive for a better, more compassionate future.   All Americans want women and their babies to be safe, loved, and  empowered, no matter their situation or socioeconomic status.   I believe Americans are capable of seizing this moment and coming  together to support those facing tremendous challenges and uncertainty.   We can support critical, comprehensive services for women in need. We  can make it easier for working-class families to earn money and raise  children, and we can support the rights and dignity of our youngest  Americans.   This month, I was elected to serve on the Ways and Means Committee,  and I intend to use this position to do better by American families.    We owe our most vulnerable children more effective policies that give  them a better runway to achieve their dreams in a broken world.   I am engaging on Title IV-B and IV-E programs to ensure child welfare  and foster care programs are as evidence based as MIECHV.   I am engaging on the Connecting Forever Families Act to expedite  foster care placements and help child welfare courts adopt new  procedures to address the unacceptable delays and backlogs for children  waiting for placements in supportive homes.   I will fight for children in foster care who have to spend nights in  shelters, government offices, or other inappropriate settings because  of our congregate care crisis.   I am shedding light on the unfair audit rates of families who have  claimed their adoption tax credit, 70 percent of whom were audited in  the most recent available data.   Children are obviously our future and we must work harder to ensure  every child has the opportunity and resources to thrive and succeed.
