 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to say how  incredibly proud I am to be representing Minnesota's Second District.  It is an honor that I do not take lightly, and I am excited to get to  work for my constituents.   Here in the House we have hit the ground running. During my first 2  weeks in Congress, we took steps to jump-start our economy by  addressing the massive web of regulations that were issued by unelected  and unaccountable bureaucrats in the administration. In fact, 2016 was  a record-breaking year for Federal agencies. Unfortunately, the record  they set is not a good one.   In 2016 alone, there were 3,853 finalized rules and regulations,  amounting to 97,110 pages. That is more than any year in history. Based  on the page numbers alone, this amount of regulations may seem  staggering, but the economic costs are even more damaging. In 2015,  regulations cost American consumers and small businesses an estimated  $1.88 trillion in lost economic productivity and higher prices.   Many in Washington have started to call Federal regulators the fourth  branch of government, unelected branch of government when it comes from  the agencies. For too long, these regulators have run rampant, hurting  our small businesses, stifling job growth, and hampering our economy.  In fact, we have had one of the slowest economic recoveries coming out  of a severe recession in modern times.   That is why, last week, I was proud to join my colleagues in passing  the REINS Act and the Midnight Rules Relief Act. Additionally, this  week we passed the Regulatory Accountability Act. Today I am proud to  introduce my first piece of legislation, the Reforming Executive  Guidance Act. This will further increase transparency and ensure that  regulatory agencies are held accountable for their actions.   My bill will ensure that significant guidance documents promulgated  by the regulatory agencies are subject to congressional review. These  guidance documents are only meant to clarify regulations. However, over  the years, executive agencies have used these guidance documents more  and more often to expand their power and make significant policy  changes. We are the accountable branch who are to make those policy  changes. These policy changes are negatively affecting our businesses  and imposing these significant costs on our economy.   My bill simply ensures that significant guidance documents are fully  subject to the Congressional Review Act and the Administrative  Procedure Act's notice and comment requirement. Not only does this  increase congressional oversight, it also increases transparency, as  the public will now have the ability to review these guidance documents  before they are finalized. I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting  this straightforward, commonsense legislation.   I look forward to working with my colleagues throughout the 115th  Congress as we address the major issues facing the American people.                            ____________________
