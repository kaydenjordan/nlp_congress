 Mr. President, I come to the floor today to continue  our discussion about the Endless Frontier Act and why America needs to  make more investment in the areas of research and development for our  Nation. This is critically important as we have gone through this  debate with some of our colleagues, to talk about why this is important  for the United States. I spent my time yesterday--maybe somebody from  the staff can come over and help me with the charts but, thank you--the  biggest reason we are doing this is because we believe in American  know-how, that is we believe in American ingenuity and we believe in  American know-how and we have discussed already how that has helped to  build our country over and over and over again, that we are a nation  of, if you will, explorers, of pioneers, and by necessity, inventors,  and that has continued throughout the history of our country.   So we are so proud to continue to make these investments in all areas  of science, certainly in the areas of healthcare, but we are more  specifically talking about the engineers of the physical science and  engineering. And we are talking about why we should make an increase in  both basic research with this underlying bill that continues to drive  dollars into curiosity driven early stage research, so that we can  continue to grow jobs and help our economy, and it also continues the  effort by saying we should make more investments in STEM education, so  the workforce that it will take for us to meet the job challenges of  the future. So we are excited that we are there with American know-how,  but we are also cognizant of this international debate that is going  on, the debate about other countries and what they are investing in  research and development. And one of the reasons why I like where we  are in the United States is because our research and development  ecosystem is really an ecosystem of many different agencies doing  research and development.   And not only are those research and development investments by these  various agencies helping in particular areas--because it is really  distributed as this chart shows, the United States works with the  private sector, it works with our public universities, and it works  with various agencies. Instead of a centralized approach that you might  find in other countries, the fact that we have this distributed  ecosystem with, you know, the Department of Energy may collaborate with  the Department of Agriculture, they may collaborate with the Department  of Defense, NSF may collaborate with universities, universities may  collaborate with the private sector--it is an ecosystem, and that  ecosystem is what is unique about research and development in the  United States. It is not hierarchical, it is not the majority driven by  the private sector, or by government, it is an ecosystem, and the fact  that it is so distributed. That means, almost like the competition in  various places, and the collaboration is helping us grow the innovation  economy.   So the one thing that we need to be cognizant of in this debate is  that we want to preserve that. We want to preserve the uniqueness of  our ecosystem. And that is why we are really talking today about this  NSF, the National Science Foundation, principally, and you can see from  this big pie we just had this debate, right, we had this debate, well,  let's increase the defense R&D--well, we are already doing a lot in  defense R&D, of course, our colleagues are talking about the budget  overall as it related to defense, but you can see that NSF, the numbers  that they are at today at 6.8 are not really at the--you know, you  might think this whole debate we are spending, you know, billions of  dollars to change the focus. This agency is a powerhouse, and it is a  powerhouse mostly connected with universities, and the R&D that is done  there has been in the basic research area.   But now, this bill by our colleagues Senators Schumer and Young is  about taking the basic research, continuing that, making a little bit  of investment in that basic research, but then also now trying to  accelerate all the research that we now have at our hands, our  fingertips, at our minds, and saying, What other user-based research  can we take, that basic and applied research, and actually put it into  use in commercialization in the United States?   So if you will, capitalizing on a faster tech transfer and a faster  deployment of these technologies--why is this so important? Well, it is  important because, in the information age, a lot of people can read our  published research and development, they can read what we are doing,  and they can continue their research and development. Other nations are  figuring out that research and development in an information age  economy really does matter. They are figuring out that the United  States has come a long way as a nation in building job growth,  maintaining competitiveness, national security issues, all because we  at the Federal Government level have said we believe in research and  development with the public taxpayer dollars and it has benefited,  whether it is the internet or the bio sciences and healthcare or on  national security, the American public gets that that research has made  us competitive as a nation.   So we have had two previous attempts to make investments in this  issue in America COMPETES, first started in the Bush administration in  [[Page S3184]]  2006 when President Bush published a report about America's  competitiveness and proposed this concept of that small NSF budget that  I was referring to, and articulated that we needed to double that  budget within a 5-year or 7-year window of time. They felt that, with  the level of change and transformation and innovation, that we wouldn't  be keeping pace on a global basis unless we made that investment.   So in 2007 we passed the America COMPETES Act which gave money both  to NSF and to DOE, and literally the first 3 years, we thought we were  going to double this DOE budget and an investment in DOE within 7  years. So there was a little good news, a lot of euphoria in R&D, a lot  of hope for STEM education, science, technology, engineering, and math.  And then, in America COMPETES, the same request basically of a 60/40  split between NSF and energy, people thought we would end up--well, we  are not on pace, where we want to be, but, oh, we will get there within  11 years. Well, we will put enough money into this innovation effort  that we will double our research and innovation budget as it relates to  NSF and our energy innovation efforts in 11 years.   Well, this is what really happened. We didn't do either of those  things. We are really on a track to have taken those 2007 numbers and  double them in 22 years. So when you look back at the history and you  say, Well, how did we--what happened? If we are so enthusiastic about  this, if we identify this--both a Republican President identified this  and then a Democratic administration followed up, why didn't we execute  on this? Why didn't we execute on this doubling of this number and  making this investment?   Well, we all know what happened, we basically hit a recession. And in  a recession of 2009 and 2010, we just didn't live up to this obligation  of funding the research and development that was in America COMPETES to  the aggressiveness that we had all hoped for. I am not sure everybody  even realizes that this effort fell short, that we didn't make quite  the level of investment that we wanted, that we were falling behind. I  don't think anybody really understood it until now, when people see the  incredible level of international competition. All of a sudden, as we  see this incredible investment from the international community, people  are starting to say, Well wait, what have we done on this effort?   So our next chart shows the fact that the United States has been a  leader in global research and development, and as I said, I mentioned  on the floor a report that was done by the Pew Charitable Trust--I mean  the Pew Research Center, that basically said 7 in 10 Americans believe  in public investment in research and development. We have a higher  regard for this than other nations, and we just do, I think, because  people get it here, I think they get that we have invented a lot of  things, they believe in that innovation, they know it creates jobs. And  so we have a higher regard for that, and consequently, we have been the  leader in world R&D for a very, very long time. But as this Information  age has come along, other nations get that R&D leads to job creation,  transformation, and certainly to security. So just since 1991, we have  seen China who was ninth in R&D--now, they are No. 2, and I am pretty  sure, at current trajectories, will end up being No. 1 sometime very,  very soon.   And so it is, you know, not everything about China, although many of  my colleagues here are going to discuss this is a China bill, I view it  as a bill about the future and making the investments in the future to  capture the economic opportunities. There are security issues here,  clearly national security issues here. There are clearly issues about a  supply chain and whether you can depend on a supply chain and whether,  if you have a concentration of an industry in one region of the world,  then are you really dependent on that one region of the world for that  particular product?   What happened to all of us in the last year and a half--and I am  saying now on a global basis--is the world community realized with  COVID, well, wait, supply chains really matter, product really matters,  where we get product in an emergency really matters, whether it does  what it says it does in an emergency really matters. And so all of  these issues about supply chains and who is building what and the  intricacies of it really got ripped open in the COVID debate, and now,  we are really, as the world community starts to look at this too, where  do we get our product, who is making it, is it made to the standard  that we want, is it secure? And obviously, you know, people have made  lots of decisions about supply chain based on just pure cost and  effectiveness of a product, but now, people are starting to realize  that it is way more complex, and it has led us to this current debate.   So again, why do we do this, why does America want to make an  investment in an innovation economy? Well, we don't have to go too far  to understand that from our past history. It enables competitiveness,  and if you just think about, you know these sectors-I will never forget  years ago we had somebody--this was in the '80s, visit Seattle, and  they said, Well, what is everybody going to do, make car phones and  computers? And in reality, there was a big decade or so of making what  then was supposed to be great technology of a car phone, and obviously,  we all know where we have now been with computers and operating systems  and how much it drives the economy of the future, but at the time when  we were seeing a transformation to that, people just thought, Well,  what are we all going to do? Is that what we are going to do? Well,  telecommunication, semiconductors, advanced materials, all were huge  things that enabled this competitiveness of our Nation-in automobiles,  in aviation, in the tech sector, in healthcare, in a whole variety of  things. And it drives our economy with this level of innovation.   The internet, just one example, is something we started working on in  the '60s, became a reality in the '90s, and today, it is $2.3 trillion  part of our national economy, and 12 percent of U.S. GDP. That is what  we got out of previous research. That is what we got out of saying we  are going to let scientists do basic research and figure out what they  think are the most important advances moving forward. The job growth,  millions of jobs, and national security today, we can see just from  this past week in a pipeline that was affected by a cyber attack, we  cannot afford to take our foot off of national security research and  development in the purposes of things like cyber security.   We have to continue to be a leader in this area of technology. It is  not as if you are not going to have intimidation of our Nation by  somebody maybe sticking the nose of a foreign sub in U.S. waters or  flying a spy plane over the United States, it is going to come in the  form of intimidation of our banking system, or pipelines, or other  senses of security and hacking. And so there is no doubt--no doubt--we  need to stay on top of the level of investment in national security. I  would say the underlying bill that we will be talking about next week  in detail relates to a very important aspect of national security, and  that is the area of semiconductors. We need to make an investment in  our competitiveness in semiconductors, and we need to make that  investment because it is going to be critical to our national security.   So let me talk about a few things that are in the bill, just so  people understand some of the priorities that Majority Leader Schumer  and Senator Young came up with as it relates to this legislation. As I  mentioned, it creates a new Tech Directorate in the office of NSF, the  National Science Foundation, so that it will be like a DARPA system,  that is, that they work with the private sector, they create technology  centers, they build partnerships between government and academia, they  support rapid technology demonstration, they advance the  competitiveness of the United States in important fields like  artificial intelligence quantum computing, biotechnology, and they  focus on these ideas, similar to how DARPA has done, where the  individuals involved are critical to the effort, that is to say, to get  the best and brightest minds who are working in these areas to be part  of this effort and concentration.   We also looked at and improved in this legislation the fact that  universities and academia provide a lot of research and development,  but oftentimes, don't even--in the academia world, people are focused  on publishing. Publishing their research, that  [[Page S3185]]  is kind of how they get known, that is what they get basically almost  rewarded for at the university system, and you will be surprised how  little time they take to actually take that research, turn it into a  patent, and then turn it into a commercialized product.   So one thing we heard in our hearings is that we needed to give more  help to universities on tech transfer and patenting of information. Why  patenting? Because patenting helps us protect the science that we  already have developed. It helps us--say that somebody can't just take  that published science report and then go off in another country and  develop it because it is now protected under our U.S. law. So we feel  this is a very important effort, and we think that it also helps lead a  lot of research at universities to then be supported, developed,  exposed to the venture capital markets and thus actually helped turn  into commercialization.   So efforts at the University of Washington that specifically focused  on this, specifically hired somebody to come into the university and  kind of, if you will, shake the tree of the level of R&D that was being  done and say, What are we doing to actually patent this content, what  are we doing to actually transfer it into commercialization, had  outstanding results? Yes, it was a transformation of what our  universities do, but in the end, they came up with something like, just  in a few years, 20 companies that ended up becoming been, you know,  supported by venture capitalists and making it on to the markets. So we  are very excited that we will now, with this provision, be trying to  get more out of the research we do, by patenting it and doing tech  transfer.   Our colleagues Senators Young and Schumer also believe that  university research should continue to get investments, and that is the  major aspect of the provision here is to have the Tech Directorate work  on these 10 areas of expertise, work with selected universities around  the United States on this critical focus of technology. I mentioned  some of them: artificial intelligence, quantum computing,  biotechnology, and many others.   So the fact that the bill really is depending on our university  system, I think, is something that our colleagues should applaud and be  excited about. That chart that I showed at the beginning where  everybody is working together, this is just research dollars going to  the best universities in our Nation to continue to focus on this, but  now focus on it in partnership with experts in these sectors and with  industry so that we can actually get to a faster adoption rate and a  faster implementation into commercial markets. So I think we are  leaning in to our university system.    That is a good idea.   That is a good idea. What we are giving the university system,  though, is the tools, the tools to help accelerate that development.  And then, as I mentioned, we are also making a huge investment in STEM,  more than $10 billion into STEM education. The chart I showed before  talked about how we were going to do all these great things under  America COMPETES in STEM. We didn't quite get there. We didn't really  do that. I think this is like broadband. Everybody talks about it all  the time, we think we have solved it five times, and you still think,  Wait, I thought we solved broadband?   STEM is the same thing. You think we have funded STEM. We haven't  funded STEM. This represents a huge increase in our STEM education  budget, but I will just tell you, this is so that we can get the  researchers, the scientists, the fellows, if you will, at the higher  education level for STEM. We still need to go and build the pipeline at  our K-12 system so that we are putting more people into the pipeline.  But hopefully, with the STEM dollars here, we will be, if you will,  creating a new workforce for the innovation that we are trying to chase  with the investments of these dollars.   And we felt so strongly about this that we looked at the numbers and  we were just astonished. There are so few women and minorities in STEM  fields--so few. The underlying bill our colleagues, Senator Schumer and  Young, created a diversity office at, for the first time, over at NSF  so they can focus on this issue. We put more resources to it within  this STEM category so our colleagues and those at NSF could focus on  it. And we expect to really try to take a very aggressive role here.  That is what we heard from NSF in their research.   STEM education can't be a passive thing. It can't be just, We are  going to put some more dollars out for education. If we want to  diversify in the sciences, we have to have a very, very aggressive  approach. And so that aggressive approach means changing the faces of  those who do the education, changing some of the faces of people who do  investments, changing the dynamics of research. A lot of women were  hurt in the last COVID pandemic who were researchers because they were  juggling both taking care of their families or taking care of parents  and doing their research. And so they had extra strains on them that  made complexity to when they could get their research done.   So we know we have to think about STEM education from the perspective  of what are some of the challenges that face people going into those  fields. But no doubt, this underlying legislation before us will have a  big investment in that and continue NSF's leadership in trying to grow  a more aggressive workforce. So the bill also includes, I should say, a  few things about how one of our goals is to diversify innovation to  many different parts of the United States. The challenge there is, you  know, you are not going to sprinkle some dust on some magic words on  some region of the United States, and all of a sudden, something is  going to pop up-and nor do I personally expect it to. I always give the  example of Walla Walla, which is a real place, Walla Walla, WA. I had a  journalist ask once if that was a real place.   Yes, it is a real place. It is a great wine-making place. But  somebody might say, Walla Walla, WA, should be a research center. It  has got a university, an outstanding university, Whitman. People might  say it should be a tech hub or it should be a research center. Walla  Walla found its rightful place when research was done, and a university  professor at the University of Washington said, You know what, we can  grow wine grapes. That really wasn't that long ago. That was in the  1980s. He said we can grow grapes. We weren't growing grapes. Now, a  couple of decades later, we have over a thousand wineries in the State  of Washington. So not everybody is going to be a tech hub, but it  doesn't mean that you're not going to use science to the best and  highest use for a region of your State or the country.   It is about empowering. As Director Panchanathan, the head of NSF  says, it is about trying to have innovation everywhere, connected to  opportunity everywhere, connected to universities. The point is let's  build a better ecosystem that goes all throughout the United States so  more and more people can take advantage of technology and innovation.  So this is really, really important because we never know where the  next person is going to come from, who is going to play a critical role  in technology. And the more we build this infrastructure, the better.   So this allows money for regional technology hubs to help concentrate  in various parts of the country and expertise, more money for our  manufacturing institutes which help manufacturers all across the United  States focus on being competitive in their particular area, and it  supports $2.4 billion for manufacturing extension programs, which are  those things that really do work with, say, a particular sector like  automobiles or aviation or some other type of manufacturing and help  make them competitive. And as mentioned, it also, just like in the  former COMPETES Act bills, puts some money into DOE. In this case, it  puts about $17 billion into the Department of Energy so that its energy  innovation can move forward.   So let me talk for a second about this issue about national security  and where we are with semiconductors because I expect this will get a  bunch of focus next week as we talk about this legislation. The  underlying bill has about $52 billion of investment for the  semiconductor industry, so I am pretty sure people think, Well, wait,  this is a lot of money, but it is a very big sector.   It is essential to our defense, it is essential to navigation, it is  essential to  [[Page S3186]]  satellites, it is essential to healthcare, it is essential to consumer  products. And the United States has been a leader in this area. The  United States has been a leader in this area for a long time--or I  should say, was a leader in this area for a long time, when you think  of companies like Intel or others, even some of the companies that are  foreign investors who made huge footprints in the United States. But  the point is that we are no longer in this position--as this chart  shows, only 12 percent of a global supply.   A report recently done on the semiconductor industry by Boston  Consulting Group, I just want to read this one part: ``The U.S. has  been the long-standing global leader in semiconductors with 45% to 50%  share of the worldwide market''--45-percent to 50-percent share of the  worldwide market--``in the last 30 years. However, significant focus is  being placed on ending the U.S. share in semiconductor manufacturing  which now only stands at 12% installed capacity.'' This is a report  that I am pretty sure you could get online. That is the end of that  statement.   So we have gone from 45 percent to 50 percent, that is where we  started out, and over the last 30 years, now, we are down to 12  percent--12 percent. So I ask my colleagues, if you were 12 percent of  anything, how long would you be around to be competitive? How long  would you drive the supply chain? How long would you drive job growth?  How long would you continue to be competitive in this very, very  important sector that is important to all of these things?   And while I am somebody who supports continued growth of our global  economy because I think we build and make great things and we want  people to sell them to, this presents to us a very unique challenge,  the fact that something as critical to the information age as  semiconductors, we have gone from 40 percent to 50 percent down to 12  percent the question is what is going to happen next.   Well, the question of what is going to happen next is, if we don't  make this investment, very, very likely that that 12 percent is going  to, in the next several years, turn into 6 percent. It is going to turn  into 6 percent. So staying status quo right now, doing no investment,  it is very likely that 12 percent will turn into 6 percent, which means  people aren't going to want to locate their boundaries in the United  States. People aren't going to want to locate their research in the  United States--people aren't going to want to have their companies and  the supply chain and the workforce. Literally, this industry simply is  clusters, it is clusters. Seattle didn't get to be Seattle overnight.  Seattle didn't get to be the hub of the No. 1 STEM city in the United  States of America and certainly an epicenter of software and software  development overnight.   It took decades--decades. Literally, you know, even in the 1980s and  1990s, it wasn't that diversified. It has just been in the last 15  years that it has really diversified. But, yes, it took the work of the  University of Washington. Yes, it took the work of many companies being  there. Then it took the work of then people attracting a workforce who  would rather be there than, say, in Silicon Valley. And then it took  the efforts of universities to produce a workforce. Then it took  attracting venture capital.   Then once they got venture capital, then more companies wanted to  come there because then you have the entire ecosystem. You had  universities, you had venture capital, you had leading companies, you  had a workforce, and you had all of this stuff. Well, that is in  software, and software can continue to move forward, but if you didn't  have those things, you aren't going to be a cluster for semiconductors.  The United States of America--the cluster of semiconductor development  is going to be in Asia. It is going to be in Korea. It is going to be  in Taiwan, and it is going to be in China.   So we have to ask ourselves if we are only 6 percent of the supply in  the future and we can't really control the development and we lose our  edge in this and then basically we have to rely on a supply chain for  all the chips, you know, in the world, where is the supply chain that  we are going to rely on for the national security products and defense  technology and satellites and maybe some of these other consumer  products that then end up getting used for other purposes? That is what  this debate is about.   It is about that we went from 45 percent to 50 percent down to 12  percent. If we do nothing, we are going to 6 percent, and the epicenter  of a critical technology is going to move to Asia. So I personally want  to see us be successful in keeping a sector in the United States. I am  very proud that that same Boston report shows that we have 49 percent  of the aerospace manufacturing market in the United States. I am very  proud of that because we are an epicenter of that. Forty-nine percent  of the manufacturing market for aerospace is in the United States.   That represents, to my region, maybe 150,000 to 200,000 jobs in the  Northwest. To the United States, that is 2 million jobs--more than 2  million probably if you think about some of the other related sectors.  So being 49 percent of the supply chain in the United States for  aerospace really, really, really matters. And I don't want to see that  slip. You know, we have had a discussion about the fact that we have  the Jones Act.   Now, some of our colleagues might not support the Jones Act, but the  Jones Act is we decide, Well, we are not going to be all the  shipbuilding in the world. Shipbuilding is going to get built in other  places. But, oh, my gosh, we have to have enough shipbuilding in the  United States so if we are at war, products and services that we need  to support our military can be transported on U.S. vessels. That is why  we have the Jones Act because we decided that that sector was critical  enough to support.   And what we are saying here is that this sector is critical enough to  support, too. I don't know that we are ever going to be 49 percent like  aerospace manufacturing is--probably not, probably because it would  take a lot more money than we are talking about here--because the rest  of this world is chasing this market, too. They are chasing it fast and  furious. We have to ask ourselves, Do we want to end up at 6 percent,  or are we want going to try to reverse this trend and make an  investment and make it as smart as possible?   I thought we had one more chart, but I guess we don't. So I guess we  are back to this. Is this bill's investment worth taking the chance on  American know-how? Is it worth the history of our country and saying,  We have done a lot in research and development, and we know how to get  things done. When I think of some of the people in this story, I think  one of the guys on the GI Bill was one of the first contributors to  semiconductors. It is a guy who basically went to school on a GI Bill,  and if you think about the capital formation and capital markets we  have in the United States, it has contributed to allowing that  technology to move more rapidly. Our investment in higher education has  allowed this to move more rapidly.   So to my colleagues who aren't sure about this legislation or think  that it sounds like a lot or thinks that it sounds like, Oh, I don't  understand it, it is really quite simple. Do you want to make a bigger  investment in our contribution to American know-how with research and  development and let them compete to winning the next generation of  jobs? I do. I do.   I want to do that because I want to see what comes next. I think it  is one of the most exciting things about today and where we live today.  We are not in the agrarian age; we are not in the industrial age. We  are in the information age where everything can be created in the blink  of an eye and now distributed and transform our economy in such  significant ways. I want to see what comes next. But we can't do it by  passing legislation, authorizing things and then not appropriating the  money and then waking up in 10 years and finding that we are at the  lowest percentage of research and development to GDP in 60 years. That  is where we are, the lowest percentage. So we can't do that. We have to  make these investments and if we invest in American know-how, the rest  of this will take care of itself.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
