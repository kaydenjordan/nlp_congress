 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Maria Manzo for 10  years of service to our office, to the communities that we represent in  Illinois, and to our country.   Maria was one of the first people who we hired back in the spring of  2008 when I left the crazy business of science to enter the sane and  steady business of the United States Congress.   Maria began as our ambassador to the Hispanic communities in Aurora,  the second largest city of Illinois, and she now coordinates outreach  to all citizens of Illinois' 11th District.   Maria was with me during the terror of the economic collapse, the  historic victories of ObamaCare, and the political firestorm that  accompanied it. She was with us during the electoral defeats of the Tea  Party wave and the electoral victories of our subsequent return to  office. Maria is now a steady and trusted voice in our community as we  navigate the coronavirus crisis.   During those 10 years, I had the chance to watch Maria's wonderful  children, Elijah and Sophia, progress from early childhood to becoming  enchanting adults.   Maria Manzo, it has been a great 10 years.                            ____________________
