 Mr. President, today, we will make history in the Senate.  Today, we will vote on one of the most important conservation bills not  just in years but in decades.   Today, we get one step closer to protecting our outdoor heritage for  our children, our grandchildren, for future generations of Montanans,  and for all Americans because today we will be casting the final vote  on this historic bipartisan bill entitled the ``Great American Outdoors  Act.''   Today, for the first time ever in the U.S. Senate, we will vote to  make funding for a critical conservation program, the Land and Water  Conservation Fund, full and mandatory. This funding will protect the  program and provide certainty for our land managers, for  conservationists, for sports men and women.   I spoke with Montanans across our State about the importance of this  program. What is interesting is no matter what the ideologies are,  these ideologies across the board, from left to right--they agree that  this program will protect our outdoors for current and future  generations.   As a Senator from Montana, Big Sky Country--in fact, we like to call  Montana ``The Last Best Place''--I know just how important it is that  we have access to our public lands and the opportunity to enjoy our  outdoors. In fact, it is a major driver of our economy, the outdoor  recreation economy.   The Land and Water Conservation Fund enables better public access to  our public lands. It is going to help create jobs in a time when we  need them the most. It will help protect wildlife habitat. It will help  improve land management. It links conservation to a strong energy  sector, and it costs the taxpayers nothing.   Today, by voting on the Great American Outdoors Act, we will also  provide a significant downpayment to address the maintenance backlog  that is facing our national parks and our public lands. I chair the  National Parks Subcommittee here in the Senate. As a fifth-generation  Montanan who grew up going to our national parks--I grew up in the  shadows of Yellowstone National Park, just about 1\1/2\ hours from my  home--because of enjoying the outdoors with my family, this has been  one of my top priorities.   You see, our national parks and our public lands set us apart from  the rest of the world, but our parks have seen an increase in  visitation--in fact, record visitation for many of our parks. That is a  really good thing.   Our park infrastructure is at risk of being loved to death, leading  to dilapidated infrastructure that can compromise the visitor  experience and safety. There is nearly $12 billion in maintenance  backlog facing our national parks across the Nation, including over  $700 million in Glacier and Yellowstone National Parks, an additional  $34 million throughout other national parks in Montana. We have a great  opportunity today to address this by getting this bipartisan bill, the  Great American Outdoors Act, done and passed out of the Senate and send  it over to the House.   As a kid who grew up in Bozeman, I went to kindergarten through  college in Bozeman. I was a Bozeman Hawk in  [[Page S3032]]  high school and proud Montana State University Bobcat. I know just how  important it is to get this done for Montana.   I am also fortunate to have the opportunity to enjoy Montana outdoors  with my sweet wife, Cindy, and our four children and our granddaughter,  Emma, and soon-to-be new grandson in just a few months. You see,  Montana's public lands are part of our Montana way of life. They are  part of our heritage, who we are as Montanans.   I have been very fortunate to be able to fly fish many of Montana's  rivers and their streams. In fact, my son took that picture of me up in  the Beartooth a few years ago. I remember that distinctly. Just around  the corner of where that picture was taken, I was working my way up  that stream and got a real nice cutthroat and ripple. In fact, Cindy  and I backpack in the Beartooth, in the wilderness area, every August.  We take along two of our dogs, Ruby and Reagan. In fact, I took that  picture of our son, Michael, up in the High Country of Montana. We get  places like this where there are virtually no trails. This is wild  country.   It is unique to the world that we have places that are so pristine  and still remain so relatively untouched. My wife and I have instilled  in our family the same passion and love for outdoors that we have  shared for so long.   Here we are at a backpack, again, up in the Beartooth. This is not  too far from Granite Peak, Montana's highest point. Some of our best  memories are spending time with our son, Michael, there, the dog,  Cindy, and me there.   I want to show you this next picture because that sums up probably  who we are as a couple. We went back up to the Hyalite area south of  Bozeman a few years ago. That peak is Hyalite Peak. Back in 1986, that  is where I asked Cindy to marry me. We got engaged on top of that  mountain, a peak over 10,000 feet high.   This is more than just some theoretical discussion that we are having  today on the floor of the Senate. This is about protecting our Montana  outdoor way of life. It is the very heart and soul of who we are as  Montanans. In fact, since I came to Congress, I made it one of my  highest priorities to protect and expand access to our public lands.   I am proud to be standing here today, ready to vote on this historic  conservation bill. Today, I urge my colleagues--it doesn't matter  whether you are a Democrat or Republican--to come together and pass  this bipartisan bill that will benefit generations. I think we are  going to have a really strong vote today. My sense is it will be an  overwhelming affirmation of this important legislation. I look forward  to seeing that. I look forward to passing the Great American Outdoors  Act today, working to get it out of the House, which is our next step,  and getting it onto President Trump's desk. I spoke with him today, and  he is excited to sign this historic piece of legislation into law.  Montana is ready. I am ready. Let's get her done   I yield the floor.
