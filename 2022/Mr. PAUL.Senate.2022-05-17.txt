 Madam President, today the Senate is considering a bill to  give $40 billion to Ukraine. This bill brings up the questions of both  constitutionality and also affordability.   There was an essay written in 1867 that was published in Harper's  Magazine. It was called ``Not Yours To Give.'' It is the story of Davy  Crockett as a Congressman in the late 1820s. Like most stories of that  vintage, some will argue that the story is an accurate rendition while  others may say it is apocryphal. The moral of the story, however, is  incontestable.   Davy Crockett only served two terms in Congress, but on one day in  Congress he was confronted with a bill to give money to the widow of a  military officer. Davy Crockett arose and gave this speech.         Mr. Speaker--I have as much respect for the memory of the       deceased, and as much sympathy for the sufferings of the       living, if suffering there be, as any man in this House, but       we must not permit our respect for the dead or our sympathy       for a part of the living to lead us into an act of       injustice to the balance of the living.        We have the right, as individuals, to give away as much of       our own money as we please in charity; but as members of       Congress we have no right so to appropriate a dollar of the       public money.    Davy Crockett continued:         I am the poorest man on this floor. I cannot vote for this       bill, but I will give one week's pay--        I will give my check for 1 week, and if every member of       Congress were to do this, it will amount to more than this       bill asks for.    When Crockett finished, there was silence, and, remarkably, the bill  failed. When later asked for an explanation, Davy Crockett explained.   He said:         Several years ago I was one evening standing on the steps       of the Capitol with some other members of Congress, when [we       saw] a great light over in Georgetown. It was evidently a       large fire. We jumped into a hack and drove over as fast as       we could. In spite of all that could be done, many houses       were burned and many families made homeless, and, besides,       some of them had lost all but the clothes they had on. The       weather was very cold, and when I saw so many women and       children suffering, I felt that something  [[Page S2527]]       ought to be done for them. The next morning a bill was       introduced appropriating $20,000 for their relief. We put       aside all other business and rushed it through as soon as it       could be done.    Later in the year, when Davy Crockett was back in Tennessee, he ran  into a constituent by the name of Horacio Bunce. Crockett asked him for  his vote, and Horacio Bunce responded thusly. He said:         You had better not waste your time or mine. I shall not       vote for you again.        Your vote last winter shows that either you have not the       capacity to understand the Constitution or that you are       wanting in the honesty and firmness to be guided by it       because the Constitution, to be worth anything, must be held       sacred and rigidly observed in all its provisions. The man       who wields power and misinterprets the Constitution is more       dangerous the more honest he is.    Horacio Bunce continued. He said:         No, Colonel, there's no mistake.        The newspapers say that last winter you voted for this bill       to give $20,000 to some who suffered from a fire in       Georgetown. Is that true?    Congressman Crockett answered him:         Well, my friend; I may as well own up. You have got me       there. But certainly nobody will complain that a great and       rich country like ours should give the insignificant sum of       $20,000 to relieve its suffering women and children.    Horacio Bunce replied to Congressman Crockett. He said:         The power of collecting and disbursing money at pleasure is       the most dangerous power that can be intrusted to man. . . .       [W]hile you are contributing to relieve one, you are drawing       it from thousands who are even worse off than he. If you had       the right to give anything, the amount was simply a matter of       discretion with you, and you had as much right to give       $20,000,000 as $20,000. If you have the right to give to one,       you have the right to give to all; and, as the Constitution       neither defines charity nor stipulates the amount, you are at       liberty to give to any and everything which you may believe,       or profess to believe, is a charity, and to any amount you       may think proper.        No, Colonel [Crockett], Congress has no right to give       charity. Individual members may give as much of their own       money as they please, but they have no right to touch a       dollar of the public money for that purpose. If twice as many       houses had been burned in this county [in Tennessee] as in       Georgetown, neither you nor any other member of Congress       would have thought of appropriating a dollar for our relief.    Bunce informed Crockett that if each Congressman had shown their  sympathy for the fire victims by giving 1 week's pay, it would have  nearly covered the cost, but it was easier simply to give other  people's money.   Bunce continued:         The people about Washington, no doubt, applauded you for       relieving them from the necessity of giving by giving what       was not yours to give. The people have delegated to Congress,       by the Constitution, the power to do certain things. To do       these, it is authorized to collect and pay moneys, and for       nothing else. Everything beyond this is usurpation, and a       violation of the Constitution.        ``So you see, Colonel, you have violated the Constitution       in what I consider a vital point. It is a precedent fraught       with danger to the country, for when Congress once begins to       stretch its power beyond the limits of the Constitution,       there is no limit to it, and no security for the people.''    Today, we are faced with a vastly greater sum of money than $20,000.  We are faced with $40 billion to be gifted to Ukraine--a noble cause,  no doubt; a cause for which I have great sympathy and support but a  cause for which the Constitution does not sanction or approve of.   Now, we could ask, as Davy Crockett did, if each Member of the Senate  would like to contribute individually to Ukraine, but, of course, that  would simply serve to demonstrate the enormity of the gift. To come up  with $40 billion, each Senator would need to give $400 million--not a  likely scenario. It is much easier to spend such exorbitant amounts if  you are spending someone else's money.   But even if the Senators won't agree to contribute their own money,  surely we are a rich country and can afford it. Well, not exactly. The  U.S. debt now approaches $30 trillion. In the past 2 years alone, we  have added nearly $6 trillion in new debt. Inflation roars throughout  the land. Grocery bills are punishing the working class and poor, and  gas prices exceed $5. Even before the pandemic bailouts, our country  was running a trillion-dollar annual deficit just to pay for its  routine commitments.   Putting aside the constitutionality of the $40 billion to Ukraine,  isn't there a more fiscally responsible way this could be done? What  about taking the $40 billion from elsewhere in the budget?   The United States spends more on our military than the next eight  countries combined. Couldn't Congress simply shift over the $40 billion  and not add to the debt? If the defense of Ukraine is really in our  national security interests, shouldn't the gift come from our military  budget?   What about cutting wasteful spending? My office catalogued over $50  billion in waste. I don't know about you, but couldn't we cut programs  like the million-dollar study to see if taking selfies of yourself  while smiling and then looking at these selfies later on--if that makes  you feel good? Couldn't we cut the budget of the National Science  Foundation that spends billions of dollars studying such burning  questions as ``Do Panamanian city frogs have a different mating call  than country frogs?'' Couldn't we maybe cut the $2 million the NIH  spent studying cafeterias to see, if someone in front of you sneezes on  the food, whether you are more or less likely to eat that food?  Couldn't we maybe cut the money spent on Japanese quail, studying  whether or not they are more sexually promiscuous or not when you give  them cocaine?   If we are not willing to cut the budget at all, couldn't we ask the  American people to step up and pay a war tax? If this is really for our  national security, it should be very popular with the people. Why don't  we offer to tax them in exchange for this?   Guess what. The American people don't want to cut spending anywhere  in the budget--at least their representatives don't. They don't want to  pay any taxes for this. They just say ``Put it on my tab.'' But we have  been doing that for decades, and that is why we have a $30 trillion  debt, and that is why we have roaring inflation.   If you want to pay for this with a tax, you could triple the gas tax.  I am guessing that is going to be really popular and people really want  to send this money so badly that they would be willing to triple the  gas tax. If we were honest, that is what the people who are for this  would propose. That would guarantee $5 gas for the foreseeable future.   Alternatively, Congress could raise the income tax about $500 for  every American taxpayer. I am sure that would be popular. And for the  people who think it is a great idea to send $40 billion overseas, why  don't they just be honest with people and tax them? Here is your bill,  Mr. and Mrs. America, $500 a taxpayer. Then it would be paid for. No,  it is like everything else: Put it on our tab. Well, Uncle Sam's tab is  full. It is complete.   To be clear, I am not for raising taxes to finance Ukraine's defense,  but it is irresponsible to simply borrow more money. To borrow the  money from China simply to send it to Ukraine makes no sense and makes  us weaker, not stronger.   But let's be honest--most of Congress doesn't seem to care about the  debt, doesn't seem to care how much money we shovel out the door and  out of the country. Why? Because it is not their money. Every day,  Milton Friedman's statement has proven correct--that nobody spends  somebody else's money as wisely as their own.   I doubt the big spenders in Congress will ever consider spending any  of their own money. But Americans across the land should sit up and  notice and attach blame to these profligate spenders.   In the past 3 months, bipartisan majorities, Republicans and  Democrats, have added over $100 billion to the debt. Now these same big  spenders are proposing another $50 billion next week to bail out  restaurants--restaurants that have been primarily injured by  overzealous Democratic Governors and their edicts.   There are ramifications to this mountain of debt. Make no mistake,  inflation is here, and it is rip-roaring and on the rise. Just as  aiding the victims of fire in Georgetown during the days of Davy  Crockett ignored the misfortune of the suffering people in lands too  distant from Washington to be noticed, so, too, does today's deficit  spending to be sent overseas ignore the pain and suffering and the  inflation that is caused by that debt on everyday American families.  [[Page S2528]]    Inflation is simply an increase in the money supply. It comes from  the Federal Reserve buying U.S. debt. M2 is a measure of the money  supply. For the last 3 years, it has been going up at about a 15- percent rate. So we shouldn't really be surprised that there is  inflation because inflation is an increase in the money supply. In  January of last year, the annualized rate of the M2 expansion, the  monetary expansion, was 27 percent.    No one should be shocked we have inflation. We have rising prices in  the grocery store. We have rising prices at the pump because we  borrowed too much money. We went heavily in debt, and the Federal  Reserve is buying the debt. All this so-called free money floods the  market and chases prices higher. Adding to our debt will only make the  problem worse.   Yes, our national security is threatened--not by Russia's war on  Ukraine but by Congress's war on the American taxpayer. The vast  majority of Americans sympathize with Ukraine and want them to repel  the Russian invaders. But if Congress were honest, they would take the  money from elsewhere in the budget or ask Americans to pay higher taxes  or, Heaven forbid, loan the money to Ukraine instead of giving it to  Ukraine. But Congress will do what Congress does best: spend other  people's money. I, for one, will not. I will vote no. Somehow,  somewhere, a voice of fiscal sanity must remain vigilant, must remain  stalwart and steady in a sea of fiscal madness.
