 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support this resolution with  vigor.   Last month, the Subcommittee on Military Personnel within the Armed  Services Committee held a hearing. It was the first time in the history  of this Congress that five transgender members of the military were  allowed to testify.   Four of them are trans female. One of them is trans male. All five of  them have served our country with distinction. All five of them have  served more than 12 years in the military. One of them is a West Point  graduate. All of them have served either in Iraq, Afghanistan, multiple  deployments, and in submarine service.   To the servicemember, all I saw was pride to be in the military,  pride to serve their country, pride to put themselves on the line.   The testimony from the administration was like a twisted pretzel.  They offered a weak and dithering defense of their cruel policy. Two  things became clear at this hearing:   First, the administration policy is a ban. Make no mistake about it.  Those who are in the military and serving as transgender can continue  to do so. No one can come into the military who is transgender. If you  are in the military and transgender and have not identified, you cannot  identify. So it is a ban.   Captain Alivia Stehlik put it best:         Currently, soldiers are allowed to seek care no matter       what, trans related or not. If the policy changes, soldiers       will no longer be able to seek care, because if you say, I am       trans and get a diagnosis of gender dysphoria, regardless of       your job performance, you are ineligible and will be       terminated.    The policy is a solution in search of a problem. Worse, it  discriminates against our servicemembers.   Second, the hearing demonstrated resoundingly that the last 2\1/2\  years of open service have been unequivocally successful.   Mr. Speaker, let me say, transgender servicemembers have been there  for us. It is time for us to be there for them.
