 Mr. President, earlier today, the Senate passed the  Kennedy-King National Commemorative Site Act--an effort that I was  pleased to lead here in the Senate, alongside my colleague Senator  Donnelly. This important legislation commemorates the  [[Page S1905]]  Landmark for Peace Memorial in Indianapolis and establishes the site as  part of the African American Civil Rights Network. The act would not  have passed without the support of both Chairman Murkowski and Ranking  Member Cantwell, and I thank both of them and their hard-working staffs  for their assistance in this effort.    I also extend my sincere gratitude to Representative Brooks, Senator  Donnelly, and Representative Carson for working with me to pass this  measure that recognizes a significant moment in Indiana's and our  Nation's history.   Two weeks from now, on April 4, the city of Indianapolis will  commemorate the 50th anniversary of Senator Robert F. Kennedy's  timeless speech in the Circle City. On that fateful evening in 1968,  Senator Kennedy was scheduled to be in Indianapolis for a campaign  event. As Senator Kennedy arrived in Indianapolis late that evening, he  learned of the tragic death of Martin Luther King, Jr., in Memphis, TN.  Senator Kennedy decided to speak to the assembled Hoosiers who had come  to see him and inform them of the tragic news of King's death. He  confirmed the terrible rumors that many were beginning to hear that  evening in the course of his words.   Cities throughout America were erupting in riots, in many instances,  as they learned of Martin Luther King, Jr.'s assassination. However, in  Indianapolis, Senator Kennedy spoke to the grief-stricken crowd, and he  inspired them. He inspired them to replace the hatred they felt with  compassion and love. To this day, Hoosiers warmly remember Senator  Kennedy's moving speech, and we recognize his heartfelt words as a  reason why Indianapolis remained calm and peaceful while riots swept  much of the Nation.   I wish to close today with a quote from Senator Kennedy's speech-- powerful words that still ring true 50 years after he uttered them.  These words will forever mark Senator Kennedy's grave in Arlington  National Cemetery:         What we need in the United States is not division; what we       need in the United States is not hatred; what we need in the       United States is not violence and lawlessness; but love and       wisdom, and compassion toward one another, and a feeling of       justice toward those who still suffer within our country,       whether they be white or whether they be black.    I yield the floor.
