 Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, I am proud to cosponsor H.R. 1309,  introduced by my colleague, Congressman   Joe Courtney.   This bill requires the Secretary of Labor to develop a comprehensive  workplace safety and health standard. Ultimately, this legislation will  protect the millions of workers in the healthcare and social service  industries by implementing a violence prevention plan.   Prevention plans and training are critical tools to mitigate  dangerous situations if and when violent emergencies occur in the  workplace. Clear and effective plans that address violence prevention  benefit both the workers and their patients or clients; and violence  prevention plans catered to the respective industries, using evidence- based practices, are even more effective.   In the healthcare and social service industries especially, workplace  safety reforms are much-needed.   Social workers, like healthcare workers, are particularly vulnerable  and susceptible to instances of workplace violence. Workers in both of  these professions interact daily with people struggling with mental  health, addiction, and/or recovering from trauma.   Madam Chair, let me just tell you, personally, that I have been  impacted by this. I am a former social worker. I will tell this quick  story.   I went to make a home visit. I was a geriatric social worker at the  time. It was in a house, a shutdown house right down Lyons and Jensen.   I believe, Madam Chair, that is in your district now.   I knocked on the door, and to my surprise and shock and fear, a  little old lady--she was probably about 85 or 90--comes out with a gun  pointing right at my face, pointing right at my face.   That is not what a social worker experts when they are coming to  visit a home to make plans for a home healthcare aide, which is what I  was doing.   But she thought that I was there to take a child away from her that  she had in her home and that I was a child welfare worker, so she was  defending her son. Actually, it was a street child.   I had to convince her with every persuasive part of my body that I  was not there to take her child, that I was actually there to help her  and give her a home health aide to help her in her home. And quite  miraculously, I talked her out of it, and I actually got her to put the  gun away.   Now, I was lucky, but, regrettably, those things may still be  happening out there in America: a social worker facing a gun, a social  worker facing violence, a social worker facing harm or injury to  herself or others.   So that is what this bill is about. It is not about what the  employers will or will not do; it is about the protection of the  workers and making sure that the employers do have plans, much like  they do for hurricanes, that they have plans for violence.   So all employees, regardless of the line of work, deserve to feel  safe and not feel the fear that I did that day and to be protected from  violence in their workplaces.   They also deserve to have peace of mind that an informed violence  prevention plan is in place. With that in mind, I am proud to offer an  amendment to an already excellent bill.   My amendment would ensure that annual evaluations of violence  prevention plans include changes based on informed findings by  employers. Employers can use their personal experiences or lessons  learned to effectively update the violence prevention plan in their  mandatory annual plan reviews.   Simply put, the goal of this amendment is to enhance the  participation and protection of covered employers and employees in the  creation of updating their annual plans. This is a commonsense  amendment intended to implement best practices.   Employer input, along with employee input, will create the best  violence prevention plans possible. It will also help industries update  their prevention plans, as needed, to cater to that specific industry's  needs.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to support the amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I accept the condolences, but,  fortunately for me, I was under threat but did not die. Regrettably,  that situation  [[Page H9148]]  may happen again and someone may die, and that is what I just want to  underscore is that social workers, healthcare workers, all social  service workers are put in danger many times.   This bill and this amendment would simply make sure that we got  participation and input from the employers, the employees, and everyone  concerned to make sure that we have a good plan and that we use best  practices, because, regrettably, not much seems to have changed since  the days when I was a social worker.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, yesterday, we observed Latina  Equal Pay Day. Latinas across the country made our voices heard,  demanding an end to the gender pay gap that affects Latinas the most.   We Latinas are ``luchadoras''--fighters. Yet, on average, Latinas  make 53 cents to the dollar earned by White, non-Hispanic men. We are  talking about our ``madres, our abuelitas, our hijas, y tias''-- mothers, grandmothers, daughters, and aunts.   Hardworking Latinas deserve better. We should not have to work 23  months to make what White, non-Hispanic men make in 12 months.   We must level the playing field. It is not only the right thing to  do, but America works best when women are empowered and treated  equally.   I won't stop fighting until Latinas and all women receive equal pay  for equal work.                            ____________________
