 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, just before Easter, the Biden  administration released a report that they claim vindicates their role  in our disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan, but rather than laying  out the facts and embracing accountability, the Biden administration  returned to its default setting of blaming Donald Trump for their  problems. They claim that because Trump did not provide them with a  plan for every contingency, the Biden White House should be allowed to  wash its hands of the mess they have made.   Now, you would think that anyone who witnessed mothers throwing their  children over barbed wire fences and into the arms of our soldiers  would at least hesitate before making excuses for the terrible decision  making that led to those images. Biden and his team are kidding  themselves if they think we have forgotten what happened. But the  American people are not fooled. They remember that it was Joe Biden who  chose to close Bagram Airfield; that it was Joe Biden who set an  arbitrary evacuation deadline even though his military generals begged  him not to do this; and that it was Joe Biden who surrendered control  of Karzai International Airport and handed over the names of American  citizens, green card holders, and our Afghan partners--handed this  information over to the Taliban.   We saw the catastrophe unfold at the airfields and in the cities, and  we see what the Biden administration has done. They have ignored it  ever since. Afghanistan fell back into the Dark Ages. Twenty-three  million people are going hungry. Twenty million Afghan women are  subjugated under the Taliban's medieval boot.   On the day the evacuation officially ended, there were at least 4,000  Americans left behind--that is right, left behind--in Afghanistan.  Today, our best guess is that there are around 175 still stranded  there. Some of them are being held captive by the Taliban. Seventy- eight thousand of our Afghan partners remain in hiding, many being  hunted by the Taliban. Yes, that is the mess that this administration  and Joe Biden made.    And on his way out the door, Biden also left behind at least $7.2  billion of American weaponry, including aircraft, vehicles, and guns,  some of which have cropped up in the hands of militants in other  countries. That is $7.2 billion of  [[Page S1127]]  equipment, part of the $80 billion investment there at Bagram Airfield.   And what did Joe Biden do? Here you go, Bagram--the investment in  training, the investment in the troops, the investment in  infrastructure, and all of that equipment.   Just imagine for a moment that you are one of our allies watching all  of this unfold. It would cause you to be worried--and rightfully so.   Biden's disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan damaged America's  image on the world stage and sent once-strong alliances into a  tailspin. Some of our most important allies now believe that the United  States is weak, that we are unreliable, and that we are undependable.   This is what has emboldened what I term the new axis of evil--China,  Russia, Iran, and North Korea. They think they have got running room  because of the way the Afghan withdrawal was conducted.   Beijing wasted no time normalizing relations with the Taliban by  offering multimillion-dollar investments through the Chinese Belt and  Road Initiative. The CCP knows what it is doing here. Afghanistan has  $1 trillion in untapped resources that communist China has already  signed a deal to extract. Since then, they have increased their  aggression against Taiwan and elsewhere around the globe, and the Biden  administration has had very little to say about it--an emboldened China  going after the $1 trillion in lithium in Afghanistan--rare-earth  minerals, Afghanistan. That is why the Chinese Communist Party has  inked that deal.   Oh, what did they do with it? Let's make chips. Let's make batteries.   Oh, what are we making those batteries for? Electric vehicles.   How about that? How about that? This is what has emboldened the CCP.   Afghanistan was a disaster. It was based on the decision making of  this administration. So the CCP is encouraging Russia, Iran, and North  Korea to join them in that axis of evil and push to global dominance.   The CCP even let a spy balloon sashay all the way across this  country. We know it pulled intelligence. We know it went across much of  our critical infrastructure.   What did my colleagues across the aisle have to say? Not much. Not  much. They don't want to challenge the CCP and communist China, and  Russia and Iran and North Korea. It makes you wonder.   Meanwhile, North Korea has leaned into their ballistic missile  program, and Iran has openly celebrated a dangerous milestone: They are  now technically capable of building multiple nuclear weapons. That is  right. They are pushing their nuclear development program.   Not to be outdone, just 6 months after Biden surrendered to the  Taliban, Vladimir Putin attacked Ukraine and launched the biggest land  war in Europe since World War II. This is not a coincidence.   Biden knows he has no one to blame but himself and his officials for  this. This is the mess they have made because of the decisions that  they have made.   But there has been no accountability. There has been no justice for  the 13 servicemembers murdered by terrorists during those final chaotic  days in Kabul. I think it is clear that, if things keep going the way  they are, there won't be accountability because this administration  will not admit they made a mistake.   If there is any truth to be gleaned from the administration's report,  it is that Joe Biden hasn't learned any lessons from what will  certainly be remembered as one of the worst foreign policy disasters in  our Nation's history.   The Biden administration will go down in history for failing our  allies and our partners. They are questioning--they are questioning--if  they should be our ally and partner.   The Biden administration will be remembered for destroying what was a  robust economy, kowtowing to social justice warriors, and, of course,  committing to outrageous policy proposals that insult the intelligence  of the American people.   The Department of Homeland Security's recent budget request is no  exception to the rule. This year, instead of asking for more money to  equip law enforcement and secure our southern border, Joe Biden and  Secretary Mayorkas decided to undercut that mission by $600 million.  That is right. The border is wide open. We have a Secretary of Homeland  Security who does not believe in securing the homeland. So what does  the Secretary and the President do? They cut the budget for securing  the border by $600 million. This is something that is so unfair to our  Border Patrol.   We are only halfway through the fiscal year, and already Customs and  Border Protection has recorded more than 1 million migrant encounters  at the southern border. That is right--1 million that they have  encountered. That is not counting the ``got-aways''--the ones they can  see but can't get to, or the ones that later they find where they have  been but they could not get to them, didn't know about them. This is 1  million encounters on that border.   They have also seized 105,000 pounds of drugs, including enough  fentanyl to kill several cities--almost 11,000 pounds of fentanyl in 5  short months. And get this: They caught 268 gang members, more than  11,000 criminal noncitizens, and almost 300 terrorists trying to sneak  into this country.   Those are not my numbers. Those are not some pundit's numbers. Those  are the stats that are coming from the Department of Homeland Security  and the Border Patrol. Those are their numbers. They are telling us  this.   Do people agree with this? Do they think this is secure border  policy?   Listen to these numbers again: 105,000 pounds of drugs, 11,000 pounds  of fentanyl, 268 gang members, and 11,000 criminal noncitizens. Those  are people who have been convicted of crimes. These are the people who  are being turned out of the jails in countries. Last year, 176  different countries had people present at that southern border. This  year, so far, you have got 11,000 criminal noncitizens and almost 300  terrorists trying to come into this country.   Ask yourself a question: What in heaven's name do you think they are  coming here for? Why are they sneaking into the country? Do you think  it is because they know they wouldn't be able to come in? Do you think  they are coming for a job, or are they coming to do us harm?   We should be outraged--outraged--and concerned.   Alarms should be blaring at the Department of Homeland Security.  Right now, the Biden administration is just rolling out the red carpet.  They are issuing an open invitation. Indeed, they said: We have got an  app to make it easy for you to come. Go on your iPhone. Sign in on the  app. We will be waiting for you when you get here.   Does that sound like securing the country? Criminal noncitizens,  terrorists, gang members--these are the people who are coming in,  cartel smugglers who are taking this administration up on their  invitation: Come on in.   Every year, in Tennessee, I visit with each one of our 95 counties. I  am on the ground in every county in the State. And this year, without  exception, there are mayors and sheriffs and other officials who I am  speaking with, talking with principals, talking with citizens. And do  you know what? Border security comes up in every single one of these  meetings, and the reason it comes up is because of this  administration's policies turning every town into a border town and  every State into a border State. And now it is the local officials and  local law enforcement officers who are left to deal with the broken  policies of this administration.   If you ask them what the biggest problem is, they are going to tell  you: Well, Marsha, it connects back to the border because the drugs we  are apprehending are coming across the southern border, and 95 percent  of those drugs, they are fentanyl, and that drives crime in our  communities. There are gang members coming into these communities.    Now, here is a great example of this: Hamilton County, TN. That is  Chattanooga, a great city. And their district attorney, Coty Wamp, and  Sheriff Garrett there in Hamilton County were showing me some pictures  from one of their drug busts. Well, these are rainbow fentanyl pills  that were specifically manufactured to look like OxyContin--rainbow  fentanyl.   Now, officers there in Chattanooga found more than 1,000 of these  pills in a single search. That is enough to take  [[Page S1128]]  out the entire city of Chattanooga, TN. They weren't expecting to find  fentanyl when they were executing that warrant, but that doesn't mean  they were surprised. This is a persistent problem in Chattanooga.   Thank goodness, a great sheriff and a great DA working together-- great officers--they conducted this bust, and this is what they found.  And we have great local law enforcement all across the State of  Tennessee. And they will tell you that fentanyl overdose deaths are  occurring at such a rate that law enforcement does not have all the  resources they need to investigate all the cases.   Now, this is just one story from one law enforcement entity in one  city; but the danger is, this is occurring in every city, in every  county, in each of our States. And it is happening because President  Biden and my Democratic colleagues have refused to support securing the  border, and they refuse to hold themselves accountable for the  humanitarian crisis that this has created.   When Secretary Becerra testified before the Finance Committee about  the Department of Health and Human Services budget request, he betrayed  the same disregard for basic human decency as Secretary Mayorkas had.  He used the opportunity to push his woke agenda items rather than  focusing on poor operations of the Agency. Frankly, it is sad that  there is even a question about whether a Senate-confirmed secretary is  familiar with his own job description, especially when he can't answer  basic questions about what is happening at the Agency he, supposedly,  controls.   At the end of February, the New York Times reported that over the  course of Joe Biden's Presidency, his administration has lost--that is  right, lost--more than 85,000 children who were under the care of the  Office of Refugee Resettlement. You heard me right. This administration  has lost 85,000 children who were under the care of the Office of  Refugee Resettlement. To be clear, this is the office within the  Department of Health and Human Services that is directly responsible  for unaccompanied children who come across the border. And now we know  that this Agency has lost immediate contact with one third of the  children they are responsible for.   The Times also reported that the Office of Refugee Resettlement may  have approved sponsors who were under investigation for labor abuses  and that case management officers may have been aware of children in  dangerous situations but chose to do nothing.   During his hearing, I asked Secretary Becerra about this, frankly,  horrifying revelation, and he did exactly what his compatriots have  done when confronted with their failures: He feigned ignorance. He  claimed he had never heard of those 85,000 missing children.   Joe Biden and the Democrats might be happy to pretend that we don't  have a problem down on the border, but the American people are not  pretending that this is not a problem. They watched President Biden  throw away border security policies that were working in favor of an  open-borders agenda that benefits no one except the drug cartels; the  sex trafficking rings that are abusing women and girls; the human  traffickers that are smuggling people, preying on people, and  physically, mentally, emotionally, drugging and sexually abusing them  as they make their journey.   It is time to put politics aside and get serious about securing this  border, and I encourage my colleagues: Please, join us in securing this  border. Join us in saying let's enforce the laws we have on the books.  Join us in saying let's eliminate the policies that incentivize  breaking the law. Let's stand for the rule of law.    Earlier this year, I introduced the Stop Taxpayer Funding of  Traffickers Act, which would prohibit anyone charged with drug or human  trafficking from receiving Federal government benefits while they await  trial. We could pass this bill today, and we should pass it because it  would make a difference.   When I talked to local law enforcement, when I said, ``What would be  a way to help?'' this is the idea they gave me. It is a problem that  they have because many of these traffickers are getting government  benefits, and we need to stop that today.   We should also return to the ``Remain in Mexico'' policy. We should  end catch-and-release. And last but not least, let's get back to  building that barrier. Border Patrol has told us for 30 years they need  a physical barrier where they can have a barrier, and where they can't,  they need better technology, they need more officers, more agents, more  manpower and resources so that they can do their job, so they can  protect this Nation's sovereignty, so they can protect our citizens.   That is it. These are the things that would be a solution to helping  rid this country of this fentanyl crisis, to helping rid this country  of the gangs, the terrorists that are flooding into our country, the  criminals coming into this country. This is something that should have  bipartisan agreement. We should do this.   Now, the Biden administration has touted its various White House  staff and Cabinet nominees as being the most diverse in our Nation's  history, but they all have one thing in common: Their priorities are at  odds with what the American people are saying they want.   Secretary Mayorkas refuses to do his job and secure the border, even  though local law enforcement officials are begging him for help.  Secretary Becerra can't be bothered to offer so much as a talking point  on behalf of 85,000 missing children. Attorney General Garland has  weaponized the law against conservatives and created two tiers of  justice: one for the liberal elites and one for everybody else.   Biden's nominee to lead the FAA withdrew in disgrace. His most recent  nominee to the FCC has dedicated her career to violating the First  Amendment. His Transportation Secretary is perpetually missing in  action. And the Pentagon has yet to hold anyone accountable for one of  the worst foreign policy disasters in American history. And, yes, that  would be Afghanistan.   The mainstream media loves to complain that the American people have  lost all faith in institutions, but I would ask that media to just  stop, look at what Joe Biden's government has done to the country, and  ask themselves: Are we safer and more secure than we were 4 years ago?   I yield the floor.    Madam President, I rise today to honor a fellow  Tennessean, a great American, and an exceptional member of the U.S. Air  Force.   Lt. Col. John D. ``Ike'' Fesler has distinguished himself through his  professional character and dedication by serving this Nation in  uniform. A leader and expert communicator, he has provided  distinguished service to our country while assigned to the Air Force  Senate Liaison Office. He is an outstanding leader and the perfect  airman to represent the Air Force on Capitol Hill. Ike has honorably  served in the Air National Guard and Navy for over 27 years in both the  enlisted and officer ranks; during this time, he has led hundreds of  airmen in support of U.S. Air Force missions worldwide.   Throughout his career, Ike has demonstrated exceptional, unrivaled  officership. During his time as director of operations, course  director, and flight commander at the Academy of Military Science,  Maxwell AFB, AL., he commissioned more than 150 Air National Guard  officers. Ike spent 4 years in the White House Military Office, his  last title being Director of Staff, Policy Plans and Requirements, a  position where he led the human resource operations for a 250-person  organization comprised of five military services, five billet sponsors,  and numerous contract client partners, ensuring execution of  Presidential continuity of operations were uninterrupted. Additionally,  in direct support of Operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom, Ike  was the deputy chief, public affairs at the Air Force Mortuary Affairs  Operations Center, ensuring our fallen heroes were provided the  dignified treatment they deserved.   As a legislative liaison in the Air Force Senate Liaison Office from  April 2021 to April 2023, Lieutenant Colonel Fesler performed his  duties well and without reservation supporting the 117th and 118th U.S.  Congresses. His strategic thinking and foresight helped to strengthen  and improve our national security. Ike accomplished this utilizing his  in-depth Air Force knowledge with numerous engagements between Congress  and the Department of the Air Force. Ike expertly conveyed Department  of the Air Force positions on the Air Force Future Design that included  the future bomber, tanker, and fighter force. Ike's direct support  provided the U.S. Senate critical information necessary for two  National Defense Authorization Acts. His efforts helped solidify the  U.S. Space Force, ensure the confirmation of the 26th Air Force  Secretary and ensured the Department of the Air Force's support of the  National Defense Strategy in our return to great power competition.   Lieutenant Colonel Fesler planned and led numerous delegations for  members of Congress on visits all over the world. In fact, I became  acquainted with Ike in the run up to my recent official visit to  Europe. Anyone who has attended one of these delegation trips knows  that while the planning is stressful, the execution is downright  arduous. But Ike persevered with a smile, gave 100 percent, and the  trip went off without a hitch. Due to his direct involvement and  stewardship of this delegation and others like it, Members of Congress  were able to make informed decisions on issues of national defense,  tech policy, and other culturally significant questions and of course  ensure the Department of the Air Force was properly resourced and  funded, along with their brothers and sisters in arms across the Armed  Forces.   After serving in this crucial role for the past 2 years and becoming  a fixture on Capitol Hill, Lieutenant Colonel Fesler will retire from  Active-Duty service. Ike has sacrificed much in service to our Nation.  I am thankful for Ike's service and his work with my office and the  Senate over the past 2 years on issues of vital importance to the  United States. I salute this American patriot whose selfless service  has kept our country safe and strong.                            ____________________     Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  following interns from my office be granted floor privileges for the  remainder of the Congress: Makayla Rae Ross and Jacob Tipton.
