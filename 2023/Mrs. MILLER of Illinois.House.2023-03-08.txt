 Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Johnson for  hosting this Special Order.   The American agriculture industry powers our economy and feeds the  world, but President Biden wants to burden farmers and landowners with  higher taxes and more red tape with his disastrous waters of the United  States rule.   Farmers and ranchers do not want to be told how to use and regulate  their land by Biden's radical Cabinet Secretaries. I introduced a bill  called Define WOTUS Act with Senator Braun to protect my fellow farmers  and stand against the disastrous Biden EPA, which is working to  regulate every pond and puddle in America. Our Nation's farmers,  ranchers, and property owners come last in the Biden agenda.   This week, I will proudly stand with House Republicans to pass  legislation ending Biden's disastrous WOTUS rule.  [[Page H1201]]  We are going to put American farmers first. It is my privilege to  advocate for my fellow Illinois farmers on the House Agriculture  Committee and represent our needs in Congress.
