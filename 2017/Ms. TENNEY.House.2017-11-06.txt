 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr. Richard Synek,  a veteran of the United States Navy and founder of Feed Our Vets.   Rich served in the Navy during the 1980s and was serving aboard the  USS Peterson during combat operations against Libya in 1986.   After his military service, Rich worked for the United States Postal  Service, serving as postmaster for several local post offices. During  his time as postmaster of the Vernon Center Post Office, Rich  encountered a World War II veteran who could only afford to buy one  stamp and food for half the month.   After befriending this veteran, Rich bought him groceries so he and  his wife could eat. Shortly after, Feed Our Veterans was formed.   Since 2008, Feed Our Veterans has served over 20,000 veterans and  their families, providing over 445,000 pounds of food for those in  need.   Our community is grateful to Rich for his service in the Navy, but  especially for his continued compassionate service to our fellow  veterans.                            ____________________
