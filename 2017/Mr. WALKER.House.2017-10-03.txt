 Madam Speaker, I thank Representative Handel for  yielding.   As a former minister and as an American, even as a human being, I  believe that every boy and girl is conceived with God-given potential  and unique talents and abilities--abilities they will use to serve  others and make a difference.   Let me put it this way: I know a young man named Luke. Luke's mother  was in for a surprise when, at only 24 weeks into her pregnancy, her  baby boy decided it was time to meet the world. To make a long story  short, Luke worked through complications with his family, and he serves  in our district office in North Carolina.   Every life is an opportunity. Every life is precious.   A little earlier we were challenged by the accusation that  Republicans only are concerned about budget. It goes out the window  when it comes to this issue.   You know what?   You are right. We don't put a price on life. We cherish it.   Madam Speaker, I am a proud cosponsor of the Pain-Capable Unborn  Child Protection Act, and I encourage my colleagues to support it.
