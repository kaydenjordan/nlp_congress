 Mr. President, I am pleased to join with the Senator from  Colorado on this Joint Chiefs Landscape Restoration Partnership Act. I  appreciate his leadership.   There are several points I want to make here before we vote, and that  is, this program is very popular with landowners, and I think that is  important. This is a very popular program with landowners. It is  completely voluntary, a voluntary program. We have chatted with CBO. It  does not score, so it does not have a score. Again, both the majority  and minority on Ag agree and support this legislation. So, again, it is  farmer-friendly, rancher-friendly, and popular with landowners.   I thank the Senator from Colorado, and I urge a ``yes'' vote on this  amendment.   Thank you, Mr. President.                          Vote on Amendment No. 2548
