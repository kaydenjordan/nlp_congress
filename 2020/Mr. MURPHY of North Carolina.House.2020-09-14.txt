 Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Roe for  yielding, and thank him for gathering everyone together.    Mr. Speaker, I will give a summary here this evening. Since the end  of January, the world has been attacked essentially by a virus that  none of us can see. I will say that since May 15, our administration  has put in play Operation Warp Speed, and this is meant to save  American lives.   Mr. Speaker, $10 billion was allocated by this body to develop a safe  and effective vaccine in record time. It has literally been today's  Manhattan Project. It is combining the resources and the brilliant  minds of private industry and governmental researchers in an  unprecedented effort of cooperation. We have used decades of previous  research combined with today's new technology and research to help us  end the COVID-19 pandemic.   The objective is to deliver 300 million doses by the end of December,  early January, to the citizens of the United States.   What do vaccines do? I think it is very important for people to  understand what vaccines do.   They stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies exactly as it  would happen if you were exposed to the disease. After you get  vaccinated, you develop immunity to that disease without having to get  the disease first.   We have two trials, two companies--Moderna and Pfizer--that are  furthest along in their developments; 20,000 individuals so far have  been accrued in the trials--half have been getting the vaccines, half  placebo, and we need more.   The highest at-risk populations are those being targeted: The  elderly, those with comorbidities, Black Americans, Hispanic Americans.  As we have heard earlier, Black Americans are under-enrolling in the  vaccine and we need them to enroll.   So how can this process, which normally takes years, be done in 8  months?                                time  2115    It is that research is being done concurrently rather than in  parallel; our phases are going at the same time; and production is  going at the same time, fully understanding that we may have millions  of doses of a vaccine that we will never use.   How do we develop this at warp speed? Just to give folks one example,  how do we develop a vaccine this quickly?   If you can imagine the space shuttle, the space shuttle is a  transport mechanism. It carries things out to the space station. We  already have the space shuttle. We use that in vaccines. But what we  have now is a different payload, a different payload going out to the  space station. And the space shuttle is taking that into viruses with a  different payload now specific to the coronavirus.   What all Americans are talking about now is not only the development  of a vaccine but a safe vaccine. We have proof that the processes that  are in place to develop safe vaccines are working.   As we have talked about, AstraZeneca stopped its trial because there  was one untoward event. We have done research, and now they have  started that trial again. Stopping trials is very commonplace in  vaccine development, and the American people need to understand this.   We went through this once before with polio. Polio in the fifties was  killing thousands and disabling many, many more. Jonas Salk developed  the vaccine. What he did was remarkable, but what he did also was led  by example. He took the vaccine himself, and he had his family take the  vaccine.   This is what the Doctors Caucus is going to do. I will take the  vaccine. The other members of the Doctors Caucus will take the vaccine  because we need to tell the American people that we, physicians who  have trained our entire lives in medicine, believe that what we are  doing and what we are doing for the American people is safe.   What this will come out to is that we will have 300 million doses.  Right now, our government is working on how to get those doses out to  the American people. In an unprecedented effort, the CDC is working  with HHS and the Department of Defense to develop a mechanism to get  the vaccine out and to track the vaccine.   Finally, I will say this to the American people. There are two ways  out of this pandemic, two ways on the pathway back to normalcy. One is  to become infected with the virus, develop antibodies, and you recover.  The second is to take the vaccine, develop antibodies without ever  having the disease, and we can move forward as a Nation.
