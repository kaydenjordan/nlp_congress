 Mr. Speaker, early Monday morning, two corrections  officers at Allenwood Federal penitentiary in Union County,  Pennsylvania, were viciously assaulted in the line of duty by an  inmate.   While both Officer Sara Harvey and Officer Dale Franquet were  injured, their heroic actions resulted in subduing an armed and violent  inmate and preventing the inmate from harming others.   Officer Harvey has since returned to work, while Officer Franquet  remains in the hospital undergoing treatment.   Both of these individuals exemplify sacrifice and service. They are  true heroes.   This tragic incident is a stark reminder of the challenges our  corrections officers face on a daily basis. Despite great personal risk  to themselves and their families, corrections officers go to work every  day out of a deeply rooted sense of service.   Our entire community is grateful for these two corrections officers  and every person employed in the prison who continue to stand guard.   As chairman of the BOP Reform Caucus, I look forward to continuing to  work with my colleagues in Congress to ensure that our corrections  officers have the resources and support they need to do their jobs  effectively and, most importantly, safely.                            ____________________
