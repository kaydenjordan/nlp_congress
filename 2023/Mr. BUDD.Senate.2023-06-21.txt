 Madam President, reserving the right to object, I object to  S. 1297 for a simple reason: It would make it easier for unborn life to  be ended.   Last year's Dobbs decision brought renewed hope to Americans who  believe in the sanctity of each and every life, including life in the  womb. After 49 years, a new culture of life has begun to take hold  across our country. But this bill would actually take us backwards.   This bill would allow abortion on demand in pro-life States so long  as the patient is from another State. This bill would expose doctors  and nurses who work in religious organizations, clinics, and  hospitals--it would expose them to costly lawsuits if they stand by  their deeply held beliefs. This bill would violate the spirit of  bipartisan Hyde protections by providing 80 million taxpayer dollars to  the abortion industry.   I was elected to save as many unborn lives as possible, and this bill  puts more unborn lives in danger; therefore, I object.
