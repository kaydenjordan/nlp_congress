 Mr. Speaker, today it is with overwhelming pride that I  rise to congratulate the 2021 NCAA Men's Volleyball National Champions  of the University of Hawaii.   In Columbus, Ohio this past Saturday, the Rainbow Warriors dominated  Brigham Young University in a three-set sweep showcasing to the Nation  the qualities of a team hungry for a national championship only made  possible through years of hard work, perseverance, grit, mental  fortitude, and sportsmanship.   As a former Rainbow Warriors men's volleyball player and proud  alumnus, I know how much this victory means to the program and all of  Hawaii.   So congratulations to the head coach, Charlie Wade, the coaching  staff, UH athletics programs, the players, and, Mr. Speaker, most  importantly, the best collegiate volleyball fans, supporters, boosters,  and Aunty's on the planet.   Hawaii is so proud of them. No Ka `Oi, and go Bows.                            ____________________
