 Mr. Speaker, it is with profound sadness that I share the  news that a great friend and public servant has passed away.   Daryl Ann Pennington was a dear friend, trusted member of my staff,  and a tireless advocate for Maryland's Fifth District.   For the past 12 years, Daryl served as a caseworker in my office in  Greenbelt, Maryland, serving Prince George's County, Calvert County,  and Anne Arundel County. Earlier, she had worked for former Maryland  State Senator Ulysses Currie.   Mr. Speaker, she knew the Fifth District and its communities better  than almost anyone, and she cared deeply about the people who called,  emailed, and wrote to us asking for assistance with Federal agencies  and help accessing government services. In particular, Daryl was a  fierce advocate for our district seniors, but she was also a mentor to  countless young people, including interns who came to our district  office and learned lessons from Daryl, not only about serving our  constituents but how to approach life through perseverance, faith, and  positive thinking.   Daryl drew heavily on her personal faith as a member of the Evangel  Cathedral in Upper Marlboro, Maryland, for more than a quarter of a  century, and as a partner with Dr. Corinthia Ridgely Boone of the  International Christian Host Coalition organizing the National Capital  Region's Day of Prayer for many, many years.   Mr. Speaker, she believed strongly that prayer was a powerful tool,  not only to connect with her creator, but to connect with others here  on Earth, to communicate her love for others, and to spread peace and  joy to those around her, which she surely did. Her sense of humor, her  wit, her warmth will be sorely missed not only by her colleagues in my  office, but by all who knew her.   I and all of us who worked so closely with Daryl will miss her very,  very much. Daryl had so many spiritual daughters and the many young  women who looked up to her over the years as a mentor and friend, but  her pride and joy were her five children: Laura, Christie, Toi, Peter,  and Lenny, as well as her grandchildren to whom, of course, she was  devoted.   A native of Rochester, New York, Daryl made her final journey home in  July when she was diagnosed with multiple myeloma and departed Maryland  to seek treatment closer to family at the University of Rochester  Medical Center. We had all hoped to welcome her back soon, but sadly,  Daryl's condition worsened quickly last week, and she passed away on  Saturday morning with her family by her side.   Mr. Speaker, Daryl was a true friend and partner in service to the  people of Maryland's Fifth District. She will long be remembered by  those she helped and by those of us who worked closely with her.   Her passing is a great loss to my constituents, our office, to this  House, and to our country. I hope my colleagues will join me in  offering her family the condolences of the whole House and the thanks  of a Nation grateful for patriotic Americans like Daryl Ann Pennington  who serve their country and communities so dutifully and so well.   Mr. Speaker, now Daryl rests in peace with God, whom she served so  faithfully throughout her life.                            ____________________
