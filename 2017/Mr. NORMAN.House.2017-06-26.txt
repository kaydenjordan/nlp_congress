 Mr. Speaker, members of my South Carolina Congressional  delegation, it is an honor to be here. Let me have my family and  friends stand. It is South Carolina's Brady Bunch. You all stand up  there.   It is a tremendous honor to serve with such an esteemed group. I  think it is a special time in history. As Congressman Lewis said, we  are family. With the shooting of Steve Scalise, we know that we are all  Americans.   We have got such an opportunity, and I look forward to playing a part  in working with Members to move this country forward.                            ____________________
