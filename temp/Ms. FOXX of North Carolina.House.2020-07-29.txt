 Mr. Speaker, my colleagues across the  aisle have developed a habit of harping about how Republicans are  incorrectly addressing the priorities of the American people during the  pandemic.   This is a bold claim coming from them, seeing as they are the ones  being  [[Page H3884]]  caught playing political games on multiple occasions. Every day,  Democrats echo those same fatigued talking points, and you can't help  but wonder if they realize that, in fact, they are the ones who have  been wasting time all along.   Denial is a powerful thing, Mr. Speaker. At a time when the American  people demand leadership and accountability from Congress, Democrats  have leaned on their political playbook for answers.   At this point, are we really surprised? Let's recap what the  Democrats have done to date.   They have passed the so-called HEROES Act, a $3 trillion socialist  wish list that was crafted behind closed doors without bipartisan  collaboration.   They have undermined 200 years of precedent by implementing proxy  voting.    They have held virtual hearings where their Members are not  physically present in the Capitol, and even one of their Members  decided to phone in his vote to the committee while he was on his boat.   Now, juxtapose that with the work we have taken up.   Republicans have fought for schools to reopen safely. We have placed  a high priority on strengthening our Nation's economic recovery, and we  have worked tirelessly to support frontline workers.   Let President Trump and the administration be an example as well.   Secretary Scalia of the Department of Labor recently came to my  district to meet with frontline workers, educators, and members of the  private sector to learn about North Carolina's progress.   Deputy Secretary Hargan of HHS visited Wake Forest Baptist Hospital  in Winston-Salem to see the work being done by medical professionals to  treat and protect North Carolinians.   This week, President Trump traveled to North Carolina to meet with  representatives of a biotechnology company that is currently  manufacturing a promising coronavirus vaccine.   Mr. Speaker, the differences between the Republican approach and the  Democrat approach are night and day. I have said this before, and I  will say it again: Democrats are choosing posturing over progress. They  have ample opportunities to work with us, but they are more interested  in creating the newest media sound bite, further inflating the Federal  bureaucracy and appeasing their far-left base.   This isn't an observation. This is a fact. When you think of  progress, you think of frontline workers; you think of private-sector  innovation; you think about the millions of children around the country  safely returning to school; and you think of businesses reopening their  doors to the public.   When Republicans think of progress, that is what we envision. Sadly,  Democrats have become so entrenched in their own political narrative  that they have failed to recognize the true priorities of the American  people. Republicans will continue to work on the pressing needs of our  Nation without delay. We can only hope that our Democrat colleagues  will come to their senses eventually.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 7027, Democrats' partisan  Child Care Is Essential Act, which, based off its troublesome  provisions, would be better titled as the no care for children act.   Republicans and Democrats agree that there is a critical need that  exists in our country today: the need to help childcare providers  reopen their businesses safely.   Childcare is the cornerstone of the American workforce. If parents do  not have a safe place to send their children, they cannot work. If our  Nation is going to recover swiftly and successfully from the COVID-19  pandemic, childcare providers must be an integral part of the solution  to getting America reopened and back to work.   Unfortunately, the bill we are considering today, H.R. 7027, is just  another messaging bill for House Democrats, who are more interested in  political posturing than enacting meaningful solutions.   Before I get into the lowlights of this legislation, I would like to  point out that childcare falls under the jurisdiction of the House  Education and Labor Committee. However, our committee did not hold a  single hearing or a single markup on today's bill. This is becoming a  recurring theme in Speaker Pelosi's House of Representatives.    The fact that Chairman Scott allowed Speaker Pelosi to make the  opening comments on this bill is a further indication that this is  Speaker Pelosi's bill. The blatant disregard for congressional  precedent and proper way of doing our job is appalling. Too many pieces  of legislation are being written behind closed doors in the Speaker's  office. This type of backroom horse trading is not how the Nation's  deliberative body should operate.   On top of this, House Democrats are casting votes and conducting  legislative business from the comfort of their own homes or, in some  cases, their fishing boat, and bringing partisan messaging bills to the  House floor without going through the legislative process, all while  collecting a taxpayer-funded paycheck.   We have gone from a representative Republic to an autocracy. Members  of Congress were elected to represent Americans here in Washington, yet  Speaker Pelosi seems set on silencing those voices. This is downright  shameful and indicative of Speaker Pelosi's out-of-touch politics-over- progress agenda.   Back to the flawed legislation at hand.   We all agree that Congress should help childcare providers reopen  safely; however, we cannot spend taxpayer dollars recklessly while  layering on additional burdens when childcare providers on the ground  are already facing burdensome red tape.   The Democrats' flawed, one-sided bill appropriates $50 billion, which  is higher than the entire annual revenue of the childcare industry and  substantially more than Democrats felt was necessary to include in  their so-called HEROES Act.   We know the Democrats preferred solution for any problem is to throw  more taxpayer money at it, but the Bipartisan Policy Center estimated  that the industry would need about half of the amount included in H.R.  7027 to recover.   Additionally, H.R. 7027 places burdensome requirements on childcare  providers, which could lead to providers spending more time and money  applying for and reporting on the funds rather than doing what is most  important: serving children.   Providers already have to figure out how to implement new and  necessary health and safety rules, from social distancing and limits on  group size to increased cleaning protocols. As if this isn't already  weighing heavily on childcare professionals, Democrats now want to  enact even more cumbersome requirements for them to deal with.   This legislation also tries to dictate from the Federal level how  providers run their businesses, which can hamper their ability to  reopen safely and stay open.   This ill-advised bill also denies support for certain eligible  providers, such as churches and public recreation camps who are  licensed-exempt, operating legally in a State, and meeting all State  and local requirements.   H.R. 7027 fails to address the barriers many new providers face, an  issue that can increase cost and limit slots for children.   Mr. Speaker, the no care for children act will drive up costs  substantially, tie many providers' hands unnecessarily, and shift the  focus away from serving children and supporting parents returning to  work.   It is worth repeating that Republicans and Democrats wholeheartedly  agree on the overarching goal of this debate we are having today. A  lack of childcare options could seriously delay our Nation's economic  recovery. That is why it is extremely disappointing that we are  spending our time debating another partisan messaging bill from House  Democrats rather than focusing on common ground and working in a  bipartisan fashion to solve our differences on this issue and deliver  for American families.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge a ``no'' vote on H.R. 7027, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Byrne).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Allen).    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from  Georgia an additional 15 seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, Politico wrote recently, ``A lack of safe and affordable  childcare amid the coronavirus pandemic is keeping many working parents  from returning to the office as more companies call employees back to  their jobs, threatening to extend the economic crisis and erode decades  of gains for women in the workplace.''   In fact, the Bipartisan Policy Center found that at the height of the  COVID-19 outbreak, 60 percent of childcare centers closed, and one- third of the childcare workforce lost their jobs.   The topic of today's debate is an issue that both Republicans and  Democrats agree must be addressed. Unfortunately, the legislation being  pushed by Democrats spends taxpayer dollars recklessly and layers on  additional burdensome requirements.   That is why my Republican colleagues have introduced the Back to Work  Child Care Grants Act of 2020, which is led by Senator Ernst and  Senator Alexander in the Senate and Representative Reed in the House.   Unlike the Democrat bill we are considering today, the Back to Work  Child Care Grants Act will offer childcare providers solutions and  resources, not burdensome red tape. The GOP-led initiative would  support childcare providers by offering short-term financial  assistance, critical resources to reopen and stay open, all while  holding providers accountable to State and local health and safety  guidelines.   Regrettably, the Democrats' childcare bill picks winners and losers  by denying help to many providers who are license-exempt and operating  legally, such as churches and public recreation camps. The Back to Work  Child Care Grants Act of 2020, on the other hand, ensures all providers  in need of support have access to funding.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds.   Mr. Speaker, we need more childcare slots, but rather than opening  more doors, H.R. 7027 denies support for certain eligible providers  such as churches and public recreation camps who are operating legally,  and fails to address the barriers to entry new providers face, an issue  that can increase costs and limit slots for children.   Given the capacity issue of existing centers, legislative proposals  should allow for more slots and reduce the barriers to entry for new  providers. This bill does the opposite.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close when  the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Scott) is prepared to close.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance  of my time.   Congress should provide childcare centers nationwide with resources  that will allow them to recover from the many challenges they have  endured over the last few months. Unfortunately, this body has yet  again missed an opportunity to come together in a bipartisan manner,  solve our differences, and tackle an issue we all agree needs to be  addressed. Instead, we have more partisanship, more political  posturing, and more one-sided legislation on the House floor absent of  any committee consideration.   Mr. Speaker, American families and childcare providers across the  Nation deserve better than the legislation before us. I strongly urge a  ``no'' vote on the Democrats' no care for children act, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas  and nays.  [[Page H3965]]
