 Mr. Speaker, as a fiscal conservative, $2.2 trillion of  our grandchildren's money is a tough pill to swallow. But this is a  two-front war on our economy and on public health.   On the economic front, we must provide a lifeline to individuals,  businesses, and seniors that are suffering collateral damage. And on  the health front, we must send reinforcements to our healthcare  workers.   This morning, I spoke with a physician and family member heading into  the emergency room in Manhattan. She said she is scared. Like combat, I  told her, you have to take a deep breath, stay focused, and do what you  are trained to do.  [[Page H1840]]    These hospitals are the Omaha Beach of this war. Colleagues, in the  foxhole, nobody cares about race, religion, creed, socioeconomic  background. They certainly don't care about Republican and Democrat. It  is about mission. It is about country.   We have a duty to provide these soldiers what they need. We have a  duty to support this bill.
