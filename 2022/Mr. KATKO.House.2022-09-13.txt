 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the gentleman  from New York, the Honorable Joseph Sempolinski, be permitted to take  the oath of office today.   His certificate of election has not arrived, but there is no contest  and no question has been raised with regard to his election.    Madam Speaker, I join my colleagues in the New York  Congressional delegation in formally welcoming Congressman Joe  Sempolinski as the new Representative for New York's 23rd Congressional  District.   As someone who grew up in the Painted Post area and is currently  raising a family in Canisteo, Joe is well-suited to represent New  Yorkers from across the Southern Tier and Finger Lakes regions in  Congress.   Beyond his local roots, Joe has a long history of public service to  this region, and his record speaks for itself.   After earning degrees from both Georgetown University and Yale, Joe  took a position as district director for Congressman  Tom Reed so he  could serve the community where he grew up.   In addition to his years of work with Congressman Reed, Joe's  commitment to service has kept him personally involved in Steuben  County politics and ultimately led to his decision to run for Congress.   With his demonstrated record of service, I am confident that  Congressman Sempolinski will be a strong Representative for the  families of New York's 23rd Congressional District.   I am proud to welcome him as a colleague, and, along with the rest of  the New York delegation, to extend my heartfelt congratulations to Joe,  his wife, Angie, and two beautiful daughters up in the balcony.   Madam Speaker, I yield the remainder of my time to the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Sempolinski).                                time  1900
