 Mr. Speaker, in a few minutes, the American people will  see clearly what each and every Member of this House is made of. Will  we vote to willfully strip healthcare coverage for 24 million  Americans, older Americans, working Americans, Americans with chronic  illness and developmental disabilities and now, incredibly, we even  know, Americans who wore the uniform of this Nation?   In a few minutes, we will see who will vote to raid the Medicare  trust fund in order to cut Medicare taxes for the rich, and we will see  who will vote to cut Medicaid's coverage for patients struggling with  the curse of opioid addiction.   Mr. Speaker, this is not just a vote. This is a gut check of who we  are as people and whether our purpose, as elected officials, is to  serve the public interest or, rather, feckless special interests.   Show the Nation that we care more about people than politics, that we  care more about the long arc of American history toward justice rather  than the short news cycle of who is up and who is down in Washington.   Make no mistake: History is watching this vote. Vote ``no.''
