 Madam Speaker, Republicans have relentlessly tried to  undermine the pillars of Americans' retirement security.   The Trump budget alone calls for $500 billion in cuts to Medicare,  almost $1.5 trillion in cuts to Medicaid, and $72 billion in cuts to  Social Security disability. Democrats will keep our promise to our  seniors and protect the health, well-being, and financial security of  American families by strengthening Medicare, Medicaid, and Social  Security.   Moreover, the Trump budget calls for cuts to vital childcare  development block grants that help ensure working parents have access  to quality, affordable child care. Democrats are calling for expanded  childcare assistance and universal access to high-quality preschool  programs so every child can have a strong start.                            ____________________
