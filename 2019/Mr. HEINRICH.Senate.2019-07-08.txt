 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in  morning business.    Mr. President, a new generation of young leaders in my  home State of New Mexico and all around the world recognizes that the  climate crisis is not just urgent, it is literally existential. These  young students and activists are demanding that their elected leaders  get to work on implementing solutions to limit its devastating impact.   I heard from many students in New Mexico about how we should confront  the climate crisis. Earlier this year, I sat down with students in  Santa Fe to hear their ideas on how we should confront this crisis.  These students showed an incredible depth of knowledge on climate  science and on their changing atmosphere. They are observing how the  climate crisis is already impacting their daily lives. Talking with  young people who are calling on us to save their future drives home how  urgent this issue is for our next generation.   It is not just high school or college students. I want to read to you  from a couple of handwritten letters I recently received from  elementary school students in New Mexico.   Brook is 9 years old from Albuquerque. She wrote to me: ``The Earth  is important to me because if we don't take care of earth now things  are going to get much worse, please do something.''   Orla, age 10, from Rio Rancho, wrote:         The Earth is important to me because Earth is the only       planet perfect for us. Earth is the place we live, plants       live, where other creatures big and small live. And if we       don't do something about this now, our Earth will not be       Earth, but Junk. We will have no place to live. Please do       something. NOW!    If these children can see so clearly how important it is, how  desperately urgent it is to fight for the future of the planet, why on  Earth can't our Nation's leaders here in Washington? I think it is long  past time for us to listen to our children who are pleading for us to  take action and to leave them with a better world in which to live. It  is long past time for us to think through substantive solutions that  can move us away from carbon pollution that is causing this crisis.   That means we should refuse to continue down the climate deniers'  desired path of inaction. That will only keep us moving toward more and  more costly disruptions for our children. I am focused on implementing  real and pragmatic solutions to eliminate this pollution. That is why I  was proud to join with Senator Whitehouse of Rhode Island and Senator  Schatz of Hawaii to introduce legislation this year that will finally  put a price on carbon. The scientific consensus is clear--the  destructive wildfires in my home State, the catastrophic hurricanes,  and the extreme flooding we are experiencing are all directly linked to  our pollution.   When we look at the climate modeling, one of the surest and, for that  matter, one of the cheapest ways we can move the needle is by finally  putting a price on carbon pollution because the truth is carbon  pollution isn't free. We are all paying the price for carbon pollution  in the billions of dollars we are spending each and every year to  recover from climate disruptions of more extreme wildfires, floods, and  storms. We need to stop socializing the cost of that pollution and ask  those who produce it to bear its true costs. In other words, we need to  internalize the price of carbon pollution at the source.   Our legislation, the American Opportunity Carbon Fee Act, would  collect a fee from carbon polluters. It would also include a border  adjustment provision to ensure that American manufacturers would still  be able to compete on a level playing field and that international  carbon polluters would pay a price. The fee for carbon pollution under  our bill would start at $52 a ton, and it would rise 6 percent each  year. This matches the midrange of the estimated cost of carbon that  researchers at the Office of Management and Budget, under the previous  administration, determined in 2016. Roughly translated, this is the  cost that carbon pollution is already costing you and your neighbors  because of its devastating effects. This is the cost that pollution  producers should be paying, and we can put the revenues raised by this  fee on carbon pollution directly to work helping American households.   Our legislation would raise a projected $2.3 trillion over 10 years  that would be returned directly to American families in the States to  transition us toward a clean energy economy. States would receive $10  billion a year to help pay for their transition toward clean energy and  a clean energy workforce. This transition represents our greatest  opportunity to create millions of new jobs all across our Nation and  particularly in our rural communities. Wind technology and solar are  already two of the fastest growing jobs in the Nation. States need to  put real resources into training our workers for these clean energy  jobs, and our legislation would make that happen.   The rest of the revenue from our legislation would be delivered  directly to American families in the form of tax credits and Social  Security and veterans' benefits. This is the responsible way forward.  This is the type of market-based climate policy that should have the  support of both Democrats and Republicans.   We know that to meet our climate goals and to limit the damage  wrought by the climate crisis, we must immediately change our  trajectory. We must move toward an economy that is run entirely--yes,  100 percent--on clean, pollution-free energy.   Our proposal is just one way to take a major Federal action that  would move us quickly in that direction--and I would welcome a full  debate in the Senate on the best way forward--but what is abundantly  clear is that we can no longer afford to debate whether to move  forward.   Our climate crisis often feels too big, too complex, too hard to fix.  However, the scientific fact is, we have created this problem, and we  possess the creativity and the tools and the technology to fix it. Our  kids understand better than even most of us do that we need to act  urgently and decisively. That is what leadership is all about. That is  our job.  [[Page S4691]]    I yield the floor.
