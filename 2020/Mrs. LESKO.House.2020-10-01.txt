 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume,  and I thank Representative Scanlon for yielding me the customary 30  minutes.   Madam Speaker, this rule consists of two nonbinding resolutions, H.  Res. 1153, regarding allegations made against the Irwin County  Detention Center, and H. Res. 1154, condemning QAnon and rejecting the  conspiracy theories it promotes.   First, H. Res. 1153 is a complete disregard to our Nation's due  process system. If the accusations from the  [[Page H5127]]  women at Irwin County Detention Center are true, they are obviously  horrific, and this resolution would be, obviously, an appropriate  response.   However, we don't know anything for certain yet. In fact, the Office  of the Inspector General and the Department of Homeland Security are  currently conducting investigations.   We could open up a committee investigation, too. We could go through  a normal committee oversight process where we have a hearing and bring  in witnesses to get to the truth. That would be appropriate, not this.   Guess what. ICE agrees with us. Acting ICE Director Tony Pham issued  a statement on September 18, 2020, saying: ``The recent allegations by  the independent contracted employee raise some very serious concerns  that deserve to be investigated quickly and thoroughly. ICE welcomes  the efforts of both the Office of the Inspector General as well as the  Department of Homeland Security's parallel review.   ``As a former prosecutor, individuals found to have violated our  policies and procedures should be held accountable. If there is any  truth to these allegations, it is my commitment to make the corrections  necessary to ensure we continue to prioritize the health, welfare, and  safety of ICE detainees.''   In fact, I, along with my colleague from New Jersey, Representative  Chris Smith, sent a letter to DHS last week to state that the  allegations are alarming and must be investigated thoroughly.   It also said in our letter that these accounts don't comport with the  statement of Dr. Ada Rivera, the medical director of the ICE Health  Services Corps, who stated that, since 2018, only two individuals at  Irwin County Detention Center were referred to certified, credentialed  medical professionals at gynecological healthcare facilities for  hysterectomies. Dr. Rivera also said that detainees are afforded  informed consent, and a medical procedure like a hysterectomy would  never be performed against a detainee's will.   On September 18, the Associated Press published an article citing the  results of its own internal investigation. It stated that the AP's  review did not find evidence of mass hysterectomies as alleged in a  widely shared complaint filed by a nurse at the detention center.   The AP also noted that one attorney investigating the case had found  that Dr. Amin has performed surgery or other gynecological treatment on  at least eight women detained at Irwin County Detention Center since  2017, including one hysterectomy.   As a member of the Homeland Security Committee and the co-chair of  the Bipartisan Women's Caucus, I am very concerned about these  accusations in this situation. However, what happened in this body to  due process?   The way the House is moving forward today on this resolution sets a  very dangerous precedent. For instance, in the resolution itself, it  states: ``Whereas these allegations indicate a failure by U.S.  Immigration and Customs Enforcement to conduct rigorous oversight to  protect the health and safety of people in its custody.''   However, we do not even know if the allegations are true. It should,  instead, read: ``If true, these actions indicate a failure.''   We can't just base it on allegations. This is an example of my  Democratic colleagues' acting first and learning later.   Right now, we need to investigate, not bring a resolution condemning  ICE to the floor. This is backwards, and it is just wrong. America  needs to see us together on this issue. Unfortunately, my Democratic  colleagues clearly do not want to work with Republicans to make that a  reality.   Madam Speaker, this rule also contains H. Res. 1154.   At the outset, let me be clear, Republicans are concerned with and do  not embrace QAnon.   I have to admit, although I must confess I know little to nothing  about this idea, organization, whatever it is, if what they say on  Wikipedia is true, then, of course, we oppose it. In fact, on August  20, the House Republican leader, Mr. McCarthy, stated very clearly that  there is no place for QAnon in the Republican Party.   It is a serious issue, and Republicans don't discriminate on which  dangerous organizations or groups we take seriously. We don't just  condemn groups because it is politically convenient. Because, unlike  many of our colleagues across the aisle, we also take the threat of  antifa seriously.   It is clear, unfortunately, that many of my Democratic colleagues  refuse to condemn antifa. Chairman Nadler said here right on the floor  of the U.S. House of Representatives something to the effect that  antifa was a myth, a fantasy. Just the other night, Vice President  Biden refused to condemn antifa at the debate.   That is why, last night, I offered an amendment to this resolution in  the Rules Committee to include condemning antifa, so we, as a governing  body, could unite against at least two threatening groups and  ideologies, not just one.   Unfortunately, all of my Rules Committee Democratic colleagues voted  against my commonsense amendment, even though FBI Director Wray,  himself, testified recently in Judiciary Committee: ``Antifa is a real  thing. It is not fiction.'' In other words, antifa is not a myth as  some on the other side believe. According to the FBI and the Department  of Justice, antifa is involved in the rioting and looting across our  Nation.    So while I do wish that the majority would have included a resolution  condemning antifa in this rule for floor consideration today, I am glad  Republicans can put country first and agree when a group poses a  threat.   Madam Speaker, I urge opposition to the rule, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, let's be clear: I already said it, but we agree. We  condemn QAnon, but we also ask the majority to condemn antifa.   Why is the majority condemning one group and not the other group?  That is the point.   But let me go on to what my colleague, Representative Scanlon, said  on H. Res. 1153. This was said in the Rules Committee last night, too,  that all this resolution does is call for an investigation.   That is inaccurate. This resolution goes beyond that. In fact, it  says it right here, and I said it last night. It says: ``Whereas these  allegations indicate a failure by U.S. Immigration and Customs  Enforcement.''   So, if all it did was call for an investigation, fine, but that is  not what it all does. It says: Whereas these allegations indicate a  failure by ICE.   Madam Speaker, you saw in the comments that Representative Scanlon  gave that she was going after ICE. That is what this is about.   Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.  Austin Scott).                                time  1200     Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman from Georgia.    Madam Speaker, yield myself such time as I may consume.  Again, we are all for investigations. Two investigations are already  going on; one by the office of Inspector General; one by DHS. I wrote a  letter, along with Representative Chris Smith, to the DHS Secretary  Chad Wolf last week, saying: Please investigate this, get back to us.   The problem that I have with this resolution is that it also condemns  ICE, just based on allegations that haven't even been investigated. The  findings haven't been done yet. So how can you condemn an agency based  on allegations that haven't even been proven yet? That is the point.   That is what Mr. Scott was trying to say. There are opposing  viewpoints. One side said this happened, another said it didn't.   So last night, in addition, in Rules Committee, I said: Why don't we  postpone this resolution until October 9? Give it a week. Let's go  through committee and find out what is exactly going on. Let's have DHS  come in. But, no, they opposed that, too.   Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.  Collins), my good friend.    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Georgia.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   If we defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment to the  rule to immediately consider Small Business Committee Ranking Member    Steve Chabot's H.R. 8265, to reopen the Paycheck Protection Program to  America's 30 million small businesses.   Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    This amendment would ensure our Nation's smallest and  most vulnerable firms get the support they need by allowing an  opportunity for a second PPP loan with specific funds set aside for  small businesses with 10 or fewer employees, expand the list of  eligible covered expenses, simplify the loan forgiveness process, and  extend PPP through the end of 2020.

Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from North  Carolina (Mr. Budd) for the purpose of a unanimous consent request.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, in closing, we need to help the American people. The  House should be considering a bipartisan COVID-19 relief package right  now, not binding resolutions that simply have the purpose of making  political points.   Our constituents need us, so let's get to work on a bipartisan  package that could actually be signed into law because, let's face it,  anything else is worthless to the American people.   Madam Speaker, I urge ``no'' on the previous question, ``no'' on the  underlying measure, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
