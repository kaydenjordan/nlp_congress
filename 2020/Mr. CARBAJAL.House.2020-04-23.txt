 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of this bipartisan  relief package. The funds we are adding to the PPP and EIDL programs  will go a long way in providing necessary support to small businesses.  I am glad that small farms and ranches will now be eligible for the  EIDL program and that we have secured additional resources for  hospitals, workers, and testing.   While this is another great bipartisan step forward, more must be  done, especially for our States, cities, and local governments. People  are hurting. Time is of the essence. We must act now.
