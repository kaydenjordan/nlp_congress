 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me the  time.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule for H.R. 2936, the  Resilient Federal Forests Act of 2017. This bill is a commonsense,  thoughtful approach to restore our forests and minimize forest fire  risk.   First and foremost, I thank Representative Westerman for  understanding the need for these vital reforms. He has been a great  partner to work with and has a keen understanding of how to restore our  forests.   This bill contains a number of needed reforms, but, in particular,  H.R. 2936 will put an end to obstructionist litigation that has been  paralyzing the ability of the Forest Service to manage their own land  for years.   The legislation creates an arbitration pilot program that requires  anyone suing to block a forest management activity to produce an  alternative solution, providing effective resolutions to problems  rather than frivolous litigant activity. The bill also puts a limit on  the amount of taxpayer dollars that can go to pay legal fees of  obstructionist groups when they sue to stop management.   It seems that every year we have a longer, more devastating fire  season. In my home State of California this year, it has been  particularly devastating in both lives and land lost. These fires  demand that we act, and we need to act now, to fix our forest  management.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman for his leadership on this  issue.   One last thing: Go Dodgers.
