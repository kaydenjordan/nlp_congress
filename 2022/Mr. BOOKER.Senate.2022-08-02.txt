 Mr. President, when the Federal Government authorizes  billions of dollars in grants to States, we have a duty to ensure that  those dollars are spent in a responsible, effective manner.  Accountability is essential to a healthy, functioning democracy.   And it is especially important when we discuss issues related to  policing. In recent years, we have seen egregious instances of police  misconduct, many of which have involved the unjustifiable deaths of  Black people. Right now, it is vital that we prioritize initiatives  that will improve public safety and strengthen public trust in law  enforcement.   As mayor of Newark, I spent hundreds of hours with police officers  riding along with them in their squad cars and learning about the daily  challenges they face trying to make our communities safer. I have seen  their bravery in the face of uncertainty and their fear knowing that  their streets are filling up with deadly weapons of war. I have  witnessed the enormous sacrifices they make in service of the public.   I have tremendous respect for our law enforcement officers. and I  believe that they need support to be able to do their jobs effectively.  I support improving officer training programs, hiring more officers in  underresourced departments, and updating the outdated equipment law  enforcement agencies are often left using.   Any resources provided, however, must be coupled with transparency.  It flies in the face of responsible governance to invest significant  resources into something without ever knowing what parts of that  investment are paying dividends.   Transparency does not mean that every law enforcement program must  come under the Federal Government's close scrutiny. Instead, it means  commonsense data collection and reporting. It means tracking how  Federal funds are spent and whether they produce positive or negative  outcomes.   It means doing basic due diligence for the purpose of improving  policing in this country and ensuring that taxpayer dollars are being  spent as effectively as possible.   As Congress moves to increase Federal assistance to State and local  law enforcement agencies, we must ensure responsible administration and  oversight of grant programs and ensure resources are directed toward  policing practices that actually enhance public safety and promote the  dignity of all communities, especially Black and Brown communities.   One of the biggest pools of funding for our Nation's law enforcement  comes in the form of grants from the Community Oriented Policing  Services, COPS, Office. The amount of money given to State and local  law enforcement through these grants has steadily increased over the  last few years, from $222 million for fiscal year 2017 to $512 million  for fiscal year 2022.   These grants fund the improvement of Tribal law enforcement agencies,  school violence prevention, drug crime enforcement aria prevention,  mental health and wellness services, equipment and technological  capabilities, and community policing strategies.   All of these programs share the goal of improving public safety. Yet,  despite the large increase in funding for the COPS grant program,  Congress has not moved to measure the successes and failures of the  program. As such, we cannot be sure that real improvements are actually  being made with the more than half a billion dollars in taxpayer money  being spent.   Reviewing how COPS grants are being spent and the outcomes they are  producing will help realize the very goals that the COPS program aims  to advance.   Ensuring that the Federal Government, through COPS grants, invests in  best practices will help train officers in the most effective ways  possible. Establishing performance metrics for COPS grants will allow  law enforcement agencies to identify which initiatives make officers  and the public safer and which reduce negative and dangerous  interactions between law enforcement and the public.   As law enforcement agencies are called upon to bolster their data  collection and reporting practices, it is also important to recognize  that some agencies, particularly in underresourced communities,  struggle to respond to those calls even with the availability of COPS  grants. We must specifically dedicate more resources toward helping  these law enforcement agencies meet these standards.   In particular, many law enforcement agencies have not been fully  equipped to report data to the Federal Bureau of  [[Page S3865]]  Investigation's National Use-of-Force Data Collection. This dearth of  data severely hinders our ability to analyze policing trends, develop  best practices, and hold officers accountable for wrongdoing when it  occurs.   These measures for transparency and accountability are basic,  commonsense ways to invest effectively in policing and make our  communities safer. All law enforcement agencies should be collecting  and reporting data. All law enforcement agencies should be complying  with civil rights laws. All law enforcement agencies should be using  performance metrics to identify best practices. These are the building  blocks of responsible, modern policing which we should all be able to  agree on.   Today, I introduced the COPS Responsible Administration and  Management Act of 2022, which will promote the kind of accountability  and transparency that should accompany these important investments that  the Federal Government makes in law enforcement.   This bill supports and complements the crucial investments we are  making in police forces by reviewing COPS grants to ensure they are  being effectively and efficiently administered, evaluating how COPS  grants are being utilized and how well they are assisting law  enforcement in making communities safer, offering grants to agencies to  improve data reporting, and assessing agency compliance with civil  rights laws.   This Congress has made historic investments in improving law  enforcement and addressing violent crime in our communities. Let us  also take the time to make sure that those investments are paying off.   Law enforcement agencies across the country are struggling to manage  competing demands. Officers work incredibly hard every day to protect  their neighborhoods, and they often do so without the equipment,  personnel, and training that they need.   The good news is that law enforcement agencies will be receiving many  of these important resources with COPS grant funding. At the same time,  if the goal of this funding is to improve policing and public safety,  which we can all agree it is, then we must also track and evaluate the  success of these grants.   Our investments should produce positive outcomes for communities.  They should reduce negative and dangerous interactions between officers  and the public, including use-of-force incidents, and they should  increase the public's trust in law enforcement.   Our officers deserve resources that will help them do their jobs  effectively and keep them safe. Our communities deserve police forces  that are well-trained and well-informed. The COPS Administration Act  will help secure both of those goals.                            ____________________     Mr. President, when the Federal Government authorizes  billions of dollars in grants to States, we have a duty to ensure that  those dollars are spent in a responsible, effective manner.
