 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 5059) to amend the Home Owners' Loan Act with respect to the  registration and supervision of insurance savings and loan holding  companies, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.

SEC. 7. RULE OF CONSTRUCTION.         Nothing in this Act or the amendments made by this Act may       be construed to affect the authority of the Board of       Governors of the Federal Reserve System over any subsidiary       of an insurance savings and loan holding company that is not       an insurance underwriting company (as such terms are defined,       respectively, under section 10(a)(1) of the Home Owners' Loan       Act).     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5059, the State Insurance  Regulation Preservation Act. I want to thank Chairman Hensarling and  Ranking Member Waters for their support for this bill. I also want to  commend my colleague, Representative Joyce Beatty from Ohio, for her  leadership on this issue. It has been a pleasure working with  Representative Beatty, the ranking member's staff, and the Federal  Reserve to ensure that this  [[Page H8126]]  legislation is balanced, effective, and bipartisan.   This bill is a good example of how solutions-minded Members from both  sides of the aisle can come together to address a clear problem. H.R.  5059 is a commonsense, right-regulation bill that calls on the Federal  Reserve to tailor the supervision of insurance-focused savings and loan  holding companies.   As many of you know, Dodd-Frank brought savings and loan holding  companies under the Federal Reserve's supervision for the first time.  Despite the fact that Dodd-Frank also reaffirmed a State-based model of  insurance regulation, a principle that we all support, the law had the  effect of also bringing insurance savings and loan holding companies,  or ISLHCs, under the Fed's purview.   These are firms that are overwhelmingly engaged in the business of  insurance but also happen to own thrift subsidiaries. These insurance  companies are simultaneously regulated by the Fed and the States. The  lack of clarity regarding how Fed supervision of these insurers should  complement rather than supplant State regulation has led to regulatory  inefficiency, duplication of effort, and higher compliance costs.   Bank-centric Fed supervision has also been a poor fit for companies  that are primarily in the insurance business and has not been  consistent with the actual risks posed by ISLHCs. All of this cost and  complexity eventually impact consumers through higher prices and  reduced access to services.   I should also point out that the burden of duplicative supervision  has encouraged a significant number of these insurance companies to get  rid of their thrift subsidiaries. Today, fewer than half of the  insurance savings and loan holding companies that existed when Dodd- Frank was enacted continue to operate under the same model.   H.R. 5059 streamlines regulators' approach to ISLHCs by enacting the  following reforms.   If an ISLHC has filed a report with another Federal or State  regulator, the Fed will be required to request that report from that  regulator first before requesting the information from the company.  This prevents compliance staff from being required to respond to  duplicative information requests.   H.R. 5059 also requires the Fed to align recordkeeping requirements  with those imposed by State insurance authorities to avoid duplication.   The bill also requires that Fed examinations be coordinated, to the  fullest extent possible, with State and Federal authorities. Again,  this will help to reduce unnecessary duplication and conflict.   The bill further requires the Fed to craft a supervisory framework  that appropriately tailors the supervision of ISLHCs. It then requires  a review of existing supervisory guidance to ensure that it is  consistent with the new framework.   All of these reforms will provide greater regulatory clarity and  efficiency, and reduce unnecessary compliance burden. In doing so, we  can ensure that these companies can continue to serve their customers  without sacrificing the safety and soundness of our financial system.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 5059, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Missouri (Mr. Luetkemeyer), the chairman of the House Financial  Institutions and Consumer Credit Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Beatty for working  together on this very particular piece of legislation.   Again, this is a right-sized regulation that enjoys strong bipartisan  support and sets forth the appropriate framework for regulating  insurance savings and loan holding companies in this area.   Mr. Speaker, I request that my colleagues vote ``yes'' on this  legislation, H.R. 5059, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 6411) to amend the duties of the Financial Crimes  Enforcement Network (FinCEN) to ensure FinCEN works with Tribal law  enforcement agencies, protects against all forms of terrorism, and  focuses on virtual currencies.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 6411         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``FinCEN Improvement Act of       2018''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         The Congress finds the following:        (1) The mission of the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network       (FinCEN) is to safeguard the financial system from illicit       use and combat money laundering and promote national security       through the collection, analysis, and dissemination of       financial intelligence and strategic use of financial       authorities.        (2) In its mission to safeguard the financial system from       the abuses of financial crime, including terrorist financing,       money laundering and other illicit activity, the United       States should prioritize working with partners in Federal,       State, local, Tribal, and foreign law enforcement       authorities.        (3) The Federal Bureau of Investigation has stated that       since the terror attacks on September 11, 2001, ``The threat       landscape has expanded considerably, though it is important       to note that the more traditional threat posed by al Qaeda       and its affiliates is still present and active. The threat of       domestic terrorism also remains persistent overall, with       actors crossing the line from First Amendment protected       rights to committing crimes to further their political       agenda.''.        (4) Although the use and trading of virtual currencies are       legal practices, some terrorists and criminals, including       international criminal organizations, seek to exploit       vulnerabilities in the global financial system and are       increasingly using emerging payment methods such as virtual       currencies to move illicit funds.        (5) In carrying out its mission, FinCEN should prioritize       all forms of terrorism and emerging methods of terrorism and       illicit finance.       SEC. 3. STRENGTHENING FINCEN.         Section 310 of title 31, United States Code, is amended--        (1) in paragraph (C)--        (A) in clause (i), by striking ``appropriate Federal,       State, local, and foreign law enforcement agencies'' and       inserting ``appropriate Federal, State, local, Tribal, and       foreign law enforcement agencies''; and        (B) in clause (vi), by striking ``to protect against       international terrorism'' and inserting ``to protect against       terrorism'';        (2) in paragraph (E), by striking ``appropriate Federal,       State, local, and foreign law enforcement authorities'' and       inserting ``appropriate Federal, State, local, Tribal, and       foreign law enforcement authorities'';        (3) in paragraph (F), by striking ``Federal, State, local,       and foreign law enforcement'' and inserting ``Federal, State,       local, Tribal, and foreign law enforcement''; and        (4) in paragraph (H), by striking ``anti-terrorism and       anti-money laundering initiatives, and similar efforts'' and       inserting ``anti-terrorism and anti-money laundering       initiatives, including matters involving emerging       technologies or value that substitutes for currency, and       similar efforts''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the FinCEN Improvement Act was introduced by  Representative Ed Perlmutter, the ranking member of the Subcommittee on  Terrorism and Illicit Finance, and cosponsored by Representative Steve  Pearce, the chairman of this subcommittee.   This would add Tribal law enforcement agencies to those partners with  which the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network already works, which  includes Federal, State, local, and foreign law enforcement agencies.   The bill would clarify that FinCEN should protect against all forms  of terrorism. FinCEN currently supports law enforcement on domestic  issues, not just international, and this legislation would clarify that  current practice. This bill would add an emphasis on emerging  technologies or value that substitutes for currency in order to address  the growing exploitation of digital currencies to move illicit funds.   The financial technology, virtual currency, and electronic payments  landscape is rapidly evolving to include means of storing and  transferring value that didn't exist when previous laws and regulations  were written. This bill emphasizes that FinCEN ought to prioritize  cryptocurrencies to ensure that criminals and terrorists cannot use  these technologies to carry out illicit financial activities.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, again, I thank my colleague, Mr.  Perlmutter, for his diligent work on this very practical, bipartisan  bill. I urge my colleagues to support its adoption.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
