 Mr. Speaker, I thank my dear friend for yielding to me  and for his leadership.   Mr. Speaker, when I served in local government, I helped write and  pass 14 consecutive budgets--all balanced. And what the budget writing  process taught me was that a budget is a values document.   So what does the budget reconciliation process tell us about our  respective values?   Well, the last two times the budget reconciliation process was used  by Republicans, they used it on a $2 trillion tax giveaway to the  wealthiest Americans and corporations and to take away healthcare for  more than 20 million Americans. That was their value.   The budget we are debating today shows the Democrats in Congress are  going to use every bit of a fight we have in us to take decisive and  comprehensive action to finally end this pandemic and alleviate the  economic pain Americans are experiencing.   We will not wait and see if another 100,000 Americans die in a single  month in order to deliver vaccines and testing that we need. We will  not wait and see if the United States loses another 20 million jobs, or  if the American economy experiences another record-breaking year of GDP  contraction. We will not wait and see if the U.S. loses another 10  million jobs, or people continue to go hungry at record numbers.   We will enact an American rescue plan that saves lives and  livelihoods. Those are our values.
