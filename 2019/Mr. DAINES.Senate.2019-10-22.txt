 Madam President, this week I have the honor of  recognizing pilot Bill Stebbins of Dawson County for his tremendous  impact on Montana and over 60 years of experience as a pilot.   Bill was honored by his colleagues and the Federal Aviation  Administration with the distinguished Wright Brothers Master Pilot  Award in August of 2019. This high honor is reserved for few pilots who  have had a pilot's license in good standing for 50 or more years.   Bill has been flying since 1955, putting him at over 60 years of  flight with an outstanding 13,000 hours spent in the air.   After earning a mechanical engineering degree, Bill joined the Army  where he trained in fixed-wing aircraft at Gary Air Force Base in San  Marcos, TX. He later advanced to fixed-wing and helicopter training at  Fort Rucker in Alabama.   Upon leaving military service, Bill worked for Montana-Dakota  Utilities and then Williston Basin Interstate Pipeline, where he flew  thousands of miles of pipeline in a variety of fixed-wing and rotary  aircrafts to help inspect and maintain the pipeline's protection.   Over the years, Bill has also committed himself to helping those in  need, including participating in countless search and rescue  operations.   Most notably, in the 1980s Bill airlifted food and supplies into  Makoshika State Park to support a youth group stranded at the Lion's  camp by heavy rains and washed out roads.   Bill has spent 50 years based at the Dawson Community Airport, where  he has served as the assistant airport manager since 2015. He has had a  tremendous impact on the operation of the Dawson County Airport.   It is my honor to recognize Bill for his extraordinary  accomplishments. Bill's experience as a pilot and his selfless service  to his community and country is exemplary of the Montana  spirit.                            ____________________
