 Mr. Speaker, 6 months ago, the White House shamefully  rescinded the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program without  having legislation in place to protect Dreamers. That is just wrong.   The overwhelming majority of Americans support a pathway to  citizenship for Dreamers, yet Republican leadership refuses to let  Congress vote on a clean Dream Act.   A few months ago, after ending DACA, the President began rolling back  immigration from Black and Latino countries he thinks are s---holes.  After that, he went on a Twitter rant to attack the Diversity Immigrant  Visa program, which helps people from Africa immigrate lawfully to the  United States.   Eliminating DACA without a plan for Dreamers is just another  antiminority move. Removing the Diversity Immigrant Visa program is  more of the same. The administration has shown itself to be hostile to  people of color. Mr. Speaker, racism is not a good policy.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from the Keystone State  for hosting tonight's Special Order hour. He has demonstrated great  leadership during this time, and the issues that we are tackling during  these Special Order hours are very important to this country as we move  forward.    As has been stated today, it has been 50 years since the Kerner  report warned us that the Nation was headed into a separate and unequal  future. The Kerner report was supposed to be a wake-up call for the  United States to break the cycle that kept African-Americans in  poverty. It called for government to invest in job creation programs,  to expand public housing, and to guarantee minimum family incomes. The  Kerner report understood that such actions were necessary for the  United States to confront its legacy of race and inequality.   Unfortunately, 50 years later, the same problems persist. The rate of  child poverty in the United States today is greater than it was in  1968. The percent of Americans who live in the depths of poverty has  grown as well. Welfare reform has failed. African-American unemployment  is still nearly double the rate of our White counterparts. Labor  unions, once a great equalizer for workers, have shrunk, and inequality  has grown.   Rich people in the United States are healthier than poor people. They  live longer. They go to better schools, get better jobs, and generate  more wealth. They are also more likely to be White than to be Black.   Our schools are more segregated than they were in the 1980s. Our  prisons are darker. The Voting Rights Act, a landmark achievement of  the civil rights movement, has been gutted.   These and other barriers to equality threaten our democracy.   The resegregation of our schools means that people of color and those  who struggle with poverty are often forced to go to underfunded  schools. Their education suffers. They aren't given adequate  preparation for college or a trade school, and they ultimately make  less money than their White counterparts.   A recent Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco study found that Black  men and women earn persistently lower wages compared to their White  counterparts, a gap that cannot be fully explained by differences in  age, education, job type, or location.   So what can Congress do? We need to invest in housing programs that  help desegregate communities once again. We need to make it easier for  people of color to get federally backed loans to buy homes and finally  do away with red lining.   We need to invest in public schools. We need to expand preschool  education. We need to spend money on job training programs and public  universities.   We need to increase the minimum wage, and we need to strengthen  oversight of mortgage lenders.   We need to restore the Voting Rights Act, because people who cannot  vote cannot lead.    Mr. Speaker, I would say that, as we have all stated  tonight, it apparently appears that we are going backwards in this  country, and so why wouldn't the Voting Rights Act be under attack? It  was finally the opportunity for African-American citizens to be full  citizens.   The only right you are born with in the United States of America is  the right to vote as an American citizen. You are born with that right,  and yet it is stripped away through the gutting of the Voting Rights  Act.   So what does that say to people who fall under the Voting Rights Act?  It says that you are not equal, that you don't deserve the same rights  as other Americans, that somehow you are less than a first-class  citizen in this country, yet you can go to war for us, you can do other  things, contribute to this society, but not be able to vote. The three- fifths compromise, we can go all the way back to that and talk about  the inequality.  [[Page H1370]]    So we need people of goodwill on both sides of the issue, on both  sides of the aisle, to understand how equality is arrived at and come  together and do the things that we need to do in order to make this a  more perfect Union. I believe in that. I have not always seen it, but I  believe that we need to continue to strive to make this a more perfect  Union, to live out the mantra of this great Nation.   This is the greatest country in the world, no question about it,  absolutely incredible, but let's live up to it. Let's really live up to  what this Nation stands for, because you don't need people who are  citizens here that don't believe in what you are saying.   Every day, we get up and we pledge allegiance to the flag like every  other resident, every other citizen in this country, but every once in  a while it fails us. We need to stay vigilant. We at the Congressional  Black Caucus will be the voice and be vigilant on this floor in this  House for people throughout this country who seem to be on the wrong  side of this issue.                                time  2115
