 Madam Speaker, today's bill making Juneteenth, when the  last slaves got word that slavery had ended, a federal holiday has  unique meaning for the District of Columbia because the slaves here  were the first, not the last, to be freed. The reason, of course, is  that the District was and is a federally controlled jurisdiction. The  District celebrates the emancipation of slaves here on April 16 every  year.   Juneteenth should remind Congress that it's time for the first to be  freed to finally become equal to other Americans. The House understands  that with its passage of the D.C. statehood bill. So does the Senate,  with a hearing on our D.C. statehood bill scheduled for next Tuesday,  June 22.   With the President, the House, and the Senate all believing that the  residents of their Nation's capital should in every way be equal to  other Americans, we rejoice this Juneteenth knowing that we are close  to adding the 51st star to the flag.
