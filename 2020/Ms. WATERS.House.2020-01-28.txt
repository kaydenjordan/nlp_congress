 Mr. Speaker, I stand today on behalf of all Californians;  certainly, the entire city of Los Angeles; and millions of fans  worldwide who are mourning the sudden and tragic loss of one of the  greatest athletes we have ever known: Kobe Bryant.   Celebrated as a king in Los Angeles, Kobe's death is deeply painful  for our city and his millions of fans everywhere.   For decades, he dazzled generations of fans and aspiring athletes,  leaving a legacy as a prolific athlete, devoted husband, loving father,  and philanthropist that will never be forgotten.   This tragic event is made worse by the death of his 13-year-old  daughter, Gianna Bryant, a beautiful young lady who was so full of life  and potential.   Our hearts go out to his wife, Vanessa; surviving daughters, Bianka,  Natalia, and Capri; relatives; teammates; and friends.   On behalf of the California delegation, we lift up the names of Kobe  Bryant; his beloved daughter, Gianna; and all the victims of this  horrible tragedy in prayer and reverence. We send our deepest  condolences to their loved ones, now and forever.
