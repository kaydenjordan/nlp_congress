 ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to  the amendment.    ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Chairman, there is no question  that prescription drug prices in this country are too high and that too  many Americans cannot afford the lifesaving medications that they need,  and I wish the bill we were debating today would solve that problem.  Sadly, it does not.   The premise of this amendment is that the VA should be able to lower  drug costs if the savings predicted materialize. But make no mistake  about it, a bill that stops cures from coming to market and discourages  innovation is bad for veterans and bad for America, regardless of the  effects of this amendment.   Further, with this amendment, we would be putting the brave men and  women who have served our Armed Forces and are seeking care from the  Department of VA at risk. Congressman Cunningham's amendment would  expand the scope of this bill to include the prescription drugs  provided by VA. As well intentioned as Congressman Cunningham's  amendment might be, this is the wrong thing for veterans.   Mr. Chairman, let me reminisce a little bit. When I graduated from  medical school, there was a disease out there we did not know the name  of. We didn't even know the name of it. We later discovered it was  hepatitis C. We have gone from not even knowing the name of this  disease to being able to cure it in 8 to 12 weeks.   Let me tell you what this incredible innovation has done for our  Nation's veterans. The VA has cured more than 100,000 veterans of  hepatitis C since 2014, remarkable, cutting the death rate by 50  percent.   That is innovation that has done that. Because of this treatment,  veterans cured are estimated to have a 72 percent less likely chance of  developing cancer of the liver. Fewer than 25,000 veterans out there  are now untested that are at risk, and the VA is to be applauded for  this.   Let me digress to my first pediatric rotation in medical school in  Memphis many years ago. My first inpatient rotation was St. Jude  Children's Hospital. At that time when I saw those children, 80 percent  of them, Mr. Chairman, died of their disease. Because of innovation and  research, and doctors and nurses and others who went in every day and  saw these children die, today, 80 percent of those children live. If we  don't stifle innovation, my prayer is that 100 percent of these  children live.   My concern with this bill, H.R. 3, is not what it will do. It is what  will be left undone when we don't have these cures. I know that is not  the intent of my friend. We serve on the committee together, and I know  that is not his intent. My concern is that is exactly what will happen.  [[Page H10217]]    I submit for the Record this list of drugs right now that the VA does  not have on its formulary because it is closed.

Mr. Chairman, further with this  amendment, we have a system now that works, and I would encourage my  colleagues to not support this amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Chairman, I agree with my  colleagues that we should do everything possible to lower prescription  drug costs, but I can tell you that H.R. 3 will not do it. One of the  problems I have with this bill is to stifle the incredible innovation  that I have seen in my career.   Let me give another example before I close, Mr. Chairman. I had a  professor in medical school, Dr. Lemuel Diggs, my hematology professor.  He spent his entire career trying to cure sickle-cell anemia. I have  sat by the bedside of pregnant women and done exchange transfusions on  women nearing term who have sickle-cell disease so they can deliver a  baby that is well and the mother would be healthy. I have done that.   Dr. Diggs passed before we found out incredible research that has  been done, that we can do alterations of the HIV virus, an attenuated  virus it is called, and place the right code in the genetic code and  potentially cure sickle-cell disease for African Americans. We do not  want to stifle this innovation.   Mr. Chairman, I oppose this amendment, and I yield back the balance  of my time.    ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded  vote.
