 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of America's  Water Infrastructure Act, which includes the House-passed WRDA.   The chairman's commitment to passing bipartisan WRDA bills every 2  years has been an impactful item at better managing the bureaucracy at  the Army Corps and more regularly approving vital water projects. This  is good government and a policy that I would like to see the committee  remain committed to in the future.   In my district, Mr. Speaker, this bill is extremely important to the  agriculture economy and to everyone who relies on the Missouri and  Mississippi Rivers. I am glad the final bill included my amendment to  stop the Army Corps from building any new, unproven structures for  endangered species along the Missouri, and, instead, they now are  required to prove that it will actually work before spending millions  of taxpayer dollars.   The Corps has to prove that these structures do not negatively impact  the other management priorities on the Missouri River.   In closing, this is a good bill, and it is necessary to advance the  important flood control projects and ensure our inland waterways remain  reliable and efficient options for transporting goods.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote for S. 3021.
