 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed  to speak as in morning business and that Senator Bennet be allowed to  conclude his remarks before the vote today.    Mr. President, I come to the floor today to continue to  raise the alarm about how Republicans' extreme, ongoing attacks on  reproductive rights are putting women's lives at risk, are trampling  the will of the American people, who supported the right to abortion,  by the way, everywhere it was on the ballot last November, and are even  undermining care for patients in States like mine, which have strong  abortion protections.   In fact, right now, a truly extreme lawsuit, which some far-right  Republicans in Congress just filed a brief supporting, is seeking to  overturn the FDA's longstanding approval of a safe and effective  medication used in abortion care. This suit could cause chaos  nationwide and rip abortion medication away from patients in every  single State, potentially even from my constituents in Washington  State.   I have been clear that the overturning of Roe v. Wade last year was  not the end of the fight to protect reproductive rights. Unfortunately,  it was just the starting gun for even more extreme attacks from far- right Republicans. We have already seen 14 extreme State abortion bans  go into effect--from bans that set bounties for information about  anyone who gets an  [[Page S417]]  abortion or helps to provide one to bans that even lack exceptions for  rape and incest and the life and well-being of moms. Some States are  even passing new bans to try and get around State courts that block  their first ones or laws to get around the fact that their own  constituents backed the right to abortion in a statewide vote last  year.   Here in Congress, we saw Senate Republicans introduce a national  abortion ban last year, and it was one of the first things the  Republican House voted on this year. We are still seeing new, appalling  proposals from extreme Republicans across the country.   While Republicans here in Congress blocked our bill to make sure  doctors cannot be jailed for providing an abortion, Republican State  legislators have drafted bills to make sure women can be prosecuted for  getting an abortion.   While Republicans in Congress blocked our bill to protect the right  to travel across State lines for an abortion, State lawmakers have  bills to stop employers from helping employees travel for an abortion.   Right next door to my home State, there is a bill in Idaho that could  lead to parents and grandparents being charged with human trafficking  for helping minors travel out of State so they can get an abortion.  That is appalling.   Republican politicians have investigated a doctor for providing care  to a child who was raped. They have proposed funding to jail people for  abortions. They have talked about using existing child endangerment  laws to prosecute women who use abortion pills. They have made it  harder for patients to get birth control and even the treatments they  need for life-threatening illnesses, like cancer.   There are Republican attorneys general suing, right now, because the  Biden administration told pharmacists they can't discriminate against  pregnant patients and because the administration reminded care  providers that, when a woman's life is at stake, they are required by  Federal law to provide the necessary care, and that includes abortion.   Then there is the case I mentioned earlier, whereby a far-right group  is trying, right now, to ban mifepristone, an important abortion  medication, nationwide, and I mean all across the country, including in  my home State of Washington and in every other State that has strong  protections for abortion. There are 22 Republican attorneys general and  67 Republicans right here in Congress who have filed briefs in support  of that outlandish lawsuit.   Now, let's be clear about what is going on here. In this lawsuit,  these far-right extremists are asking one district judge to overrule  the FDA's experts and rulemaking authority in order to undermine  healthcare for patients nationwide by declaring a drug that was  approved over 20 years ago as unsafe.   Let's set the record straight right now because there has been so  much misinformation on this, including from Republican Members of  Congress.   Mifepristone is safe, and it is effective for ending a pregnancy  during the first 10 weeks. The FDA determined that decades ago. The  science is done. The results are in. They have been for over 20 years.  Mifepristone is safe. This lawsuit is not about science; it is about  ideology. It is not about protecting women; it is about controlling  their bodies.   The reality of what extreme Republicans have already caused with  their abhorrent bans is a nightmare. Because of Republican bans, women  facing miscarriages have already been unable to get the care they need  for days on end. They have already been left bleeding, getting sicker  and sicker, and pleading for help. Doctors are already being forced to  compromise medical care, leave patients in pain, and even forgo  providing lifesaving care because they fear far-right politicians will  jail them for doing their job. Abortion providers in States like mine  are already overworked, overbooked, and overwhelmed with patients who  have had to wait weeks and travel hundreds of miles to get an abortion  because of Republican bans. This lawsuit will make things much worse.   Mifepristone is used in over half of the abortions. Taking that drug  away would mean fewer options for women, longer waits for people who  are seeking care, stress for patients and providers, and chaos for a  healthcare system that Republicans have already put in crisis.   It is cruel and utterly unnecessary. There is no reason for this.   You don't have to take my word for this, by the way. Listen to  doctors and patients, and listen to women, because that is exactly what  I have been doing.   I am not going to stop. I am going to continue to make sure their  stories are being heard, especially when they are hard stories to hear,  because we will not be quiet. I am going to continue to be their voice  and vote here in the Senate, and I am going to keep putting a spotlight  on their concerns and on the threats to their health, like these  extreme abortion bans and ideology abortion lawsuits. I am going to be  here, raising the alarm, fighting to pass commonsense legislation to  protect our rights, being a firewall against extreme Republican attacks  against abortion, and working, meanwhile, to build the support we need  to restore Roe once and for all.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  memberships on the twelve subcommittees of the Committee on  Appropriations for the 118th Congress be printed in the Record.

(9-8)                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the Lieutenants  [[Page S420]]  Peggy Dente and Lyndsay Evans of Naval Air Station Whidbey Island for  making history on February 12, 2023, as part of the first-ever all- women flyover at the Super Bowl pregame, commemorating 50 years of  women serving in the U.S. Navy.   Both of these extraordinary women represent the best of what  Washington State--and our Nation--has to offer. Not only do the two  share over a decade of friendship, they also bring with them a keen  sense of duty and deep commitment to excellence in aviation.   In 1973, eight women broke new ground by being selected for naval  aviation training for the first time in our Nation's history. Five  decades later, we are seeing more women and girls express interest in  taking to the skies through service and leadership at every level of  naval aviation. In performing their first ever flyover, Dente and Evans  have quite literally proven that with women at the helm, the sky is the  limit.   I know breaking into a field dominated by men isn't easy, when I  first got to the Senate, there wasn't even a women's bathroom off the  Senate floor. But every day, women like Lieutenants Dente and Evans are  setting an example for young girls that with hard work, they can follow  their dreams and achieve their goals.   I offer my sincere thanks to the lieutenants for their service to our  country and my congratulations for proudly representing Washington  State on the national stage. I ask my colleagues to join me in  celebrating this tremendous accomplishment.                            ____________________
