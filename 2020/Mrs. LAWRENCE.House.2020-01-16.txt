 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of the late, great  Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.   On June 23, 1963, in my hometown of Detroit, Michigan, Martin Luther  King, Jr., delivered an impassioned precursor to his ``I Have a Dream''  speech during the historic Detroit Walk to Freedom, which recognized  the 20th anniversary of the Detroit race riots.   With over 120,000 people present, the Detroit Walk to Freedom was the  largest civil rights demonstration in the Nation's history. Of course,  we all know that soon changed just a few weeks later with the March on  Washington.   As a young Black girl growing up on the east side of Detroit, Dr.  Martin Luther King, Jr., was more than just a public figure; he was our  hope. Today, I am honored to have the chance to recognize him and his  work and will continue to do my part to ensure his legacy lives on.   And in today's environment, here in Washington, D.C., and this  Congress, we must refocus on the ability to recognize every person  based on their character, their skills and abilities, and not based on  race.                            ____________________
