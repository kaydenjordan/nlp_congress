 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, the Senate is now opening the crucial  debate on our proposal to throw out the Trump pro-dark money campaign  rule under the Congressional Review Act.   At the outset, I thank my colleague Senator Tester for his leadership  on the issue of bringing sunshine to American elections.   The fact is the State of Montana is the poster child of campaign  finance reform--a textbook case of the sort of transparency and  accountability that American elections need to all be about, and no  Senator embodies that tradition more than Montana's own Jon Tester.   If you know anything about the history of the State and the Montana  Copper Kings, you know why Montanans and Jon Tester always lead this  fight. That is why I am so glad, as the ranking Democrat on the Finance  Committee, to be able to partner with him on this critical issue. The  Trump administration's dark money rule makes it easier for foreigners  and special interests to corrupt and interfere in our elections.  Senator Tester and I have filed this Congressional Review Act proposal  because we want to make it harder.   I believe deeply that when you are facing down secret money that is  shifting between shadowy groups that want to buy our elections,  sunlight is the best disinfectant. If you are concerned about foreign  actors who are hostile to our country and who are illegally funding  candidates who will do their bidding, sunlight is the best  disinfectant. If you are worried about anonymous political insiders who  have deep pockets that are tightening their grips on Washington, DC,  sunlight is the best disinfectant. I hope, today, we will prove that  sunlight should not be a partisan proposition.   Yet the rule change the Trump administration pushed through this  summer is not about sunlight; it is all about darkness. It is about  secrecy. It is about giving the well-connected even more of a say in  how American Government works. You can see that pretty clearly just by  going back to the day the rule was announced. That alone shows how out  of whack these policies are, how wrongheaded they are.   On July 16, 2018, a Monday morning, the American people woke up to  the news of the arrest of an accused Russian spy in Washington, named  Maria Butina. She had come to our country years earlier and had set out  to infiltrate conservative organizations, especially the NRA. She  cultivated relationships with political insiders. She worked to  organize back channel lines of communication for the benefit of the  Russian Federation, and she set up a shell company in North Dakota with  a very prominent NRA political operative. For months, her lawyer  claimed she was nothing more than a typical college kid who was  enjoying life in the Nation's Capital.  [[Page S7461]]    It has been a few years since I have been in college, but I don't  know of many students at Portland State or Southern Oregon who cross  State lines to set up shell companies and organize lines of  communication with the Kremlin. Most college kids in Oregon are too  busy being college kids to infiltrate conservative political circles on  behalf of a hostile foreign power.   Hours after the vast majority of the American public heard Maria  Butina's name for the first time, the Trump administration dropped its  dark money bombshell. It announced a new policy that is going to let  even more untraceable dark money from foreigners and special interests  find its way into--infiltrate--our elections. For those like Maria  Butina who want to secretly, furtively, invade and twist and corrupt  our democracy, the Trump administration, just this summer, made it a  lot easier.   Shadowy political spending groups used to be required under tax law  to disclose the identities of their major donors. After this rule was  adopted, they didn't have to disclose their donors at all. Federal  investigators are going to be blind to bad actors who use dark money  groups to do their bidding. Even if the Internal Revenue Service and  State tax authorities suspect a particular spending group is guilty of  wrongdoing, they will not know who provided the cash.   Since this is a tax policy change, it falls under the jurisdiction of  the Finance Committee, where we do a lot of work on issues that deal  with tax exemptions. Let's make one thing clear. There was no debate on  this issue in the Finance Committee, and it received no debate on the  Senate floor. The American people had no opportunity to comment on the  rule change, which would be typical if you are talking about a major  change in a regulation. So we are going to unpack that this morning.   I am going to start by just spending a minute or 2 on some of the  arguments I have heard from some who might not be inclined to support  it.   First, there has been an argument that disclosing these major donors  is a violation of privacy. The Presiding Officer and I serve together  on the Select Committee on Intelligence, and I think anybody who has  followed that work knows that I am a real privacy hawk and don't take a  backseat to anybody in terms of privacy rights. Yet allowing foreigners  and megawealthy corporations to buy elections in secret is not a matter  of privacy policy; it is a proposition that is anti-democratic.  Furthermore, I will point out that the group that is making the case  for the privacy argument online is, in fact, a dark money group.   Second, since the announcement, the Trump administration has tried to  downplay the significance of the new rule. The Deputy Secretary of  Treasury told the Finance Committee that cutting off disclosure was all  about working to ``further efficient tax administration.'' That sounds,  to me, like dry Washington lingo for ``enforcing the pro-sunshine law  is a pain, so why would anybody bother?'' Others, simply, claim it will  have no real consequence.   I have two responses to that one.   First, if the dark money rule change is not any big deal, then why  did the Trump administration work so hard to block Congress from  challenging it? It kept the rule change off the official books for as  long as it could because it was hoping to run out the clock on our  oversight. This is real gamesmanship in order to make sure the American  people don't find out about how there would be less sunlight with  respect to big political donations.   Second, the argument that cutting off disclosure will not have  harmful consequences is another one that has been trotted out in  opposition to our reform.   If the existing rule requiring disclosure of major dark money donors  to the IRS wasn't casting enough sunshine, that is not a reason to  bring on total secrecy. That is not a reason for bringing on darkness.  It is a reason to say you want to be on the side of more sunshine.   A number of our colleagues on the Finance Committee--Senator  McCaskill and Senator Whitehouse, who is a champion of disclosure--are  all in favor of more sunshine. To me, this argument, as well, just  doesn't stand up. We think that making as much public information  public ought to be the policy of our land.   One thing that is clear to me from my conversations this election  season is that voters do not want more secret spending for more  anonymous wealthy donors and foreigners leading to more political ads.   It is not possible to escape all of these ads on television. Short of  pitching a tent and camping out in the woods until the second week of  November, you can't get away from it. People hear all of these charged- up political ads, but much of the time they have no way of determining  who is behind them. You get to the end of the ad, and a voice says that  it was paid for by an oddly named group that you have probably never  heard of, something like ``Americans United for Patriotic Priorities''  or ``Grandparents for This and That.'' Maybe the group is called  ``Families for Stuff.'' That is the kind of nonsense that is offered up  in terms of disclosure that I, Senator Tester, Senator Whitehouse, and  others who have been in this fight think is ridiculous.   By the way, there are real-life examples that actually demonstrate my  point. Some will remember Don Blankenship, whose mining company broke  safety laws and lost 29 employees in the worst mine explosion in  decades. A couple of years ago, he wanted, more or less, to buy a seat  on the West Virginia Supreme Court. So he set up a political spending  group called ``And For The Sake Of The Kids.'' Then he dropped a  mountain of cash on the election, and his preferred candidate won. Let  me repeat that in case anybody didn't get the essence of what he was up  to. An energy baron, a leader in the fight for more dirty energy  started a political spending group to protect his dirty energy  interests, and he actually named it ``And For The Sake Of The Kids.''   The dark money rule change--what the Trump administration worked so  hard to get, what they worked so hard to hide from oversight--feeds  right into what I have shown is a system of malignant, secretive  politics that our people have had a belly full of. It gets to the heart  of a larger problem. Across the country, our right to vote, our  elections, and our democracy are under assault.   Here are a few examples of what that means. Since the Citizens United  decision, the amount of outside money spent by shadowy groups on our  elections has gone into the stratosphere. Congressional districts are  gerrymandered to such an extreme that millions of Democratic voters  are, in effect, denied equal representation. In Wisconsin, Democrats  got 54 percent of the vote, but only 37 percent of the seats in the  legislature.   Republicans ignore the advice of Trump intelligence experts ringing  the alarm bells over election security, and they ignore the cyber  security experts who have clearly stated that paper ballots and risk  limiting audits are the key--the best way--to defend attacks on our  voting system.   Tens of millions of Americans cast their votes on insecure, hackable  machines produced by companies that buy off election officials and  evade oversight by the Congress. The Trump administration and his  allies have invented a fake crisis of voter fraud out of thin air, and  they have used it as a pretext to purge millions of voters from the  rolls and discourage Americans from casting a ballot.   State officials have targeted communities of people of color,  shutting down polling places where they live and restricting  opportunities to vote early or as an absentee.   In the last few days, Americans have learned more and more about what  happened in one district in North Carolina, where Republican Party  operatives schemed to confiscate and destroy mail-in ballots, likely  belonging to Democratic voters, if you read the press reports that are  coming out daily.   In some States where Democrats have won elections--look at Wisconsin  and North Carolina--outgoing Republican lawmakers have sabotaged the  powers of incoming Governors, in defiance of the voters who elected  them.   Trump's dark money policy--the idea that it is OK to have more dark,  secret money in politics--reinforces the corruption that I have just  described. It  [[Page S7462]]  concentrates power in the hands of special interests that can afford to  cut a big check and buy the election results they want. It takes power  away from individuals, away from moms and dads who vote to give their  kids a brighter future, away from seniors who vote to protect Medicare  and Social Security, and away from young people who are saying it is  long past time to fight the devastation of climate change and the  rising cost of education.   Having more disclosure and more sunshine in elections traditionally  has been bipartisan, and I hope the resolution Senator Tester and I are  offering will also be bipartisan. All we have to do is have an outbreak  of the legacy of the late John McCain.   A few years ago, I introduced a bipartisan disclosure bill with my  friend and colleague Senator Murkowski. Big bipartisan majorities  passed campaign finance legislation in the 1970s. That is what Senator  Tester and I believe the Congress ought to get back to. Throwing out  the Trump dark money rule seems to us to be a good first step.   This is an opportunity, today, to vote for sunshine in our elections,  to say that sunshine is, again, the best disinfectant. There is none  other like it for corruption in our elections. I am hopeful that, once  again, this idea of transparency, disclosure, and accountability will  be bipartisan in the Senate when we vote a little bit after noon today.   I will close by way of saying that I come from a State where citizens  have insisted on open government. I have had more than 900 open-to-all  townhall meetings, and the reason why people want them is because they  see that as a path to accountability, and they don't want politics  driven by just campaign donations and big money. They certainly don't  want it to be dark money.   We are going to know a little bit more about Maria Butina here in the  next day or so, but, again, when you have college students setting up  shell companies thousands of miles away from going to college, that  ought to be a wake-up call that the Trump dark money rule makes it more  likely and that we will have more of those shell companies in the days  ahead.   When we vote at 12:15, I urge my colleagues to support Senator  Tester's and my resolution, with the support of many colleagues, like  Senator Whitehouse, who has been a champion on these disclosure issues.  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to remember that these  issues have always been about bipartisanship and to join us in voting  for our proposal that we will vote on shortly after noon.   I yield the floor to Senator Whitehouse and thank him for all his  work on these issues over the years.    Mr. President and colleagues, we have so many waiting to  speak about our friend Chairman Hatch that I am going to be very brief.   If you are to talk about the Chairman's record over the last 42  years, we would be here for months and months on end.   I wish to say, if you had told this body or the country in the winter  of 2017 that you would pass in this Congress a bipartisan 10-year  reauthorization of the Children's Health Insurance Program--we have  plenty of Finance members here--you would have been charged with  hallucinating. People would have said: No way; it couldn't possibly  happen.   If you had said in the winter of 2017 that you were going to pass a  major set of reforms on foster care--reforms that Marian Wright Edelman  of the Children's Defense Fund has been dreaming about for decades-- they would simply have said: That is impossible. It couldn't possibly  happen. You are hallucinating.   Colleagues, listen to this. If you had said in the winter of 2017  that you were going to start a transformation of Medicare with over 50  million seniors--a transformation from a program that traditionally  used to be about acute illness and now is largely about chronic  illness: cancer, diabetes, heart disease, and stroke--if you had said  in 2017 that you were going to transform Medicare to update the  Medicare guarantee to help seniors, once again, they would have said:  Impossible.   Colleagues, that has happened in this Congress because Chairman Hatch  was willing to reach across the aisle, and now millions of kids,  millions of seniors, and families from sea to shining sea for whom the  foster care system didn't work are now going to be able to have a  better path.   I am going to close my remarks--I know so many colleagues want to  speak--by quoting Senator Kennedy. As you know, Senator Kennedy had a  long friendship with Orrin Hatch. In 1981, Chairman Hatch took the  gavel of what was called the Senate Labor and Human Resources  Committee. And I am telling you--the chairman remembers this--Senator  Kennedy and Orrin Hatch got down right away to duking it out. They were  duking it out over labor law and all kinds of things, but they began to  develop a mutual respect. I am going to close by reading what Senator  Kennedy said about Orrin Hatch.   Senator Kennedy said: We are beyond the point where we let our  differences get in the way of opportunities for progress. We have just  learned it is a lot easier to work together than it is to fight each  other.   Senator Kennedy said:         We have differences in terms of perhaps how we achieve the       objectives, but I don't really feel that I have a difference       with Orrin in terms of what the objectives ought to be. If       you build upon that kind of understanding and respect, you       get a lot of things done.    Colleagues, I am telling you, if you look at 2017 and 2018, for the  millions of kids who will benefit from the 10-year Children's Health  Insurance Program, the scores of families who are going to benefit from  the foster care dreams Marian Wright Edelman has been dreaming about,  and the millions of seniors who will benefit from updating the Medicare  guarantee, that came about because Chairman Hatch looked at Senator  Kennedy's words, and he has continued that tradition in the Finance  Committee today. I just want him to know how much we appreciate that  work.   It is going to matter, Mr. Chairman, for millions of people from sea  to shining sea, and I thank you for the opportunity to pursue those  opportunities with you.   I yield the floor, and I look forward to hearing from my colleagues.    Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, the Social Security Administration needs to  get out of the death data business. Unfortunately, S. 2374, the  Stopping Improper Payments to Deceased People Act, moves the issue in  the wrong direction. Under current law, the Social Security  Administration receives death data from the States. SSA shares the  State data with other Federal benefit paying agencies. This bill would  expand the distribution of the State data and burden the Social  Security Administration with responsibilities unrelated to running the  Social Security program. Similar to a musician receiving compensation  each time their song plays on Spotify or Apple Music, the States own  the data, want to control the distribution of the data, and deserve  adequate compensation. Proceeds from the use of State death data helps  maintain State vital records offices. Because the bill would increase  sharing of personal data by the Federal Government at the expense of  States, I will object to any unanimous consent request to proceed to or  pass this bill. I hope the sponsors of this bill will work with the  Finance Committee on this important issue in the future.                            ____________________
