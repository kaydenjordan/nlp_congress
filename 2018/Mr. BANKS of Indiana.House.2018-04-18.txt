 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of  changes to title X family planning funds.   Currently, abortion providers like Planned Parenthood are eligible to  receive these title X funds, but abortion is not family planning; it is  family ending. It ends the lives of innocent children. It is an affront  to the very definition of family.   Title X is Planned Parenthood's second largest funding stream,  providing around $80 million a year. America's largest abortion  provider, which ends over 321,000 lives each year, should never receive  a single dime of taxpayer dollars.   I strongly support efforts to turn off the title X funding stream for  Planned Parenthood, and urge the Department of Health and Human  Services to issue new regulations for the title X program that will  stop funding for programs that include abortion.   Mr. Speaker, there are much better and life-affirming options than  allowing Planned Parenthood access to taxpayer dollars.                            ____________________
