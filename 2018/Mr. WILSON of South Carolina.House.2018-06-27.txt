 Mr. Speaker, South Carolinians extend  sincere thoughts and prayers to State Representative Katie Arrington,  who was injured in a tragic auto accident on Friday. We are grateful to  learn that Katie will make a full recovery.   On June 12, Katie achieved the Republican nomination for Congress for  the historic First District of South Carolina. When successful in  November, she will be the first Republican Federal elected official in  the history of South Carolina, in the tradition of Ambassador Nikki  Haley who was South Carolina's first female Governor in 340 years.   Also, yesterday, Republicans nominated Pamela Evette to be the first  female Republican Lieutenant Governor ever, and Lexington Republicans  selected Paula Rawl Calhoon for the South Carolina State House.   Katie served as an executive with military defense contracts,  ensuring servicemembers will have the tools necessary to succeed. She  is on the board of many organizations, including Women In Defense,  Charleston Defense Contractors Association, and South Carolina Cyber.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.   Congratulations on yesterday's primary victories by Governor Henry  [[Page H5758]]  McMaster, Attorney General Alan Wilson, and congressional nominee  William Timmons.                            ____________________
