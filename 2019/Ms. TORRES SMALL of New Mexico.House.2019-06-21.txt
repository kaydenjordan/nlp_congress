 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor  the life and memory of Alvin Francis Jones, a lifelong New Mexican  judge, lawyer, and community leader.   Born in New Mexico in 1944, Alvin earned a bachelor's degree from New  Mexico Tech and a juris doctor from the University of New Mexico.   He began his career in private practice and was later appointed to  New Mexico's Fifth Judicial District in Roswell, where he served for 19  years, many as chief judge.   During his time on the bench, he founded the local chapters of CASA  to help vulnerable children navigate the State legal system, and  Character Counts, teaching children the value of good character.   After retiring from the bench in 2004, Alvin joined a private  practice, where he specialized in water law.   For me, he was a personal example of character. He had a dogged work  ethic, and he also dedicated time and resources to mentor New Mexicans.   A pillar of the community who was loved by his family and friends  alike, Alvin leaves behind a legacy of selfless service to New Mexico.   We are grateful and will miss him dearly.                            ____________________
