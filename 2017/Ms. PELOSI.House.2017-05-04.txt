 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I thank  him, Congressman Scott, I thank Frank Pallone, John Yarmuth, Ritchie  Neal, our ranking members, who have done such excellent work on this  debate on the values of our country.   Mr. Speaker, our colleague, Mr. Clyburn, began his remarks quoting  Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, and I want to join him. I think those  words bear repeating. Over 50 years ago, Dr. King said: ``Of all of the  forms of inequality, injustice in health care is the most shocking and  the most inhumane because it often results in physical death.''   We come to the floor with the moral force of Dr. Martin Luther King's  words in our hearts: Affordable health care is a civil right, a  fundamental right for every person in our country, not just the  privileged few.   And so, in the spirit of Mr. Clyburn and Dr. King, let us be  prayerful about how we go forward on this very personal issue about the  well-being of every person in our country.   Speaker Ryan once called this bill an act of mercy. There is no mercy  here. Indeed, inequality and inhumanity is exactly what TrumpCare has  in store for the American people. But when he said it is an act of  mercy, here is what others said.   From the beginning, TrumpCare was a moral monstrosity that will  devastate seniors, children, and hardworking Americans. That was from  me. But don't take it from me.   Sister Simone Campbell said: This is not the faithful way forward and  must be rejected.   The Catholic Health Association wrote: We strongly encourage the full  House to reject this replacement bill.   And the United Methodist Church, opposing TrumpCare, this is what  they said: People will die because of efforts like this to roll back  health care.   Lutheran Services in America said: TrumpCare will jeopardize the  health care and long-term services and supports of millions of  Americans.   The Episcopal Church said: TrumpCare falls woefully short of our  spiritual calling to care for the least of these, as well as the noble  values upon which our great Nation was founded.   And all that was said before the Republicans decided to destroy the  protections of Americans with preexisting conditions.   I grant our Republican friends their position. I respect them and  their constituents who sent them here. But I reject the wrong  priorities in TrumpCare--tax cuts for the rich at the expense of the  health insurance for tens of millions of working families across  America.   TrumpCare very clearly spotlights the differences in priorities  between Democrats and Republicans in Congress. It has stepped forward  in the longstanding Republican belief that Medicare should wither on  the vine, that Medicaid should be shrunken, and that Social Security  should be privatized.   If you believe in the health and well-being of the American people,  you must reject this bill before us now. It is what TrumpCare--here is  what it means to the American people. You know, much has been said  about policy here today and over time. Much has been said about  politics, what are the politics of this.   What is really important is what this means to the American people.  And they know they are listening. They know what it means to them.   It means, TrumpCare does, it forces families to pay higher premiums  and deductibles, increasing out-of-pocket costs. Higher costs.   Less coverage. TrumpCare will take away health care from more than 24  million hardworking Americans.   A crushing age tax. TrumpCare forces Americans aged 50 to 64 to pay  premiums five times higher than what others pay for health coverage, no  matter how healthy they are.   It steals from Medicare. TrumpCare shortens the life of the Medicare  trust fund and ransacks funds that seniors depend on to get long-term  care they need. That is why it is consistent with their wither on the  vine for Medicare philosophy.   And then, if that were not bad enough, and they couldn't pass their  bill because it was that bad, they moved further away from the American  people by gutting key protections. TrumpCare eviscerates essential  health benefits such as maternity care, prescription drugs, emergency  coverage, prenatal care, and guts protections for Americans with  preexisting medical conditions.   As bad as TrumpCare was the first time around, you know, it was dead.  It died. It died right here on the floor. Now it has come back to life  like a zombie, even more scary than before, and it is even worse.   If Republicans had their way, Americans with preexisting conditions  will be pushed off their insurance and segregated into high-risk pools,  where they will face soaring costs, worse coverage, and restricted  care.   TrumpCare means huge premium increases. It is a frightening future  for families who need affordable, dependable care the most.   Now, on the floor, the Republicans have recklessly, and some would  say fraudulently, claimed that TrumpCare covers Americans with  preexisting conditions. It does not.   As Robert Graboyes at the conservative Mercatus Center said about the  Upton amendment: ``. . . the $8 billion amount is a pittance. Spread  over 5 years, it is a fifth of a pittance.''   As Karen Pollitz from the Kaiser Family Foundation said, the Upton  [[Page H4165]]  amendment will cover the costs for only 1 percent of the individual  market. Others have given it up to 5 percent; 1 to 5 percent. Does that  mean covering? No.   Forcing a vote without a CBO score shows that the Republicans are  afraid of the facts. They are afraid of learning the full consequences  of their plan to push Americans with preexisting conditions into the  cold or, as my colleague from New York said, off the sidewalk.    If Republicans thought they were really protecting people, they  wouldn't be afraid of the facts. But they are also afraid of the truth,  and the truth that would come forth if we knew the facts. And they are  afraid that the American people would find out that this is not a  healthcare bill, this is a tax bill disguised as a health bill.   This is a bill that is one of the biggest transfers of wealth from  the middle class to the richest people and corporations in America.  This is a tax bill not a healthcare bill. That is why they have to do  it now so they can get on with their tax bill.   But the suffering TrumpCare will inflict on the sick is all too  clear. That is why this disastrous bill has been condemned by the  American Medical Association, the American Cancer Society, the American  Diabetes Association, the American Heart Association, the American Lung  Association, the American Society of Clinical Oncology, the Cystic  Fibrosis Foundation, AIDS United, the Children's Hospital Association,  AARP, the March of Dimes. The list goes on and on--the American Cancer  Society.   Instead of reading all of these pages, I include them for the Record.         Trumpcare--pulled from the House Floor by Speaker Paul Ryan       on March 24--already meant higher health costs, more than 24       million Americans losing their health coverage, gutting key       protections, a crushing Age Tax, and stealing from Medicare.        Amazingly, Republicans have managed to make Trumpcare even       worse. The MacArthur Amendment would completely gut the       protections for people with pre-existing conditions by       allowing states to waive essential health benefits and       community rating rules, which prevent insurers from charging       people with pre-existing conditions more. This will make it       all but impossible for millions of Americans fighting illness       to afford the coverage they desperately need.        As seen below, over the last few days, the number of health       care, consumer, seniors, children, disability and other       groups that are speaking out against Trumpcare continues to       grow.        A Coalition of Patient Advocacy Groups, Including American       Cancer Society, American Heart Association, American Lung       Association, American Diabetes Association, and March of       Dimes: ``In March, our patient advocacy organizations       collectively urged Congress to ensure that any changes made       to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA)       provide affordable, accessible and adequate coverage and do       not result in a loss of coverage for any Americans. The AHCA       would do the opposite, causing at least 24 million Americans       to lose health insurance, according to the non-partisan       Congressional Budget Office. . . . We are alarmed by recent       harmful changes to AHCA . . . These changes include allowing       states to waive the requirement for essential health benefits       . . . Another change allows states to waive protections       against health status rating. Weakening these rules would       enable insurers to charge higher prices to people with pre-      existing conditions, possibly making insurance unaffordable       for those who need it most. . . . The individuals and       families we represent cannot go back to a time when people       with pre-existing conditions could be denied coverage or       forced to choose between purchasing basic necessities and       affording their health care coverage. Given these factors, we       oppose the latest draft of the AHCA. We urge Members of       Congress to reject this legislation.'' [5/1/17]        American Academy of Pediatrics, American College of       Physicians, American Congress of Obstetricians and       Gynecologists, National Association of Nurse Practitioners in       Women's Health, National Partnership for Women & Families:       ``Rather than support recent gains in women's access to       healthcare and coverage, the MacArthur Amendment and AHCA       turn back the clock and reverse hard-won progress. . . . The       MacArthur Amendment would enable states to waive EHBs       including those for maternity and newborn care, preventive       services, and services for mental health and substance use       disorders; [and] to waive community rating rules. . . .       Supporters of the bill claim this bill maintains protections       for those with preexisting conditions, but allowing states to       waive coverage of EHB and charge people more based on their       health status renders the promise of coverage for preexisting       conditions to be meaningless. . . .  Women and families must       not be made to suffer, lose access to care and coverage, and       pay higher healthcare costs. . . . The AHCA and the MacArthur       Amendment turn the clock back on women's health and should       not move forward.'' [5/1/17]        Association of American Medical Colleges: ``This week, the       House could vote on a new version of the American Health Care       Act that includes the MacArthur amendment. . . . The       [MacArthur] amendment's treatment of essential health       benefits and health status underwriting dilutes protections       for many Americans and would leave individuals with       preexisting conditions facing higher premiums and reduced       access to care. The shortcomings in the underlying bill       remain the same. The original analysis from the Congressional       Budget Office indicated that 14 million Americans would lose       their health insurance coverage as early as next year, and as       many as 24 million by 2024. Nothing in the bill has changed       that alters the fact that this legislation would lead to       fewer Americans with quality insurance, less affordable       coverage for those who have it, and the destabilization of       the current Medicaid program.'' [5/2/17]        Children's Hospital Association: ``On behalf of our       nation's children's hospitals and the patients and families       they serve, Children's Hospital Association (CHA) continues       to oppose the newly modified American Health Care Act (AHCA)       and strongly urges the House of Representatives to reject the       bill. Recently adopted changes only worsen the AHCA by       putting children with preexisting conditions at increased       risk of losing health care coverage and failing to correct       the Medicaid cuts that would impact over 30 million kids. . .       . The block grant option in particular would be devastating       to children as it eliminates Medicaid's EPSDT (Early and       Periodic Screening, Diagnostic, and Treatment) benefit which       ensures children receive immunizations, mental health       assessments and vision, eye and hearing exams as well as       other medical services they might need. CHA urgently asks       members of Congress to vote against the AHCA.'' [4/27/17]        Children's Leadership Council: ``The Children's Leadership       Council opposes the American Health Care Act (AHCA) because       it would jeopardize health care for millions of babies,       children, youth and families. We urge you to vote NO on this       legislation. . . . The ACHA's changes to Medicaid would       radically restructure a program that has worked for more than       50 years to support children's health. The Medicaid cap would       shift $839 billion to states, forcing them to cut       eligibility, benefits, or provider rates that could have       disastrous health consequences. There is no question that the       massive cuts to Medicaid, increased premiums likely for       millions of families, and eliminating the Essential Health       Benefits requirements under current law will seriously harm       children and families. . . . This legislation is a dangerous       step backward.'' [5/1/17]        Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities: ``The Consortium       for Citizens with Disabilities (CCD) is strongly opposed to       the amended American Health Care Act. The amended American       Health Care Act retains the original bill's proposals to       dramatically cut Medicaid services that are vital to people       with disabilities and seniors through per capita caps, which       CCD has opposed. . . . The newest amendments to the American       Health Care Act make the bill even more harmful to people       with disabilities. The new amendments would allow states to       easily obtain waivers that would allow them to charge higher       premiums to people with pre-existing conditions, including       people with disabilities. They would also allow states to       seek waivers from the Affordable Care Act's requirement to       provide essential health benefits, including services for       people with disabilities . . . We urge you to oppose the bill       should it come to a vote.'' [4/28/17]        National Education Association: ``Apparently, snatching       health care coverage from children and families was not       enough for House Republican leaders and the Trump       administration. To make a terrible bill even worse, a new       amendment to the American Health Care Act (AHCA) would allow       states to jettison existing essential health benefit       requirements and permit insurance companies to charge people       with pre-existing conditions more than they charge healthy       people. . . . If the AHCA and new amendment are enacted,       millions of kids and families would effectively lose the       health care coverage they need. The new amendment also       threatens to make insurance for people with pre-existing       conditions prohibitively expensive.'' [4/27/17]        American Society of Clinical Oncology: ``On behalf of the       American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), I write to       express our strong opposition to the American Health Care Act       (AHCA), as currently amended. . . . Studies show that when       cancer patients do not have adequate insurance they receive       less care, receive it later, and have worse outcomes than       those with better insurance coverage. . . . The AHCA as       currently constructed will create or worsen barriers to care.       It will add costs to the system, decrease access to       appropriate treatment and increase existing disparities of       care. We are especially concerned with provisions allowing       state waivers that could erode important protections for       people with cancer, including pre-existing condition       safeguards, coverage of essential services, and access to       affordable health insurance. . . . ASCO strongly opposes       passage of the AHCA in its current form.'' [4/27/17]        American Thoracic Society: ``On behalf of the 16,000       members of the American Thoracic Society (ATS), I want to       voice my grave concerns with the latest legislative proposal       developed to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act       (ACA). . . . The ATS opposes any  [[Page H4166]]       legislation that does not ensure affordable health insurance       coverage for Americans currently insured under the ACA. We       are concerned that allowing states to waive important       insurance reforms in the Affordable Care Act will lead to       reduced coverage for many Americans and significant price       increases for patients with preexisting conditions. Further,       we are concerned that reliance on ``high risk pools'' will       not adequately meet the health insurance needs of many       Americans with pre-existing conditions. We note that previous       attempts at implementing state-based high risk pools have       been largely unsuccessful. Members of the ATS serve a large       and diverse patient population, including patients with       respiratory diseases, critical illnesses and sleep disorders       such as asthma, COPD, pneumonia, sepsis and obstructive sleep       apnea. Our patients cannot afford to lose affordable health       insurance coverage for any period of time.'' [4/27/17]        Lutheran Services in America: ``Lutheran Services in       America continues to oppose the drastic and unnecessary       restructure of the Medicaid guarantee to a per capita cap       system as proposed in the American Health Care Act (AHCA).       Furthermore, we oppose the bill's new provisions that       eliminate protections for people with pre-existing conditions       as these provisions would be devastating to people with       chronic diseases and disabilities. . . . In addition, the       modified bill maintains the AHCA's drastic cuts and       fundamental restructuring of the Medicaid program, shifting       significant risks and costs to states, and to the people who       need and provide Medicaid services. . . . Lutheran Services       in America respectfully urges members of Congress to reject       this or any legislation that would erode Medicaid, increase       the number of uninsured and/or decrease protections for       preexisting conditions.'' [4/28/17]        Planned Parenthood Federation of America: ``The latest       Republican proposal to repeal the Affordable Care Act is the       worst legislation for women's health in a lifetime. It       eliminates the community rating provision, allowing insurers       to charge people with pre-existing conditions an exorbitant       amount for coverage. Despite the fact that the proposal       claims to maintain the current prohibition on gender rating,       it still allows insurers to once again discriminate against       women and charge more for being a woman. Eliminating the       community rating provision disproportionately affects women,       since insurers can claim having given birth, having had a C-      section, or having been a survivor of domestic violence is a       so-called pre-existing condition. For example, a woman who       had breast cancer could be charged more than $28,000 per year       for coverage and a woman who was previously pregnant could be       charged more than $17,000 per year for . . . They took a bad       bill that would result in 24 million people losing their       insurance and higher premiums and actually made it worse. [4/      27/17]        Federal AIDS Policy Partnership: ``The undersigned 77       organizations are writing to strongly urge you to oppose the       amended American Health Care Act (AHCA) on behalf of the 24       million or more Americans estimated to lose coverage,       including tens of thousands of people with HIV. . . .       Healthcare coverage can be a life or death issue for people       living with HIV, and in the three years that the Patient       Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) coverage has been       available it has made a critical difference. . . . We cannot       afford to go back to the pre-ACA sick care system that       focused on treating disability and disease rather than       preventing it. Please support access to healthcare coverage       for the more than 52 million Americans living with pre-      existing conditions, including 1.1 million living with HIV.       We hope we can count on you to oppose the amended American       Health Care Act.'' [5/1/17]        AIDS United: ``AIDS United seeks a health care system that       will eventually enable the end of HIV in the United States.       AHCA makes major changes to the U.S. health care system that       would, if passed, worsen the provision of HIV prevention       services for people at risk for HIV and the treatment and       care for people living with HIV. . . . AIDS United is       especially concerned that the [MacArthur] amendment, far from       improving the situation, will make it easier for insurance       companies to raise rates on people living with HIV, people       with other chronic conditions and the elderly. . . . AIDS       United notes that thanks to Congress's strong response over       many years, the U.S. has made substantial progress in       responding to the HIV epidemic. However, doing so requires a       strong health care system that can ensure that people living       with HIV are able to access care and treatment . . . H.R.       1628 will reverse some of the gains that we have made in       ensuring coverage for both prevention and treatment. AIDS       United urges you to decide to vote no and publicly state       your position prior to any vote.'' [4/28/17]        American College of Nurse-Midwives: ``On behalf of the       American College of Nurse-Midwives, . . . we strongly urge       the House of Representatives to vote NO on the revised       American Health Care Act (ACHA). The legislation, in its       current form, would further impeded access to healthcare and       coverage for millions of women and newborns. Midwives stand       for improving access to quality care and coverage for women       and newborns . . . including, but not limited to, coverage       and access to a full range of preventative, reproductive and       sexual health services under state Medicaid programs and       coverage and access to essential health benefits (EHBs),       including maternity and newborn care. The newly-revised AHCA       language will end this guarantee and radically turn back the       clock on the progress made in women's health. Specifically,       the ``MacArthur Amendment'' would enable states to apply for       the ability to waive EHBs, including those for maternity and       newborn care, to waive community rating rules, and to shift       patient with preexisting conditions or illnesses into high-      risk pools. These provisions, if adopted, could have dire       consequences for women's health and health coverage.'' [4/27/      17]        AARP: ``This harmful legislation still puts an Age Tax on       older Americans and puts vulnerable populations at risk       through a series of backdoor deals that attempt to shift       responsibility to states. Older Americans need affordable       health care services and prescriptions. This legislation       still goes in the opposite direction, increasing insurance       premiums for older Americans and not doing anything to lower       drug costs. AARP continues to oppose legislation that would       impose an Age Tax, eliminate protections for pre-existing       conditions, weaken Medicare, erode seniors' ability to live       independently because of billions of dollars in Medicaid       cuts, and give sweetheart deals to drug and insurance       companies while doing nothing to lower the cost of health       care or prescription drugs. We intend to let all 38 million       of our members know exactly how their Representative votes on       this bill in newsletters, in our publications, on social       media and in other formats.'' [4/26/17]        American Medical Association: ``After reviewing the       MacArthur Amendment to H.R. 1628, the American Health Care       Act (AHCA), the American Medical Association (AMA) remains       opposed to passage of this legislation. As we have previously       stated, we are deeply concerned that the AHCA would result in       millions of Americans losing their current health insurance       coverage. Nothing in the MacArthur amendment remedies the       shortcomings of the underlying bill. The MacArthur Amendment       would allow states to apply for waivers for critical consumer       protections provided in the Affordable Care Act (ACA),       including . . . . the requirements that health insurers must       cover certain essential health benefits, and the ban on       health status underwriting. The current ban on health status       underwriting protects individuals from being discriminated       against by virtue of their medical conditions. Prior to the       passage of the ACA, such individuals were routinely denied       coverage and/or priced out of affordable coverage. We are       particularly concerned about allowing states to waive this       requirement because it will likely lead to patients losing       their coverage.'' [4/27/17]        American College of Physicians: ``The College strongly       believes in the first, do no harm principle. Therefore, we       continue to urge that Congress move away from the       fundamentally flawed and harmful policies that would result       from the American Health Care Act and from the changes under       consideration--including the proposed ``Limited Waiver''       amendment--that would make the bill even worse for       patients.'' [4/24/17]        American Hospital Association: ``The latest version of the       AHCA continues to put health coverage in jeopardy for many       Americans. Our top concern is what this change could mean for       older and sicker patients, including those with pre-existing       conditions, such as cancer patients and those with chronic       conditions. For these reasons, along with our previously       stated concerns about the AHCA, we cannot support the bill. .       . . The amendment proposed this week would dramatically       worsen the bill. The changes included put consumer       protections at greater risk by allowing states to waive the       essential health benefit standards, which could leave       patients without access to critical health services and       increase out-of-pocket spending. This could allow plans to       set premium prices based on individual risk for some       consumers, which could significantly raise costs for those       with pre-existing conditions.'' [4/27/17]        America's Essential Hospitals: ``This latest version of the       AHCA is not an improvement. It's simply bad policy that will       cut a lifeline of health care for millions of Americans. The       legislation also would leave unchanged more than $800 billion       in Medicaid cuts over the next decade, breaking the nation's       safety net and saddling state, local governments, and       taxpayers with new costs for indigent care. The nation has       spoken on the AHCA: only 17 percent of the public support it       and their elected representatives have rejected it once       already.'' [4/26/17]        Catholic Health Association: ``It is critically important       to look at this bill for what it is. It is not in any way a       health care bill. Rather, it is legislation whose aim is to       take significant funding allocated by Congress for health       care for very low income people and use that money for tax       cuts for some of our wealthiest citizens. This is contrary to       the spirit of who we are as a nation, a giant step backward       that should be resisted.'' [4/27/17]        U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops: ``It is deeply       disappointing to many Americans that, in modifying the       American Health Care Act to again attempt a vote, proponents       of the bill left in place its serious flaws, including       unacceptable modifications to Medicaid that will endanger       coverage and affordability for millions of people, according       to reports,'' said Bishop Dewane. ``Sadly, some of the       recently proposed amendments--especially those designed to       give states flexibility--lack apparent safeguards to ensure       quality of care. These additions could severely impact many       people with pre-existing  [[Page H4167]]       conditions while risking for others the loss of access to       various essential coverages.'' [4/27/17]        American Nurses Association: ``The new bill is an even       further departure from our principles; endangers consumer       protections put into place by the ACA. [4/26/17]        American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network: ``The       American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network (ACS CAN) is       deeply concerned about a proposed amendment to the American       Health Care Act (AHCA) that would create an option for states       to obtain waivers from the Essential Health Benefits (EHB)       and the community rating rule. These two rules work together       to guarantee access to comprehensive and affordable insurance       that covers cancer prevention and treatment for patients and       survivors with pre-existing conditions. . . . In short, the       proposal could lead to bare bones coverage plans that push       significant costs onto patients who access care.'' [4/20/17]        American Lung Association: ``The American Lung Association       requests that Representatives oppose the American Health Care       Act (AHCA) with the new amendment by Rep. MacArthur. The       American Lung Association opposes the MacArthur amendment       because would allow states to opt-out of the Essential Health       Benefits (EHB)--resulting in millions of Americans having       inadequate care. . . . All Americans--regardless of the state       in which they live--need adequate coverage for the range of       essential health services and treatments including life-      saving cancer screening.'' [4/26/17]        March of Dimes: ``Women and children need quality,       affordable insurance coverage to be born healthy and lead       healthy, productive lives. Unfortunately, in its current       form, the MacArthur amendment to American Health Care Act       will deny millions of pregnant women, babies, and their       families the affordable coverage and quality services they       need. . . . The MacArthur amendment will offer states and       health plans numerous opportunities to charge people with       pre-existing conditions higher rates, design plans that       explicitly exclude the services they are most likely to need,       and erect barriers to care.'' [4/26/17]        Families USA: ``America's families must be heard. By now,       it should be clear to House Republicans and the Trump       Administration from all the town halls, letters, phone calls       and tweets that this is not what people want. They do not       want to return to the dark days when insurers were free to       charge the sick and old more for coverage and offered       policies that covered very little, often leaving people to       cope with staggering medical bills. It's time for President       Trump and the GOP to drop this harmful effort to undermine       the nation's health care system. It's time to move on.'' [4/      26/17]        American Psychological Association: ``We are writing on       behalf of the American Psychological Association and the       American Psychological Association Practice Organization to       express our opposition to the American Health Care Act, as       recently revised and proposed for floor consideration. Our       organizations comprise nearly 115,700 members and affiliates,       who are clinicians, researchers, educators, consultants, and       students.'' [4/26/17]        Arc of the United States: ``The Arc of the United States is       strongly opposed to the amended American Health Care Act. The       amended American Health Care Act retains the original bill's       proposals to dramatically cut Medicaid services that are       vital to people with disabilities and seniors through per       capita caps. The new amendments make the AHCA even more       harmful to people with disabilities.'' [4/26/17]        Chronic Illness and Disability Partnership: ``On behalf of       the Chronic Illness and Disability Partnership as well as       allied organizations, we are writing to strongly urge you to       oppose the American Health Care Act (AHCA), with or without       the amendment to allow states to waive community rating and       Essential Health Benefits protections (the MacArthur       Amendment). If enacted, the amended bill will only increase       the 24 million Americans estimated to lose coverage under the       AHCA, including millions of individuals living with chronic       conditions and disabilities. The MacArthur Amendment seeks to       deliver cheaper insurance to healthy Americans by       undercutting crucial Essential Health Benefits requirements       and excluding the most vulnerable Americans from the private       insurance market by allowing states to remove crucial       consumer protections.'' [4/27/17]        Democratic Governors Association: ``This new proposal is       nothing more than the reheated leftovers of the failed       Trumpcare bill. Just like last month's bill, this one would       slash Medicaid funding, throw millions out of health coverage       and leave states holding the bag. The only fresh idea in this       proposal is a new way to raise insurance rates on sick       people. States are happy to work with the federal government       on strengthening health care, but we never asked for the       flexibility to jack up premiums on people with pre-existing       conditions. Congress should again reject this disastrous       proposal that would wreck state budgets and cut millions off       of health coverage.'' [4/27/17]        National Nurse United: ``The original version of the       American Health Care Act posed a mortal threat to the health       and well-being of our patients, and to the health security of       our country. The new version, which incorporates changes       negotiated between the House Freedom Caucus and Congressman       Tom MacArthur, will be even worse for our patients. This new       version has not yet received a score from the Congressional       Budget Office, and it should not be considered by the House       until a CBO score has been made public.'' [4/26/17]        Leadership Council of Aging Organizations: ``While LCAO is       made up of organizations that often have different       perspectives on public policies, as a coalition LCAO strongly       opposes the American Health Care Act (AHCA) of 2017, which       would cause at least 24 million Americans to lose their       health care insurance. We strongly oppose the Medicaid cuts       and caps that remain the core of the American Health Care       Act. Over six million older adults rely on Medicaid. Among       the non-Medicare population, Americans aged 50-64 are the       most likely to face health challenges and have pre-existing       conditions. The AHCA will expose these older Americans to       significantly higher premiums and health care costs, if they       can afford to purchase coverage at all. We are also deeply       disappointed that there is a push to vote on the bill without       a revised estimate from the Congressional Budget Office on       how it will impact Americans. We fear and expect that the       proposed changes will increase the number of uninsured beyond       the current estimate of 24 million. For these reasons, as       well as other harms that would result for older Americans and       their families, LCAO opposes AHCA and urges members to vote       against it.''        Common Sense Kids Action: ``On behalf of the millions of       American kids and families who rely on comprehensive,       dependable health insurance to stay healthy and to get       medical treatment when they need it, we are writing to       respectfully express our strong opposition to your bill, H.R.       1628, the American Health Care Act (AHCA). Thanks to current       law, including the Affordable Care Act, Medicaid, and the       Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), 95% of young       children in the U.S. today have health insurance. That's a       remarkable achievement. However, the AHCA will result in 24       million fewer Americans having coverage, including millions       of children. Even with changes recently suggested to your       bill, America's kids will be best served by strengthening the       Affordable Care Act and preserving Medicaid and CHIP, not by       repealing the Affordable Care Act and block granting or       establishing a per capita cap on Medicaid. We urge you to       keep our children's future foremost in your thinking,       withdraw your bill, and work on a bipartisan basis to support       measures that protect and strengthen children's health       care.''        American Hospital Association: ``The latest version of the       AHCA continues to put health coverage in jeopardy for many       Americans. Our top concern is what this change could mean for       older and sicker patients, including those with pre-existing       conditions, such as cancer patients and those with chronic       conditions. For these reasons, along with our previously       stated concerns about the AHCA, we cannot support the bill.       The amendment proposed this week would dramatically worsen       the bill. The changes included put consumer protections at       greater risk by allowing states to waive the essential health       benefit standards, which could leave patients without access       to critical health services and increase out-of-pocket       spending. Additionally, the Congressional Budget Office has       not yet scored the amendment. However, CBO previously       projected that the AHCA would result in 24 million fewer       people covered in 2026. As the backbone of America's health       safety-net, hospitals and health systems must protect access       to care for those who need it and ensure that the most       vulnerable patients are not left behind. The AHCA continues       to fall far short of that goal.''     Mr. Speaker, under TrumpCare, families, seniors,  vulnerable children, Americans with disabilities, people struggling to  overcome addiction, and the sick will lose their health care. Rural  hospitals will be closed. Nearly 2 million jobs will be destroyed  across America. Seven million veterans will lose access to tax credits  for health care.   And all of this, to give a massive tax cut to the richest in America.  TrumpCare is a billionaire's tax cut, again, disguised as a healthcare  bill. It is Robin Hood in reverse, one of the largest, again, transfers  of wealth from working families to the rich in our country.   Today, we honor the visions of our Founders, we can, who risked  everything. They risked everything, their lives, their liberty, their  sacred honor, to advance the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of  happiness; the life, a healthier life, the freedom to pursue your  happiness, the freedom from being job-locked or policy-locked because  of what the Republicans want to do today.   Today, we fight to preserve affordable health care as the right of  every American, again, not the privileged few.   Today, we fight for children like Zoe Madison Lihn. Zoe was born with  a congenital heart defect in May of 2010. She faced her first of three  heart surgeries at 15 hours old. By 6 months old, Zoe was halfway to  her lifetime limit her insurer had placed on her. She  [[Page H4168]]  faced a grim future, not only using up her lifetime limit by preschool  but by carrying a preexisting condition that will require attention and  care for the rest of her life.   Under the Affordable Care Act, Zoe is protected, but TrumpCare puts  her future in danger.   I wish that our Members who vote for this bill, I hope you make time  to sit down with the parents of a newborn with a heart condition, or a  young woman who just learned she had breast cancer, the family of loved  ones struggling with a disease or a chronic condition, any of the tens  of millions of Americans who are rightfully terrified of what TrumpCare  will mean in their lives.   Mr. Speaker, we have, with this bill, a right, a wonderful  opportunity. This is one of the best civics lessons we can engage in.  Because of what happened following the election, the American people  are engaged. They are paying attention. I am not saying in a political  way, I am saying in a personal way.   A former Speaker said: All politics is local. In the case of health  care, all politics is personal when it comes to health care. And so,  this civics lesson will teach the American people a number of things.   As special as we think we are when we come to the floor here, most  Americans don't know who their Member of Congress is. But they will  now, when they find out that you voted to take away their health care.  They will know when you put an age tax on them, or undermine Medicare  and Medicaid and the rest.   Oh, yeah, they are paying attention because it is really personal  with them and their families. So I think we have to get ready for that.   I have Members, I have colleagues who have the mantle of being a  moderate. You vote for this bill, you have walked the plank from  moderate to radical. And you are walking the plank for what? A bill  that will not be accepted by the United States Senate. Why are you  doing this?   Do you believe in what is in this bill?   Some of you have said: Well, they will fix it in the Senate. But you  have every provision of this bill tattooed on your forehead. You will  glow in the dark on this one. You will glow in the dark. So don't walk  the plank, especially unnecessarily.   Our responsibility to the sick and the hurt is Biblical. It is  fundamental to who we are.   As Pope Francis said: ``Health is not a consumer good but a universal  right, so access to health services cannot be a privilege.''   Today, let us declare, once again, that affordable health care must  be the right of every American, not the privileged few.   So I ask you, my colleagues, does TrumpCare lower health costs?   Does TrumpCare provide better health care?   Does TrumpCare protect seniors and families?   Is TrumpCare good for our veterans?   Is there any caring in TrumpCare at all?   For the sake of our values, to honor our responsibilities to our  Founders, life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, to our veterans  who protect us, and to our children whose aspirations are our guide, I  urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this disastrous TrumpCare bill.
