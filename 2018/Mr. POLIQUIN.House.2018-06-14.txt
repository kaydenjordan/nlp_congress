 Mr. Speaker, Maine is a big small town. Our population  is only 1.3 million people, and it seems like everybody, Mr. Speaker,  knows everybody else. But this opioid epidemic has devastated so many  of our families in the great State of Maine, including having a big  impact on my own.   Every day, one Mainer dies from an opioid epidemic up in our great  State. We must continue to battle this devastating scourge on our  population, and it must be all hands on deck.   Several months ago, Congress appropriated $4 billion back to the  States for increased law enforcement and early education and for  recovery programs, but there is so much more, Mr. Speaker, that needs  to be done. That is why this week I am so proud that the House of  Representatives passed, with a big bipartisan vote, the Safe Disposal  of Unused Medication Act. This allows hospice workers to safely dispose  of unused opioids and other powerful medications so that they don't  fall into the wrong hands.   I am grateful, Mr. Speaker, for all Democrats and Republicans here in  D.C. and back in Maine who helped give our families more security. We  have got to stay on the offense and battle this epidemic until we have  won.                            ____________________
