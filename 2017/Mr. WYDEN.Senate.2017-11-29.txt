 Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, a number of Senators have been inquiring as  to what will happen next with respect to the handling of the tax  legislation. My sense is that, in a relatively short period of time,  the Senate will be voting on the motion to proceed to this legislation.  I just want to take a couple of minutes to talk about why I am going to  oppose the motion to proceed.   The fact is, right now, on a topic that will involve $10 trillion  worth of tax policy changes--the biggest change in the Tax Code in 31  years when the U.S. Senate votes on the motion to proceed--we,  essentially, will not know yet what the Senate will be debating. There  are rumors; there are whispers, but the fact is, as the ranking  Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, which has authority over  taxes, I haven't seen the text of the bill that we will actually be  debating.   The bill seems to have changed practically every half hour. It has  certainly been a moveable feast for the super lobbyists, but there are  a couple things we already do know. We know, for example, it is not  going to give a fair shake to working families. What we have talked  about again and again in the Senate is that the Senate leadership is  committed to a double standard with respect to the American economy:  temporary breaks for the middle class--they vanish in a few years--and  permanent breaks for those at the top.   We can do better than this. The middle class is responsible for 70  percent of the economic activity in our economy. They are the ones who  buy the cars, who buy the houses. They send kids to childcare. Instead,  many of them certainly fairly soon are going to be further in the hole  than they already are.   So this is a piece of legislation, both on the substance, from the  standpoint of what my colleagues have been talking about in terms of  the double standard--I mean, we already have in our economy essentially  two tax systems, one for the cops, the nurses, autoworkers, and timber  workers. Their tax system is compulsory. Their taxes come right out of  their paycheck. There are no Cayman Island deals for them. The people  at the top pay what they want when they want to. The reality is, what  it looks like we are going to get--as I say, I don't have the details-- is going to make this work.   So a number of Senators have asked, for example, about the  passthrough provisions, important to small business. We don't have the  details on that. We have Members who care about how we are actually  going to not rack up hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of debt in  the years ahead. Some Senators have suggested that there be triggers. I  happen to think they are gimmicks in all of the approaches I have  heard. They just don't seem to add up. We don't have the details on  that.   What we do know--and I know there are several other Senators who  would like to speak--is, we have never had negotiations in the Senate  Finance Committee over the specifics of this legislation or any other.  We have never had a legislative hearing. When Ronald Reagan and  Democrats got together in 1986, they had more than 20 of these  hearings.   I will just tell my colleagues in the Senate, Bill Bradley, the  former Knick and basketball great who was on the Finance Committee--and  I like to kid colleagues that he was another tall Democrat on the  committee with a much better jump shot than I--he always would tell  stories about how he would fly across the country to meet with  Republicans to talk about the specifics of tax reform. Back then,  Senators went to great lengths to talk to each other about the  specifics of tax reform. In this instance, the majority hasn't been  willing to even walk down the corridor of the Dirksen Senate Office  Building to talk about the specifics of tax reform.   The Senate is better than this. I was part of the bipartisan group  yesterday, and Senator Donnelly, our colleague from Indiana, really set  out what became an outpouring of good faith among something like 17  Senators who said we can find common ground here. I happen to know we  can find common ground here because with two Senators, who happen to be  very close to the distinguished majority leader, Mitch McConnell, I  wrote two full bipartisan Federal income tax reform bills--my former  colleagues, Senator Gregg and Senator Coats.   We can do this. This is what the Senators said yesterday. We can find  common ground. There is not a Senator here who doesn't agree that the  Tax Code is a rotting economic carcass. It is a dysfunctional mess.  Every single Senator understands it is broken. Since it has been 30  years since the last reform, there have been scores of changes to the  Tax Code that really cause as much confusion as they do benefits. So I  know we can do this. That is what Democratic Senators said yesterday.  They said we want to work together in a group led by our colleagues  Senator Manchin and Senator Kaine, who brought us together.   So we are going to vote, and I think it is going to be soon, on a  motion to proceed. I would just tell Senators, as of right now, we  don't yet know what the Senate is going to be debating, and on those  crucial issues I just mentioned, we still don't have any information.  Yesterday, the Joint Committee on Taxation told me they hoped to have  what the Republicans said was the essence of why their bill works: a  dynamic score of the tax legislation. We haven't seen that either.   I hope our colleagues will vote no on the motion to proceed because I  don't think it is too much to say that as Senators, when we are talking  about going to a bill that involves $10 trillion worth of tax policy  changes in the Senate, we ought to know what the Senate will actually  be debating.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I call up the motion that I have at the  desk.    Mr. President, I listened to the remarks of my colleague,  the distinguished Senator from Wyoming, and he said there were 70  hearings on taxes. I think it is important that the American people  know that there was not one single hearing--not one--on this bill.  There were no discussions of the specific provisions in this  legislation. There was no hearing on the personal responsibility  requirement in the Affordable Care Act, which is so essential to that  law and to what we ought to be looking at strengthening in the years  ahead with respect to cost containment. So I just want to set the  record straight right at the outset of the debate. Since I have heard  once again that there were 70 hearings, I think it is important that  the American people know that there was not one on this bill.   Contrast this to 1986, when Democrats and Republicans got together  and there were more than 20 hearings--more than 20 discussions on  specifics about how to work together and find common ground on this  enormously important issue.   The Senate is 20 hours of debate away from a broken promise of truly  historic proportions. This was supposed to be the year that the working  people of America regained a powerful voice in Washington. Instead of a  strong voice, what they got was a big con job. If this Republican tax  bill passes, Washington is going to reach into the pockets of working  Americans and cut a big check to multinational corporations, to tax  cheats, and to the politically powerful and well connected.   The bill before the Senate would enshrine an economic double standard  that makes permanent second-class treatment of Americans who work hard  and do their best day in and day out to provide for their families. For  the cops, for the nurses, for the mechanics, and for those who work  retail, this Republican tax plan is a big gamble. They don't get any  special tax dodges--no Cayman Islands deals for them. Those folks are  stuck clinging to the hope that they will not be among the millions hit  with an immediate tax hike. Even for those lucky Americans who do see  some benefit, there is bad news coming down the pike. All they get out  of this Republican plan is the fleeting sugar high of temporary tax  cuts.   That is not the case, though, for multinational corporations or  powerful high fliers who wield big political power in this town. Under  this tax plan, the basic message to them is this: You can pay what you  want, when you want, and, if you are lucky--really lucky--you may pay  hardly anything at all. That certainly is not what working people were  promised in the fall 2016 campaign. That is not what Republicans have  spent month after month telling Americans their tax plan would do. The  Republican rhetoric doesn't match the reality of this tax plan, and  every day we get frightening news reports about the harm it is going to  do to working people and the middle class.   Just yesterday, I received a letter from the independent  congressional tax experts known as the Joint Committee on Taxation, and  they gave us really important information about the bill. Buried in one  of those answers was information that ought to put a scare into  millions of Americans who work hard every day to get ahead. This bill  showers trillions of dollars on multinational corporations, but the  fact is, these multinational corporations are already awash in cash.  What it means, according to these independent congressional tax  experts, is that interest rates are going up. The Federal Reserve will  have to tighten the screws of the economy.   But here is the bottom line for what it means for a middle-class  American in North Carolina, or Oregon, or anywhere else in the United  States: If you want to buy a house, this bill is going to make it more  expensive. If you want to buy a car, this bill is going to make it more  expensive. If you want to get a credit card, this bill is going to make  it more expensive. If you want to take out a student loan, this bill is  going to make it more expensive.   It is not just harm for typical families. The cost of doing business  is going to rise for the brewery owner or the tool-and-die maker who  wants to build a new facility or purchase new equipment. They would  like to hire new workers, but they will find that the money they need  to do it is getting drained by higher interest rates.   In short, higher interest rates will wipe out the benefits of this  bill for a lot of small businesses and add pain to the tax hikes that  are going to hit millions of families. The only businesses and  individuals who will not feel the effects I just described are those  sitting on mountains of cash--those who will never need to borrow to  get ahead. That is just one of the latest of truly frightening details  about what this destructive bill would do.   If there was any doubt remaining, it is clear based on those tax  experts that individual working Americans and families are going to be  on the hook for handouts to multinational corporations.   Republicans have spent months shouting from the hilltops that they  were bringing jobs back. The President made it a centerpiece of his  campaign. Jobs are coming home, he said. Corporations that ship jobs  overseas are going to be punished. The plight of so many mill and  factory towns is over. It is too bad that those talking points from  stump speeches and interviews never made it into the proposals on  paper, because the tax plan that is actually before the Senate does the  opposite.   Under the new notion of taxes for American companies overseas called  the territorial system, corporations will get a bigger tax cut if they  lay off their American workers here in the United States, pack up, and  move abroad. It creates colossal new loopholes, a true bonanza of new  tax gifts for the tax cheats, for the people who have sophisticated  help to cut corners.   When it comes to international tax rules, my view is that the United  States shouldn't get suckered into a race to the bottom with a bunch of  no-tax, resort-lined islands to please the tax avoidance industry and  their lobbyists. That is a truly expensive competition in terms of  taxpayer dollars and jobs, but this Republican plan forces working  Americans to pay up.   The tax experts we rely on here in the Congress make it clear that  the Republican corporate tax scheme loses  [[Page S7396]]  revenue, but the individual tax changes raise revenue. That is a whole  lot of tax lingo for saying that working people are going to get  fleeced so that multinational corporations can pay a lot less.   Here is how it is going to work. More and more Americans will face a  tax hike with every passing year. Stealthy tax tricks will force people  into higher tax brackets over time, heaping a heavier burden on their  shoulders. Millions of working Americans are going to lose their  healthcare and the tax credits that make insurance affordable for them  and their family. Put all together, it is an immense amount of money  being taken from people who are already walking an economic tightrope-- an economic tightrope in North Carolina and Oregon and everywhere  else--where they balance food costs against the fuel bill and the fuel  bill against the cost of housing. An immense amount of money is being  taken from them and being handed to multinational corporations that  ship jobs overseas.   This is not a plan to create red, white, and blue jobs. This is not a  plan to turn the lights back on in factories that went dark many years  ago. This is a plan to sell out millions of Americans--American workers  and their families--and the damage will get even worse when the deficit  climbs into the stratosphere.   As I begin to touch on the deficit, I want to note that it didn't  have to be this way. I wrote two fully bipartisan Federal income tax  reform bills with our colleagues. I believe they were here before the  Senator from North Carolina joined us: Dan Coats, now the head of  national intelligence, and Judd Gregg, the former Republican chair of  the Budget Committee. The three of us--Senator Gregg first, then  Senator Coats--made changes to ensure that American companies could be  competitive for red, white, and blue jobs. We understood that you had  to have a competitive rate to grow those companies. But we certainly  didn't create new breaks for shipping jobs overseas, and--because I am  going to touch on the deficit now--our proposal was revenue neutral.   So it didn't have to be this way. That is what Senator Manchin and  Senator Kaine said yesterday, along with 17 Democrats. We wanted a  bipartisan alternative that didn't create new incentives for shipping  jobs overseas and that didn't jack up the deficit, but I certainly was  surprised when I saw early on that Senate Republicans, who had given so  many speeches on their concern about the deficit, said: It is kind of  OK with us if we have a net deficit of $1.5 trillion. And as the Joint  Committee on Taxation has essentially indicated to me, it would be  higher than that.   All of the deficit hawks in the Republican Party just flew away. That  was surprising because it seems like just yesterday when the Congress  couldn't buy lunch without a whole cast of Republican deficit hawks  doing some pretty serious hollering about the deficit. But based on  history, what is coming next is pretty predictable. We have seen the  movie before. The deficit hawks come flying back after ideas like the  one we are looking at in the Senate become law. We have already heard  the Speaker say, what is next? Entitlement reform, which means  Medicare, Medicaid, and anti-hunger programs.   The Speaker said that is what is next. That is next on the docket.  Everybody listening ought to know that is code for attack, and it is  multiple fronts on these kinds of programs for the most vulnerable  people in our country--the lifeline programs, the safety net programs I  have just described. What we are going to hear, because this is the  script from earlier movies, is we have these big deficits. Oh, my  goodness. There is a lot of red ink. America can't afford the safety  net. They will say we have to do something. Instead of being willing to  go after the people at the top, history says the people who really face  the burden of those deficit reductions are the most vulnerable.   The first big legislative push after the Bush tax cuts, for example,  was an all-out assault on Social Security. The fact that it was stopped  doesn't mean Medicare or Medicaid or other safety net programs like  Social Security are going to be safe this time around.   The policy on offer, in my view, is simply a disaster. It makes a  mockery of the approach Ronald Reagan took with a big group of  Democrats. I know so many of my colleagues on the other side of the  aisle admire President Reagan greatly. This bill is the opposite of  what President Reagan did.   What President Reagan did is he said to those big multinational  corporations: I have to ask you to give up some money in order to make  sure the middle class, the individual ratepayer, will get a fair shake.   This is just the opposite--180 degrees away from what Ronald Reagan  did. We are going to have an amendment on the middle class pretty soon,  but what could be more stark than the fact that the tax cuts for the  multinationals are permanent, and the relief for the middle class is  temporary. This bill is the opposite, the total opposite, of what  Ronald Reagan worked on in 1986.   Our colleague Senator Enzi--and I have worked with him often, and I  am sad to see us have such differing views on this--said we have had 70  hearings. I can tell you, the once storied Senate Finance Committee  never even attempted once to craft a bipartisan bill. We said for  months that was our preference. That was what was stated in the letter  the vast majority of Senate Democrats signed. That is what we said when  we were invited to the White House to meet with the President. We said  it repeatedly.   I mentioned the two bills I wrote. They are the only two bipartisan  Federal income tax reform bills--the only two we have had since 1986.  By the way, they didn't go as far as Ronald Reagan went. Ronald Reagan,  in 1986, said, for purposes of taxes, a dollar is a dollar is a dollar.   We are going to have the same rate for those who make money on  investments that we do for those cops and nurses who get that wage,  that ordinary income. I have indicated on the floor that Senator  Bradley, former New York Knick--and as I like to say, another tall  Democrat who served on the Senate Finance Committee with a much better  jump shot than mine--is incredulous at this process. He is just slack- jawed when he asks about what is being done to bring both sides  together. Senator Bradley, and others on the Republican side, in 1986,  flew all over the United States to get together with senior Republicans  and Jim Baker, Richard Dorman, and others to talk about the specifics  of getting bipartisan tax reform together. You hear the stories, and  you see that is the way you tackle an issue like this. Bill Bradley  flew all over the country to work with Republicans to get a bipartisan  tax reform bill. Right now, the majority on the Senate Finance  Committee wouldn't walk down the corridor of the Dirksen building once  to talk about anything resembling how we would put together a  bipartisan proposal. So the process we have seen here makes a mockery  out of Reagan-style reform.   Some have asked, was this foreordained, did it have to be. I have  already made it clear that I don't think it had to be. It is hard work  putting together a bipartisan bill. Senator Gregg, for example, when he  was in the Senate, I think was one of Leader McConnell's top economic  advisers--chairman of the Budget Committee. We used to say in our  house, Judd Gregg is scary smart. We sat next to each other in chairs  in our office for almost 2 years to put together a bill. It is heavy  lifting, but it can be done. A lot of that work was brought into other  efforts since then--the question of the Bush proposal, bipartisan  commissions, or a variety of other ones. It is pretty hard to do when  the majority leader says, on the first day, the very first day out, we  are going to use the most partisan process--budget reconciliation and,  in effect, say: What we are telling the other party is we don't want  your ideas because we don't need your votes. Sometimes it got almost a  little ridiculous because I know there were times when statements were  made by the Republican leadership that no Democrats were interested in  bipartisan tax reform, despite the fact that in the few instances where  a White House official would call and ask our opinion, Senate Democrats  would meet. That was the point of the press conference that was  held yesterday with 17 Democrats from various parts of the country, as  well as legislation I have described that was written.    By the way, in the work product Republicans finally produced, they  took  [[Page S7397]]  some of the ideas from the bipartisan bills; for example, increasing  the standard deduction, but we tripled the standard deduction without  any takeaways, like the State and local deduction or the permanent  exemptions, and what that meant is, in the bipartisan bills, if you  passed something like that, people adjust their wages, and immediately  working-class folks get hundreds and hundreds of dollars more in every  paycheck. Not only were there no discussions--and I have seen  Republican Senators stand out on the floor sometimes and hold up a  sign: What we are doing is the Wyden-Coats bill. Nothing could be  further from the truth, whether it is on the international provisions I  mentioned or the personal provisions. I was so proud to stand with  Senate Democrats in a meeting yesterday put together by Senators  Manchin and Kaine, once again, stating that it doesn't have to be this  way.   What is the rush to take taxes for multinational corporations from 35  to 20 percent? Back when I was working with Senator Gregg and Senator  Coats, the Republicans, we didn't have multinational corporations  saying we should go to 20 percent. The difference between 25 and 20  percent is $500 billion.   My colleagues yesterday were saying--moderate Democrats--we are  serious about tax reform, both on the individual and the corporate  side, but it ought to be based on bipartisan give-and-take, not  something like we have seen.   Republicans in Congress and the administration's top salesmen have  spent months and months telling the American people that in the long  run, their bill is going to pay for itself with explosive growth. They  had cheerleaders, those who cooked up these phony growth forecasts  based on revenue-neutral reform proposals that don't exist. Respected  economists will tell you tax cuts don't pay for themselves. In fact,  when we had a chance to have some discussion not about a specific bill  but some ideas about taxes, the Republican economists who were before  the Finance Committee said the tax cuts wouldn't pay for themselves.   The honest predictions say that any growth caused by this bill is  going to be modest. After they have spent years insisting--I can't tell  you how many times I heard this--that we would have dynamic scores,  Republican Senators are rushing the independent scorekeepers to try to  get a thorough analysis, but we don't have it as we are on this floor  debating the bill.   Finally, we ought to forget that this bill has been getting a rewrite  behind closed doors for weeks now. A number of my colleagues on the  other said what was important to them is we have what is called regular  order. Regular order is probably not a concept people talk about in too  many coffee shops unless they traditionally get eggs or toast or  something, but what it means is, you have a process where both sides  work together, and you have a chance to discuss ideas and differing  approaches or offers. We haven't had anything like that. We haven't had  an open process with open debate and real amendments. What we have seen  is a mad dash to pass a bill that can't stand scrutiny in broad  daylight. If this bill really got scrutinized and had a chance to be  examined, we would see a lot of Americans coming to their Senators and  saying: Senator, no way--no way--should you support that bill.   What is on offer is a plan to force working people and working-class  families to pay for handouts to multinational corporations and tax  cheats. This bill does not deserve to pass. My view is, it really  doesn't deserve the ink that was used to print it on paper. The process  that has culminated in this scramble to drive this through, drive it  through with the most arbitrary process imaginable, I consider  shameful.   With that, I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that motions to  commit be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                     Motion to Commit With Instructions         Mr. WYDEN moves to commit the bill H.R. 1 to the Committee       on Finance with instructions to report the same back to the       Senate in 3 days, not counting any day on which the Senate is       not in session, with changes that--        (1) are within the jurisdiction of such committee; and        (2) eliminate provisions that would raise taxes on millions       of middle class taxpayers.                     Motion to Commit With Instructions         Mr. Wyden moves to commit the bill H.R. 1 to the Committee       on Finance with instructions to report the same back to the       Senate in 3 days, not counting any day on which the Senate is       not in session, with changes that--        (1) are within the jurisdiction of such committee; and        (2) are made through regular order and a bipartisan process       resulting in substantive provisions contributed by both       parties.     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 3  minutes to wrap up on the first vote we are going to have on my motion.    Mr. President, this first motion, the first motion the  Senate is going to vote on, is a straightforward proposition. The  motion says: Let us send this bill back to the Senate Finance Committee  on a bipartisan basis and come up with a plan that actually works for  the middle class.   I am going to wrap up just by recapping the Republican rhetoric on  this tax plan. First, it was said to be a guaranteed middle-class tax  cut. Then, it was merely focused on the middle class. Next, it was an  average tax cut across a variety of income cohorts. Now the numbers are  actually in. Republicans want to run up enough red ink to threaten  Medicare and Social Security and still raise taxes on more than half of  the middle class. The Senate, on a bipartisan basis, can do better than  this.   I urge my colleagues to support this proposal to send the bill back  to the Finance Committee and, on a bipartisan basis, come up with tax  reform that actually works for the middle class.   I yield back.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following  individuals in my personal and Finance Committee offices be granted  floor privileges for the remainder of this Congress: Claudette Yazbek,  Karlen Yallup, Lawrence Doppelt, Jonathan Harris, Rachael Kauss, and  Michael Cecil.
