 Madam President, I want to thank the chairman of the  committee for objecting. I want to tell my colleagues on the other side  of the aisle that I appreciate their being here giving the passionate  speeches they have because they made the case for Senator Alexander's  bipartisan bill.   You see, incorporated in this legislation is an initiative by Senator  Jones and Senator Baldwin. Anybody who makes this out to be a partisan  piece of legislation is just flat wrong. I have more historical Black  colleges in North Carolina than any State can claim. When those  chancellors and presidents have been presented with the question: Do  you want 2 years or permanent, they all said permanent. They didn't  know there was a permanent option.   I say this to my three colleagues because none of them are on the  committee: There is a permanent option for funding historically Black  colleges. It is in the chairman's bill. We have been told that the  FUTURE Act needs to be passed. The FUTURE Act is 2 years long. There is  not much of a future there. We ought to match its title with the  chairman's bill because this really does address the future.   The No. 1 concern of historically Black institutions is  predictability of funding. The chairman's bill is permanent. We are not  going to come in here in 2 years and seek another reauthorization, but  the benefit is that we are passing good legislation.   Let me point out to my colleagues that it is important to read  legislation. The FUTURE Act is funded by whacking the funding for the  State guaranty agencies. By taking away the account maintenance fees  that these State-based organizations receive to administer loans, we  are robbing Peter to pay Paul. These same students who are probably  going to go to historically Black universities are also seeking State- based loans to do it, and we are providing the institutions 2 years of  predictability on one side, and we are taking away the fees that are  needed to administer the loans to allow them to be able to afford it.  This is when it is important to look at the details.   The way the FUTURE Act is funded, it actually hurts all institutions  in North Carolina. Just today, I heard from the North Carolina State  Education Assistance Authority about how important this funding is for  their daily functions in administering student loans. So I believe  there is a better way to extend HBC funding but also not to hurt  students.   At the end of the day, our focus--the human face we see is the  student who benefits from the educational opportunity they have been  given. I would tell you that the FUTURE Act flunks on all counts. It is  not permanent. It takes away from some because of how it is funded. We  have an opportunity with Chairman Alexander's bill, the Student Aid  Improvement Act, which would extend this title III funding permanently,  but it would also include other bipartisan support changes in higher  education, like expanding Pell grants. Every Member of the Senate has  sat on this floor and said we have to do something on Pell grants. Here  is your opportunity.   It doesn't fit in the timeframe of passing a bill that passed the  House that provides 2 years of funding, but we have a bipartisan piece  of legislation. It simplifies the financial student financial aid  process. You saw the chairman hold up the form. There is nobody who can  defend the continuation of that form. It should be one page. The  chairman of the Education Committee has tried for now 5 years to  transition that to one page. You might look at us and say: Well, we can  do this very quickly, but we need time to talk about this. We have  taken 5 years to do this, and the people on the committee know this.   This is the sixth time you have come to the floor and asked unanimous  consent to do the exact same thing: Pass this; don't look at anything  else.   No, that is wrong, but it is not wrong because we are in the  majority. It is wrong because it is not serving the students for whom  we are supposed to be here setting policy. It simplifies aid award  letters to students. It is actually easy to tell them they got their  student aid. It is cumbersome. If you are on the committee, you  understand the agony they go through. We are wiping all of that away.   I believe Chairman Alexander has a better path. I also would like to  remind my colleagues that while this funding should be extended, there  has been no lapse. Let me state that again. It should be extended, and  there has been no lapse.   Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have a letter I received  from Secretary DeVos, stating that the title III funding in question is  available through September 2021, be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                     The Secretary of Education,                                    Washington, DC, October 9, 2019.        Dear [Redacted] I write to clarify the status of grants       under Title III, Part F of the Higher Education Act of 1965,       in light of the enactment of the Continuing Appropriations       Act, 2020, and Health Extenders Act of 2019 (Pub. L. No. 116-      59), signed on September 27, 2019.        Initially, I want to note that the new law has no effect on       funds that we recently awarded in the Title III, Part F       programs. Funds obligated in fiscal year (FY) 2019 have       already been made available to grantees under all Part F       programs in the Department of Education's (Department) G5       System for the project period beginning on October 1, 2019,       and ending on September 30, 2020. Those funds will remain       available to grantees for allowable uses during this period.       In addition, in the Part F programs that award grants       competitively, the Department has carried over FY 2019 funds       into FY 2020 to support noncompeting continuation awards and       supplements for project periods from October 1, 2020, through       September 30, 2021.        The Department's ability to make additional formula grants       in FY 2020 under Part F for Historically Black Colleges and       Universities (HBCUs) and Tribally Controlled Colleges and       Universities, and to conduct new competitions for FY 2021,       depends on the availability of congressionally appropriated       funds. However, this will have no bearing on the grant funds       that have already been made available to grantees for the       next 12 months.        This Administration is committed to each and every HBCU and       other minority-serving institutions and the important work       they do in educating historically underrepresented student       populations. If you have any questions about these programs,       please reach out to your program officer in the Department's       Office of Postsecondary Education.            Sincerely,                                                       Betsy DeVos.     On that basis alone, there is not the sense of urgency that  some have come to the floor six times and suggested. I don't disagree  with any of my colleagues that this is something we need to do now, but  a 2-year temporary bill that doesn't accomplish any of the other  reforms when we have had 5 years of bipartisan work--why would we not  take this option? Why would we not sit down and find a way for Chairman  Alexander's bill--which has many Democratic initiatives in it--to pass  and provide historically Black colleges and universities with permanent  funding, provide students with a one-page form to fill out for student  aid, provide an expedited way for the notification when their loans  have been approved? We are there, but for some reason, some want us to  do a 2-year temporary fix. It is wrong. I thank the chairman for  objecting.   I yield the floor.
