 Mr. Speaker, Members are advised that votes are now  expected in this House on Monday, December 4, at 6:30 p.m. Members  should be prepared to vote on the motion to go to conference and the  motion to instruct conferees on H.R. 1, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.   I strongly encourage all Members to be here present and voting. If  there are any further changes to the schedule, I will be sure to let  all Members know.    I yield to the gentleman from Maryland.    Mr. Speaker, the gentleman does know--we have talked  many times--about our issue not only just on security but also when it  comes to DACA, and we know that deadline is not approaching by the end  of this year.   My good friend does know the deadline of government funding that  affects all Americans. I take my friend in a serious manner, but I  would say my severe disappointment in what transpired this week when an  opportunity to meet with all leadership--my friend talked about the  number of days we have. This is not a time to play politics. This is  not about one party or the other.   I would be glad to hear the support and opposed. You just have to  show up for the meeting. I think more outcome would happen if you show  up to the meeting.   Tomorrow I will be announcing a full legislative schedule. I am  excited about the opportunity to let America keep more of their hard- earned money and get us working again.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Will the gentleman yield?    My friend is correct on a lot, but understand one  thing. In this job and when we run, we are passionate about our  beliefs. My parents always told me: If you can't handle the heat, you  probably shouldn't run.   But the one thing that should happen here is, if we want to come to a  conclusion, just as you and I and my good friend sat yesterday in my  office talking with the White House on our concerns about the hurricane  that came to the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico, the only way you solve  a problem is you come together. The only way you come together is you  show up in the meetings and you can air your differences.   But at the end of the day, when we walk into this House, we don't  walk in as Democrats or Republicans. We walk in as an American. It is  about time we put the people before politics.   We have got a shorter time to do our job. I look forward to seeing  people here Monday. I look forward to seeing us get our work done.
