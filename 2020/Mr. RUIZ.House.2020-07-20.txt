 Mr. Speaker, in 2017, my constituent, Jennifer Kepner,  passed away due to pancreatic cancer connected to her exposure to burn  pits during her military service in Balad, Iraq.   In her honor and the countless veterans who are sick, permanently  disabled, or who have died from illnesses due to exposure to burn pits,  I introduced an amendment to the NDAA to prohibit Federal funding for  the military use of toxic burn pits.   My amendment was not included, but it is imperative to acknowledge  the serious health risks that open-air burn pits have on our troops,  yet our military still uses them to dispose of waste on the  battlefield.   The EPA's website has a brochure discouraging burning household  trash, because burning waste releases dioxin and other pollutants to  the air and at the ground level, where they are most readily inhaled.  In addition, many counties across the Nation have banned open-air trash  burning because of air pollutants that pose a risk to our health.   If we can't burn trash here at home because of the health effects,  why do we keep exposing our servicemembers to dioxin and other toxins  and carcinogens that are released by burn pits?   We must address reducing the use of burn pits in our military.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, as we stand here right now, our brave men and  women overseas and our returning veterans continue to suffer the  horrific health effects of their exposure to toxic burn pits.   Burn pits are fields where tons of waste like jet fuel, plastics, and  medical waste were burned right next to military bases, exposing  servicemembers to an array of toxic pollutants, particulate matter, and  known carcinogens like dioxin.   For too long, servicemembers have inhaled black fumes from burn pits.  To make matters worse, their symptoms, like subtle shortness of breath  that progresses, headaches, or dry cough, have been dismissed.   As a physician, I know these symptoms can signal serious health  conditions, like severe pulmonary diseases, chronic fibrosis, chronic  bronchiolitis, and others.   For years, the Department of Defense has been dismissing the serious  health effects of burn pits, hiding behind promises about ``ongoing  studies.'' Promises about studies are not enough. It is time to act.   Our heroes cannot afford to wait. That is why we must pass four of my  bipartisan bills included as amendments to the NDAA.   First, H.R. 7596, the DOD Burn Pits Health Provider Training Act,  will require DOD to implement mandatory training for all their medical  providers on the potential health effects of exposure to open-air burn  pits. No longer can we allow symptoms of burn pit exposure to be  dismissed.   Second, H.R. 7597, the DOD Burn Pits Research Status Act, will  require DOD to report to Congress on the status and timeline for  completion of all ongoing studies conducted or funded by DOD related to  the health effects of burn pits.   Third, H.R. 7598, the Post-Deployment Burn Pit Question Act, will  require DOD to include a question about burn pit exposure in the post- deployment health assessment form to increase reporting of burn pit  exposure.   Fourth, H.R. 7600, the Burn Pit Registry Expansion Act, will require  DOD and VA to expand the burn pits registry to include Egypt and Syria.   In order to comprehensively address the military's use of burn pits,  prevent exposure, and improve timely care for servicemembers, we must  find alternatives to burn pits usage, educate military healthcare  providers about the variety of illnesses due to toxic burn pit  exposures, expand the burn pits registry, and understand gaps in  scientific research.   Toxic burn pit exposure continues to threaten the health of  servicemembers. Many servicemembers and veterans continue to become  severely sick, permanently disabled, or die from respiratory failure,  cancers, or autoimmune or other diseases due to toxic burn pits  exposure. This is an urgent problem that must be addressed right now.   My 2020 burn pits bill package will help bring us closer to providing  the attention that this DOD self-inflicted public health crisis  requires: identify at-risk servicemembers and give them the timely care  they need, and end the use of military toxic burn pits once and for  all.
