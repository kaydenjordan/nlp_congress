 Madam Speaker, it is always an honor to speak  here in the well of the House of the Congress of the United States of  America. I do want to compliment you, Madam Speaker. I heard your  statements earlier, and I would like to associate myself with the  portion of your statement that dealt with transgender persons.   Madam Speaker, I stand before the world today with an impeachment  update. I have previously indicated that  [[Page H9188]]  there will be a vote on an impeachment resolution before Christmas. I  stand by this. To this end, I will be meeting with appropriate members  of House leadership this week to discuss the notification process. I  want people to understand how this process works.   I will have the opportunity to read the Articles of Impeachment from  the well of the House. After this is done, there will be a time set for  me to present them again before the House. It must be done twice. When  that time is set, I will have to be notified of the time. I don't set  the time. I have to respond at the appropriate time. For me to respond  at the appropriate time, appropriate notice has to be given to me.   This is why I will be meeting with House leadership so that we can  discuss the means by which appropriate notice will be given to me. We  want to make sure there is no confusion about this process and no  confusion as to how the notice is to be accorded to me.   I will meet with leadership to ascertain how the appropriate notice  will be accorded to me so that I may present the Articles of  Impeachment a second time so that, thereafter, there will be a vote on  these Articles of Impeachment.   Because the system is such that it can be difficult to understand how  people have actually voted, I want you to know that those who vote with  me and those who are supportive of advancing the cause of impeachment,  I will be proud to announce who they are, and I will give Members  further updates as to how this will take place.   But I want to assure every American that this vote on Articles of  Impeachment will take place before Christmas, and that this vote will  be about the incitement of hate, about how the country is being pushed  back, and how America is better than the direction that someone seeks  to push us forward into.   This is a great country, and we cannot tolerate hate. This may be one  of the few times in the history of the country that persons will be  given the opportunity to take a stand against hate by casting the  appropriate vote in the Congress of the United States of America.   I will give future updates on impeachment from this podium. I am  always honored to stand in the well of the United States House of  Representatives.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member, and I  thank the chair of the committee as well.   Mr. Speaker, I am opposed to the legislation. I am opposed to it  because it does not give hardworking Americans the same consideration  that we will accord persons who are making billions and we will accord  corporations.   Corporations are going to get great tax cuts, billionaires are going  to get tax cuts. We will eliminate the estate tax, we will eliminate  the AMT for billionaires, but we are not going to give hardworking  Americans the opportunity to get the relief that they need with  reference to the $20 billion worth of debt that the NFIP currently has.   If we don't eliminate that debt now, premiums will go up on  hardworking Americans. Hardworking Americans won't be able to afford  premiums, and many of them won't be able to afford homes. This is not  the way to treat people who work hard and pay their taxes.   If we can give tax breaks to corporations and billionaires, we can  afford to reduce this debt on the NFIP so that hardworking Americans  can afford homes. It really is that simple.   Five years without another bill: this is our last chance. We can't  pass this chance up so that we can take care of billionaires and  corporations at the expense of hardworking Americans.
