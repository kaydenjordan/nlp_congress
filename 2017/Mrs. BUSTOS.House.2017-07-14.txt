 Mr. Chair, I rise in support of my amendment to cut  waste and strengthen our military installations.   This amendment would require the Department of Defense to ensure that  there is not usable space available on a military installation before  entering into expensive leases or purchasing additional property.   To put this into context, you wouldn't lease space in a parking lot  if you already had room in your own garage to park your car.   This amendment is needed because, while asking for another round of  base realignments and closures, the Department of Defense leased more  than 6,000 buildings in fiscal year 2015 instead of using available  space that it already owns.   That sounds like a waste to me.   My Congressional district is home to the Rock Island Arsenal, and  we're proud to have it as part of our community.   It houses the Army's only remaining foundry and employs more than  6,000 hardworking people.   But like many of our military installations, it has room for more.   We should be using facilities like the Arsenal to their full  potential, especially when it means we can reduce overall costs.   That's why I'm offering this amendment today.   I want to thank my bipartisan cosponsors Congressmen Paul Gosar, Dave  Loebsack and Walter Jones for their support of this amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendments en bloc offered  by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Thornberry).   The en bloc amendments were agreed to.                   Amendment No. 122 Offered by Ms. Tenney    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 122  printed in House Report 115-217.
