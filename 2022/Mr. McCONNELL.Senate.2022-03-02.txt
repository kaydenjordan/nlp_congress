 Mr. President, last night, President Biden gave a  State of the Union Address that might have worked OK for a popular  administration that had been successfully tackling America's problems  and naturally earning high marks, but that is not the reality in which  we live.   Democrats spent the last 12 months making major and painful policy  errors. The public overwhelmingly disapproves. President Biden didn't  need to stay the course and rehash a scattered wish list; he needed to  make a dramatic pivot. But he chose not to.   The President first discussed Ukraine. Everyone agrees with the  sentiments President Biden expressed, but the sentiments are not  enough. The President articulated no meaningful new steps, no specific  plan. He made no explicit commitment to keep flowing weapons,  intelligence, and advanced capabilities into Ukraine as long as the  Ukrainians need them, nor did he explain why his administration was  slow to provide lethal assistance in the first place. Instead, the  President focused on trying to claim credit for the remarkable European  and worldwide response that his administration did not foresee, let  alone orchestrate.   Apart from Ukraine, the President's other remarks on our dangerous  world were not just insufficient; they were basically nonexistent.   The President spoke for over an hour but only mentioned China twice.  Neither time had anything to do with national security or military  modernization. The President only mentioned Iran one time, and it was  literally by accident. There were zero mentions of North Korea, zero  mentions of the botched Afghanistan retreat the administration  originally boasted was a ``success.'' Our 13 servicemembers who lost  their lives were completely unmentioned until Governor Reynolds took  the microphone. And there were zero mentions of rebuilding the defense  budget that President Biden actually tried to cut last year.   Meanwhile, the President's speech tried to skate by the serious  kitchen-table concerns that are actually keeping families up at night.  The President talked about ``made in America'' but keeps fighting  against energy independence. Democrats want us to ``Buy American'' but  not American oil or gas. On President Biden's watch, we have set a new  record for importing Russian oil, and we are begging OPEC to produce  even more, and his energy vision is to dump huge subsidies into supply  chains that are dominated by China--borrowing from our grandkids to  build back Beijing.   The President tried yet again to revive the zombie spending plans  which a bipartisan majority of Senators have already killed and buried  because they would make inflation even worse. He tried to brag about  fancy technology on our southern border, as if we hadn't just seen a  new record for illegal crossings on his watch.   The President's address was not responsive to the country's concerns.  He needed to pivot, but he didn't.   CNN conducted an instant poll. As you might expect, it oversampled  Democrats. Even so, the percentage who gave the President's speech high  marks was the lowest they have seen in 15 years.   Iowa's hugely successful Governor, Kim Reynolds, offered the clearest  possible contrast. She spoke for the working families who are suffering  under Democrat policies. She outlined a commonsense Republican vision  of stability at home, strength abroad, law and order on our streets,  and sanity in our public schools.   November is just months away. If President Biden does not correct  course sharply and quickly, the American people may correct course for  him.                           Tribute to Angie Schulte    Mr. President, now on an entirely different matter, one of the  occupational hazards of Senate service is having to say goodbye to  truly remarkable staff professionals.   I have already been through this rodeo with Angie Schulte. All the  way back in 1988, this dedicated caseworker left my office for the  nonprofit sector, but back in 2010, I leapt at the chance to hire Angie  back as my State office manager, and her second tour of duty has been a  huge success.   I have known Angie for 40 years now. I have watched her master a wide  variety of roles. She is an integral part of my State office. She keeps  all of us on task and on time. But, unfortunately, tomorrow, her second  tour of service will end with a second farewell. Angie is retiring  after decades of hard work and phenomenal public service.   For 12 years, Angie has been the steady rudder steering my instate  team. If there was a complicated problem, she would fix it; a  scheduling conflict, she would resolve it; a new staffer needed help  growing into her role, she would provide it. Angie combines meticulous  efficiency with a totally charming and cheerful demeanor.   My relationship with Angie actually predates my time in the Senate.  Her mother Jeannette was my personnel director for my county  administration. I was a newly elected Republican in a heavily  Democratic county government who needed all the smarts and all the help  that I could get. Angie's mother Jeannette proved invaluable.   In 1982, her daughter Angie came on board as office receptionist. I  quickly promoted her, not once but twice. She served as office manager  in my Neighborhood Response Office. When I won statewide in 1984, Angie  was one of my first hires.   With the same vigor that helped Louisville residents settle property  disputes and parking tickets, Angie began helping Kentuckians across  the State navigate the morass of Federal Government redtape. Expertise,  an eye for detail--Angie grew into the consummate public servant. Our  whole team was overjoyed to welcome Angie back after her tenure with  Metro United Way, one of the Commonwealth's largest nonprofits.   Angie is famous for humming and whistling while she works and for  throwing extravagant birthday parties for her colleagues. She is  unfailingly upbeat. She has a permanent positive attitude and, boy,  does she get results for Kentucky.   As you can see, it has been an honor to have Angie's talents on our  team. I am just grateful that when her sterling 40-year career  concludes tomorrow, a 40-year friendship will not.   So, Angie, I wish you every happiness as you spend more time with  Steve, with Kathleen and Becca, and with those grandkids, Grant, Logan,  and Elizabeth.   I am eternally grateful for your outstanding good work.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
