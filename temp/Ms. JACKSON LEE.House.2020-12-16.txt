 Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the Judiciary,  Committee, I rise in strong support of S. 3312, the ``Crisis  Stabilization and Community Reentry Act,'' bipartisan legislation that  ensures people experiencing a mental health crisis receive appropriate  care while in a correctional facility.   Specifically, the Crisis Stabilization and Community Reentry Act  would authorize $10 million in grants to communities to create  collaborative programs involving justice agencies and community-based  behavioral health providers, including Certified Community Behavioral  Health Clinics (CCBHCs).   Mr. Speaker, this legislation addresses the challenges faced by many  person during their period of incarceration and as they seek to reenter  the community.   This includes access to proper medication and additional training for  law enforcement officers so they can address the needs of our most  vulnerable individuals.   The bill also calls for a warm handoff between law enforcement and  community mental health clinics upon re-entry into the community to  ensure the best possible start.   It would also create a national technical assistance center to serve  communities around the country.   Crisis Stabilization and Community Reentry Act grants would support  community-level crisis response programs, including collaboratively  designed crisis response services and technical support programs that  promote medication adherence and continuity of care.   This grant funding will also support targeted training programs  related to medication adherence and continuity of care; including the  purchase and use of long-acting antipsychotic medications to support  adherence.   Importantly, the infusion of funding will strengthen local agency and  provider capacity to reduce suicides during incarceration.   Finally, the legislation establishes a national technical assistance  center to support justice and mental health agencies, community  behavioral health providers, CCBHCs, and other stakeholders in  developing training and treatment approaches for justice-involved  persons with mental illness, as well as payment strategies that promote  best-practices with respect to care for this vulnerable group of  persons.   This legislation is strongly supported by and has earned the  endorsement of The National Council, which is another reason why I  strongly support this bipartisan, common-sense criminal justice reform  and urge all Members to join me in voting to pass S. 3312, the Crisis  Stabilization and Community Reentry Act.    Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the Judiciary,  Committee and a member representing a state on the nation's southern  border, I rise in strong support of S. 2174, the ``Missing Persons and  Unidentified Remains Act of 2019,'' sponsored by the senior senator  from Texas, Sen. Cornyn, and Sen. Kamala Harris, the next Vice- President of the United States and the first woman and person of color  to win election to that high office.   I support the Missing Persons and Unidentified Remains Act because it  is bipartisan legislation that will help prevent migrant deaths on the  Southwest border and will help border counties and nonprofit  organizations locate and identify missing migrants.   Mr. Speaker, migrants seeking a better and safer life in the United  States who attempt to cross the U.S.-Mexico border between ports of  entry are often faced with difficult terrain and extremely dangerous  conditions.   The temperature in barren border sections of Arizona's Sonoran  Desert, for example, can reach over 104 degrees Fahrenheit in the  summer and drop to below freezing in the winter.   Since 1998, the U.S. Border Patrol has reported 7,505 migrant deaths  on the border, most due to dehydration, drowning, and exposure to  extreme heat or cold.   For more than two decades, over one migrant a day has died while  attempting to enter without authorization, a misdemeanor offense under  Federal law.   The actual number dead is likely much higher than that, as the  statistics only report those who have been positively identified by  border patrol agents.   The bodies of migrants tragically lost during attempted border  crossings become increasingly difficult to identify after exposure to  the desert for prolonged periods.   The continuing loss of life on the border is unacceptable and  allowing many of the dead to remain unidentified is inhumane, families  of border crossers unsure of their loved ones' fate and depriving them  of the opportunity unable to say goodbye.   The legislation before us would create grants for humanitarian and  state actors to report and identify missing persons and unidentified  remains, including migrant border crossers.   The bill also provides resources for rescue beacons, which have been  used effectively to rescue migrants who are in danger.   Mr. Speaker, the Missing Persons and Unidentified Remains Act would  authorize the Attorney General to provide grants to various entities to  report, process, and identify missing persons and unidentified remains.   Entities eligible for the grants would include state and local  governments, humanitarian aid groups, nonprofit organizations,  forensics and toxicology laboratories, and medical examiners' offices.   This funding will improve reporting of missing persons to the  Combined DNA Index System (CODIS) and the National Missing and  Unidentified Persons System (NamUs), databases used to identify border  crossers who have lost their lives.   Additionally, the legislation authorizes the purchase and  implementation of up to 170 self-powered ``rescue beacons'' in isolated  border regions to prevent further migrant deaths.   Rescue beacons are tools used by U.S. Border Patrol in desolate  border areas to rescue migrants in distress.   They are 30 to 40 feet tall, solar-powered, and satellite-connected.   They are equipped with a 9-1-1 cellular relay, a strobe light, and a  multilingual instructional placard to help migrants alert border patrol  personnel to a distress call.   Not long ago, on Christmas Eve, 2017, a distress call from a rescue  beacon allowed border patrol agents to rescue a migrant family near  Lukeville, Arizona, representing three of hundreds of lives that have  been saved by the beacons since they were first implemented in the late  1990s.   As of November 12, 2019, there were 34 rescue beacons situated in  desolate border areas; this bill would increase the total number of  beacons by 600 percent.   The bill clarifies privacy protections concerning the use of  biometric data in the reporting and identification of missing persons  and unidentified remains and provides that any piece of biometric  evidence handled by an entity receiving grant funding be used for the  sole purpose of identifying missing persons and unidentified remains.   Finally, S. 2174 requires the Attorney General, Customs and Border  Protection (CBP), and the Government Accountability Office (GAO) each  to submit annual reports on use of grant funding and on programs  implemented to save migrant lives and identify the dead.   Mr. Speaker, the Missing Persons and Unidentified Remains Act would  make an immediate impact, both by saving lives on the border and by  allowing the families of those who have lost loved ones to gain  closure.   I strongly support this bipartisan, common-sense reform that would  enable the United States to lessen the loss of life on our southern  border and treat those dying or crossing between ports of entry with  dignity and humanity.   I urge all Members to join me in voting to pass S. 2174, the Missing  Persons and Unidentified Remains Act of 2019.    Madam Speaker, first of all, I want to, as a member  of the Judiciary Committee, associate myself with the Missing Persons  and Unidentified Remains Act of 2019, a very vital act for dealing with  families who have lost loved ones, as well as the Crisis Stabilization  and Community Reentry Act, S. 3312, which deals with helping people who  are incarcerated adjust back to the community.   I believe that we had a day of hope yesterday in Houston and around  the world. In fact, it was not only yesterday, but it was Monday. That  is when the first vaccines began to come to the Nation.   I went to the public hospital system, and I became part of UPS--that  is, Pfizer vaccines that I was able to lift at the Lyndon Baines  Johnson Hospital and then walk that vaccine to the pharmacy so that  people would have hope. Then, I went to Ben Taub Hospital--the public  health system, again--and watched people from all backgrounds get  vaccinated.   This is a day of hope. We must continue, but we must continue to walk  carefully. We must continue to stay distant, get testing, and wear our  masks.   There is hope. I am delighted to have been able to be there to say to  our constituents that there is hope, Madam Speaker.                            ____________________
