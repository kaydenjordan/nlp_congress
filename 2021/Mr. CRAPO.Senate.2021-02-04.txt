 Mr. President, I call up my amendment, No. 55, and ask  that it be reported by number.    Mr. President, this amendment simply makes permanent the  individual and small business tax rate reductions and reforms from the  TCJA.   The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the TCJA, gave American workers and  families more cash in their pockets by significantly lowering  individual tax rates, nearly doubling the standard deduction, and  doubling the child tax credit. For American businesses, the TCJA  lowered the tax rate and provided parity for small businesses operating  in passthrough form. It also encouraged investment in the United States  through the immediate expensing of property and equipment.   From the beginning of the previous administration up to the beginning  of the pandemic early last year, the economy added more than 7 million  jobs. Every U.S. metropolitan area had enjoyed income gains in 2018.  Low-income workers were experiencing the highest wage growth in nearly  a decade.   We need to give our economy its best shot at recovering to  prepandemic levels. This means strengthening that pro-growth policy we  have put into place by making permanent these expiring tax provisions  from the TCJA.    Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.
