 Mr. Speaker, as an obstetrician, I have delivered  thousands of babies and helped moms through pregnancies for 25 years.   I stand before the House today disgusted by the murderous, barbarous  legislation pushed by Democrats in New York legalizing abortions for  any reason, all the way until the due date of the baby. This extremist  antilife abortion measure is literally nauseating to me.   How sad it is that we live in a time when extremists are legalizing  the murder of innocent, defenseless children. The legalization of these  late-term procedures that amount to infanticide are the worst thing I  have heard in my entire professional lifetime.   I call on my obstetricians and other physicians who deliver babies. I  call on the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and all  physician associations to openly denounce and refuse these murderous  procedures. Legal or not, this is morally reprehensible.   As a father, a grandfather, a physician, and a human being who loves  people, I cannot sit here in good conscience while this is going on,  regardless of it being on a State level. I will do everything in my  power to combat this position from spreading and protect these innocent  children.                            ____________________
