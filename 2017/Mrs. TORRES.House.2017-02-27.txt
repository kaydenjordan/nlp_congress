 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   By expanding the boundaries of the Shiloh National Military Park in  the State of Tennessee, H.R. 88 will assist the National Park Service  in its efforts to preserve lands and share the history of the Civil War  for generations to come.   The bill adjusts the boundary of the park to include several sites  identified in the 2004 boundary expansion study conducted by the  National Park Service. This bill also establishes the Parker's  Crossroads Battlefield as an associated area of the National Park  System.   Between the Union and Confederacy, Parker's Crossroads saw over 700  Americans lose their lives in the war for our Nation's future.  Preserving this site will provide even broader opportunities to  commemorate and learn from the legacy of the Civil War.   The emphasis that we all need to place on preserving our country's  history cannot be overstated. The Civil War is a chapter in our  national story that continues to shape the thoughts and actions of this  country over 150 years after its conclusion.   The struggles and personal conflicts faced by millions of soldiers  and the impact on families throughout and after the war have provided  us with many lessons, lessons that continue to remain relevant today.  Only through learning from our past will we learn how to be a better  and stronger nation in the future.   Parks, such as Shiloh National Military Park, offer countless  opportunities for us to explore the rich history and lessons of the  past. These opportunities are most effective when visitors to sites can  immerse themselves in the full setting of the area and gain a true  understanding of the historical context, something that this expansion  of the Shiloh National Military Park will achieve.   I would like to thank Representative Blackburn for her hard work and  commitment to protecting the historical resources in her State, and I  urge my colleagues to support this bill.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I would like to again thank Representative  Blackburn for her efforts, and I urge adoption of this bill.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Public Law 102-477 establishes what is commonly known as the 477  Program to foster employment and economic development in Indian  Country. This highly successful program authorizes tribal governments  to consolidate up to 13 different Federal grant programs into a single  plan with a single budget in a single reporting system.   Current participants in the program have significantly improved the  effectiveness of the delivery of services included in their 477 plan,  while lowering administrative costs. These cost savings have been  translated into more accessible and available services for their  communities.   The Citizen Potawatomi Nation of Oklahoma's 477 Program has been in  place since 1996. Since 2010, the Nation has served well over 6,000  participants through the program. Of those who had employment as their  goal, 47 percent achieved unsubsidized employment.   H.R. 288 will build on this success by permanently authorizing the  program, increasing the scope and availability of participating Federal  grant programs, and setting a streamlined process for tribes to follow.                                time  1645    I want to congratulate Chairman Young for his tireless work on this  legislation and for bringing together all of the stakeholders to  address their concerns and find a workable solution.   I supported this legislation last year, as it passed the House last  Congress unanimously. I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this  legislation.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   This is an important program that deserves to be reauthorized. As we  know, this bill passed out of the House last Congress without  objection. I look forward to continuing to work with Mr. Young at  finding other pieces of legislation that we can work on on a bipartisan  level.   I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 699 clarifies the terms of the land exchange  between the Forest Service and Mt. Hood Meadows, a privately held ski  resort. The exchange was authorized by Congress in 2009, but due to  lack of clarity, here we are 7 years later and the exchange still has  not been executed.   Last year, the Forest Service and Mt. Hood Meadows engaged in  mediation to resolve the issues that have held up the exchange. This  bill is a result of that mediation, and its passage will ensure that,  after 7 long years, the exchange will finally move forward.   I want to thank the sponsors, Representative Walden and  Representative Blumenauer from Oregon, for their hard work and  commitment to resolving this issue.   Last year, this bill passed the House and Senate as part of S. 2012.  Given all the positive momentum this legislation has seen in recent  years, I hope that we can get this bill across the finish line as soon  as possible and finally complete the land exchange. I urge my  colleagues to support this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Larson), the bill's sponsor.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Congress established the Coltsville National Historical Park at the  end of 2014. The law that established the park also authorized the  National Park Service to utilize a 10,000-square-foot building, known  as the East Armory for the purpose of park administration.   However, during the planning phase for establishing this new park,  local stakeholders and the Park Service have determined that the Colt  Armory Complex is better suited for this purpose. This bill simply  makes that change and authorizes use of the Colt Armory Complex.   I support this simple fix to the enabling legislation that responds  to the on-the-ground dynamics of this particular park. I want to thank  the majority and my colleagues on the Natural Resources Committee for  expediting review of this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Larson) for  his hard work on moving this bill forward. I urge my colleagues to vote  in favor of H.R. 863.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
