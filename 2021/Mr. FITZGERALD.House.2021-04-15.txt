 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 7.   This bill is a solution in search of a problem, and it does nothing  to help employees. In reality, the bill would only boost paychecks for  trial lawyers and not workers.   H.R. 7 places unworkable, burdensome restrictions on employers, and  also poses a threat to worker privacy.   Even more, this bill would kill the Christmas bonus by effectively  prohibiting employers from paying end-of-the-year bonuses to their  employees. This hardly seems fair to an employee, despite the title of  the bill.   Republicans tried to strengthen the bill during the committee markup.  My colleague, Ms. Stefanik, offered an amendment that would have made  commonsense improvements to the text, but that amendment was rejected  by the Democrats.   I urge a ``no'' vote on the bill. We should not allow trial lawyers  and burdensome restrictions to kill the Christmas bonus under the false  guise of fairness.
