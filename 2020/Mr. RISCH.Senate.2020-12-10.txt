 Mr. President, as a member and former chairman of  the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each month  I recognize and celebrate the American entrepreneurial spirit by  highlighting the success of a small business in my home State of Idaho.  Today I am pleased to honor La Cabanita Mex in Ketchum as the Idaho  Small Business of the Month for December 2020.   Growing up, Rodolfo Armenta was captivated by his father's cooking  and passion for traditional Mexican cuisine. Rodolfo knew he wanted  serve his father's food as a career and dreamed of one day opening up  his own Mexican restaurant.   During a visit to Idaho's Wood River Valley, Rodolfo fell in love  with the area's natural beauty and tight-knit community and soon  relocated his family to the area. After years of hard work and  determination, Rodolfo opened La Cabanita in Ketchum where it continues  to thrive today.   Since its 2009 opening, La Cabanita has become a beloved institution,  garnering accolades for its exceptional food, family atmosphere, and  dedicated service to the community. It has received multiple awards,  including the gold medal for ``Best Mexican Restaurant'' in the Idaho  Mountain Express's Best of Valley Survey for 5 years in a row, and  continues to draw in locals and tourists alike.   Thanks to the success of the Ketchum location, Rodolfo opened a  second La Cabanita in Bellevue and a bakery in the Wood River Valley,  providing dozens of jobs to the local community and giving Idahoans a  true sense of the cultural vibrance that surrounds Mexican cuisine.   Congratulations to Rodolfo, his family, and all of the employees of  La Cabanita Mex on being selected as the Idaho Small Business of the  Month for December 2020. You make our great State proud, and I look  forward to your continued growth and success.                            ____________________
