 Mr. President, over the last couple of weeks, many of us  have spent a lot of time thinking about the horrific shootings in  Uvalde, Philadelphia, Buffalo, and elsewhere.   Unfortunately, these are familiar scenes that we have seen before,  and we would like to try to find a way to reduce the likelihood of  their reoccurrence in the future if there is anything we can do here in  the Senate to make that possible. So I have been working particularly  with Senator Murphy, who was my partner on the Fix NICS bill that we  passed in 2018.   Senator Murphy comes from a blue State, Connecticut; I come from a  red State, Texas. Yet, in that example, we were able to take the  horrible events of Sutherland Springs, where innocent parishioners were  gunned down at a small Baptist church outside of San Antonio, and take  out of that tragedy something good, which is a bill we call Fix NICS,  the National Instant Criminal Background Check System.   Since that was signed into law, 11\1/2\ million new records have been  uploaded into the background check system, and I believe that has saved  lives.   You will recall, in that case, the shooter was a veteran of the U.S.  Air Force, but, unfortunately, he had a troubled history: felony  convictions, domestic violence, mental health adjudications. None of  that was in the background check system. It should have been, and it  would have disqualified him had it been known. But he did what so often  happens; he lied, and then he bought--the lie and buy--and tragedy  ensued. We were all sickened by these shootings, and we are hyperaware  of the public interest.   The most common refrain I hear is: Do something. Do something.  Unfortunately, it gets a little less specific after that what exactly  should be done, and that is where the hard work begins.   But, as before, I am optimistic that we can find something that  protects the rights of law-abiding citizens under our Constitution,  under the Second Amendment, who, I believe, are not a  [[Page S2881]]  threat to public safety, and focus on people with criminal records,  people with mental health challenges, like young Salvador Ramos in  Uvalde, TX; like Adam Lanza at Sandy Hook.   The profile is pretty well established--young, alienated,  disaffected, mentally challenged boys who lack access to treatment  which will help them manage their mental illness and who descend into a  pit of despair, ultimately resulting in their desire not only to harm  themselves but to take other people with them. That profile is well  established in the scientific literature. And the New York Times did an  excellent piece a couple of weeks ago on that profile. So I think that  gives us a little bit of a roadmap for the sorts of things we might do  to deal with that.   What makes this more challenging than, for example, the Fix NICS bill  after Sutherland Springs is that was a singular point of failure. Here,  we see multiple points of failure, and I think we need to address as  many as we can.   So as I mentioned, the mental health issue looms large. We know that  during the 2 years, where many students were isolated at home, trying  to keep up with their studies virtually, many of them have languished,  many of them have fallen behind. And because they have been isolated  from their peers at a time when their social development is the most  important, many of them have fallen into despair, exacerbating  underlying problems that they may have in the first place. So trying to  figure out how to support our schools and our communities with  resources needed to address the mental and emotional health of people  who are struggling, particularly young students, that seems like an  obvious area that we can work on together.   Obviously, school security is important. The initial reports in  Uvalde were that the door was propped open that Salvador Ramos entered.  Later, we found out that, no, it wasn't propped open, but the lock  didn't work. He just walked right in.   There are a lot of studies and best practices when it comes to what  is necessary to secure our schools. If we can secure our airports post- 9/11, we can secure our schools to make sure that people who should  come in and out of those schools can do so relatively easily but that  outsiders cannot and particularly those who are a threat to the safety  of those students.   I think all of us want to try to find ways to reduce the likelihood  of something like this happening again, and school districts across the  country are eager to get our help and guidance to harden their  infrastructure to provide for the personnel, resource officers--that is  the local police officer on the school campus. Those are things that I  think would diminish the likelihood of another Uvalde.   Mental health and school safety seem to me as kind of no-brainers, in  a sense, where I don't think there is a lot of division between that  side of the aisle and this side of the aisle.   But we are also looking at ways to keep guns out of the hands of  people who already, by law, are prohibited from having them. I am not  talking necessarily about expanding the background check system; I want  to make sure the background check system works.   What makes this challenging is Salvador Ramos showed up after his  18th birthday as if he were born yesterday. For purposes of the  background check system, there was no insight into his many mental  health challenges or terroristic threats of fellow students,  potentially drug use, and other things that if he were an adult, he  could not pass a background check. But because of the fact that  juvenile records are typically sealed and are not part of the NICS  review, the merchant who sold him the firearms he used didn't know  anything about his track record.   But we know how, as I said earlier, that he fits a familiar profile.  He shot his own grandmother because she wanted him to go back to school  after being out of school for the last 2 years. He engaged in self- mutilation, self-cutting, tortured animals, made threats against his  fellow students, threatened sexual assault against his fellow female  students, and made threats that he would, in fact, do what he  ultimately did online. He was a ticking timebomb.   So if there is some way for us to look back into the sorts of records  that would disqualify an adult if they had occurred post-18--because  they would have been public records available to the National Instant  Criminal Background Check System--if there is a way to look back and  identify people like Salvador Ramos, who, by virtue of his mental  health and other problems, we would know he should not be able to  purchase a firearm legally.   A couple of States--I think it is South Carolina and Virginia-- voluntarily upload mental health adjudications for 17-year-olds. We  can't compel other States to do that, but we can sure provide--we can  facilitate other States doing so and incentivize their populating the  NICS background check system with this necessary information for  juveniles, who ultimately will end up--they will turn of age and be  able to buy a firearm, and we need to know ahead of time, for purposes  of the background check system, what those records look like.   So there are a number of things that we could do. One suggestion is,  for example, to take a look at the background check process itself for  18- to 21-year-olds in particular since that is the population we are  focusing on based on this profile.   Under current law, if you go in and buy a firearm and you have a  clean record, you can pass your background check pretty quickly. In 90  percent of cases, that is actually what happens. The average processing  time is 2 minutes. In most cases, the system returns a binary result:  You either pass or you don't pass, you fail. When you fail, that means  you can't purchase a firearm.   Now, the Congress, the Senate--in particular, Senator Coons from  Delaware and I sponsored a bill that would notify local police when  somebody goes in to take a background check and fails because they  don't qualify. Many times, the local law enforcement knows more about  these people and would be interested to know that they tried to  illegally purchase a firearm and were denied.   But in about 10 percent of the gun purchases, the background check is  not resolved immediately. The system returns a yellow light, which  means additional review is required. For example, if you have a common  name like John Smith, the search may pull records for somebody else,  for the wrong person with the same name who is prohibited from  purchasing a gun. It could also be caused by incomplete criminal  history--for example, if somebody is convicted of assault but on  further examination, you find out it was domestic violence, which is a  prohibited category. You would also learn whether it was a felony or a  misdemeanor.   In those cases, the FBI, under current law, already has 3 days in  which to complete the background check. The problem is, under current  law, there are no finish--the seller still sells the gun, and we have  an incomplete record.   Dylann Roof, I believe, was the name of the shooter at the Mother  Emanuel Church in Charleston, SC. As it turned out, he had a  misdemeanor drug offense that was not uploaded into the background  check system.   Now, it is a disqualifying condition if you are addicted to or a  frequent user of illegal drugs, but because the background check system  did not allow enough time to include that information--maybe, just  maybe, he would have been denied the purchase of the firearms that he  ultimately used to kill those innocent people that day.   So what we are looking at is the possibility of--in those cases where  there is what I will call a yellow flag or an indication that further  review is necessary--an extended period of time, for this class of  purchasers between 18 and 21, for the background check system to  complete their review.   Well, I have said it before, and I will say it again: I don't believe  law-abiding, mentally well gun owners are going to commit mass  shootings or are a threat to public safety. I know within the Senate,  we have a number of people who are sportsmen; who enjoy target  shooting, let's say; who believe that they need to exercise their  Second Amendment rights in order to protect their family and their  homes. They are not a threat. So blanket limitations or prohibitions on  those law-abiding citizens who are not a threat to public safety and  never will be, to me, strikes as overreach.   We are not talking about a discretionary right; we are talking about  a  [[Page S2882]]  constitutional right. But I do believe that the Second Amendment and  sound public policy are not mutually exclusive here, and that is the  needle we are trying to thread here. So adding juvenile records to the  NICS system is a commonsense way to ensure we have a complete picture  of the buyer's history.   Then, of course, there is the scandal of our mental health delivery  system in the United States today. Back in the sixties, when people who  had mental health challenges were institutionalized, we finally figured  out that that didn't work very well; it was inhumane. The theory was  that there would be created some safety net in communities across the  country where people could turn; where the police, if they answered a  9-1-1 call and they realized that this isn't a criminal, that this is  somebody going through a mental health crisis--where the police could  take people where they could actually get help, get treated, get  counseling, and get better. That doesn't exist today in many  communities--in the major cities perhaps, even in suburban areas, but  Uvalde, TX, population 15,000, not so much.    So we are looking at ways to expand the community-based mental health  system. Senator Stabenow and Senator Blunt have a great proposal that  would extend the current eight-State pilot program nationwide. Now, is  that solely related to what happened at Uvalde or what happened in  Buffalo or what happened in Philadelphia? No, but it would address the  larger underlying challenge of more and more Americans falling through  the cracks.   While we know most people in a mental health crisis are not going to  commit acts of violence, we also know that 60 percent of the gun- related deaths are suicides. And as it occurred to me like a light went  off in my head, Salvador Ramos, Adam Lanza, and others of this profile  of young men, in addition to the multiple homicides they commit, they  commit suicide. They know they are not going to make it out alive.   So addressing this mental health crisis that affects our country and  particularly where we fail these young men who feel like they have  nowhere else to turn, who become increasingly isolated, become  increasingly desensitized to the idea of taking someone's life because  they are sitting in their room playing video games, killing people  virtually all the time, and then, in their bizarre fantasies, decide to  extend those fantasies to taking not only their own life but the lives  of other innocent people.   So this is challenging, Mr. President, and there is no doubt about  it, but we can do this. We can do this. Sometimes politics is called  the art of the possible, and I think this is possible. Is it going to  be perfect? Are we going to not have to revisit some other scenario  where people have fallen through the cracks or where vulnerabilities  are exposed? No, we can't be sure that this is one and done. But I do  believe there is a sense of urgency, not only here in the Congress but  in the White House and across the country. We have all heard from our  constituents, who are in anguish over what has happened in Uvalde and  elsewhere. The cry is to do something. Like I said, that is not very  specific. And I understand, but it is up to us to try to find what is  the right set of policies that would respect the rights of law-abiding  citizens under the Constitution but at the same time address what we  know is a huge mental health crisis in this country and make sure that  the systems that are in place work, like the National Instant Criminal  Background Check System.   We need to populate that system with the relevant information that  would disqualify somebody, if they were an adult, if it occurred while  they were a juvenile. There are ways we can do that. We can incentivize  that. We can take a look back in some cases. We can allow the National  Instant Criminal Background Check System, in those limited cases where  they need to do further review, to see that the information is  complete.   We can figure this out, and I think, on a bipartisan basis, there is  a will to do so. Around here, if there is a will, there is a way, and I  believe we do have the will and we will find a way.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print my bill  for introduction in the Congressional Record. The bill improves certain  sexual assault and domestic violence prevention policies.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record as follows:                                  S. 4367         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.
