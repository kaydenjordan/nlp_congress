 Madam Speaker, 2 minutes is almost impossible to  actually have an honest and detailed debate/discussion in here.   But do understand--and I believe this is a sin of both sides--we are  playing this game where we are moving around who pays. We are doing  almost nothing to actually reduce the underlying cost of healthcare.  Your bill is doing it; ours has done it.   But this bill actually has a very cynical mechanism in it. This board  is being recycled from H.R. 3. We are all familiar with the mechanism  of reference pricing. We have debated it around here for years.   So, if you are in Great Britain and there is a new drug that gives  you a year of healthy life and it costs more than $37,000, it is not  purchased. That pricing, that scarcity mechanism, is what the  Democrats' bill is importing. So its savings are actually very cynical,  because it is going to take away pharmaceuticals that make people  healthy.   How could we be doing this, even allow this mechanism, in a time of a  pandemic?   You are about to crush all of the little biopharma companies that we  are hoping desperately produce miracle cures, and, in a perverse way,  for large pharma. You have just given them the market, because you have  taken away those who are nipping at their heels.   I beg of you, think about what you are actually doing, because this  type of financing mechanism will kill people. It will end lives,  because it will create a dearth, a shortage, of the next generation of  cures.   Let's not engage in that cruelty. There are better ways to get there.  And we have proposed many of them. It would just be nice to get heard,  because there are solutions, and this is a really dark one.
