 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, in a few moments, I am going to ask  unanimous consent for the Senate to pass S. 2800, which is the  bipartisan NASA Authorization Act. Before doing so, I want to make some  brief remarks about how important this legislation is to American  leadership in space and to our continued space exploration efforts.   Well over a year ago, I joined with Chairman Wicker, Ranking Member  Cantwell, and Subcommittee on Aviation and Space Ranking Member Sinema,  and we began writing the NASA Authorization Act, using as a foundation  the bipartisan bill that I had previously authored with Senators  Cornyn, Rubio, Markey, and then-Senator Bill Nelson, from the last  Congress, as our starting point. We solicited input from hundreds of  stakeholders, from individuals and academics to industry partners and  even our international allies. Hundreds of pages of suggestions,  proposed edits, and comments were submitted. Over many months, our  staffs worked diligently through each and every submission, trying to  incorporate the feedback to the greatest extent possible, and what  resulted is this bill, which was marked up last year and unanimously  reported.   What we have achieved together is legislation that enjoys deep and  broad bipartisan support and that sets bold goals for NASA and the  United States in space. It provides the direction and  [[Page S7652]]  the infrastructure necessary to meet them. I am very proud of the work  we have done together and of this legislation we have assembled, and I  want to express particular thanks to Senators Wicker, Cantwell, and  Sinema and to their staffs for their hard work.   Our bill strengthens U.S. leadership in space, ensuring that we  remain the default space exploration partner of the world. It extends  the life of the International Space Station through 2030, and it  challenges us to be the international leader for lunar and Mars  exploration and to reach new horizons.   It is not just human exploration, though. By working in a collegial  and good-faith manner, we were able to craft a product that strengthens  all of NASA's core missions--something which benefits not just States  with strong NASA equities but every American. It is amazing what  strong, unified leadership can do to bring the Members of this body  together, working to pass vitally important legislation that advances  science and technology and national security and the interests of our  Nation.   I want to say again how grateful I am to my colleagues who worked on  this bill with me and to state just how proud I am that the Senate is  speaking with one, unified voice in passing this legislation. This is  following a tradition that we have seen in the past 8 years I have  served in this body, where, on the question of space, we have seen over  and over again strong bipartisan cooperation. Even at a time when  partisan division pulls us apart in so many other areas, on the  question of America's leading the world in space, the U.S. Senate  speaks with one voice.   We have a real opportunity here to boldly shape the Nation's space  exploration efforts, to inspire new generations of little boys and  little girls gazing up at the stars and wondering what is out there,  and to make the United States a true space-faring nation.   While this bill is not going to pass the House of Representatives  during the remainder of this Congress, I look forward to the beginning  of the next Congress, where we can use this unanimously approved  legislation as the starting point to move quickly to pass a  comprehensive NASA Authorization Act across the finish line and get it  signed into law    Therefore, as if in legislative session, I ask unanimous  consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of  Calendar No. 525, S. 2800.    I ask unanimous consent that the committee-reported  substitute be withdrawn; that the Cruz substitute amendment at the desk  be agreed to; that the bill, as amended, be considered read a third  time and passed; and that the motion to reconsider be considered made  and laid upon the table.    Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, reserving the right to object, today, we  have good news and bad news. The good news is that our Democratic  colleagues are finally discovering that the Chinese Communists are not  our friends. They are finally acknowledging that the Chinese Communists  are murdering, torturing, oppressive tyrants, and our Democratic  colleagues are likewise discovering that Hong Kong is a beacon for  democracy and a beacon for liberty. That is, indeed, good news.   The bad news is, the bill that they have put forth is not designed to  do anything about it. This is not a Hong Kong bill. It is, instead, a  Democratic messaging bill because House Democrats made, I think, a  cynical decision to try to exploit the crisis in Hong Kong to advance  their longstanding goals of changing our immigration laws.   It is not news to anyone who has been watching the political battles  of recent years to discover that our Democratic colleagues embrace open  borders; that when it comes to illegal immigration, their preference is  to make all immigration legal. This bill advances that longtime  partisan political agenda that the Democrats have.   When it comes to standing up for Communist China, for 8 years I have  led the fight in this Senate to stand up to Communist China. China is,  I believe, the single greatest geopolitical threat facing the United  States for the next century.   In October of last year, I traveled to Hong Kong as part of a friends  and allies tour throughout Asia, met with the Hong Kong dissidents-- those brave, young students standing in the streets, standing for  freedom, and standing up against Chinese tyrants. I did a satellite  interview on an American Sunday show from Hong Kong dressed in all  black in solidarity with those protesters because Hong Kong today is,  as I have said many times, the new Berlin. It is the frontline in the  battle against Communist tyranny.   This bill, however, is not designed to fix that problem. Right now,  today, under current law, individuals in Hong Kong are already eligible  to become refugees under our immigration law. In fact, in July,  President Trump explicitly expanded the number of refugee slots  available and allocated them to Hong Kong. This bill, instead, is  designed and would dramatically lower the standards for both refugee  and asylum status to the point where individuals would qualify even if  they cannot establish an individualized and credible fear of  persecution.   The Senator from Connecticut just listed that as a virtue of this  bill--that no longer would you have to establish a credible fear of  persecution; instead, this bill would dramatically lower that standard.  There is no reason to lower that standard, and there is particular risk  when doing so, we know, would be used by the Chinese Communists to send  even more Chinese spies into the United States.   The Senator from Connecticut assured us: Well, don't worry. We will  do a background check.   Well, the last I checked, when the Chinese Communist Government sends  spies into our country, they are quite willing to concoct a bogus  background portfolio of materials. Who do you think the Chinese  Government would be seeing coming in? We just recently had news of  Chinese spies targeting Members of Congress--targeting prominent  Democrats. This is an espionage threat America faces of our adversaries  taking advantage of our laws and targeting our leadership.   The truth also is that China has confiscated passports and, I am  told, stopped issuing exit visas to persons deemed problematic. As a  result, China is highly unlikely to let actual dissidents leave Hong  Kong, so this bill isn't directed to help them.   But I will say this: We urgently need to have a real, substantive,  bipartisan conversation about countering the Chinese Communist Party,  about defending the United States of America, about standing up and  winning this battle. This bill doesn't advance that objective, but what  I am going to do is I am going to give our Democratic colleagues the  opportunity to actually support legislation that would stand up to  China.   So, momentarily, I am going to ask unanimous consent for one bill and  discuss a second bill that I also later intend to ask unanimous consent  to pass. But first, I object.    Mr. President, my colleague from Connecticut just said that  they were being tough on China. As I explained, this bill is not being  tough on China.   But a bit of good news: They will have the opportunity, moments from  now, to in fact be tough on China. I have introduced, roughly, a dozen  separate pieces of legislation designed to do exactly that, to stand up  to the Chinese Communist Government. I am glad also to see my  Democratic colleagues discovering the human rights travesties that are  playing out in China.   Look, my family knows the oppression of Communist governments. My  father was imprisoned and tortured in Cuba. My aunt, my Tia Sonia, was  imprisoned and tortured by Fidel Castro's thugs. So, when it comes for  standing for dissidents, there is a reason why, for 8 years, I have  gone to the Senate floor over and over and over again speaking up for  dissidents who are being tortured and oppressed by Communists. Here is  a chance for the Democrats to join us in that regard.   Mr. President, there are two separate bills that I have introduced  that I am going to discuss. The first is a bill called the SCRIPT Act.   For years, we have known that China's surveillance state and  censorship practices are used to maintain its human rights violations.  And what this devastating pandemic has shown us is that China's  surveillance state and its censorship practices are also profound  threats to our national security, to our public health, and to our  public debate, as the Chinese Government hid information about the  COVID-19 pandemic that began in Wuhan, China, hid it for months on end  and allowed millions across the globe to be threatened--their lives and  health and safety to be threatened.   In addition to their espionage activities, the Chinese Communist  Party invests billions into spreading propaganda, even using American  media outlets, telecommunication infrastructure, movies, and sports  teams to spread their propaganda, from buying media outlets so that  they broadcast propaganda into America to coercing Hollywood studios  and sports leagues to self-sensor by threatening to cut off access to  one of the world's largest markets. The Chinese Communist Party spends  billions and billions of dollars to mislead Americans about China and  to try to shape what we see, what we hear and think.   All of these activities are part of China's whole-of-state approach  to amass influence around the world through information warfare, and we  need to stand together to stop it.   That is why I will be momentarily asking for unanimous consent on the  SCRIPT Act, which would cut off Hollywood studios from the assistance  they currently receive from the U.S. Federal Government if those  studios allow the Chinese Communist Government to sensor what they are  producing.   We have seen this pattern over and over and over again--Hollywood  being complicit in China's censorship and propaganda in the name of  bigger profit. ``Bohemian Rhapsody,'' a wonderful biography of Freddie  Mercury and story of the band Queen--well, the Chinese Government was  upset that Freddie Mercury was homosexual and demanded that Hollywood  sensor scenes that showed that Freddie Mercury was homosexual. And  Hollywood--those great, woke social warriors that they are--compliantly  said: We are more interested in the money than in artistic integrity,  than in telling Freddie Mercury's story, so the Chinese Government will  happily edit out those scenes.    ``Doctor Strange,'' another movie--comic book movie--in ``Doctor  Strange,'' they changed the Ancient One's character from being from  Tibet, which is how it is portrayed in the comic book, to Celtic  because, you know, the Chinese Communist censors, they don't want to  recognize Tibet--another area that has been subject to persecution and  oppression from China--and Hollywood meekly complied.   In the sequel to ``Top Gun,'' the back of Maverick's jacket--if you  remember the first ``Top Gun,'' maybe the greatest Navy recruiting film  ever made--you find the Taiwanese flag and the Japanese flag. The  Chinese censors didn't like that, and so Hollywood meekly removed the  flags. What does it say to the world when Maverick is scared of the  Chinese Communists?   I would point out, unfortunately, the Chinese censorship is being  carried out by Hollywood billionaires who are getting richer in the  process.   In recent days, it has been reported that one of Joe Biden's top  potential choices to be Ambassador to China is the former CEO of  Disney, who happens  [[Page S7692]]  to be a major Democratic donor. Disney just came out with the movie  ``Mulan.'' In the movie ``Mulan,'' which the director described as ``a  love letter to China''--well, this love letter wasn't subtle because  right in the credits at the end of ``Mulan,'' they thanked oppressive  government forces that are running concentration camps right now, with  over 1 million Uighurs imprisoned. Disney gleefully thanked the  jackbooted thugs who are carrying out torture and murder, and  apparently the leader of that effort is one of the top candidates to be  America's Ambassador to China.   The Senator from Illinois and the Senator from Connecticut said: ``We  need to stand with people who are oppressed.'' I agree.   Look, Hollywood could say whatever they want, but there is no reason  the Federal Government should facilitate their censorship on behalf of  the Chinese Communists. The SCRIPT Act says: If you are going to let  the Chinese Communists censor your movies, you are not going to get  access to the jet planes and to the ships and all the different  material of the Federal Government that are used in movies.   Moments ago, the Senator from Connecticut said they want to be tough  on China. Well, we are about to see how tough they are on China.    I will happily yield for a question.    The Senator from Illinois asked a question. Let me tell you  how it provides solace--because people who are in hell holes, they  listen to what we are saying. People who are in hell holes, they hear  the voice--you know, some time ago, I had the chance to sit down with  Natan Sharansky, the famed Soviet dissident. He and I sat down and  visited in Jerusalem. Natan told me about how, when he was in a Soviet  gulag, that in the cells, from cell to cell, they would pass notes: Did  you hear what Ronald Reagan said? The Soviet Union is an evil empire.  Marxism-Leninism will end up on the ash heap of history. ``Mr.  Gorbachev, tear down this wall.''   And I will tell you how people here--because if the Senator from  Illinois will remember, I introduced legislation to rename the street  in front of the Chinese Embassy in the United States ``Liu Xiaobo  Plaza,'' after Liu Xiaobo, the Nobel Peace laureate who was--let me  finish answering your question. If you want to propound a second one, I  am happy to answer that one too. Liu Xiaobo was the Nobel Peace  laureate wrongfully imprisoned in China. And the strategy of renaming  the street in front of the Embassy is the strategy Reagan employed  renaming the street in front of the Soviet Embassy ``Sakharov Plaza.''   Twice I stood on this floor seeking unanimous consent, and twice a  Democrat--the senior Senator from California--stood up and objected. At  one point, the senior Senator from California said: Well, if we do  this, it will embarrass the Chinese Government.   I responded: You are understanding correctly. And that is not a bug;  it is a feature. That is the purpose.   Let me tell you what happened to that. Twice, Democrats objected to  the legislation. I then placed a hold on President Obama's nominees to  the State Department.   The Obama administration came to me and said: How could we move these  nominees forward? How could we move them forward?   I said: It is very simple. Pass my legislation, and I will lift the  hold.   The Democratic caucus didn't like that, but they ultimately agreed.  So the legislation I introduced to rename the street in front of the  Chinese Embassy ``Liu Xiaobo Plaza'' passed this body unanimously.   Ultimately, the House didn't take it up and pass it, but I will tell  you how that story ends. That story ends in 2017 when I was sitting  down with Rex Tillerson for breakfast in Foggy Bottom--the new U.S.  Secretary of State. When he spoke to his Chinese counterparts, he said:  They have come back and said that among their top three diplomatic  objectives with us is to stop your bill to rename the street in front  of the Embassy. They are terrified by the sunlight and sunshine on the  dissidents.   At the time, Liu Xiaobo had passed, but his widow, Liu Xia, was still  in China, still wrongfully held back. I told Secretary of State  Tillerson: I will tell you what. You tell the Chinese that if they  release Liu Xia, if they let her get out, I will stop pressing this  particular bill. If they don't, I will keep pressing it, and we will  pass it again because we have already done it.   Within weeks, China released Liu Xia.   So you ask, how does this help the people in prison? By not having  Hollywood media moguls spreading Chinese propaganda.   But let me give you a second choice, very directly. Do you want to  know how people are helped? It is a second bill called the SHAME Act,  which, if our Democratic colleagues want to be tough on China, we could  pass right now.   What does the SHAME Act do? The SHAME Act focuses in particular on  human rights atrocities. It focuses on over 1 million Uighurs in  concentration camps and other religious minorities and the Falun Gong  practitioners who are captured and murdered and whose organs are  harvested. And the Chinese Communist Party engages in yet another  horror.   My Democratic colleagues like to say on the question of abortion that  they are pro-choice. Well, the Chinese Communist government right now  is engaging in forced sterilizations and forced abortions, taking  Uighur mothers and forcing them to abort their children against their  will.   Whatever the Democrats' views on abortion in the United States as a  matter of a woman's choice, surely they must be united in saying that a  government forcing a woman to abort her child, to take the life of her  unborn child, is an unspeakable atrocity.   So the SHAME Act does something very simple: It imposes sanctions on  the Chinese Communist government leaders responsible for implementing  this horrific, 1984-style policy of forced sterilizations and forced  abortions.   I had intended to seek unanimous consent for the SHAME Act as well,  but my Democratic colleagues have said they are not yet able to find a  Democrat to object, although my understanding is they intend to. I hope  they reconsider that.   A terrific ending for today's debate would be passing the SHAME Act  and saying: We are all standing together against forced abortions and  grotesque human rights violations. Maybe that will happen. Maybe it  won't. But let's find out where we are on the question of the SCRIPT  Act.    If the Senator from Connecticut--I have not yet yielded the  floor. I am about to ask unanimous consent, so--    Mr. President, as if in legislative session, I ask  unanimous consent that the Committee on Homeland Security and  Governmental Affairs be discharged from further consideration of S.  3835 and the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration; further,  that this bill be considered read a third time and passed and that the  motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no  intervening action or debate.    Three brief observations: No. 1, the Senator from  Connecticut said multiple times that the House bill in question passed  the House unanimously. I am sure this is inadvertent, but what the  Senator from Connecticut said is simply wrong. It passed the House by  voice vote, which is a very different thing from passing unanimously.  It simply means the vote tally was not recorded.   Secondly, the Senator from Connecticut said the SCRIPT Act is not  going to pass this Congress. Well, that appears to be correct, but that  is for one reason and one reason only, which is the final two words  uttered by the Senator from Connecticut: ``I object.''   Quite literally by doing nothing, quite literally by giving the  identical speech he had just given and then closing his mouth before  those final two words--had that occurred, the SCRIPT Act would have  passed this body unanimously.   So the only reason the SCRIPT Act isn't passing is because the Senate  Democrats are objecting. And it should not be lost on anybody that the  Hollywood billionaires who are enriching themselves with this Chinese  propaganda are among the biggest political donors to today's Democratic  Party in the entire country.   The Senator from Connecticut said: Well, the SCRIPT Act might make it  possible to have documentaries on the human rights abuses in China. Oh,  really. That argument staggers the mind. It so defies reality because-- you know what--Hollywood doesn't make movies about the human rights  abuses in China.   Earlier this year, I had the opportunity to meet Richard Gear. Now,  Richard Gear is not someone you would ordinarily imagine palling around  with a conservative Republican from Texas, but Richard Gear was up  here. He was up here actually standing up against Chinese abuses and  urging anyone who would listen--Republican or Democrat--to stand with  him.   Do you know Richard Gear has not made a single major Hollywood movie  in a decade? Why? Because he dared stand with Tibet, and the Hollywood  billionaires blackballed Richard Gear. If you speak out for Tibet, if  you do what the Senator from Connecticut just suggested and discuss the  Chinese human rights abuses--it doesn't matter that Richard Gear used  to be an A-list Hollywood blockbuster actor--boom--his career is dead  because no studio will produce a movie with him because he spoke the  truth.   By the way, my bill presents zero barriers to someone actually making  a documentary on the human rights abuses in China because, presumably,  if you are making that documentary, you wouldn't allow the Chinese  Communist Government to censor it.   I don't know what kind of documentaries the Senator from Connecticut  is familiar with, but I am not familiar with documentaries done on  tyrants and concentration camps where you let the concentration camp  guards edit out the stuff they don't like. That ain't a documentary.   The Senator from Connecticut said perhaps we can work together in a  bipartisan manner to address this. I hope so. Standing together against  the oppression of the Chinese Communists would be a very good thing for  the U.S. Senate. It would be a very good thing for our country.  Unfortunately, at least today, that hasn't yet happened.   I yield the floor.    Thank you.                    Unanimous Consent Request--S. Res. 806
