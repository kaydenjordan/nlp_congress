 Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for  the nomination of Bonnie Jenkins to be the next Under Secretary for  Arms Control and International Security.   The position for which Ambassador Jenkins has been nominated is one  of the most vital senior security positions in the Department of State.  This individual is responsible for overseeing nuclear policy and  nonproliferation efforts, directing U.S. arms sales and security  assistance policy, dealing with the legacies of unexploded munitions  and landmines, and orchestrating global cooperation among both allies  and adversaries on critical national security issues.   As the United States is preparing for its first Strategic Stability  Dialogue with Russia, which will occur later this month, it is  absolutely critical we have a Senate-confirmed leader in the State  Department to effectively compete with and confront Moscow's challenges  to our national security. This meeting will set the tone for U.S.  diplomatic efforts to limit Russia's nuclear arsenal, which is crucial  at a time when we are also witnessing the initial stages of a major  build-up of Chinese nuclear forces.   I am pleased to be supporting Ambassador Jenkins's nomination for  this position, and I am confident that her extensive experience in the  State Department and her 22 years in the Air Force and Naval Reserves  provide her with the type of background and knowledge required to meet  the challenges that await her, if confirmed.   During the Obama administration, Ambassador Jenkins' spearheaded  efforts to fight nuclear terrorism. She helped coordinate four nuclear  security summits which sought to persuade nations around the world to  secure vulnerable nuclear material that might fall into the hands of  dangerous actors.   For over 20 years, she served as an intelligence officer in the U.S.  Naval Reserves, retiring as a lieutenant commander. She also holds  multiple degrees, including a Ph.D., a master of laws, a law degree,  and a master in public administration.   Outside of government she has consistently empowered voices rarely  heard in national security debates, providing a different but important  perspective on how the United States should tackle the threats we  confront.   The fact that Ambassador Jenkin's nomination, someone whose  leadership is so essential to the State Department and to our national  security, has languished on the Senate floor for 56 days is a travesty.   I urge my colleagues to support her nomination and make sure that  this critical national security position is filled without further  delay.                          Vote on Jenkins Nomination     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may place  into the Record a portion of the final report by the National Security  Commission on Artificial Intelligence,  [[Page S5011]]  NSCAI. This landmark report and its important recommendations are the  result of the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act for  Fiscal Year 2019, which established the NSCAI as an independent  commission ``to consider the methods and means necessary to advance the  development of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and  associated technologies to comprehensively address the national  security and defense needs of the United States.''   In March 2021, the Commission submitted its final report to Congress  and the President, in part, warning of the dangers of the Chinese  Government obtaining the personal genetic information of U.S. citizens  and the importance of ensuring U.S. leadership in biotechnology. As we  complete our work on the United States Innovation and Competition Act  that will enable us to maintain our technological edge over China, it  is imperative that we acknowledge the findings of this Commission  regarding the critical importance of securing our biodata from China  and its agents. To that end, allow me to cite warnings and  recommendations directly from this Commission. I hope our State  Department leadership, including Secretary Blinken, take these into  serious consideration and put them into action.   On Page 53, the report finds: ``[China understands the tremendous  upside associated with leading the bio revolution. Massive genomic data  sets at places like BGI Group (formerly known as the Beijing Genomics  Institute), coupled with China's now-global genetic data collection  platform and ``all-of-nation'' approach to AI, will make them a  formidable competitor in the bio realm. BGI may be serving, wittingly  or unwittingly, as a global collection mechanism for Chinese government  genetic databases, providing China with greater raw numbers and  diversity of human genome samples, as well as access to sensitive  personal information about key individuals around the world. The United  States cannot afford to look back in 10 years and be ``surprised'' by  the biotechnology equivalent of Huawei.]''   Later, on Page 586, the report finds: ``[BGI has also benefited from  substantial support from the Chinese government, as well as its 2013  acquisition of a competing U.S. firm, Complete Genomics. There are  indications that BGI's links with the Chinese government may run deeper  than it publicly claims, as it built and operates China National  GeneBank, the Chinese government's national genetic database, and has  used PLA-owned supercomputers to process genetic information. Chinese  diplomats have pushed BGI-built COVID-19 testing kits, including in the  United States, and by August 2020 BGI had ``sold 35 million rapid  COVID-19 testing kits to 180 countries, and built 58 labs in 18  countries.'' The highest levels of the United States government should  publicly state these concerns so as to raise awareness among the U.S.  commercial and academic biotechnology communities, as well as U.S.  allies, many of which currently have partnerships or business dealings  with BGI.]''   The Commission then recommends on Page 587 that the State Department  design a specific initiative to warn America and its allies about BGI.  ``[Launch a strategic communications campaign to publicly highlight the  links between the Chinese government and BGI. The Secretary of State  should personally voice concern about BGI's ties to the Chinese  government and instruct the Department to conduct a strategic  communications campaign to highlight those links and warn of the  dangers of the Chinese government obtaining personal genetic  information via BGI. The Department should also warn BGI and the  Chinese government that it will closely monitor BGI's activities, and  that should BGI be utilized as a mass DNA-collection apparatus for the  Chinese government, it could face additional U.S. regulatory action.]''   It is important to note that two subsidiaries of BGI were placed on  the entity list by the Commerce Department last year for their role in  aiding the genocide being perpetrated by the Chinese Government against  the Uyghur minority in Xinjiang, an issue that I and many of my Senate  colleagues have been vocal on.   In closing, I think it is important that this report be part of our  Record today.                            ____________________
