 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk, and I  ask for its consideration.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 2 minutes.   Mr. Chairman, I don't get to say this often, but I agree with Senator  Ted Cruz. Yesterday, along with members of the Texas congressional  delegation, he wrote to President Trump. Part of his letter read: `` .  . . we are strongly opposed to using funds appropriated by Congress for  disaster relief and mitigation for Texas for any unintended purpose.''   I agree. Disaster funding should go where Congress intended: to the  sites of actual disasters, to communities dealing with things like  hurricanes, mudslides, wildfires and floods.  [[Page H648]]    That is what my amendment is all about. It states that none of the  funds in this disaster supplemental for the Army Corps of Engineers or  Department of Homeland Security may be used to plan, develop, or  construct the President's border wall. It is that simple.   If someone like me, a progressive Member of the House, can see eye to  eye with Senator Ted Cruz on this, one of the biggest cheerleaders for  the President's border wall, then this amendment should pass with broad  bipartisan support.   It isn't about whether or not you support building a border wall; it  is about whether we support a President moving disaster funding away  from where Congress said it should go, away from communities that are  rebuilding. These people aren't interested in building a wall. They  need to rebuild their homes.   So today, we are talking about President Trump and the wall. But, Mr.  Chairman, if we don't take a strong stand against subverting the will  of Congress this time, then it opens the door for the next President,  Democrat or Republican, to use disaster funding as a piggy bank for  their priority, whatever it may be.   I think the border wall would be ineffective and a waste of taxpayer  dollars, but you can disagree with me and still support my amendment,  because we all should agree that no President should be redirecting  funding away from where Congress said it should go.   The supplemental provides $12 billion in disaster relief for  communities trying to rebuild. Let's make sure every penny actually  goes to disaster relief.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I include in the Record a letter to the  President from the Texas delegation objecting to using disaster money  for the border wall.   These individuals support the wall, I assume most of them do, but  they don't support the President's promise that he might use executive  powers to go into disaster money to pay for the border wall.                                                     U.S. Senate,                                   Washington, DC, January 15, 2019.      Hon. Donald Trump,      President of the United States,      The White House, Washington, DC.        Mr. President: The widespread flooding, storm surges and       high winds that resulted from Hurricane Harvey's landfall       (DR-4332) left many parts of the Texas coast paralyzed for       months. Harvey leveled thousands of homes and businesses,       altering many Texas communities forever. This disaster       required a massive, coordinated response at the state, local       and federal levels to help individuals restore their lives to       normal as quickly as possible. Texas continues to rebuild       through coordinated efforts at all levels of government and       important work is underway to mitigate against future storms.        We--and the millions of Texas citizens we represent--remain       thankful to the numerous federal agencies and first       responders who coordinated and contributed resources and       personnel. Shortly after the rains subsided, Congress swiftly       acted by passing three separate disaster supplemental bills,       including the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (P.L. 115-123),       which contained over $15 billion dollars for U.S. Army Corps       of Engineers civil works projects.        Recent reports have indicated that your Administration is       considering the use of U.S. Army Corps of Engineers funds,       appropriated by Congress and intended for Hurricane Harvey       recovery and mitigation efforts, in an effort to secure our       southern border. We strongly support securing the border with       additional federal resources including tactical       infrastructure, technology, ports of entry improvements and       personnel. However, we are strongly opposed to using funds       appropriated by Congress for disaster relief and mitigation       for Texas for any unintended purpose. As Texans continue to       rebuild and prepare for future disasters, these funds,       appropriated by Congress to be spent directly on rebuilding       and mitigation, are critical to helping our communities       recover, preventing future flooding and protecting our       constituents. Thank you for your commitment to help Texas       respond to Hurricane Harvey and to secure the southern       border. We ask that you ensure necessary efforts on border       security do not jeopardize long-term hurricane recovery and       mitigation in Texas.            Sincerely,          Greg Abbott, Governor, State of Texas; John Cornyn, U.S.             Senator; Ted Cruz, U.S. Senator; Michael McCaul, Member             of Congress; Randy Weber, Member of Congress; Will             Hurd, Member of Congress; Kevin Brady, Member of             Congress; Pete Olson, Member of Congress; Lance Gooden,             Member of Congress; Brian Babin, Member of Congress;             Kenny Marchant, Member of Congress, Bill Flores, Member             of Congress; Dan Crenshaw, Member of Congress; Lizzie             Fletcher, Member of Congress; K. Michael Conaway,             Member of Congress; Roger Williams, Member of Congress,             Kay Granger, Member of Congress; John Carter, Member of             Congress; Sheila Jackson Lee, Member of Congress;             Filemon Vela, Member of Congress; Vicente Gonzalez,             Member of Congress, Henry Cuellar, Member of Congress;             Sylvia Garcia, Member of Congress.     Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Escobar).    Madam Chair, I would inquire how many more speakers the  gentlewoman has.    Madam Chair, how much time do I have remaining?    Madam Chair, I want to thank Representatives Velazquez,  Hastings, Torres, Jackson Lee, Jayapal, Pocan, and Escobar for  cosponsoring this amendment with me.   This is not about whether or not you believe a border wall is  necessary or not. I don't believe it is. Some of my friends on the  other side believe it is. But when the President said he was going to  declare an emergency and dip into emergency funds, disaster funds, that  are dedicated to helping people deal with real disasters to pay for  this wall, that set off alarm bells here.   So no matter what side you are on on this border wall issue, you  should support this amendment, because this President, and no  President, should dip into disaster relief money to use it for  something different than what Congress intended.   The people who this money is aimed at helping are not interested in  building a wall; they are interested in rebuilding their homes.   Let us not put these moneys in jeopardy. Let's have a bipartisan  moment when we all can agree that the disaster money ought to be  disaster money, period.  [[Page H649]]    Madam Chair, I urge a strong vote in favor of this amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
