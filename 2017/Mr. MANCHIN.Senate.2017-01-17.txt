 Mr. President, I thank my most generous friend from  Rhode Island, Senator Whitehouse, for allowing me to speak for a few  minutes.   (The remarks of Mr. Manchin pertaining to the introduction of S. 175  are printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills  and Joint Resolutions.'')    Again, I thank the Senator.    Mr. President, I am back again to introduce the Miners  Protection Act.   It is bipartisan. We worked on it in a bipartisan manner, and we  said: If it comes to the floor, we will pass it. So we are here again.   This is a promise that was made since 1946. These are men who have  worked hard. They paid through the hard work they have accomplished  through their own sweat, and we are trying to make sure they have their  permanent fix to their health care and to their pensions. This is  something that has a pay-for. It is back up again. It should have been  done last year. We had an extension at the end until April. April is  going to come and go again, and then we are going to start playing  politics with this. If we get this done now and get it done quickly, it  is something that we can move on, and we can take care of the other  problems we have.   Again, this is the Miners Protection Act, which our miners have  worked for, earned, and deserved. Their widows and families are  expecting this. They need this in order to live any type of a quality  life.   I thank you, again. I thank all of my colleagues--my Republican  friends for signing onto this piece of legislation and all of my  Democratic caucus, which unanimously signed onto it. It is something  that should be done and done quickly.                                  ______                                         By Mr. McCONNELL:   S. 176. A bill to amend the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation  Act of 1977 to transfer certain funds to the Multiemployer Health  Benefit Plan, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.
