 Mr. Speaker, I rise this morning to address the growing  threat of Delta 8 across communities in Nebraska.   For anyone who may not be following this issue yet, Delta 8 is a  variant of THC and is derived from cannabis. Today, retailers across  Nebraska are selling THC-laced products aimed at kids. For example, a  retailer in Madison County has allegedly been selling gummies  containing 200 times the level of THC needed to send a kid to the  hospital. Delta 8 products are made to look like common types of candy  or snacks to appeal to children.   I am glad Nebraska is cracking down on Delta 8, which are illegal  even in States that have legalized recreational marijuana. Attorney  General Mike Hilgers has filed complaints in 10 counties across  Nebraska as he works to confront this challenge.   I commend him and others across the country who are taking action to  stop the threat of Delta 8 that is hurting our children.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage everyone watching to visit AGO.Nebraska.gov  to learn more.                 Saluting Nebraska State Treasurer Tom Briese     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to salute the service of newly- appointed Nebraska State Treasurer Tom Briese.   For almost 7 years, Tom honorably served the people of District 41 in  the unicameral. I sat next to him on our State's revenue committee.  During those years, he fought hard to reform the State's high property  taxes and school funding formula.   Over the course of time in the legislature, he worked with both  Governor Ricketts and Governor Pillen to deliver historic tax relief.   Earlier this year, Governor Pillen announced that he would appoint  Senator Briese to fill a vacancy in the role of State treasurer.   Tom brings with him a wealth of experience in working with the  legislature and State senators to shape public policy. He leads an  office that manages the State's college savings plan and unclaimed  property programs while watching over the State's resources.   I know Tom will do an outstanding job in his new role and I wish him  all the best as he takes on this new challenge.   Mr. Speaker, I wish the treasurer best wishes in the years ahead.          Congratulating Hampton Enterprises on 75 Years of Business     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Hampton  Enterprises on 75 years of business. The late Joe Hampton opened the  real estate and construction company in Lincoln, Nebraska, in 1948 when  he was just 22 years old.   Throughout the past 75 years, Hampton has constructed everything from  houses to offices to the Pinnacle Bank Arena. Hampton has an impressive  and extensive list of arenas, schools, and offices, and with all of  these buildings comes numerous tenants and customers.   One tenant has been renting office space from Hampton for nearly 40  years. He says they offer a complete spectrum of services. Hampton  prides themselves on maintaining their core values of integrity,  quality, work ethic, relationships, and stewardship, which is likely  why they have found so much success.   Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the people of Nebraska's First  Congressional District, I congratulate Hampton Enterprises on 75 years.                               Biden-Xi Meeting     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address the upcoming meeting  between President Joe Biden and China's President Xi Jinping.   President Biden and President Xi are expected to meet later this  month during the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit. Leading  Biden Cabinet members have been meeting with high-level officials from  the Chinese Communist Party in recent months.   The focus of these meetings has been framed as ``engagement.'' While  that might sound nice, the Biden administration's approach has weakened  America's position in relation to China.   The CCP respects strength, and America must project it if we are  going to succeed in this new era of competition. If President Biden  wants to find success in this policy area, he needs to be willing to  communicate clear principles around national security, trade, and human  rights as he meets with their President. Failure to do this will only  mean America's ability to compete against China will fade away.   Mr. Speaker, I wish President Biden all the best as he takes on this  challenge. I hope he is up to it.        Recognizing Beckenhauer Construction on 145 Years in Business.     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Beckenhauer  Construction of Norfolk, Nebraska, on 145 years in business.   Since 1878, Beckenhauer has built everything from churches to schools  to hospitals and community projects built around the good life. Today,  it is still a family business being run by the fourth and fifth  generations.   They have been involved in the Box Butte General Hospital and the  Boone County health clinic. The University of Nebraska had them  renovate the UNL Barkley Memorial Center in Lincoln just last year.   Beckenhauer Construction's reach extends beyond Nebraska. They  recently broke ground on a new law enforcement center in Clay County,  South Dakota.   The Beckenhauer commitment is to hold the standards of quality,  reliability, integrity, safety, and honesty to provide unparalleled  service to their clients. That is why they are likely to grow for  another 145 years and beyond.   Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Beckenhauer Construction and wish them  the best in the years to come.                            ____________________
