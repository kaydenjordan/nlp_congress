 Mr. President, I come to the floor with my colleague  Senator Flake from Arizona to send a strong, clear, and, importantly, a  bipartisan message to the American people that we stand with the men  and women of the Department of Justice and the men and women of the  U.S. intelligence community.   We support the ongoing investigation into Russian interference in our  elections, and we must act--and act unequivocally--to hold Russia  accountable for its actions.   Just 3 days after the U.S. intelligence community issued a detailed  and staggering finding that led to an indictment against 12 Russian  military intelligence officers for interfering in our 2016 election,  President Trump stood shoulder to shoulder with President Putin and  failed to challenge Putin's claim that his government played no role in  the effort to undermine our democracy.   In fact, when asked, at the time, whether he believed Putin's denial  or the U.S. intelligence community, President Trump said: ``I have  confidence in both parties.''   He has subsequently walked back those comments, but I think it is  important that the Senate be on the record as saying that our  intelligence community is clear, our law enforcement community is  clear, and today the Senate should be clear.   So today Senator Flake and I are putting forward a resolution that,  in its language, commends the Department of Justice for its ongoing  investigation into Russia's interference in our last election--the one  that led to last week's 11-count indictment, offering the most thorough  and detailed accounting to date of Russia's complex effort to sow doubt  and create chaos in the months leading up to our last election.   The resolution also reaffirms the intelligence community's assessment  of Russian interference and asserts that Russia must be held to account  for its actions. This can be accomplished in part by immediately and  responsibly implementing sanctions provided for in the Countering  America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, or CAATSA, which this body  passed 98 to 2 this summer.   Finally, following the President's summit with Putin in Helsinki,  today's resolution calls for prompt hearings and the release of notes  to better understand what the two leaders discussed and may have agreed  to during their one-on-one meeting, which ran for over 2 hours.   I am encouraged by hearings that have already been scheduled, but I  think it is important that it be clear that our Senate seeks a role in  engagement and oversight.   Congress and the American people deserve to know what promises or  concessions may have been made to President Putin, and thorough  hearings with senior officials, including Secretary Pompeo, are  critical.   This resolution is a first step--a good first step--but we need to be  clear-eyed. President Putin of Russia will not stop until we stop him.  We know we face continued threats to our elections in 2018 and beyond.  Just last week, Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats, our former  colleague here in the Senate, cautioned that the warning lights are  blinking red again on cyber attacks against our Nation. He said:         These actions are persistent, they are pervasive, and they       are meant to undermine America's Democracy. Attacks on our       country's digital infrastructure [are] made principally by       Russia.    He said:         Russia is the most aggressive foreign actor and the worst       offender.    So we know that we continue to face hostile threats. FBI Director  Chris Wray said just yesterday: ``Russia is still working to sow  division in the United States and continues to engage in malign actions  against our country.''  [[Page S5086]]    So we need to join arms and look forward to protecting our next  election. Today's resolution is an important first step, but I think we  should work together to take up and pass the DETER Act, introduced by  Senators Rubio and Van Hollen, to deter Russia from interfering in our  next election.   I think we should take up and consider the Lankford-Klobuchar Secure  Elections Act to strengthen election cyber security.   Of course, I would like to see my Special Counsel Independence and  Integrity Act taken up as well. We can build on $380 million invested  in election security, grants provided by this Congress to the States  back in March to help bolster their election systems against threats.   It is important to remember that Putin and Putin's Russia are  attacking other democratic processes throughout Europe. As Americans,  as Senators, we need to stand up and fight for our democracy and the  rule of law.   I had a memorable conversation with the Ukrainian leader last year,  who said to me: If you don't defend your own elections, your own  democracy, how can the rest of us count on you to defend ours?   This resolution makes clear that, on a bipartisan basis, we intend to  defend our democracy. Russia's attacks on our last elections where  attacks on every American--Republicans and Democrats. The threat is  great, it is pressing, and it demands that we act.   Today's resolution is a first step and an important one, and I call  on my colleagues to join us in supporting it. If there is any Senator  who disagrees with this very basic resolution, I look forward to  hearing their reasons.   Let me close by thanking my colleague and friend Senator Flake, from  Arizona, for having taken the initiative and the lead in introducing  this important resolution. We may not agree on everything, but we agree  on this important principle: We should stand up and be counted in  defense of our democracy.     Madam President, I join my colleague from Arizona in  briefly remarking on my regret that our resolution was not adopted  today.   It does call for the full implementation of mandatory sanctions as  discussed at some length. It does not call for the reckless  implementation of mandatory sanctions.   There is a significant range of sanctions already provided for in  this law, adopted 98 to 2 by this body, that have not yet been adopted.  I recognize that this resolution, standing strong behind the Department  of Justice, the intelligence community, and its ongoing investigation  is, as was referenced, a symbolic act, but there are moments when  symbolism and standing together are important.   I look forward to continuing to work closely with my colleague and  friend from Arizona to ensure that this resolution is adopted, that the  American people and the men and women of our Federal law enforcement  agencies and our intelligence community understand that this body  strongly supports them and their work and sees clearly the ongoing and  continuing threat to  [[Page S5088]]  our democracy posed by President Putin and Putin's Russia.   Thank you.
