 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                      Recognition of the Minority Leader    The Democratic leader is recognized.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak on  leader time.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                          Nomination of David Stras     Mr. President, I know we have a vote coming up soon.   First, on the judge vote, today the Senate will vote on cloture on  the nomination of David Stras for the Eighth Circuit in Minnesota.  Senator Franken opposed this nomination and did not return his blue  slip, but Senator Grassley scheduled the confirmation hearing and a  markup anyway. It is my understanding that the new Senator from  Minnesota, Ms. Smith, intends to vote against his nomination.   If Judge Stras is confirmed, it will mark the first time since 1982  that a circuit court nominee was confirmed without both home State  Senators returning blue slips in support of a hearing. Democratic and  Republican chairs have stuck to the blue slip rule, despite the  tensions in this body. So this is a major step back--another way that  the majority is slowly and inexorably gnawing away at the way this body  works and making it more and more and more like the House of  Representatives. It is not a legacy, if I were the leader or a Member  of that party, that I would be proud of.                             Republican Tax Bill    Mr. President, tomorrow President Trump will address the Nation in  his first State of the Union. We all look forward to hearing what the  President has to say. One thing we can expect is for the President to  link any good piece of economic news to the Republican tax bill, as the  majority leader does most days and did again today. Of course, the  reality of the Republican tax bill is much different than the image  painted by the leader's cherry-picked examples.   One of the real impacts of the tax bill has been massive giveaways to  wealthy investors and corporate executives. The very wealthiest and the  most powerful got the overwhelming majority of the breaks. As for  individuals, some got increases, some stayed the same, and some will  get a little bit.   Companies have announced multibillion-dollar stock-buyback  repurchasing programs, which benefit wealthy shareholders, not workers.  According to Morgan Stanley, ``83% of analysts indicated that companies  would put gains from lower taxes to use for share buybacks, dividends,  and mergers and acquisitions.'' So we will have less competition  because this tax bill has given the big corporations money so they can  buy other corporations and reduce competition.   Even though Republicans sold it as a job creator, there have been a  slew of layoffs in this country just after the tax bill passed.  Walmart, which made a big to-do of what it was doing for its workers,  is shuttering 63 Sam's Club warehouses and laying off 1,000 workers at  their headquarters. Macy's will cut 5,000 jobs. Carrier, a company the  President promised to save, is still bleeding jobs. Kimberly-Clark will  cut up to 5,500 jobs, and their chief financial officer said the  savings from the Republican tax bill gave them the ``flexibility''--his  word--to make these reductions. So the tax bill is actually leading to  a whole lot of layoffs. We don't hear that from President Trump or our  Republican colleagues, but it is true.   Another one of the real impacts of the tax bill will be felt on tax  day, when the Nation's highest income earners, the top 1 percent, will  get an average tax cut of roughly $50,000, while more than 9 million  middle-class families will face a tax increase, according to the JCT  and the Tax Policy Center.   It is true that bipartisan, deficit-neutral tax reform could have  delivered more jobs and better pay for the middle class, but President  Trump and congressional leaders opted for a partisan bill that rewarded  their wealthy donors, big corporations, and the superrich, and it  increased the deficit that our children and grandchildren will have to  pay by $1.5 trillion. I don't expect the President or the Republican  leader to mention these facts. I certainly don't think the President  will mention them in the State of the Union. But Democrats will  highlight them in days to come.                           Issues Before the Senate    Now, Mr. President, when we passed the last extension of government  funding, we gave ourselves a lengthy to-do list: Pass a budget, provide  disaster aid, negotiate a healthcare package, and protect the Dreamers.  We have been talking about these issues for months without resolution.  Now is the time to start solving them. We have waited too long to fully  fund our military. We have waited too long to dedicate more money to  the opioid crisis, which is stealing 40,000 American lives a year. We  have waited too long to improve veterans healthcare, which our veterans  receive. Many are waiting in line still to get treatment. We waited too  long to address failing pension plans, which are the safety net for so  many teamsters, carpenters, miners, and people approaching retirement.  We have waited too long to give the 800,000 Dreamers the peace of mind  that they will not be deported by the only country they have known.   We need to address these issues soon--no more delay. We hope our  moderate Senators will strive to find a narrow bill on DACA and border  security that can actually pass. Expanding this beyond DACA and beyond  border security, as the White House framework tries to do, will only  delay a solution to this time-sensitive problem.   Now, my guest at tomorrow's State of the Union will highlight the  urgency of a few issues I have just mentioned. Her name is Stephanie  Keegan. She is from Putnam County, NY. Her son Daniel, a veteran of the  war in Afghanistan, died from an opioid overdose. At the time, Daniel  was suffering from a severe case of PTSD. His nerves were shattered by  war. He waited 16 months for treatment at the VA--16 months, after he  served us so well. That is a shocking amount of time for a young man  who bravely served his country to wait for his country to serve him.  Daniel died 2 weeks before he was given his first appointment at the  VA.   There are many things that can be done to change this situation, Mrs.  Keegan told me. She is so right. We can provide better healthcare to  our veterans. We can do more to fight the scourge of opioid addiction.  We can fulfill the promise to hundreds of thousands of pensioners who  need money. We can make sure Social Security works. We can make sure  the kids waiting for college who have to pay for college can get there  a little easier. So I hope Stephanie's presence at tomorrow's speech  inspires an urgency to tackle these challenges.                                     FBI    Finally, Mr. President, I want to return to a topic I addressed at  some length last Thursday--the ongoing scorched-earth campaign by the  White House, rightwing media, and some Republicans in Congress to  destroy the integrity of the FBI and the investigation into  interference in the 2016 election. This ongoing scorched-earth campaign  weakens law enforcement and weakens the FBI--one of our best agencies.   We recently learned that President Trump, at one point last summer,  directed the firing of Special Counsel Mueller--what would have been a  shocking and unambiguous obstruction of justice--only to be pulled  back.   Today, we learned that the Deputy Director of the FBI, Andrew McCabe,  will be stepping down immediately. He has been attacked by the White  House relentlessly.   As soon as this evening, the House will vote to release the contents  of a secret memo prepared by the Republican majority on the House  Intelligence Committee that insinuates the FBI and Department of  Justice's investigation into Russia's interference in our elections is  politically biased.   According to the ranking member of that committee, Representative  Schiff, this memo is full of innuendo and glaring omissions. It  presents evidence without context and jumps to unfounded conclusions.  We should call it what it truly is: a slanderous memo of GOP talking  points.   This is not an erudite study. This is a bunch of talking points to  discredit an agency that is doing a good job, that we all have  supported and respected over the years.  [[Page S545]]    If Republicans vote to release their memo of partisan talking points  tonight, they should also vote to release the memo prepared by Ranking  Member Schiff, and let everyone judge both on the merits. Let both  memos go forward. What is good for the goose is good for the gander. It  would be absolute hypocrisy for House Republicans to release their memo  and not allow Representative Schiff to release his.   Everyone should keep in mind who is promoting this stuff. Who is  promoting these rightwing talking points, defaming the FBI? None other  than Russian-linked bots. They are using the hashtag ``Release the  Memo'' 100 more times than any other hashtag by Kremlin-linked  accounts. Putin and the Kremlin are trying at all times to undermine  our democracy through the spread of false information.   What does it say about the Republican memo that the Kremlin is  pushing it more than they are pushing anything else right now? At this  point, every American should wonder whether the House Republicans are  working harder for Putin or for the American people--at least those  House Republicans who put together this memo.   This Republican talking points memo is part of a pattern of behavior  from this White House and their Republican allies in Congress--not  everyone, just some--and the hard-right media. They do not welcome the  results of Special Counsel Mueller's investigation, so they are trying  to smear the investigation and the entire FBI before it concludes. We  all know agents; we all know how hard they work and how decent they  are.   The attacks on the credibility of the FBI are beyond the pale. They  have fueled wild speculation and outright paranoia--talks of ``coups''  and ``deep states'' and ``secret societies.'' It brings shame on the  folks propagating this nonsense, but more crucially, it diminishes our  great country.   When prominent voices in one of our country's two major political  parties are outright attacking the FBI and the Department of Justice-- the pillars of American law enforcement--they are playing right into  Mr. Putin's hands. They are unfairly and dishonestly clouding a crucial  investigation into Russia's interference in our elections--a matter of  most serious concern for every American. It is abhorrent. It must stop.   I yield the floor.                                Cloture Motion    The PRESIDING OFFICER. Pursuant to rule XXII, the Chair lays before  the Senate the pending cloture motion, which the clerk will state.   The legislative clerk read as follows:                               Cloture Motion         We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the       provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate,       do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to       proceed to S. 2311, a bill to amend title 18, United States       Code, to protect pain-capable unborn children, and for other       purposes.          Mitch McConnell, John Boozman, Jerry Moran, Marco Rubio,             Deb Fischer, John Barrasso, Richard Burr, John Cornyn,             Thom Tillis, John Hoeven, Tom Cotton, Joni Ernst, James             M. Inhofe, Steve Daines, Mike Crapo, James Lankford,             Roy Blunt.    The PRESIDING OFFICER. By unanimous consent, the mandatory quorum  call has been waived.   The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that debate on the  motion to proceed to S. 2311, a bill to amend title 18, United States  Code, to protect pain-capable unborn children, and for other purposes,  shall be brought to a close?   The yeas and nays are mandatory under the rule.   The clerk will call the roll.   The bill clerk called the roll.
