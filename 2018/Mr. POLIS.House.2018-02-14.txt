 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Olympic  athletes from the great State of Colorado. The Olympics are a  demonstration of fellowship, sportsmanship, commitment, determination,  and grit--a wonderful example for the world.   There are 36 Olympians participating from Colorado, the most from any  State in the USA, and they are competing in 17 different disciplines. I  am proud to say that 12 of these Olympic athletes are from Colorado's  Second Congressional District. Lindsey Vonn, Mikaela Shiffrin, Sarah  Schleper, Joanne Reid, Casey Andringa, Chris Del Bosco, Jaelin Kauf,  Mike Testwuide, Katie Uhlaender, Chris Corning, Kyle Mack, and Red  Gerard all hail from the Second Congressional District of Colorado.   And I am exceptionally proud that this past Saturday Red Gerard, at  17 years old, from Silverthorne, Colorado, won the Pyeongchang Olympic  Gold Medal for the United States, the first Olympic Gold Medal for Team  USA, before going from last place to first place on the final run. Red  learned to snowboard right in his backyard in beautiful Summit County.   Another young Coloradoan, Arielle Gold--and Gold is a great name if  you are going to be an Olympian--despite dislocating her shoulder in  training earlier in the week, is bringing home a bronze medal in the  women's halfpipe.   Those are just two of the 36 Olympic stories from Colorado. I wish I  had time to talk about the other 34 because their dedication,  perseverance, and spirit is an inspiration to all Americans, and I am  rooting for them every step of the way.   USA. USA. USA.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me the customary 30  minutes.   Mr. Speaker, today, sadly, we find ourselves considering legislation  that would actually make it easier for unscrupulous payday lenders to  actually skirt State interest rate caps and another bill that guts  enforcement of the Americans with Disabilities Act that puts an unfair  burden on people with disabilities.   These bills hurt the American people. Instead of spending our time  here debating a very important immigration bill, like the Senate is  doing across the way, we are considering bills that will only harm our  most vulnerable populations.   Over on the other side of the Capitol, the Senate is having an open  debate about immigration in our country. This House owes the American  people no less. The Senate is trying to find solutions to help the  hundreds of thousands of DACA recipients, to improve border security,  or to address family reunification. The Senate is debating different  proposals from both sides of  [[Page H1138]]  the aisle. We will see what they come up with.   Again, this House is simply not doing its job. This House is doing  nothing to improve border security, nothing to address the DACA  recipients or family reunification. Over here, there is not even a plan  to bring any immigration bill or amendment to the floor. In fact, there  is no commitment at all to actually address the issues that the  American people care about. We have bipartisan bills today that Speaker  Ryan could bring to the floor. They would pass with probably 70 or 60  percent of the vote.    Mr. Speaker, the March 5 deadline for DACA protections is rapidly  approaching. There is no plan in place to protect Dreamers like  Anareli, Marcos, and Javier in my district. Instead, over 800,000 young  adults are trying to see what happens next, hoping that the court  system intervenes, hoping that somebody somewhere does something so  they can continue to live and work legally in the only country that  they know, the country that they call home, the United States of  America.   I have offered the Dream Act as an amendment to every spending bill  that has come through the Rules Committee. I will continue to do so  until we finally get it done.   But, again, instead of bringing up a bill to help protect Dreamers  before the self-Trump-imposed March 5 deadline, the House will consider  legislation that undermines the civil rights of disabled Americans, and  it also makes it easier for predatory lenders to evade consumer  protection laws. And people wonder why the House of Representatives is  as unpopular as it is.   H.R. 3299, the Protecting Consumers' Access to Credit Act is a bill  that hurts consumers. It is one that makes it easier for payday lenders  to evade well-thought-out State-level protection laws.   That is why over 200 national and State organizations have written in  opposition to this bill, which they fear would open the floodgates for  predatory lending with interest rates as high as 300 percent.  Additionally, 20 State attorneys general have also written in  opposition.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record these two letters.                                                  November 29, 2017.      Re Oppose H.R. 3299 (McHenry) and S. 1642 (Warner),           Protecting Consumers' Access to Credit Act of 2017.         Dear Members of Congress: The undersigned 202 national and       state organizations write in strong opposition to H.R. 3299       (McHenry) and S. 1642 (Warner), the Protecting Consumers'       Access to Credit Act of 2017. The primary impact of this bill       will be enabling nonbank lenders to make high-cost loans that       exceed state interest rate limits by using a bank to       originate the loan. The bill poses a serious risk of enabling       predatory lending and unsafe lending practices. Unaffordable       loans have devastating consequences for borrowers--trapping       them in a cycle of unaffordable payments and leading to harms       such as greater delinquency on other bills.        Specifically, the bill makes it easier for payday lenders       and other nonbanks to use rent-a-bank arrangements to ignore       state interest rate caps and make high-rate loans. The bill       overrides the Second Circuit's Madden v. Midland decision,       which held that a debt buyer purchasing debts originated by a       national bank could not benefit from the National Bank Act's       preemption of state interest rate caps. The Madden decision       did not limit the interest rates that banks may charge on       credit cards and other forms of credit, but it does limit       nonbanks from evading state interest rate caps. Reversing the       Second Circuit's decision, as this bill seeks to do, would       make it easier for payday lenders, debt buyers, online       lenders, fintech companies, and other companies to use       ``rent-a-bank'' arrangements to charge high rates on loans.        The bill provides that ``a loan that is valid when made as       to its maximum rate of interest . . . shall remain valid with       respect to such rate regardless of whether the loan is       subsequently sold, assigned, or otherwise transferred to a       third party, and may be enforced by such third party       notwithstanding any State law to the contrary.'' In other       words, if a bank originates a loan that exceeds state       interest rate caps, and then sells or assigns the loan to a       nonbank, that nonbank can continue to charge a usurious rate.        This bill could open the floodgates to a wide range of       predatory actors to make loans at 300% annual interest or       higher. The bill could bless arrangements such as the       partnership between the payday lender Elevate and Republic       Bank, through which Elevate is making high-cost loans that       exceed state interest rate caps. Through its Elastic brand,       Elevate offers purportedly open-end loans in 39 states and       the District of Columbia.        Elevate does not disclose an APR, but a $380 advance repaid       with monthly minimum payments would cost $480 to repay over       five months. Including all fees, the annual rate for this       extension of credit is about 100%, which is nearly three       times the 36% legal interest rate approved by voters in       Montana, one of the states where the lines of credit are       offered. Through its Rise brand, Elevate also makes closed-      end loans at rates up to 365% in states where those rates are       permitted, and it could attempt to expand to other states.        Enova, dba NetCredit, also offers high-cost installment       loans in a number of states through a rent-a-bank       partnership. Enova, like Elevate, relies on Republic Bank and       Trust to facilitate this scheme.        Other payday lenders have regularly attempted to avoid       state usury caps through rent-a-bank arrangements. For       example, CashCall has attempted to partner with banks to make       usurious loans in several states. Courts have struck down       those arrangements, finding that CashCall had to comply with       state interest rate caps. The bill could undermine these       decisions, by stating that a loan's interest rate remains       valid even if a loan is transferred or assigned to a third       party and ``may be enforced by such third party       notwithstanding any State law to the contrary.'' This could       allow high-rate lenders to use banks to originate and then       immediately transfer usurious loans.        This bill is a massive attack on state consumer protection       laws. In a letter by 20 State Attorneys General opposing       provisions in another bill that would have overturned the       Madden decision, the state law enforcement officers warned       that the bill ``would restrict states' abilities to enforce       interest rate caps. It is essential to preserve the ability       of individual states to enforce their existing usury caps and       oppose any measures to enact a federal law that would preempt       state usury caps.'' ' In fact, the Colorado Attorney General       is in the midst of challenging online lenders' use of a rent-      a-bank scheme to make loans in violation of the state's usury       limits. This bill aims to thwart actions like these that seek       to enforce state laws.        The potential costs and damage to consumers are       significant. In about 34 states, a $2,000 loan, 2-year       installment loan at an APR exceeding 36% would be illegal.       This bill risks making high-cost loans permissible across the       country. The bill also could potentially expand short-term       payday lending to the 15 states plus the District of Colombia       whose state interest rate limits currently save borrowers       over $2.2 billion annually in payday loan fees.        Fintech lenders also should not be allowed to make loans       that exceed state interest rate caps. State interest rate       caps have not impacted responsible marketplace loans. The       leading marketplace lenders do not make loans above 36% and       the vast majority of their loans are well below that rate,       comfortably within state interest rate caps. But the mere       fact that a lender uses the label ``fintech'' or       ``martketplace lender'' does not ensure that it is a safe or       affordable loan. For example, OnDeck, a lender focused on       small business lending, offers term loans up to 99%.        Moreover, many marketplace lenders make very large loans of       $30,000 to $50,000 or higher, and even 36% is a very high       rate for such loans. Many states have tiered rate structures       in recognition that interest becomes more unaffordable the       larger the loan. Iowa, for example, caps interest at 21% for       loans over $10,000.        There are also signs that some online lenders may not be       appropriately underwriting their loans to ensure that the       loans are affordable, and that many borrowers may not have       the ability to repay, especially, if the economy sours.       Recent news reports and SEC filings show that delinquency and       charge-off rates at these marketplace lenders are rising. One       online lender apparently failed to verify a borrower's income       for a full two-thirds of its loans in 2016. Another lender       has had so many of its loans fail, that it has had to repay       investors for their losses in the last three securitizations       of the loans it bundled up and sold to Wall Street.        This bill would weaken lenders' incentive to underwrite       properly by making it easier to make high-rate loans. High       interest rates result in misaligned incentives that can lead       to lender profits but borrower catastrophe. Skewed incentives       are already a problem in the marketplace loan industry.       Moody's credit-rating firms liken this industry to mortgage       lending in the years leading up to the 2008 financial       crisis--``because the companies that market the loans and       approve them quickly sell them off to investors,'' relieving       themselves of the risk of the loan later going bad. This bill       could make that problem worse.        The bill is not necessary to ensure access to affordable       credit. Proponents of this bill claim that the Madden       decision has had an adverse impact on access to credit. They       point to a study that showed a drop in marketplace lending by       three lenders in the Second Circuit after the Madden decision       for subprime borrowers, especially for those with FICO scores       below 644. However, the study showed that these lenders       offered only miniscule amounts of credit in the low FICO       range even before the Madden decision. Thus, the impact on       access to credit was trivial. Moreover, it is likely that the       credit extended before the decision at the lower end of the       FICO spectrum was made to borrowers who had trouble repaying,       and that lenders were relying on high interest rates on large       loans to compensate for high default rates.  [[Page H1139]]         The bill wipes away the strongest available tool against       predatory lending practices. Strong state rate caps, coupled       with effective enforcement by states, remain the simplest and       most effective method to protect consumers from the predatory       lending debt trap. Contrary to what lenders often claim,       robust state loan laws do not drive people to find loans       online. In fact, illegal online lending is more prevalent in       states that do not effectively regulate predatory lending       than it is in states that enforce state interest rate caps.        Accordingly, we urge you to reject this bill. For more       information, contact Lauren Saunders at [email protected] or       Scott Astrada at Scott.A[email protected].

Re The Financial CHOICE Act of 2017 (H.R. 10).       Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Minority Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      Majority Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Steny Hoyer,      Minority Whip, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Ryan, Majority Leader McCarthy, Minority       Leader Pelosi, and Minority Whip Hoyer: On behalf of the       undersigned State Attorneys General and the Executive       Director of the Office of Consumer Protection for the State       of Hawaii (the ``States''), we write to express our strong       opposition to H.R. 10 (the ``Act''), which we understand the       full House of Representatives intends to vote on this week.       The proposed Act will eliminate many of the critical consumer       protections implemented as a result of the Dodd-Frank Wall       Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (``Dodd-Frank'') in       the wake of, and in response to, the financial crisis. As the       chief consumer protection officers in each of our respective       States, we write to call your particular attention to those       portions of the Act that would effectively eviscerate the       role of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (``CFPB''),       the only independent federal agency exclusively focused on       consumer financial protection. While the Act purports to       protect consumers from over-regulation by federal agencies,       its far-reaching consequences would make consumers more       vulnerable to fraud and abuse in the marketplace. The       undersigned States support the work of the CFPB and oppose       any effort to curtail its authority. While we find numerous       provisions of the Act to be objectionable, we write to       highlight certain provisions that would significantly impact       consumer protection -- a core function of our States.                               I. Background         Our States' work to protect consumers from unscrupulous       marketplace actors and practices is greatly enhanced when the       federal government serves as an effective partner. In the       years leading up to the global financial crisis, residents of       our States suffered the consequences of a federal government       that failed to fulfill its basic obligations to U.S.       consumers to prevent fraud and misconduct by mortgage       providers, servicers, and other financial firms. Families       nationwide suffered dire financial consequences as a result       of lax federal oversight and inaction.        Since its inception, the CFPB has emerged as the       independent federal consumer watchdog the nation has long       needed, and as a key partner in critically important consumer       protection work undertaken by our States and by State       Attorneys General across the country. The exceptional record       of the CFPB speaks for itself. As of January 1, 2017, the       CFPB has handled over one million consumer complaints, and       obtained $11.8 billion in relief for 29 million consumers.       The CFPB has taken enforcement actions to stem abuses by       student loan originators and servicers, for-profit schools,       debt collectors, credit reporting agencies, payday lenders,       and foreclosure ``rescue'' companies, among others. Among its       more recent, significant enforcement actions have been cases       against  [[Page H1140]]       mortgage servicer Ocwen Financial Corporation for widespread       mortgage servicing failures, including improperly calculating       balances, misapplying payments, and failing to investigate       consumer complaints, student loan servicer Navient for       student loan servicing abuses, including failing to notify       struggling borrowers of their eligibility for income-based       repayment plans and steering such borrowers into more costly       forbearance plans--and Wells Fargo bank for its widespread       practice of opening unauthorized bank and credit card       accounts for consumers. In addition, as part of its statutory       mandate, the CFPB has conducted thorough and nuanced studies       of complex financial issues that impact consumers and has       issued rules intended to protect consumers in a thoughtful,       consensus-driven manner.       II. The Devastating Effects of the Act on Consumer Protection         The Act would effectively cripple the CFPB from doing the       job it has been doing so effectively since its inception.      A. The Act Would Eliminate the CFPB's Rulemaking and Enforcement      Authority Over Unfair, Deceptive, and Abusive Acts and Practices         Section 736 of the Act would eliminate the CFPB's authority       to prohibit unfair, deceptive, and abusive acts and practices       (``UDAAP''). The CFPB's authority to prohibit entities it       supervises from engaging in UDAAP violations has been the       basis for many of the CFPB's most significant enforcement       actions, including the Ocwen, Navient, and Wells Fargo       matters discussed above. In addition, several of the       undersigned States have jointly filed cases with the CFPB       against businesses and individuals engaged in unfair,       deceptive, or abusive practices. UDAAP authority gives the       CFPB the flexibility to respond swiftly to new technologies       and practices that harm consumers, without the need to wait       for legislation expressly addressing a given practice.      B. The Act Would Eliminate the CFPB's Supervision and Enforcement                         Authority Over Large Banks         Section 727 of the Act would similarly eliminate the CFPB's       supervision and enforcement authority over large banks and       permit financial institutions that meet certain criteria to       elect to be exempted from the CFPB's supervisory authority.       This provision is concerning in a number of ways, not the       least of which is that it is through the supervision process       that the CFPB often learns of systemic issues in the       companies and industries it regulates. The CFPB is the only       federal agency that has been conducting consumer protection       reviews as the focus of their supervisory authority (rather       than safety and soundness), which is important for the       reasons previously discussed. In addition, many of the CFPB's       enforcement actions have been against the large banks.   C. The Act Would Eliminate the CFPB's Authority to Regulate Payday and                            Vehicle Title Loans         Section 733 of the Act expressly prohibits the CFPB from       engaging in any rulemaking or enforcement with respect to       payday and vehicle title loans. Payday lending, as the CFPB's       own extensive research has documented, has adversely affected       the lives of millions of financially vulnerable consumers       across the country. The CFPB has been at the forefront of       curbing abuses in the payday lending industry and has       supplemented state enforcement by taking enforcement actions       against payday and other lenders that are attempting to       collect on loans that are void under state law. The CFPB has       been similarly aggressive in uncovering and confronting       abuses in the vehicle title loan industry, where consumers,       risk the loss of their vehicle (with the corresponding loss       in mobility) if they find themselves unable to repay their       loans. The Act will strip the CFPB of all authority in these       areas, including its enforcement authority and the ability to       adopt sensible and common sense rules to prevent consumers       from falling into debt traps that are often the result of       payday and vehicle title loans.   D. The Act Would Permit Third Party Debt Collectors to Charge Usurious                               Interest Rates         Section 581 of the Act would restrict states' abilities to       enforce interest rate caps. Currently, there are no federal       interest rate caps that cover financial products and services       offered by national banks. Rather, national banks are       permitted to export the interest rate of their home state and       disregard the more stringent interest rates of other states       in which they do business. Section 581 of the Act would add       language to four federal statutes to provide that, when a       national bank sells or assigns debt covered by the National       Bank Act, the buyer or assignee has the right to collect that       same interest rate, regardless of the law of the state where       the buyer or assignee is located. This would make it more       difficult to ensure that debt buyers, online lenders, fintech       companies, and rent-a-bank schemes comply with state interest       rate caps. It is essential to preserve the ability of       individual states to enforce their existing usury caps and       oppose any measures to enact a federal law that would preempt       state usury caps.     E. The Act Would Eliminate the CFPB Rulemaking Authority Regarding                           Mandatory Arbitration         Section 738 of the Act would repeal the provision of Dodd-      Frank that granted the CFPB authority to study and issue       rules regarding arbitration in financial services contracts.       Dodd-Frank expressly authorized the CFPB to study arbitration       provisions in financial services contracts, and to issue       regulations prohibiting or restricting such provisions if the       CFPB concluded that doing so would be ``in the public       interest and for the protection of consumers.'' After a       thorough review, the CFPB concluded that tens of millions of       Americans use financial products or services subject to       mandatory arbitration clauses that prohibit proceeding on a       class basis and that the effect of such provisions is to       prevent consumers from seeking redress, particularly for       small dollar claims. Elimination of the CFPB's authority in       this area can only operate to the detriment of consumers.       F. The Act Would Reduce Transparency and Deprive Consumers of a                       Valuable Source of Information         Finally, the Act would end the CFPB's current practice of       publicly posting information concerning individual consumer       complaints in a searchable database. This information helps       consumers make informed decisions about the companies with       which they choose to do business, and increases transparency       in the marketplace. Eliminating the release of this       information provides no benefit to consumers, but only to       companies whose practices generate repeated complaints.                              III. Conclusion         For these and other reasons, the undersigned States urge       you to support robust and engaged consumer protection in the       financial services industry by voting against the Act. A       rollback of these significant post-financial crisis rules and       regulations would substantially harm consumers and the public       in general.

Donovan, Vermont Attorney General;          Mark R. Herring, Virginia Attorney General;          Bob Ferguson, Washington State Attorney General.     Mr. Speaker, States can, and do, like my own State of  Colorado, put limitations on the interest rates of installment loans  issued by nonbanks. Banks, on the other hand, have the preemption of  State interest rate caps through the National Bank Act.   So in order to get around State interest rate caps, payday lenders  often use a bank to originate a loan at a higher interest rate, but the  nonbank designs the loan, provides the funding for the loan, services  the loan, and guarantees any losses the bank incurs. In all but in  name, it is the nonbank entity that is the loaning entity. Essentially,  the payday lender is the de facto lender and the bank is simply a  nominal participant to evade regulations. These are referred to as  ``rent-a-charter'' schemes, and they are not new.   In the early 2000s, Federal banking regulators shut down several of  these arrangements between national banks and nonbank lenders. In 2014,  the OCC made it clear that banks may not rent out their charters to  third parties. Right now, our Federal banking regulations are able to  contain these schemes, but this legislation would undermine our ability  to stop abusive and predatory practices.   States are leading the effort to stop abusive lending practices. In  my home State of Colorado, there is actually a lawsuit challenging this  very scheme.   And now that the new Director of the Consumer Financial Protection  Bureau has delayed a final rule that would have helped protect  borrowers, it is actually up to the States to help protect  [[Page H1141]]  consumers, and this bill would make it harder. This bill would cripple  States', like Colorado's, efforts to stop predatory lending from  preying on their citizens.   The Republican assault on States' rights has gone from bad to worse.  This is yet another part of the big government Republican war on  consumers across the country preempting States' rights for Washington,  D.C., control.   It seems the Republicans want to control everything from Washington.  That is why we need to make sure that our States are empowered to have  the ability they need to protect consumers and protect our law.   Lately, there has been an increased focus on fintech companies and  how they can help serve the unbanked or underbanked. And I agree. I am  a big supporter of financial innovation and promote financial  inclusion, but we can't do that at the expense of consumers or at the  very high cost of putting consumers into cycles of debt, which ends  badly.   Why are we considering legislation that would put all of the power in  Washington, D.C., and take away State-level protections for consumers?   Instead, we should be finding ways to increase access to affordable  credit, make it easier for consumers to access the financial services  that meet their needs, rather than trying to force a Republican  Washington solution on all of the States across our country.   We are considering this bill under a closed rule. There is only one  amendment filed to this bill, and it is not even allowed to be debated  about, no less voted on.   Now, I want to talk about the other bill under this rule. H.R. 3978,  the TRID Improvement Act, is actually a package of several bills that  came out of the House Financial Services Committee, some which are more  controversial than others. Title I of the package, the TRID Improvement  Act, was reported out by a 53-5 vote, and all the Republicans and  Democrats supported Title V of the package, Eliminating Barriers to  Jobs for Loan Originators.   I support Title II, the Protection of Source Code Act, that is being  included in this package. I also support Representative Foster's  amendment to that title, which would provide additional clarification  to the subpoena requirement and would only apply to the source for  algorithmic trading.   The problem is that it takes several bills that have broad bipartisan  support and combines them with other bills that should be considered  separately, which is forcing Democrats and Republicans to weigh the  package as a whole. We simply can't know the ramifications of  considering all these bills at the same time, especially when they  haven't had hearings on the individual components.   Finally, H.R. 620, the ADA Education and Reform Act, is, in many  ways, the most damaging bill that is discussed under this rule.   We are celebrating the Americans with Disabilities Act that was  signed into law 28 years ago to really allow Americans with  disabilities to have every kind of opportunity that everybody else  does, free from discrimination in the workplace, schools, and  transportation. It was a landmark bipartisan effort.   Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act prohibits places of  public accommodation from discriminating against individuals with  disabilities and sets a minimum reasonable standard for accessibility,  which has been the law of our land for three decades.   H.R. 620 would make it more difficult for people with disabilities to  have their rights guaranteed under the Americans with Disabilities Act.  Under this bill, instead of requiring the public establishment to  comply with the ADA, the burden should shift to the victim of the  discrimination to prove a violation has occurred. You are forcing  disabled Americans to go around with clipboards and inspector goggles,  rather than forcing businesses to comply. It is simply not fair.   It has been nearly three decades since the Americans with  Disabilities Act was signed into law. All title III of the ADA requires  is that businesses make their facilities accessible to the extent that  it is readily achievable--a very reasonable burden under the law.  Businesses have flourished over the last three decades and we have had  continued economic growth.   I have heard from so many of my constituents about this bill,  including Cari Brown, a systems advocacy specialist with the Arc of  Larimer County, serving disabled residents. She said: ``The standards  set forth in the ADA are designed to ensure that people with  disabilities can access basic public accommodations. Requiring people  with disabilities to file a complaint to enforce compliance of a 28- year-old law is a step backwards.''    I think this is a Republican plan to turn everybody with disabilities  into an attorney, because that is what they are going to need to be to  be able to assert the rights that they already have under the law.   There is significant, if not universal, opposition to H.R. 620 from  health and disabilities advocacy groups, including, but not limited to:  Disability Rights Education and Defense Fund, Epilepsy Foundation, The  Bazelon Center, the National Council on Disabilities, the American  Association of People with Disabilities, and the Consortium for  Citizens with Disabilities.   We knew, Mr. Speaker, that this President has mocked and taken on  Americans with disabilities, but I frankly thought it was above the  Republicans in Congress to join President Trump in assaulting the  rights of those with disabilities.   H.R. 620 will not allow people with disabilities to immediately file  ADA violations, essentially denying access to buildings due to a  lengthy legal process.   Who has time to wait several years to access a building that you need  to be in because of your job?   It simply doesn't make sense. That means that people with  disabilities will wait weeks, months, or years just to gain the access  that is required under law.   For businesses, there is simply no incentive to adhere to ADA  guidelines. All of this combined harms disabled Americans and weakens  the legal protections that, for decades, Republicans and Democrats have  been proud of in the Americans with Disabilities Act.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Rhode  Island (Mr. Langevin).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   President Trump continues to, frankly, offend our sensibilities and  values by insisting that somehow Democrats don't care about fixing  DACA. Well, I would beg to differ. This is the 22nd time we have tried  to bring the bipartisan bill, H.R. 3440, the Dream Act, to the House  floor for a vote.   We have made our position clear. We want immigration policies that  reflect our values, that make America safer, while realizing, of  course, that we are a nation both of laws and of immigrants.   Yesterday, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce again urged Congress to pass  legislation that provides permanent relief for Dreamers. Even the  conservative Cato Institute estimates that deporting Dreamers would  result in a $280 billion reduction in economic growth over the next  decade.   Mr. Speaker, if we don't care about the families, about the young  people affected, surely you care about $280 billion that will be lost  if Republicans fail to act. Protecting these aspiring Americans is not  only the right thing to do morally, it is the right thing to do for our  country and for our economy.   If we defeat the previous question today, for the 23rd time, I will  offer an amendment to the rule to bring up H.R. 3440, the Dream Act.  This bipartisan, bicameral legislation would finally help hundreds of  thousands of young people who are American in every way except for on  paper.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Correa) to discuss our proposal.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am not sure what is worse, the fact that we are taking  up legislation that would make it more difficult for Americans to gain  access to buildings in their community, including buildings that they  work in, or that we are considering legislation that makes it easier  for payday lenders to prey on vulnerable consumers by forcing in  Washington, D.C., Big Government Republican values on our States'  rights; or is it worse that we are not taking up legislation to protect  the hundreds of thousands of Dreamers at risk of deportation in the  beginning of March unless we act?   My Republican colleagues are working hard to put Washington, D.C.,  Big Government ahead of people, to force people with disabilities to  get law degrees and wander around with notepads to document when they  are unable to get into a building, and putting payday lenders ahead of  hardworking Americans.   Instead, we should be focused on finding bipartisan solutions to  protect aspiring Americans from being forcibly deported from the only  country that they know as home.  [[Page H1144]]    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the rule and  ``no'' on H.R. 3299 and H.R. 620, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
