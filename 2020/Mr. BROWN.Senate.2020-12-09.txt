 Mr. President, I would restate my request, whenever I come  to the floor, that the Presiding Officer wear a mask because he has  people sitting in front of him that could be at risk.                          Remembering Paul Sarbanes    Mr. President, this weekend, we lost a former Member of this body who  truly embodied the spirit of service that should animate all of our  work. His name is Paul Sarbanes. He passed away a few days ago. He was  a longtime chair of the committee of the Presiding Officer.   As chair of the Banking and Housing Committee, he was always a voice  for consumers and working families, standing up against powerful  corporate interests. The accomplishment that bears his name, the  Sarbanes-Oxley Act, was a landmark law in our efforts to hold  corporations accountable. It helped protect Americans who invest hard- earned money for retirement and for their kids' education from  corporate banking fraud, the kind that bankrupted families after  scandals like Enron.   Senator Sarbanes also never ignored the housing part of our  committee's jurisdiction. He fought to make sure that all Americans  could find and afford a place to call home. Whenever developers tried  to make a deal in Maryland, he was always adamant they include  affordable housing in their projects because, fundamentally, he never  forgot where he came from. The son of Greek immigrants, Paul Sarbanes  grew up a working-class kid, bussing tables at his family's restaurant  on the Eastern Shore.   In the Senate, he cared about getting results for the people he  served, not about getting the credit. Some of his colleagues called him  the ``stealth senator.'' He welcomed the nickname. He told the  Baltimore Sun that stealth is ``one of the most important weapons in  our military arsenal. . . . If you let somebody else take the credit,  you can get the result.''   Senator Sarbanes was the definition of a true public servant. May he  rest in peace as he joins his beloved wife Christine. Connie and I pray  for Representative   John Sarbanes, his son, and the entire Sarbanes  family.   I hope my colleagues will join me in honoring Senator Sarbanes by  building on his legacy, standing up to the corporations that have too  much power in this country, and fighting for the working people we  serve. Paul Sarbanes, like many others in this body, understood the  dignity of work                      National Defense Authorization Act    Mr. President, yesterday the House overwhelmingly passed the NDAA  conference report by a veto-proof majority of 335 to 78. That bill  includes our comprehensive bipartisan reform of our anti-money  laundering laws.   I would like to thank my colleagues, especially Senator Crapo and  other Banking and Housing Committee colleagues: Senators Warner, Jones,  Reed, Rounds, and off the committee, Senators Wyden, Whitehouse,  Graham, and Grassley, and the Presiding Officer, Senator Cotton, for  his work on this legislation.   On the House side, Chairwoman Waters and Chairman Maloney and  Representative Cleaver, thank you to all of them for working so hard to  ensure that today we have this crucial bipartisan legislation in this  defense conference report that will reform our money laundering laws  and finally end abuses by anonymous shell companies.   I would like to extend my thanks to a former colleague, Chairman  Levin, who was chair of Armed Services and the Permanent Subcommittee  on Investigations and to President Obama, who both voted on these  issues for years. Many of their good ideas are codified in this bill,  harvesting some of the seeds they planted years ago.   The Anti-Money Laundering Act and the Corporate Transparency Act are  the products of months and months of bipartisan negotiations between  and among Members of the House and Senate and certainly the staffs of  Senator Cotton and me and Senator Crapo and others. I thank them for  their good work.   The bill is a critical step to fight money laundering and crack down  on shell companies. While there are things I would have done  differently had we been writing the bill on our own, overall, it is an  effective and comprehensive response to the problem of illicit finance.  I strongly support it.   Criminals abuse the U.S. financial system to launder money from drug  trafficking, organized crime, Medicare and Medicaid fraud, weapons  sales, and other criminal activities. I spoke today about this with  Sheriff Burke of Toledo, the Lucas County Sheriff, a longtime sheriff,  and U.S. Marshal Pete Elliott of Cleveland of the Northern District.  They welcomed this language, and they welcome this law. This will help  them do their jobs better.   Much of this dirty money that comes from organized crime in Medicaid  fraud, weapons sales, drug trafficking, and sex trafficking is  laundered through anonymous shell corporations. These are not  victimless crimes. They directly hurt Ohio communities, especially  those torn apart by the opioid crisis.   Sinaloa cartel actors and Fentanyl traffickers have been destroying  thousands of families. They use money laundering to get their drug  money in and out of the country. Human traffickers who prey on runaways  at truck stops along major interstate highways in Ohio and across the  country also use the financial system to launder their profits. We need  to give law enforcement new modern tools to stop their crimes.  [[Page S7310]]    The bill finally requires comprehensive reporting by U.S. companies  of their actual owners--no more hiding these abuses in anonymous shell  companies. It cracks down on bankers who look the other way to actively  aid money laundering and cracks down on Big Banks that have shoddy  compliance systems. If you are helping drug traders hide their illegal  fentanyl profits, you deserve more than a slap on the wrist. Banks  cannot be too big to jail, and laws can't treat them that way.   I will closely monitor how this critical legislation is being  implemented. I spoke this week already with the Secretary of Treasury  designee and the Deputy Secretary of Treasury designee about being  ready to administer and enforce these laws. I look forward to working  with the administration to ensure that Treasury puts in place effective  anti-money laundering and corporate transparency rules to implement the  bill as soon as possible.   We know that criminals have long been revising their tactics to get  around our current laws. This bill will enable us to get ahead of them  and stay ahead of them.   I urge my colleagues to support it. They supported this language in  the NDAA, and I ask them to support the NDAA   Taken together, as we designed them, these measures reform, update  and strengthen our current anti-money laundering laws and make critical  changes to U.S. corporate disclosure laws to combat abuses by owners of  anonymous shell companies--including foreign owners from China, Russia,  Iran, North Korea and other countries--who have for years been  exploiting our system for criminal purposes.   The legislation strengthens the Treasury Department's financial  intelligence, anti-money laundering (AML), and countering the financing  of terrorism (CFT) programs, modernizing our legal regime and improving  communication, oversight, and information-sharing in these areas.   The conference agreement requires much more routine and systemic  coordination, communication, and feedback among financial institutions,  regulators, and law enforcement, to enable them to identify and act on  suspicious financial activities, better target bank resources on  critical AML tasks, and increase the likelihood of bad actors being  caught by law enforcement.   It also provides for new whistleblower protections for those  reporting BSA violations and provides for payment of whistleblower  rewards.   It establishes tough new penalties on those convicted of serious Bank  Secrecy Act violations, including additional penalties for repeat  violators, and imposes a ban on financial-institution board service for  those convicted of egregious BSA-related crimes.   It would require important new reporting from the Department of  Justice and Treasury to better enable Congress to oversee the use of-- and sometimes continuing violations by banks under--deferred  prosecution agreements and non-prosecution agreements, which too often  are a slap on the wrist by regulators for banks that evade sanctions,  violate our AML rules, or otherwise violate banking laws. As I have  said, banks can't be too big to jail, and regulators can't treat them  that way.   To help accomplish all these goals, the conference agreement  authorizes additional funding for the Treasury Department, and we  expect the Department to insist on strong accountability for results  and to be responsive to congressional oversight as its officials work  to implement this legislation.   In addition, the bill finally requires comprehensive reporting by  U.S. companies of their actual owners. No more hiding in the dark  abuses by anonymous shell companies to commit crimes.   Unlike in most areas of reform and transparency, where the U.S. has  led the way, on this issue of anonymous shell companies we have long  lagged behind other nations, and failed to require uniform and clear  ownership information for firms at the time of their incorporation in  the states.   This information is critical to law enforcement. In the U.S.  investigators often have to spend precious time and resources issuing  subpoenas and chasing down leads--sometimes jumping from anonymous  shell company to anonymous shell company--to secure basic information  about who actually owns a company. That makes no sense. And with this  bill, it will end.   Treasury's National Money Laundering Risk Assessment estimates that  around $300 billion in illicit proceeds from domestic financial crime  is generated annually.   Criminals have for a very long time abused our financial system to  launder funds gained through narcotics trafficking, organized crime,  Medicare and Medicaid fraud, weapons proliferation and other criminal  activities. Much of this dirty money is laundered through anonymous  shell corporations.   Over the years we have heard all about these abuses, from the  ``Panama Papers'' to the ``Paradise Papers'' to, more recently this  year, the series of news articles called the ``FinCEN files.''   These exposures of abuses in our system by dedicated journalists and  national and international transparency organizations have highlighted  problems involving human trafficking, drug trafficking, terrorism,  money laundering, fraud, tax evasion, and other crimes involving  illicit finance.   None of these abuses are victimless crimes.   Money laundering for drug cartels has a direct line to the opioid  crisis in Ohio, where Sinaloa cartel actors or fentanyl traffickers  have been destroying thousands of families. Combined with the pandemic,  these drugs have hurt thousands of Ohio families.   Human traffickers who exploit the misery of runaways in truckstops  along major interstate highways in Ohio and across the country use the  financial system to launder their profits.   Medicare fraudsters cost the taxpayers $2.6 billion in one recent  year, according to the HHS Inspector General, and tarnish the  reputation of this lifeline for seniors.   That's why anti-money laundering and corporate transparency laws are  so critical: they protect the integrity of our financial system,  provide critical intelligence to law enforcement to combat crime and  help give victims the tools they need to hold bad actors accountable.   Under Treasury's existing rules, banks are already working to secure  some of this information from accountholders when they open accounts.  And while banks must continue to play a key monitoring role, it's also  important that we finally, after all these years, require companies to  provide basic information on their ownership when they're formed.   The bill contains a strong definition of ``beneficial owner'' which  includes a two-part test covering individuals who, directly or  indirectly, exercise substantial control over an entity or hold or  control an ownership interest in the entity. The definition is clear  that a nominee, intermediary, custodian, or agent acting on behalf of  another individual cannot be the beneficial owner of an entity.  Nominees are not beneficial owners; neither are trustees or attorneys  acting as agents.   The definition is also clear that employees do not qualify as  beneficial owners of an entity unless, apart from their employment  status, they hold an ownership interest in the entity or can exercise  substantial control over the entity such as the ability to transfer  some or all of the entity's assets or earnings to their personal use.  The provision defines ``beneficial owner'' as an individual who  directly or indirectly ``owns or controls not less than 25 percent of  the ownership interests of the entity.'' When applying this part of the  test, FinCEN must consider what to do if no one individual meets the 25  percent minimum, and how that situation may trigger the second part of  the beneficial owner test which requires disclosure of the individuals  who exercise ``substantial control over the entity.''   To determine whether an individual exercises ``substantial control''  over an entity, FinCEN is not intended to devise a numerical, narrow,  or rigid test. Instead, the standard is intended to function with  flexibility to take into account the myriad ways that an individual may  exercise control over an entity while holding minimal or even no formal  ownership interest.   They include written and unwritten agreements, arrangements, or  understandings, instructions to company directors or officers, letter  of wishes,  [[Page S7311]]  control over personnel decisions, economic pressure on company  shareholders or employees, coercion, bribery, threats of bodily harm,  and other legal and illegal means of exercising control.   Evidence that one or more individuals are exercising substantial  control over a specific entity is expected to vary widely and may  encompass such matters as emailed or telephoned instructions from the  individuals suspected of being beneficial owners or their agents,  employment or personnel decisions made at the direction or with the  approval of such individuals, financial accounts that name such  individuals as signatories, investment decisions made at the direction  or recommendation of such individuals, or transfers of funds or assets  to or at the direction of such individuals.   Requiring companies to provide their ownership information and  storing it in a secure federal database like FinCEN's, alongside  account holders' banking information, will help address longstanding  problems for U.S. law enforcement.   It will help them investigate and prosecute cases involving  terrorism, weapons proliferation, drug trafficking, money laundering,  Medicare and Medicaid fraud, human trafficking, and other crimes. And  it will provide ready access to this information under long-established  and effective privacy rules.   Without these reforms, criminals, terrorists and even rogue nations  could continue to use layer upon layer of shell companies to disguise  and launder illicit funds. That makes it harder to hold bad actors  accountable, and puts us all at risk.   The bill also contains certain exemptions. The basic justification  behind the bill's exemptions is that each exempt category refers to  entities that already disclose their beneficial owners to the  government in one way or another and so don't need to duplicate that  disclosure in the FinCEN database.   For example, publicly traded companies already disclose their true  owners to the SEC, and banks already disclose their true owners to  federal bank regulators; there is no reason to require those entities  to disclose the same information to FinCEN. Each of the exemptions  should be interpreted as narrowly as possible to exclude entities that  do not disclose their beneficial owners to the government.   Exemptions created for pooled investment vehicles, dormant companies,  and certain nonprofits require especially narrow interpretations to  limit those exemptions to entities that provide some level of ownership  disclosure to the government.   The exemption for pooled investment vehicles is intended to be  available only to PIVs that rely for investment advice and services on  a regulated bank or on a securities broker-dealer, investment company,  or investment adviser that is registered with the SEC, has disclosed  its own beneficial ownership information to the federal government, and  has filed a Form ADV disclosing the PIV's legal name and any other  information related to the PIV that the federal government may require.   In addition, PIVs formed under the laws of a foreign jurisdiction  must file with FinCEN a certification identifying every individual that  exercises substantial control over the PIV, providing the same  information required for beneficial owners.   Because evidence shows that criminals, fraudsters, and U.S.  adversaries are increasingly using PIVs to launder funds and commit  other wrongdoing, this exemption is of special concern and should be  subject to continuous, careful review by Treasury as provided in the  new 31 U.S.C. 5336(i) to see whether it should be retained or removed.   The exemption for dormant companies is intended to function solely as  a grandfathering provision that exempts from disclosure only those  dormant companies in existence prior to the bill's enactment; those  grandfathered entities are also required to immediately disclose their  beneficial owners to FinCEN as soon as their ownership changes hands,  they become active entities, or they otherwise lose their exempt  status. No entity created after the date of enactment of the bill is  intended to qualify for exemption as a dormant company.   The exemption provided to certain charitable and nonprofit entities  also merits narrow construction and careful review in light of past  evidence of wrongdoers misusing charities, foundations, and other  nonprofit entities to launder funds and advance criminal and civil  misconduct. This exemption is intended to apply only to entities that  are engaged in charitable or nonprofit activities, and not to entities  engaged in for-profit businesses or for-profit activities.   The exemption is based, in part, upon provisions in U.S. and state  laws that enable federal and state officials to regulate and  investigate nonprofit organizations to ensure, for example, that the  individuals behind them are not using the entity's assets to  inappropriately enrich themselves, unfairly compete against businesses  that pay taxes, or advance other inappropriate objectives.   In addition, the exemption given to entities that ``operate  exclusively to provide financial assistance to or hold governance  rights over'' a charitable entity is intended to be even more  restrictive; it is confined to entities that qualify as U.S. persons  under U.S. tax law, have only U.S. citizens or residents as their  beneficial owners, and derive ``at least a majority'' of their funds  from U.S. persons--meaning the exemption is not available under any  circumstance for entities formed under foreign laws, established for  foreign beneficial owners, or funded primarily with foreign funds.   Again, these exemptions are intended to be narrowly interpreted to  prevent their use by entities that otherwise fail to disclose their  beneficial owners to the federal government.   To ensure the bill's exemptions function as intended, the Treasury,  FinCEN, OCC, IRS, SEC, CFTC, and other federal regulators should review  and, if necessary, strengthen their filing forms to ensure that  beneficial as well as nominal owners are disclosed to the federal  government by the specified exempt entities, including investment  companies, investment advisers, pooled investment vehicles, money  transmitting businesses, and all entities registered with the SEC,  among others.   The justification for the exemption of entities that have both  physical operations and at least 20 employees in the United States is  that those entities' physical U.S. presence will make it easy for U.S.  law enforcement to discover those entities' true owners. Like other  exemptions in the bill, this exemption should be narrowly construed to  exclude entities that do not have an easily located physical presence  in the United States, do not have multiple employees physically present  on an ongoing basis in the United States, or use strategies that make  it difficult for U.S. law enforcement to contact their workforce or  discover the names of their beneficial owners. This exemption should be  subject to continuous, careful review by Treasury under the new 31  U.S.C. 5336(i) to detect and prevent its misuse.   Extending the disclosure exemption to subsidiaries whose ownership  interests are owned or controlled by one or more of certain identified  exempt entities is, again, intended to be interpreted as narrowly as  possible to exclude subsidiaries that never disclose their true owners  to the federal government.   The exemption is intended to apply only to subsidiaries that are  wholly owned or controlled by one or more of the exempt categories of  entities; that's why the provision does not contain any reference to  the 25% ownership figure that appears in the definition of beneficial  owner.   The Federal Reserve, Treasury, OCC, SEC, CFTC, FDIC, and other  federal regulators should review their filing requirements to ensure  that the entities that report to them, such as banks, publicly traded  corporations, securities dealers, exchange operators, or commodity  brokers, include requirements to disclose the subsidiaries they wholly  own or control. This exemption, like others, should be subject to  continuous, careful review by Treasury under the new 31 U.S.C. 5336(i)  to detect and prevent its misuse.   For their part, FinCEN identifiers are intended to simplify  beneficial ownership disclosures by eliminating spelling and naming  issues that can cause confusion or mistakes related to the precise  individuals or entities in an ownership chain.  [[Page S7312]]    FinCEN should design rules that will encourage both individuals and  entities to obtain and use FinCEN identifiers in their beneficial  ownership disclosures. When assigning FinCEN identifiers to entities,  FinCEN should first ensure that the entity has already disclosed its  beneficial ownership information to FinCEN. An entity that has not  disclosed its beneficial ownership information to FinCEN does not  qualify and should not be granted a FinCEN identifier.   It is critical that, from the beginning, FinCEN issue rules that  ensure only one identifying number is assigned to each individual and  to each entity, including all successors to a specific entity. FinCEN  should also establish mechanisms to detect and correct any procedure or  database field that may lead to the same individual or entity  possessing or using more than one FinCEN identifier.   Chairman Crapo and I agreed two years ago that we must get this done  in this Congress--we must finally enact sweeping legislation to require  complete ownership information--not of front men and women, not of  those forming companies on behalf of those who will pull the strings  from behind the curtain--but of the actual owners of companies to be  available to appropriate law enforcement, intelligence and national  security officials in our government who need it to combat crime.   This bill lays out a system to do that simply, efficiently and  effectively, without unduly burdening small businesses or others, and  while providing extensive protections for the information. In Europe,  that information is included in a public database. This approach is  different, imposing some limits on who will have access, and under what  circumstances.   For example, it provides that federal agency heads or their  designees--and agencies can extend that delegation as far down in their  organizational chain as they like--can provide access to the database  to appropriate law enforcement authorities once per investigation, so  they do not need to keep repeating that authorization for the same  investigation. And those delegations can be made on a bulk basis, so  groups or classes of employees can be authorized to access the data as  needed.   For State, local or tribal law enforcement, they must get approval by  a tribal, local, or state court of competent jurisdiction, which need  not be a judge--it can include an officer of the court like a  magistrate, court clerk or other administrative officer.   While I saw no reason to treat federal, state and local law  enforcement officials differently, my Republican colleagues insisted on  this differential treatment, and I am hopeful that the flexibility we  have built in should make it workable.   It is far more workable than the scheme some had pushed, to require  approval by a federal judge each time law enforcement wanted to access  the database--an approach which would have gutted the bill, tied up our  federal courts, and effectively rendered it inaccessible to state and  local law enforcement. But the key here is a robust, functional and  effective database at FinCEN to house this information and make it  readily available.   FinCEN should take immediate steps to create the new database needed  to contain beneficial ownership information. It should use state of the  art technology, procedures, and safeguards to ensure the database is  secure, easy to search, easy to audit, and easy to correct and update.  FinCEN should use its new hiring authority to hire the information  technology specialists needed to create the new beneficial ownership  database. In designing the database, FinCEN should survey other  beneficial ownership databases to determine their best features and  design, and create a structure that secures the data as required by  law. FinCEN should ensure that federal, state, local, and tribal law  enforcement can access the beneficial ownership database without  excessive delays or red tape in a manner modeled after its existing  systems providing law enforcement access to databases containing  currency transaction and suspicious activity report information.   FinCEN should allow federal, state, local, and tribal law enforcement  to access the beneficial ownership data for both criminal and civil  purposes, including law enforcement activities designed to combat  terrorism, money laundering, trafficking, corruption, evasion of  sanctions, noncompliance with tax law, fraud, counterfeit goods, market  manipulation, insider trading, consumer abuse, cybercrime, election  interference, and other types of criminal and civil wrongdoing.   FinCEN should also provide appropriate access to beneficial ownership  data for foreign law enforcement requesting the information for  criminal or civil purposes, including appropriate requests made by a  prosecutor, judge, foreign central authority, or competent authority in  a foreign jurisdiction, keeping in mind that U.S. law enforcement will  be seeking similar information from those same foreign law enforcement  agencies on a reciprocal basis. FinCEN should endeavor to design a  system that will provide appropriate beneficial ownership information  to foreign law enforcement without excessive delays or red tape.   As part of its implementation effort, FinCEN should take immediate  steps to work with states and Indian Tribes to determine how to confirm  that all covered entities formed or administered by those states or  tribes actually file and update the beneficial ownership information  required by law.   We expect FinCEN to include any resulting procedures or audits in the  rule implementing the law. FinCEN should also include appropriate  provisions in the implementing rule requiring federal, state, and  tribal agencies to cooperate with its efforts to ensure an accurate,  complete, and highly useful database of beneficial information and to  provide notice of the law's beneficial ownership transparency  obligations, as required by the new law.   The Treasury IG should take immediate steps to establish a process to  accept, store, and analyze information provided by a federal, state,  local or tribal agency, foreign government, financial institution,  reporting company, civil society group, the public, or others in the  form of comments or complaints related to how FinCEN provides  notification of the law's beneficial ownership transparency  requirements, how FinCEN collects and stores beneficial ownership  information, or regarding the accuracy, completeness, or timeliness of  the information in the FinCEN beneficial ownership database.   As part of that process, the Treasury IG should establish procedures  that will enable comments or complaints identifying false, out-of-date,  or incomplete beneficial ownership information in the database or  providing correct, up-to-date, or complete beneficial ownership  information in the database promptly to reach the FinCEN personnel  charged with ensuring the database's accuracy, completeness, and  timeliness. In addition, the Treasury IG should establish a procedure  to conduct periodic audits to determine the extent to which such  information actually reached the proper FinCEN personnel, was logged,  stored, and analyzed, led to changes in the database, and actually  improved the accuracy, completeness, and timeliness of the beneficial  ownership database.   In response to the bill, the Administrator for Federal Procurement  Policy should take immediate steps to revise the Federal Acquisition  Regulation to require covered federal contractors and subcontractors,  at an early stage in the federal procurement process, to disclose to  the federal government in writing, and to update over time, information  on their beneficial owners.   To carry out this provision in the law, the Administrator should work  with the General Services Administration to add a beneficial ownership  disclosure requirement to the database authorizing entities to bid on  federal contracts.   At the same time it is developing regulations to implement the new  law, FinCEN should simultaneously revise the existing customer due  diligence rule to bring it into harmony with the new law and all  proposed regulations. In doing so, FinCEN should carefully evaluate the  existing customer due diligence rule and preserve provisions that do  not conflict with the new law. Among other changes, the revised  customer due diligence rule must use the new definition of beneficial  owner established in the law. Treasury and  [[Page S7313]]  FinCEN should create a transition period for financial institutions to  implement the new beneficial ownership requirements. Lastly, FinCEN  should also take steps to establish procedures as needed to administer  the revised customer due diligence rule effectively.   Updating and strengthening our AML and beneficial ownership laws will  give us a 21st century system to combat these crimes. I guarantee you  criminals have long been revising, adjusting and amending their tactics  to circumvent our current laws. We must get ahead of them, and stay  ahead of them. This bill will enable us to do that.   I urge my colleagues to support the conference report and this  important measure.   I yield the floor.
