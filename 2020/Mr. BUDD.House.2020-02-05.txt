 Madam Speaker, tomorrow, the House will vote on the  Protecting the Right to Organize Act of 2019, or the PRO Act. This  legislation is a liberal wish list that represents a draconian overhaul  of our Nation's labor laws at the expense of employers, workers, and  economic growth, while strengthening the authoritarian power of big  labor.   Madam Speaker, despite the fact that the National Labor Relations  Board and the U.S. Supreme Court have recognized that there should be  ample time for ``uninhibited, robust, and wide-open debate in labor  disputes,'' the PRO Act deliberately speeds up election processes so  that employees don't have time to learn about the potential downsides  of joining a union.   Specifically, the bill codifies the provisions of an NLRB regulation  called the ``ambush election rule'' which significantly shortens the  time span in election processes. Democrats purposely inserted this  provision because they know union bosses are more likely to win  elections when employees are uninformed about the downsides of union  membership.   Second, the PRO Act increases liability for businesses by  dramatically expanding the definition of ``joint employer'' to also  include indirect control and unexercised potential control over  employees. These terms are incredibly broad and ambiguous, meaning  businesses could find themselves held liable for labor violations  committed by another business when they might not have even been aware  that they were considered a joint employer in the first place.   Even worse, the risk of increased liability incentivizes large  businesses to stop contracting out to small businesses. This would  force large businesses to keep more jobs in-house which, ultimately,  raises prices for both businesses and consumers.   The expanded definition of joint employer is also detrimental for  franchise businesses. A recent study showed that the definition change  has led to a 93 percent increase in lawsuits against franchise  businesses, costing them over $33 billion annually, and leading to the  loss of 376,000 jobs.   The study also showed that the majority of franchise businesses have  been offering less services just in order to avoid lawsuits. This  chilling effect hurts, again, both workers and consumers alike.    The PRO Act also compels private-sector employees to either join a  union or risk being fired. The bill abolishes the State Right to Work  Laws which allow workers the freedom to choose whether or not they want  to pay fees to a union.   If Right to Work Laws are repealed, not only will unions gain  unprecedented new power, but economic growth and employment will  suffer. A 2018 study by the National Economic Research Associates found  that between 2001 and 2016, States with Right to Work Laws saw private- sector employment grow by 27 percent; while States without Right to  Work Laws grew only 15 percent.   To top it off, the PRO Act strips workers of their right to cast  anonymous ballots in union elections. Under current law, workers are  able to anonymously oppose joining a union by casting ``secret'' and  unpublicized ballots. However, this PRO Act abolishes this practice and  forces employees to make their choice public about unionizing, which  makes it easier for unions to intimidate and threaten workers who do  not wish to sign up.   Senior fellow at the Mackinac Center for Public Policy, Vincent  Vernuccio, has said: ``The secret ballot is a bedrock principle of  democracy. It allows people to vote the way they feel without fear of  reprisal. Without it, those who hold the elections would hold all the  power.''   This bill should be opposed by anyone who is concerned with worker  freedom and continuing our country's economic boom. The PRO Act needs  to be permanently benched.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise today to highlight the importance of  protecting the Second Amendment to the Constitution.   In my district, Commissioners in Davidson, Davie, Iredell, and Rowan  Counties in North Carolina recently passed resolutions that simply  affirm the Second Amendment rights of their residents and declare that  these counties will never participate in the infringement of those  rights through unconstitutional gun control.   Anti-gun politicians in neighboring Virginia and other States are  trying to undermine and overturn the Second Amendment. That is why  these measures in my State are both necessary and timely.   I commend these counties, and I remain fully committed to defending  the rights of responsible, law-abiding gun owners.   Madam Speaker, it is a people problem, not a device problem.                            ____________________
