 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  service of Kevin Mooney to the communities of Scottsbluff, Gering, and  western Nebraska.   This week, after 34 years as a trusted journalist in Nebraska's  panhandle, Kevin will retire from his position as news director at KNEB  radio.   Throughout his career, Kevin has received six Mark Twain Awards from  the Nebraska Associated Press and the Trailblazer Award from the  Scottsbluff/Gering United Chamber of Commerce.   Kevin names the local sugar factory explosion in 1996 as the largest  story he reported. He stayed on the air all night providing updates to  our community.   Kevin is most thankful for his wife, Tracy. He says she has supported  him a great deal throughout their 35 years of marriage, given he is on  call 24 hours every day.   Even with his busy schedule, Kevin has dedicated himself to community  and charity events such as the Thanksgiving in the Valley event. It is  a collaboration of KNEB radio and local nonprofits Scottsbluff-Gering  Soup Kitchen and Scottsbluff Kiwanis Club. They serve around 400 meals  every year on Thanksgiving Day.   Please join me in honoring and thanking Kevin Mooney for his service  to Nebraska journalism.                            ____________________
