 Madam President, first of all, I want to echo what my  colleague said. Senator Cantwell has worked hard the last 2 years or 3  years on this process.   The lands bill was recently--    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 1  minute.    I am just saying that this is a piece of legislation  that has been worked on for quite some time. It is a piece of  legislation that basically does an awful lot for an awful lot of people  all over this country.   Every one of us has something in this that is good. Land and water  conservation is basically reauthorized permanently. It is something  that we worked hard on.   I appreciate all of the hard work, and thank you so much, Madam  President.                                Cloture Motion
