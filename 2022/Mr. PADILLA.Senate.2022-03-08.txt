 Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the Housing  Act for All Act of 2022, which I introduced today.   The homelessness and housing crises have worsened in recent years. As  of January 2020, more than 580,000 individuals in the country,  disproportionately people of color, were experiencing homelessness.  Rates of unsheltered homelessness have increased over the last few  years, and people experiencing unsheltered homelessness have a  mortality rate four to nine times higher than that of the general  public. A lack of affordable housing and housing assistance programs  have contributed to homelessness. There is a shortage of 6.8 million  affordable rental homes in the United States. Even before the pandemic,  one in four renters spent half of their monthly income on rent, and  nearly a million tenants were evicted each year. I believe every person  has a right to housing.   That is why I am proud to introduce this bill, which represents a  comprehensive approach to tackling housing and homelessness. If  enacted, it would invest in and align Federal resources to support  those experiencing housing instability. To address the homelessness and  housing crises, we must invest in policies that support strong,  sustainable, inclusive communities and ensure quality affordable homes  for all.   Specifically, this bill will address the affordable housing shortage  by investing in the housing trust fund, the Section 202 Supportive  Housing for the Elderly Program, Section 811 Supportive Housing for  Persons with Disabilities Program, and the HOME Program. It establishes  a Commission to focus on racial equity in housing and homelessness.   It will address homelessness by investing in housing choice vouchers  project-based rental assistance, emergency solutions grants, and  continuums of care. It will create grant programs to strengthen mobile  crisis intervention teams; to support hotel and motel conversions to  permanent supportive housing with services; to aid libraries in  supporting persons experiencing homelessness; and to provide people  living in vehicles with a safe place to park overnight and facilitate a  transition to stable housing. And it commissions a report on the  connection between evictions and emergency rental assistance during the  pandemic, so we can make smarter policy moving forward.   When I have traveled around the State--from LA County to Inland  Empire, to Fresno, to San Diego, to San Francisco--to get a sense of  the needs for housing in different communities, some key elements stood  out. On the production side, there is a need for more dedicated funding  for affordable housing from the Federal Government. There is also  missing middle housing for families, especially people of color. And  there is not enough housing near transit. That is why my bill focuses  on supporting inclusive, transit-oriented development. When I talked to  researchers about keeping families housed, one main point they made is  that we don't have enough data on renters and evictions, and that is  why I wanted to include a section of the bill on data--so we can make  evidence-based policies. Right now, the cost to build low-income  housing in California is very high because of land and material costs  as well as the fragmented way that funding gets doled out in  California. That is why I included a section to provide technical  assistance for localities navigating Federal and State housing funding  sources.   The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the need for affordable, safe,  and supportive housing for people experiencing homelessness. Because of  the pandemic, many lost their housing, while others struggled to make  rent for the first time. Some didn't know where to turn as shelters  faced capacity limits and food banks saw overwhelming demand. These  hardships were especially prevalent for those who had already been  marginalized--including communities of color, low-income communities,  and those with disabilities.   As we begin to recover from the pandemic, it is our job to rebuild a  more inclusive and equitable world for all. A just recovery includes  expanding affordable housing options to provide people with a sense of  stability. It also means respecting the dignity and supporting the  health of all community members. Affordable housing is essential  infrastructure. Every person deserves dignity, security, and space of  their own.   I want to thank Representatives Lieu and Carbajal for introducing  this bill with me, and I hope our colleagues will join us in support of  this solution to our housing and homelessness crises.                            ____________________
