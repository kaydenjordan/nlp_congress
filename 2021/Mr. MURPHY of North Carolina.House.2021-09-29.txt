 Madam Speaker, for the last 9 months,  Washington Democrats have been steamrolling Congress and the American  people with a series of socialist, Big Government takeovers. With such  fragile control of the White House, Senate, and House, Democrats have  authorized trillions in unchecked spending, plunging our Nation into  further crippling debt.   The American people are suffering the economic consequences of  Biden's unhinged spending in the form of staggering inflation and  decreased purchasing power, which I fear could lead us to double-digit  inflation by the end of this year.   I refuse to stand by as House Democrats attempt to bankrupt our  children and grandchildren. To correct this behavior and increase  financial transparency, I have introduced the INFORM Act, the companion  bill to Senator Mike Braun from Indiana.   The INFORM Act brings much-needed accountability to government  spending by requiring two new government-wide reporting standards on  the national debt and deficits and studies net fiscal burdens on  different populations.   With the debt growing bigger every day and Democrats showing no sign  of restraint in their plans to try to bankrupt America, my bill is an  essential part of ensuring that we create a responsible financial  future for generations to come.                            ____________________
