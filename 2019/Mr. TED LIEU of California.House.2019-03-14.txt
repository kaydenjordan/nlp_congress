 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Nadler for  his leadership.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this resolution requesting that  Special Counsel Mueller's report be made available to the public.   There are three reasons why this must happen.   First, the taxpayers paid for this report. The American people funded  this investigation. They have a right to see the contents of the report  of the investigation.   Second, internal bureaucratic Department of Justice policies do not  apply to Congress, especially on matters of national importance.   And third, if we don't get this report, it could amount to a cover- up.   The United States Constitution does not say that a sitting President  cannot be indicted. There is nothing in the Constitution that would  prevent that.   Unfortunately, the Department of Justice has taken the policy  position that they are not going to indict a sitting President, which  means that the only institution that can hold the President accountable  is Congress. If we do not get this information, we cannot effectively  do our jobs, we cannot hold the President accountable, and it is  something that the American public wants to see.   Over 87 percent of respondents in a recent poll say that this report  should be made available to Congress and to the American public. If the  Department of Justice does not do this, we all need to ask: What are  they trying to hide?
