 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support and in defense  of women's reproductive freedom and equal rights to comprehensive  healthcare.   The leaked Alito opinion shows the Supreme Court is likely to  overturn Roe v. Wade, the critical precedent that has protected a  woman's right to bodily autonomy for nearly 50 years. Suddenly,  millions of women across America are on the brink of being denied their  fullness of rights, and America is about to become less free.  Undeterred, Republicans are now publicly talking about a national  abortion ban, States rights notwithstanding. We are staring down an  emergency.   I was a young teen when the Supreme Court ruled on Roe v. Wade. That  remarkable ruling meant that my generation would not have to suffer the  cruel and dangerous world where abortion was illegal.  [[Page H4872]]    My generation, and all who have come after, have benefited beyond  measure from ensuring that women have control over their bodies and are  able to make their personal healthcare decisions in private counsel  with their families and their doctors, without having to risk their  safety or their lives.   In the House, we passed the Women's Health Protection Act to codify  Roe. Across the Capitol yesterday, 51 Senators turned their backs on  women's rights and voted against this legislation. It is shameful. I am  calling on the Senate to work together to protect women across the  country. We cannot afford to backslide. We must preserve access to safe  medical procedures and respect women's bodily autonomy.                                time  1115                         Mental Health Awareness Month     Madam Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Mental  Health Awareness Month.   As President Biden declared in his proclamation this month, each May  we raise awareness about the importance of mental health and its impact  on the well-being of all Americans, including children, adults,  families, and communities across our Nation.   We also give thanks to the dedicated mental health providers whose  service and support improve the lives of so many Americans. We stand in  solidarity with those who are experiencing mental health conditions,  renewing our commitment to providing them with the support they need  and deserve.   Madam Speaker, every day Americans bear a tremendous mental health  burden, exacerbated by COVID-19. The pandemic has increased daily  challenges for all of us and for so many have pushed us to our limits.  Frontline workers, seniors forced into isolation, parents juggling work  and teaching our kids from home, and especially our young people  navigating life's decisions, often without the basic support systems  they deserve and need.   We feel the impact of our daily interaction with family, friends,  neighbors, and even strangers, and we see the impact in the numbers.  Increased demand for mental health services, rising incidents of  domestic violence, and far too often stories of people, old and young,  losing all hope and dying by suicide.   I have heard from the Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital in  Chicago about the severity of the pediatric mental health crisis. Prior  to the pandemic, Lurie Children's used to get 50 calls per week for new  appointments for mental health services. They are now getting 50 calls  a day. Their emergency department treated a prepandemic two to three  suicide attempts each month. That number has jumped to two or three  attempts each day.   Countless teachers have come to me telling me about the struggles  their students are facing and the increasing difficulties they endure  simply managing their classrooms. A study found that the mental health  of colleges students declined between 2013 and 2021, with 135 percent  increase in depression, and 110 percent increase in anxiety.   According to the CDC, during the pandemic 18- to 24-year-olds became  25 percent more likely to report they had seriously considered suicide.  In my district, Dylan Buckner, a star quarterback due to graduate with  honors in mere months, was lost to suicide in January of 2021,  devastating his family, friends, and community.   More recently, my community lost a shining light, Orli Sheffey, to  suicide this spring. She was a wonderful young woman I had the  privilege of knowing her entire life. Her parents, Steve and Timna, her  sisters, Ariel and Ayelet, are heartbroken but are also committed to  helping others get the mental healthcare they need. Steve specifically  asked that Congress take up the issue of mental health on college  campuses.   Another of my constituents lost their son, Washington Metropolitan  Police Officer Jeff Smith, due to physical and mental injuries incurred  on January 6. Officer Smith's father shared with me that the stigma  around mental health and the lack of access to care contributed to his  tragic loss.   Orli's, Dylan's, and Jeff's stories, like everyone's, are specific to  their individual circumstances, but the tragedy of young lives cut  short and the incidence of people of all ages not able to get the care  they need reflect our national failure to meet this mental health  moment.   As a Nation, we desperately need more mental health awareness,  education, and better mental health services. We need more mental  health providers and residents available to both adults and to children  to address the access gap that so many families confront.   Getting America healthy requires that we get those facing these  challenges the resources they need, or if we as a Nation are going to  achieve our greatest potential, then we must help the sickest among us  get healthy so they can reach their full potential.
