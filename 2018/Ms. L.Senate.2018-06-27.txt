 v. U.S. Immigration & Customs Enf't, 302       F. Supp. 3d 1149, 2018 WL 2725736, at *7-12 (S.D. Cal. June       6, 2018). A class action has been certified to include       similarly situated migrant parents. Plaintiffs now request       classwide injunctive relief to prohibit separation of class       members from their children in the future absent a finding       the parent is unfit or presents a danger to the child, and to       require reunification of these families once the parent is       returned to immigration custody unless the parent is       determined to be unfit or presents a danger to the child.  [[Page S4463]]         Plaintiffs have demonstrated a likelihood of success on the       merits, irreparable harm, and that the balance of equities       and the public interest weigh in their favor, thus warranting       issuance of a preliminary injunction. This Order does not       implicate the Government's discretionary authority to enforce       immigration or other criminal laws, including its decisions       to release or detain class members. Rather, the Order       addresses only the circumstances under which the Government       may separate class members from their children, as well as       the reunification of class members who are returned to       immigration custody upon completion of any criminal       proceedings.''        Judge Sabraw went on to explain why an injunction was       needed despite the Trump Administration's claims that it was       unnecessary. He said:        ``[T]he Court addresses directly Defendants' argument that       an injunction is not necessary here in light of the EO and       the recently released Fact Sheet. Although these documents       reflect some attempts by the Government to address some of       the issues in this case, neither obviates the need for       injunctive relief here. As indicated throughout this Order,       the EO is subject to various qualifications. For instance,       Plaintiffs correctly assert the EO allows the government to       separate a migrant parent from his or her child ``where there       is a concern that detention of an alien child with the       child's alien parent would pose a risk to the child's       welfare.'' EO Sec. 3(b) (emphasis added). Objective standards       are necessary, not subjective ones, particularly in light of       the history of this case. Furthermore, the Fact Sheet focuses       on reunification ``at time of removal[,]'' stating that the       parent slated for removal will be matched up with their child       at a location in Texas and then removed. It says nothing       about reunification during the intervening time between       return from criminal proceedings to ICE detention or the time       in ICE detention prior to actual removal, which can take       months. Indeed, it is undisputed ``ICE has no plans or       procedures in place to reunify the parent with the child       other than arranging for them to be deported together after       the parent's immigration case is concluded.'' Thus, neither       of these directives eliminates the need for an injunction in       this case.''        Judge Sabraw went on to say:        ``The Executive Branch, which is tasked with enforcement of       the country's criminal and immigration laws, is acting within       its powers to detain individuals lawfully entering the United       States and to apprehend individuals illegally entering the       country. However, as the Court explained in its Order on       Defendants' motion to dismiss, the right to family integrity       still applies here. The context of the family separation       practice at issue here, namely an international border, does       not render the practice constitutional, nor does it shield       the practice from judicial review.''        The judge went on to discuss the shameful lack of planning       that has characterized the Trump Administration's zero-      tolerance policy, saying:        ``[T]he practice of separating these families was       implemented without any effective system or procedure for (1)       tracking the children after they were separated from their       parents, (2) enabling communication between the parents and       their children after separation, and (3) reuniting the       parents and children after the parents are returned to       immigration custody following completion of their criminal       sentence. This is a startling reality. The government readily       keeps track of personal property of detainees in criminal and       immigration proceedings. Money, important documents, and       automobiles, to name a few, are routinely catalogued, stored,       tracked and produced upon a detainees' release, at all       levels--state and federal, citizen and alien. Yet, the       government has no system in place to keep track of, provide       effective communication with, and promptly produce alien       children. The unfortunate reality is that under the present       system migrant children are not accounted for with the same       efficiency and accuracy as property. Certainly, that cannot       satisfy the requirements of due process.''        He also discussed the Trump Adminstration's problematic       treatment of those seeking asylum:        ``Asylum seekers like  and many other class members       may be fleeing persecution and are entitled to careful       consideration by government officials. Particularly so if       they have a credible fear of persecution. We are a country of       laws, and of compassion. We have plainly stated our intent to       treat refugees with an ordered process, and benevolence, by       codifying principles of asylum. The Government's treatment of        and other similarly situated class members does not       meet this standard, and it is unlikely to pass constitutional       muster.''        Judge Sabraw concluded his order as follows:        ``The unfolding events--the zero tolerance policy, EO and       DHS Fact Sheet--serve to corroborate Plaintiffs' allegations.       The facts set forth before the Court portray reactive       governance--responses to address a chaotic circumstance of       the Government's own making. They belie measured and ordered       governance, which is central to the concept of due process       enshrined in our Constitution. This is particularly so in the       treatment of migrants, many of whom are asylum seekers and       small children. The extraordinary remedy of classwide       preliminary injunction is warranted based on the evidence       before the Court. For the reasons set out above, the Court       hereby GRANTS Plaintiffs' motion for classwide preliminary       injunction, and finds and orders as follows:        (1) Defendants, and their officers, agents, servants,       employees, attorneys, and all those who are in active concert       or participation with them, are preliminarily enjoined from       detaining Class Members in DHS custody without and apart from       their minor children, absent a determination that the parent       is unfit or presents a danger to the child, unless the parent       affirmatively, knowingly, and voluntarily declines to be       reunited with the child in DHS custody.        (2) If Defendants choose to release Class Members from DHS       custody, Defendants, and their officers, agents, servants,       employees and attorneys, and all those who are in active       concert or participation with them, are preliminary enjoined       from continuing to detain the minor children of the Class       Members and must release the minor child to the custody of       the Class Member, unless there is a determination that the       parent is unfit or presents a danger to the child, or the       parent affirmatively, knowingly, and voluntarily declines to       be reunited with the child.        (3) Unless there is a determination that the parent is       unfit or presents a danger to the child, or the parent       affirmatively, knowingly, and voluntarily declines to be       reunited with the child: (a) Defendants must reunify all       Class Members with their minor children who are under the age       of five (5) within fourteen (14) days of the entry of this       Order; and (b) Defendants must reunify all Class Members with       their minor children age five (5) and over within thirty (30)       days of the entry of this Order.        (4) Defendants must immediately take all steps necessary to       facilitate regular communication between Class Members and       their children who remain in ORR custody, ORR foster care, or       DHS custody. Within ten (10) days, Defendants must provide       parents telephonic contact with their children if the parent       is not already in contact with his or her child.        (5) Defendants must immediately take all steps necessary to       facilitate regular communication between and among all       executive agencies responsible for the custody, detention or       shelter of Class Members and the custody and care of their       children, including at least ICE, CBP, BOP, and ORR,       regarding the location and well-being of the Class Members'       children.        (6) Defendants, and their officers, agents, servants,       employees, attorneys, and all those who are in active concert       or participation with them, are preliminarily enjoined from       removing any Class Members without their child, unless the       Class Member affirmatively, knowingly, and voluntarily       declines to be reunited with the child prior to the Class       Member's deportation, or there is a determination that the       parent is unfit or presents a danger to the child.        (7) This Court retains jurisdiction to entertain such       further proceedings and to enter such further orders as may       be necessary or appropriate to implement and enforce the       provisions of this Order and Preliminary Injunction.''
