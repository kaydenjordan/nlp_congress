 Mr. Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 3, line 4, strike ``source code, including''.        Page 3, line 6, insert ``algorithmic trading'' before       ``source code''.        Page 3, line 15, strike ``source code, including''.        Page 3, line 17, insert ``algorithmic trading'' before       ``source code''.        Page 3, line 25, strike ``source code, including''.        Page 4, line 2, insert ``algorithmic trading'' before       ``source code''.        Page 4, line 11, strike ``source code, including''.        Page 4, line 13, insert ``algorithmic trading'' before       ``source code''.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 736, the  gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Foster) and a Member opposed each will  control 5 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Illinois.    Mr. Speaker, my amendment clarifies that this bill is  only intended to apply to the source code underpinning algorithmic  trading rather than any computer code that exists anywhere in the  enterprise.   The algorithmic source code at a trading firm are its crown jewels.  It is basically the core of its existence in its intellectual property.   It is not merely historical or descriptive like books or records that  regulators routinely have access to. Likewise, it is not a broad  expression of strategies that a firm might use some time in the future.  Rather, it is a specific and prescriptive algorithm that generates a  specific outcome based on a specific set of inputs.   The firms that rely on algorithmic trading have Ph.D. scientists,  mathematicians, and economists researching correlations that lead to  these relationships between the inputs and outputs. These may be simple  but may also be incredibly complex, involving multiple inputs that do  not appear related at first glance.   This complexity, coupled with the fact that they are written largely  in computer code, limits the usefulness of  [[Page H1166]]  inspecting source code as an examination tool. It is, rather, the  behavior of the firm in the market that represents potential violations  of security laws. Manipulative behavior, like frequently displaying or  canceling orders, should get the regulators' attention and prompt them  to ask the firm to explain it.   Source code would be and will be a valuable part of any investigation  or enforcement action into observed manipulation of the market, but  this is not the basis and should not be the basis for casual  inspection. It would probably be central to proving the element of  intent in an enforcement action because it demonstrates that the  algorithm was designed to engage in, for example, manipulative or  abusive behavior.   To this end, it is imperative that the firms achieve archived  versions in effect at any given time and log modifications to those  algorithms, including who made them, at any time that the code is  altered. These should always be available by subpoena.   Additionally, I believe that most firms would allow the regulator on  site to examine the source code on an air gap computer. To treat the  source code as ordinary books and records would not limit the regulator  to onsite examination, but would allow for staff to request it and that  it be made available offsite, which has real dangers.   Because of the value the firm carries with its proprietary  algorithms, it makes sense that the firm would be reluctant to allow  any undue access to its crown jewels. It is really, I believe and I  think the majority of my colleagues believe, something that should be  accessible only by a subpoena.   My amendment simply clarifies that it is only the algorithmic trading  code and related information that should be covered. I urge my  colleagues to support my amendment and, upon its adoption, to support  the bill on final passage.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1615    Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to  the amendment.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from California is  recognized for 5 minutes.   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, the current language of  title II of H.R. 3978 would require SEC examination staff to obtain a  subpoena before it could inspect any source code whatsoever, including,  for example, computer code reflecting a firm's adherence to the SEC's  cybersecurity regulations.   The amendment offered by Mr. Foster would narrow the requirement in  title II to only apply to proprietary source code related to  algorithmic trading. While I applaud Mr. Foster and the amendment's  cosponsor, Mr. Scott, for narrowing the overbroad language of title II,  the amendment cannot fix this untimely and ill-advised legislation.  Even as amended, title II would undermine effective oversight of the  high-frequency traders that simultaneously create and stand to benefit  from the kind of extreme market volatility that we have seen in the  past few weeks.   Let's not forget that, on May 6, 2010, in an event referred to as the  ``flash crash,'' major U.S. stock indices inexplicably plummeted nearly  $1 trillion in less than an hour before mostly rebounding. Alarmingly,  market regulators took nearly 5 months to determine that the flash  crash was caused by a combination of a flawed execution algorithm of  one institutional investor and aggressive algorithmic trading by HFTs.   While it is too early to tell exactly what created the recent  volatility in the U.S. stock market, market analysts have suggested  that algorithmic trading has played a central role. In fact, just last  Tuesday, the day after the Dow Jones Industrial Average saw its biggest  one-day point drop in history, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin  testified before the House Financial Services Committee that  algorithmic trading ``definitely had an impact on market moves.''   Given the importance of algorithmic trading in our stock market, it  makes no sense to obstruct the SEC's access to the information that  enables such activity merely because it exists in an electronic format.  Americans who have trillions of their dollars in 401(k) and other  retirement and savings plans deserve the SEC's best efforts in  investigating and mitigating computer-driven market disruptions. For  this reason and for all of these reasons, and given my broader concerns  that the bill would significantly harm investor confidence in our  markets even if the amendment is adopted, I am urging a ``no'' vote on  H.R. 3978.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I would just like to simply reiterate that  it should be the actions in the market that are the first indications  that the regulators should have a look at, and when they see suspicious  activity in the market, that is the time to get the subpoena and go  after the source code.   With that, I just urge the adoption of the amendment and the passage  of the underlying bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the previous question  is ordered on the bill, as amended, and on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Foster).   The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Foster).   The amendment was agreed to.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the engrossment and third  reading of the bill.   The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was  read the third time.                              Motion to Recommit
