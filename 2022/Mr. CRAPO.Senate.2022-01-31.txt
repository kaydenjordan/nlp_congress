 Mr. President, I honor Herbert M. Franklin, who passed  away on November 16, 2021. He has left a meaningful and beautiful mark  on the heart of our Nation's Capital.   Mr. Franklin's true affection for the history and buildings of our  exceptional Capitol and Washington, DC, was put to great use through  his service as executive officer to George M. White and Alan M.  Hantman, the 9th and 10th Architects of the Capitol, from 1989 until  Mr. Franklin's retirement in 2001. In that capacity, he acted as chief  of staff for all administrative policies and actions of the agency,  which has over 2,000 employees and is essential to the preservation and  maintenance of this marvelous structure and its grounds.   His appreciation for architecture, politics, and gardens showed in  the thoughtful proficiency he put into the many important projects  under his purview. Among his accomplishments, he served as project  director for the design and construction of the Thurgood Marshall  Federal Judiciary Building, the 1995 refinement of the Capitol Center  Visitor Project, the National Garden Project, and the renovation of the  U.S. Botanic Garden.   Additionally, Mr. Franklin served on the National Capital Memorial  Commission. While on the commission, he worked on a special task force  that also included the Commission on Fine Arts and the National Capital  Planning Commission. The group was asked to draw up a master plan for  the placement of memorials in the capital city, with the challenging  objective of preserving the remaining open space on the Mall for  particularly significant memorials. Through his role at the Architect  of the Capitol, he also served on the D.C. Zoning Commission.   A person needed only to take a tour of the Capitol with Mr. Franklin  to see just how deeply he loved it, the people who work in these halls,  and the processes and procedures at the core of its operation. He  delighted in his work and took very seriously his charge to guard and  honor our Capitol.   Susan Hawkes Wheeler, chief of staff for my Washington, DC, office,  is one of the very lucky people to have benefited from one of Mr.  Franklin's tours. He gave Susan her first and best tour of the Capitol,  and I am so glad he did. Her visit with his warm and hospitable family  was instrumental in her deciding to join my staff just a few weeks  later. And she is just one of many who benefited from his experience  and guidance throughout his extraordinary life and career.   Mr. Franklin's admiration for architecture and the building arts also  showed in his volunteer work, as he was instrumental in the founding of  the National Building Museum. In 1977, he was part of a small group  that created the Committee for a National Museum of the Building Arts,  in response to concerns over the fate of the historic Pension Building  in Washington, DC. Mr. Franklin drafted the legislation that eventually  led to Congress establishing the National Building Museum in 1980. He  later served as its counsel, sat on its executive committee, and was  chairman of its board, among his many contributions.   Mr. Franklin also devoted considerable time to leadership roles for  many  [[Page S411]]  other organizations. He taught at American University, was a guest  lecturer at numerous colleges and universities, and was very involved  in the governance of the Cosmos Club in Washington, DC, including as  its president. He also authored and coauthored several published  articles and books.   Mr. Franklin graduated from Harvard College and Harvard Law School.  Originally from Milwaukee, WI, he started his legal career in his  hometown before coming to Washington, DC, during the Kennedy  administration as a lawyer in the Housing and Home Financing Agency. In  1965, he served as the director of the Business and Development Center  for Urban America, Inc. before becoming the first development  administrator for the city of Middletown, CT. He couldn't stay away  from his beloved Washington, DC, for long, though, returning in 1968 to  serve in a leadership role for the National Urban Coalition, where he  staffed a national task force on urban revitalization.   In 1973, Mr. Franklin became a founding partner in the law firm of  Lane and Edson, P.C. in Washington, DC, specializing in real estate  finance and development. He was in private practice until joining the  office of the Architect of the Capitol in 1989.   I extend my condolences to Mr. Franklin's wife of 61 years, Barbara  Braemer Franklin; daughter Marcia; son and daughter-in-law Jonathan and  Sharon; son David; grandchildren Stephanie, Noah, Sophia, Norah and  Sarah; and other family and friends. Thank you for sharing Mr. Franklin  with us and our extraordinary seat of government he loved so much. We  are all, no doubt, bettered by the respect, intellect and calm he put  into the measured problem-solving that typified his service to our  country.                            ____________________
