 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, the Senate is witnessing an unusual  sight. Our colleague from West Virginia, Senator Manchin, is trying to  roll back legislation that he himself wrote and passed less than a year  ago. Reports say the Senator now wants Congress to delay the new  electric vehicle tax credit that he himself hand-designed just last  summer until he can resolve a fight with his fellow Democrats and the  administration over what their own law actually says or actually does.   It would be comical if this Democrat-on-Democrat chaos weren't  impacting our country. Republicans pointed out over and over that  Democrats' reckless taxing-and-spending spree was unfair as well as  unworkable. We said from the start this is a hugely expensive,  hopelessly tangled mess of subsidies, regulations, and redtape. They  raised taxes on American jobs, American families, and American energy  in order to inefficiently send little chunks of the people's money back  to them if they plan their lives according to unclear and changing Big  Government standards.   This is the classic tax-and-spend liberal logic: The IRS takes more  of your money so bureaucrats can take over more of your life. Well, it  is proving just as tangled and messy for the country, as we all  predicted last summer.   Our Democratic colleague from West Virginia is locked in some battle  with the Democrats' own Treasury Department over the sweeping new  regulations that need to be written. He seems to be suggesting that  some Americans who have already received the EV tax credit--that he  wrote--should have to actually pay it back. In the meantime, while  Democrats keep fighting it out, the Senator apparently wants Congress  to act again to halt or change the implementation of his own policy.   So good luck to American families trying to understand what on Earth  does and does not qualify for the Big Government subsidies. Good luck  to American businesses trying to figure out how to direct their  investments. Now, this is what happens when Democrats make it up as  they go along and clumsily try to rewire huge parts of our economy on  the fly.   Now, remember, the senior Senator from West Virginia has already  acknowledged that other Biden policies completely cancel out the  supposed deficit savings from the massive climate bill. He has admitted  that President Biden's student loan socialism wipes out all of their  claimed deficit savings from the Green New Deal, and then some. And  now, on top of all that, the redtape and expensive subsidies are so  tangled that the very Senator who wrote the law now wants to delay or  change it.   This has been a terrible deal for the country right from the  beginning. Nonpartisan experts said the Democrats' boondoggle would  increase inflation in the short term and do nothing for inflation in  the long term. Nonpartisan experts said it would shatter President  Biden's promise not to impact middle-class families with tax hikes.  Nonpartisan experts said that none of it would have any--any-- measurable impact on the global temperature.   And now, apparently, even the author of the bill wants Congress to  rescue the country from his own handiwork. This is no way to run a  country. People need to plan their lives. Businesses need to plan their  futures and their investments. How can American workers and  entrepreneurs do what they do best if Washington Democrats are  micromanaging the economy and changing their mind every 5 minutes?   So, to summarize, we have a Senator asking Congress to delay and  modify the signature bill that he himself wrote less than a year ago.  We have American families being treated as pawns in a fight between  Democrats and other Democrats. This bill was already an incredibly bad  deal for the country, and the giant mess gets worse and worse every  day.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on an entirely different matter, some  things in life are just constants: The Sun rises in the east, water is  wet, and Democratic administrations look for ways to let terrorists out  of Guantanamo Bay.   The Biden administration has already overseen the largest terrorist  jailbreak in modern memory when they abandoned the Bagram Air Base  prison in Afghanistan. They let the Taliban waltz in and free thousands  of terrorists, reportedly including the ISIS-K suicide bomber who  killed our 13 American servicemembers in Kabul during the Biden  administration's botched withdrawal.   Now, rumor has it they are considering writing a sequel to that  jailbreak by continuing the Obama-Biden administration's literal  obsession with removing terrorists from our secure and  [[Page S108]]  legal detention facility at Guantanamo.   Let's get a few things straight. The American people are safer and  more secure because monsters like Khalid Shaikh Mohammed are off the  battlefield and behind bars where they belong. When the Obama  administration wanted to bring these terrorists to America, introduce  them into the American judicial and prison systems, the Congress, on an  overwhelming, overwhelming bipartisan basis, said no. But the  progressive leftists in the Biden administration don't seem to care.  They seem more concerned about the views of European human rights  activists than about key national security concerns and complex legal  questions.   So new reports suggest that President Biden and his team are trying  to cut plea deals with these terrorists and war criminals. They want to  cut these guys deals.   What would the deals look like? No one knows. They won't tell  anybody. Would they be transferred into our own taxpayer-funded justice  system for American citizens? Are we going to have hardened terrorists  moving through the streets of Manhattan, with terrorist lawyers getting  the rights and access that pertain to defense counsel?    Mayor Adams is already saying New York can't cope with President  Biden's open southern border, and now the NYPD could have to babysit  terrorists as well? Or is the plan military commissions, in which case,  what concessions is the President planning to make to these murderers  to get their activist lawyers to accept that forum?   Or does the administration intend to follow the Obama  administration's model and rely on third parties and other countries to  do the dirty work of detention? Well, of course, if you are going to  send these people to other countries, that requires allies who are  reliable, responsible, and actually willing to take these terrorists.  Does President Biden plan to gamble on an Iraqi Government that is  increasingly under the influence of Iran? Or do they want to double  down on detention facilities run by Syrian Kurdish partners in areas  that are not yet under the control of the Assad regime?   There is already no plan for Europe to reabsorb their citizens who  fought for ISIS and are currently detained by the SDF. We are going to  add to those ranks?   There is a huge long list of practical problems the administration  needs to consider before they toy with risky plans to shutter a  perfectly good facility at Guantanamo Bay for no good reason. The Biden  administration has got to rediscover some common sense.   Now, I understand that liberal activists are willing to leave  innocent American families in greater danger in exchange for a little  bit of leftwing symbolism, but our Commander in Chief has a higher  duty.                            ____________________
