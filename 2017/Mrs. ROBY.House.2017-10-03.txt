 Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from Alabama is recognized  for 5 minutes.    Madam Speaker, I am grateful for the opportunity to share  my strong support for the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, or  Micah's Law.   My colleagues who oppose this bill adamantly defend a mother's  ability to have a late-term abortion and a doctor's ability to perform  it. But, Madam Speaker, I have heard no mention of the third person in  the room: the unborn baby.   I am astounded that the opposition chooses to focus solely on the two  individuals who can speak for themselves, with no mention of the one  who cannot. That is exactly what we are here to do today. We are here  to speak up for those who can't speak for themselves. We are here to  defend those who cannot defend themselves.   Our bill seeks to do this by restricting abortions after 20 weeks, or  at the 6th month of pregnancy, the point at which research shows the  unborn babies can feel pain.   Last week, I, too, had the opportunity to meet the little boy this  bill was named for: Micah Pickering. As many of you know, he was born  at 22 weeks and spent 4 long months in intensive care.                                time  1730    Micah survived, and this year he is in kindergarten. You see,  children like Micah, who are born prematurely, are treated as patients.  Special care is given to reduce their pain and increase their chances  for survival, just as it should be.   So, Madam Speaker, my question to those who would oppose this bill is  this: What is the difference between a baby born at 6 months outside  the womb and a baby at 6 months inside the womb? How can one be treated  like a miracle they are created to be and the other be treated like  medical waste? If a baby like Micah can survive outside the womb given  the appropriate care, shouldn't we give other babies like him the same  protection and chance to live?   I have listened to my colleagues on the other side call this bill  extreme. I say to oppose this bill is extreme. If we won't stop  abortions at 6 months of pregnancy when a baby feels pain, when will we  stop them?   We have to draw a line somewhere. To say aborting a little baby who  can actually feel the pain of the procedure being forced upon them  crosses the line is a gross understatement.   Madam Speaker, I am unapologetically pro-life, and I oppose abortion  at any stage. I will always fight to grant greater protections for life  under the law. As a society, I pray that we will start assigning  greater value to life at all stages in this country.   Madam Speaker, so often we get caught up in the policies of this  issue and we forget that these are babies, for goodness' sake. They  feel pain, and we need to protect them. That is why I urge my  colleagues to oppose this motion to recommit and join me in supporting  this underlying bill.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is  ordered on the motion to recommit.   There was no objection.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to recommit.   The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that  the noes appeared to have it.
