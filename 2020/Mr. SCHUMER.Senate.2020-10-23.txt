 I suggest the absence of a quorum.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        On page S6407, October 23, 2020, second column, the following  appears: LEGISLATIVE SESSION -- Motion to Proceed  I suggest the absence of a  quorum.      The online Record has been corrected to read:  LEGISLATIVE SESSION  ------- PROTECT ACT -- MOTION TO PROCEED  I suggest the absence of a quorum.    ========================= END NOTE =========================                                ____________________     Mr. President, the Republicans, as we all know and as  the Nation knows, are running the most partisan, most hypocritical, and  least legitimate process in the history of Supreme Court nominations.  That is why I suggested the absence of a quorum. We are not going to  have business as usual.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, now, I believe the Senate majority is on  the precipice of making a colossal and historic mistake. By rushing  this nomination through the Senate only 8 days before a national  election, after 50 million Americans have already voted, the Republican  majority is steering the Senate, the Supreme Court, and the country in  a very dangerous direction. The damage to Americans' faith in these  institutions could be lasting.   So before we go any further, we should shut off the cameras, close  the Senate, and talk face-to-face about what this might mean for the  country.   We need to restore public trust in our institutions, not continue to  undermine it. The Senate majority may have the power to confirm this  nomination before the election, but that does not make it right. Might  does not make it right.   We ought to have a candid conversation, Senator-to-Senator, in which  we truly listen to each other before it is too late. So I am making a  motion to move to closed session.                            ____________________     Mr. President, in accordance with rule XXI, I now move  that the Senate go into closed session.    Mr. President, we have just heard a tit-for-tat,  convoluted version of history that the majority leader uses to justify  steering the Senate toward one of the lowest moments in its long  history. Might does not make right.   ``You did something wrong, so we can do something wrong'' is no  justifications when the rights of the American people are at stake. The  Republican majority is steering the Senate toward one of the lowest  moments in its long history. The Republican majority is on the  precipice of making a colossal and historic mistake, and the damage it  does to this Chamber will be irrevocable.   After thwarting the constitutional prerogative of a duly elected  Democratic President to appoint a Supreme Court Justice because it was  an election year, the Republican majority is rushing to confirm a  Justice for a Republican President 1 week before election day.  Consistency? I am afraid not. You don't have the right to argue  consistency when you are doing what you are doing now.   Four short years ago, all of our Republican friends argued that it  was a principle--that was the word they used, ``principle''--to let the  American people have a voice in the selection of a Supreme Court  Justice because an election was 8 months away.   Those same Republicans are preparing to confirm a Justice with an  election that is 8 days away. In the process, the majority has trampled  over norms, rules, standards, honor, values--any of them--that could  possibly stand in its monomaniacal pursuit to put someone on the Court  who will take away the rights of so many Americans.   The Republican majority, of course, ignored health guidelines to  conduct in-person hearings in the middle of a pandemic after Republican  members of the committee themselves had contracted COVID-19. It has  broken longstanding Senate precedent. Never--never in the history of  the Senate, despite any sophistic analyses of recent history, never has  a Supreme Court nominee, a lifetime appointment, been considered so  close to an election. The Presiding Officer of the Senate confirmed  this yesterday in response to this Senator's inquiry; never in the  history of the Senate has a Supreme Court nominee been confirmed after  July of an election year.   My friends, it is the hallmark of democracy that might does not make  right. The Republican Senate is blatantly ignoring this principle. Here  in Leader McConnell's Senate, the majority lives by the rules of  ``because we can.'' They completely ignore the question of whether they  should.   A Supreme Court nominee will be confirmed on a party-line vote after  the rules were changed to allow it. Now it doesn't matter that an  election is just a short time away. It is a complete contradiction of  the supposed principle that same party so vehemently argued only 4  years ago. Again, it is 8 days--8 days--before an election in which the  American people will choose exactly whom they want to pick Supreme  Court Justices for them.   For the Republican leader to argue for consistency, using his  convoluted version of history is laughable. It is absurd. It is  outrageous. It is a stain on this body and an indelible mark on this  Senate majority. In short, the Senate Republican majority is conducting  the most rushed, most partisan, and least legitimate process in the  entire history of Supreme Court nominations, and Democrats will not  lend an ounce of legitimacy to the process.   Yesterday, the seats of the Democratic members of the Judiciary  remained vacant in that committee  [[Page S6411]]  room. In their place, were the reminders of what is ultimately at stake  in this nomination--the fundamental rights of the American people. It  is not Democrat or Republican or who did this when and who did that  when. It is the rights of the American people, what America needs and  what Judge Barrett has stood for on these issues in the past that is  ultimately what matters.   On the seats of those Democratic members were photographs of  Americans whose lives would be devastated if a Justice Barrett delivers  the decisive vote to strike down the Affordable Care Act, ripping away  healthcare from tens of millions of Americans and eliminating  protections for more than 130 million Americans with preexisting  conditions.   You could imagine, alongside their faces, the faces of women who  cherish the right to make their own private medical decisions, the  faces of LGBTQ Americans who want to marry whom they love and not be  fired for who they are, the faces of American workers who are breaking  their backs to make ends meet and need their union to help them get a  better wage, the faces of young people who know that the planet is in  peril in their lifetimes.   I hope that when Republican Members of the Senate think about this  nomination, they will think about those faces and what this nomination  means to them, the hundreds of millions of Americans who will lose  rights and fundamental things they need to make their lives better  because of this nomination. It is not about qualifications. It is about  what the American people need and want and will an unelected body take  those rights away from them.    So I hope my colleagues will think about that. Take a moment. Take a  moment to think about it, and then think about what it says about this  sham of a process and the passion that we on this side of the aisle  feel about protecting those people's rights, that we were forced to  take the extraordinary step of refusing to participate in this process,  because while they may realize it or not, our Republican majority's  monomaniacal drive to confirm this Justice in the most hypocritical,  the most inconsistent of circumstances will forever defile the Senate  and, even more importantly, curtail the fundamental rights of the  American people for generations to come. Democrats will play no part in  that.    Mr. President, I move to recommit the Barrett nomination  to the Committee on the Judiciary.    Mr. President, I move to adjourn and to then convene for  pro forma sessions only, with no business being conducted, at 12 noon  on the following dates, and that following each pro forma session, the  Senate adjourn until the next pro forma session: Tuesday, October 27;  Friday, October 29; Tuesday, November 3; Friday, November 6. Further,  that if there is an agreement on legislation in relation to the COVID  pandemic, the Senate convene under the authority of S. Res. 296 of the  108th Congress. Finally, that when the Senate adjourns on Friday,  November 6, it next convene at 4:30 p.m., Monday, November 9, and that  following the prayer and the pledge, the morning hour be deemed  expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the time for  the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day, and morning  business be closed.    Mr. President, I appeal the ruling of the Chair, and I  move to table the appeal.    Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.
