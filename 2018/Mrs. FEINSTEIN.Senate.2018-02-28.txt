 Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the  introduction of the ``Age 21 Act'' by Senator Flake and myself.   Two weeks ago, at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland,  Florida, our Nation experienced yet another horrific mass shooting that  has shocked the conscience of us all.   The shooter--a 19-year old former student of the high school--used an  AR-15 military-style assault rifle that he legally purchased at a gun  store, to kill former classmates and educators. Along with 14 wounded,  17 beautiful lives were lost in this horrific attack. Many of them were  children and young adults. Their whole lives were ahead of them.   The overwhelming agony so many victims and their loved ones are  experiencing is all too familiar to gun violence victims and survivors  all across America. This palpable agony and grief has emboldened  students from Parkland and all across this Nation to speak out about  gun violence and demand that we as lawmakers act. I am deeply inspired  by the courage of these young people, and I hope my colleagues will  join me in working with them.   The bill that Senator Flake and I are introducing is straightforward  and simple--it raises the minimum age to purchase a military-style  assault rifle and high capacity ammunition magazines to age 21. In so  doing, this legislation closes the loophole in current law that allows  teenagers to legally walk into a gun store and buy an AR-15. It further  prohibits private individuals from selling or transferring AR-15s to  teenagers under the age of 21. In this way, it brings the minimum age  requirements for buying handguns and military-style assault weapons  into parity.   It makes perfectly clear that in America, if a person is not old  enough to buy a handgun--or, for that matter, old enough to buy a  beer--they should not be able to purchase a military-style assault  weapon. In my view, this bill is one small step in the right direction.  It was developed following the attack in Parkland that had students  asking ``why was this teenager able to legally walk into a gun store  and buy an AR-15?'' In fact, one student named Samuel Zeif, who lost  his best friend in the shooting, asked President Trump why a young  person in America ``can still go in a store and buy a weapon of war?''   So we worked in the spirit of bipartisanship to let Samuel, and these  students, know that as lawmakers we hear them. And we will work  together to make sure that they feel safe in their schools and in their  neighborhoods.   So I'm proud of this bipartisan piece of legislation and would urge  that this body take it up and pass it immediately. However, I would be  remiss not to mention that so much more remains to be done. Already  this Congress, I have introduced legislation to ban bump stocks and  assault weapons from our streets. I've also introduced legislation that  would provide states with a legal framework for courts to issue gun  violence restraining orders to prevent dangerous individuals from  accessing firearms. Additionally, nearly 100 percent of Americans  support legislation that would require universal background checks on  all gun sales, something that ordinary Americans are shocked is not  already the law.   I ask my colleagues to work with us on these common-sense, broadly  supported proposals. I strongly believe that lives are at stake. We  can't continue to watch our children get slaughtered.   Martin Luther King, Jr. once said that ``we are confronted with the  fierce urgency of now. In this unfolding conundrum of life and history  there is such a thing as being too late'' and ``we must move past  indecision to action.''   Today, as students and communities all across our nation cry out for  stronger gun laws, this message continues to ring true. Now is the time  for us to act, and to show the American people that we can come  together when they are looking for leadership.   I yield the floor.                                  ______                                         By Mr. BURR (for himself, Mr. Tillis, Mr. Alexander, Mr. Blunt,          Mr. Carper, Mr. Cassidy, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Corker, Mr. Cornyn,          Mr. Cotton, Mr. Cruz, Mr. Donnelly, Mr. Enzi, Mrs. Fischer, Mr.          Gardner, Mr. Graham, Ms. Heitkamp, Mr. Hoeven, Mr. Inhofe, Mr.          Isakson, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Lankford, Mr. Manchin,          Mrs. McCaskill, Mr. McConnell, Mr. Nelson, Mr. Paul, Mr.          Perdue, Mr. Portman, Mr. Thune, Mr. Toomey, Mr. Wicker, Mr.          Daines, Mr. Scott, Mr. Barrasso, Mr. Warner, Mr. Roberts, Mrs.          Ernst, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Heller, Mr. Rubio, Mr. Moran, Ms.          Collins, Mr. Hatch, and Mr. Sasse):   S.J.
