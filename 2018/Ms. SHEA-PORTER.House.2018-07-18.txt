 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to call this body to  action. Two days ago, we watched, the world watched in horror in  Finland as our President took Putin's side instead of our intelligence  community's side. Our intelligence community told us, told him that  Russia attacked our democracy and attacked our elections. For whatever  reason, President Trump seems unable to clearly state that he agrees  with intelligence.   Just yesterday, when he said he misspoke, he then shifted and went  back to it could be others. Why? We have to ask ourselves why. The  Republican majority has been determined to do absolutely nothing in  response when it is clear that there is much that we can and must do.  Why?   They have declined to pass additional legislation to serve as a  deterrent to Russia and that would sanction Russia if they attacked our  elections again. Why? Especially when we have been warned that Russia  intends to interfere with our elections in just a few months.   They have this whole Congress, but still Republicans have not passed  any legislation to strengthen our election security system to mitigate  this threat. Instead, congressional Republicans are trying to cut--this  is unbelievable--trying to cut election security grants by hundreds of  millions of dollars. Why? Don't they at least want to protect us going  into the future?   They have blocked votes to force the President to release his tax  returns so we can know whether his business deals are affecting his  decisions in the office of the Presidency. Why?   And, most importantly, they have consistently refused to vote to  protect Special Counsel Mueller's investigation. Why?   Speaker Ryan controls the floor. Republicans are the ones who put all  of  [[Page H6472]]  the legislation on the floor. They could do this now, but they refuse  to, even though they have the power. Why won't they? Why won't they let  us investigate? Why won't they let us have a vote?   America and the world is watching. They are wondering how long it  will take for this Republican Congress to act. When will it be too  much?   We have heard some Republican heroes like John McCain and others who  have said this was the most horrific performance and that we must--must  talk about this, and yet we don't. Why?                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I would like to share an editorial from  [[Page H6555]]  the Union Leader, New Hampshire's statewide newspaper.         People who thought a weak and dying Roosevelt gave away too       much to the Russians at Yalta in World War II may want to       reconsider. Compared to the pathetic, boot-licking       performance of President Trump in Helsinki this week, FDR had       his A-game going against Joseph Stalin.        Republicans who are now, finally, trying to distance       themselves from Trump have no one to blame but themselves.       They kept silent as Trump has disgraced and demeaned the       office, damaged our relations with loyal allies, and       repeatedly attempted to destroy a free press.        But when an American President openly sides with a Russian       KGB thug against our own country, these politicians sense       that the `optics' don't look so good and might threaten their       power and perks in midterm elections.        Trump, of course, is now trying to walk things back, but       even his hard-core supporters must wince at how he tries to       worm his way out of his nauseating Helsinki brownnosing of       the dictator Putin.        But the Republican Party isn't Trump's hardcore faithful;       and if the party doesn't clearly denounce this shameful and       disgraceful performance, it is going to find itself with no       credibility and no hope for years to come.    That is the end of the editorial.
