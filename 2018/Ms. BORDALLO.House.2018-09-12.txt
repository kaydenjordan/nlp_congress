 Mr. Speaker, today I introduce the IDEA Parity for  Outlying Areas Act, which would amend the Individuals with Disabilities  Education Act to better support students with disabilities in our  smaller U.S. territories and the Freely Associated States.   During my final congressional address to my constituents in Guam, I  pledged to sponsor this important legislation for our youngsters and  students with disabilities, as well as their families.   I want to give special recognition to Ms. Nadia Pablo, who interned  in my office this past summer, for her work in developing this  legislation with my staff. Ms. Pablo currently attends Virginia  Commonwealth University, where she is studying to become an  occupational therapist and pursue a rewarding career working with  people with disabilities.   The IDEA Parity for Outlying Areas Act would ensure that American  Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands,  classified as outlying areas by the U.S. Department of Education,  receive their fair share of Federal funding to serve students with  disabilities and their families.   The intent of Congress, outlined in current Federal law, is that the  U.S. Department of Education set aside a fixed percentage of available  Federal funding each year for the four outlying U.S. territories and  the three Freely Associated States in the Pacific.   However, the U.S. Department of Education frequently allocates far  less than the 1 percent reserved for the outlying areas under current  law. So, to fix this, my bill would require the U.S. Department of  Education to reserve the full 1 percent of available IDEA funding each  year for the outlying areas, as Congress always intended.   This will ensure that special education in American Samoa, Guam, the  Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands gets full Federal  funding.   It will also ensure that the U.S. Department of Education provides  adequate support for special education in the Federated States of  Micronesia, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, and the Republic of  Palau consistent with the Compacts of Free Association between the U.S.  and those allied countries.   There are some 7,177 students with disabilities in the outlying U.S.  territories and the Freely Associated States, all of whom would benefit  under this bill. According to the most recent figures, Guam recorded  more than 2,020 students with disabilities, including 171 preschoolers  with disabilities.   Our territorial Departments of Education are chronically underfunded,  and many developmental and learning disabilities simply go undiagnosed.  So we desperately need Federal support under the IDEA.   Instantly, and importantly, my bill would also make Guam and the  other outlying U.S. territories eligible to receive IDEA funding for  preschoolers, children ages 3 to 5, with disabilities. Under current  law, American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S.  Virgin Islands are not eligible to receive U.S. Department of Education  funding for preschoolers with disabilities.   Finally, my bill removes a number of antiquated and unnecessary  restrictions in current law to allow the U.S. Department of Education  to exercise the same flexibility in awarding IDEA funding to the  territories as the Department may do so under other programs.   As a daughter of a schoolteacher, with many members in my family as  part of education, and someone involved in special education on Guam  over many, many years, the education of our island's youngsters with  disabilities is very close to my heart. Students with disabilities in  the territories deserve nothing less than the full support of their  Federal Government, and that is exactly what my bill would provide.   While I will be leaving Congress at the end of this year, I am  confident that my colleagues from the other territories will take on my  IDEA Parity for Outlying Areas Act in the next Congress, and I look  forward to supporting them in that important work in any way that I  can.                            ____________________
