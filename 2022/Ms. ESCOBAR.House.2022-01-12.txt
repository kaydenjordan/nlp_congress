 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Robert  Chisolm, an American hero who passed away peacefully on January 4,  2022, after a lifetime of service to our country and to El Paso.   Lieutenant Colonel Chisolm served in the Army in World War II, the  Korean war, and the Vietnam war. He was a paratrooper in the 82nd  Airborne Division when he parachuted into combat in Normandy, France,  on D-day, a day that liberated Western Europe from Nazi rule.   He was also recognized in 2012 by the French Government and awarded  the French Legion of Honor medal.   After 29 years of faithful service, he retired from the military and  settled in El Paso, Texas, with his wife, Margaret. Lieutenant Colonel  Chisolm helped create a community for local veterans as a founding  member of the Benavidez-Patterson All Airborne Chapter of the 82nd  Airborne Division Association, which awards scholarships to the  children and grandchildren of paratroopers.   May Lieutenant Colonel Robert Chisolm's legacy of devotion to our  country, his fellow veterans, and his unwavering commitment to service  continue to inspire us all.                            ____________________
