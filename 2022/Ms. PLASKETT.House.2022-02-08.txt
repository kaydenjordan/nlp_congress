 Madam Speaker, in the past several months, Democrats  have advanced the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, along with,  most recently, the COMPETES Act, which will increase American  innovation, start making more critical products in America, and  turbocharge American scientific and technological leadership.   With those bills in mind, I thought it was particularly important  during Black History Month to pay special tribute to four bold,  brilliant, and Black minds who have contributed in various ways through  their inventions to innovation and to infrastructure in America.   First, let's meet the ``Father of Transportation Technology,'' better  known as Garret Augustus Morgan. Born in Paris, Kentucky, and later  moved to Ohio, Morgan was a Black American inventor. Witnessing a fatal  car crash was essentially the catalyst in Morgan's invention of the  three-position traffic signal, which is the predecessor to the modern- day traffic light. Though the stop-and-go signals had already existed,  Morgan advanced the invention to include a third position that stopped  traffic in both directions and allowed pedestrians to safely cross the  road. Talented as he was, Morgan's other inventions included a version  of the gas mask, grooming products, sewing machines, and much more.   Madam Speaker, a second inspiration was a Black American, better  known as ``Brave Bessie,'' and to others as ``Queen Bess.'' The sky was  anything but the limit to this Texas native, Bessie Coleman. Fueled by  rejections and constant noes, Coleman's determination and diligence  allowed her to soar as she was accepted into the Caudron Brothers'  School of Aviation in France, and earned her international pilot's  license on June 15, 1921.   Becoming the first African-American woman pilot in 1922, Coleman was  best known for performing tricks in the air in both the United States  and Europe. She passionately encouraged other women to learn to fly,  both figuratively and literally, by touring the country, giving  lectures, teaching flight lessons, and performing flight exhibitions.   A real go-getter was Arcola Philpott, who earned her place in  transportation history in 1944 when the Los Angeles Railway hired  Philpott to be the first Black woman streetcar operator. Philpott  opened the door for both women and African Americans to operate  streetcars in Los Angeles. Just weeks after hiring her, Los Angeles  Railway hired its first Black motorman. Philpott's time as the first  Black and streetcar operator represents just a small portion of the  impact she had.   Originally from Chicago, she graduated from Loyola University with a  degree in social science and performed welfare work prior to moving to  Los Angeles. When she returned to Chicago, she worked as a nurse and a  researcher at the University of Chicago's history department.   And finally, Benjamin Banneker, the Black architect who helped design  the capital city. Banneker was hired by the first President, George  Washington, and came highly recommended by Thomas Jefferson. He  designed the layout of Washington, D.C.'s, streets, parks, major  buildings in two days. Known for many well-deserved accomplishments and  contributions through his lifetime, he later became a reputable  architect, mathematician, engineer, and even an astronomer.   Black people should be proud of their heritage, and all Americans  should celebrate the achievements of Black Americans. Infrastructure  within the United States would look incredibly different without the  inventions, achievements, and innovations of these Black minds. It is  important to document and share stories of lesser-known historical  figures who also contributed their greatest efforts. Happy Black  History Month.                            ____________________
