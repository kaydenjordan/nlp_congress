 Mr. President, for about 20 years now, I have viewed the  development and deployment of a layered ballistic missile defense  shield as probably singularly the most vital thing we could be doing  around here. People are aware of that now. Adversaries, like North  Korea and others, have ballistic missiles, and they are increasing  their range capability. Iran is getting almost everything. One of the  problems you have is that you get countries like North Korea developing  missile capabilities, and if they have it, then other adversaries have  it. I am talking about Yemen and all the rest of them.   It is important for us to communicate to the American people that the  [[Page S128]]  threat we face is probably the most imminent threat we have had in the  history of this country. Today, it is the greatest threat we have had  certainly in my lifetime.   I have come to the floor and spoken on this issue in 2001, 2009,  2012, and this will be the fourth time this year. Over the last 30  years, we have witnessed the missile defense programs go through  dramatic investment periods, followed by extreme starvation and  cancellations--I am talking about in the United States--depending on  who happens to be President at the time.   Remember, of course, when Reagan came in and people made fun of him  with ``Star Wars'' and tried to defame him in any way they could. Yet  he was able to be persistent and start a program, and we should be very  thankful we have it today. That was followed in 1989 by President Bush.  He continued that program.   However, in 1993, when President Clinton was in office, the first  thing he did was to cut $2.5 billion out of the Bush missile defense  budget request for fiscal year 1994. He also terminated the Reagan-Bush  Strategic Defense Initiative and downgraded the National Missile  Defense Program to a research and development program. He cut 5-year  missile defense funding by 54 percent, from $39 billion to $18 billion.   I say this because these times are changing. Continuing with his  administration in 1996, he cut the funding and slowed down the  development of THAAD and the Navy Theater Wide Systems. To remind  ourselves of how important that was at that time and the cuts he made  to that and how critical that was, THAAD right now is the only thing we  have to join forces with South Korea to be able to knock down something  coming from North Korea to South Korea. The Aegis system is a defensive  system that we could share with Japan. Without these systems, they  would be wide open. That was 1996.   In 1999, the last of the Clinton years, he delayed by at least 2  years the Space Based Infrared System, which is a very complicated  system that knocks down incoming missiles. Then, in 2000, Bush came in.  By the end of 2008, President Bush had succeeded in fielding a missile  defense system capable of defending all 50 States. One of the things he  did that was most significant--and this is in the final years of his  administration--was to recognize the fact that we have had ground-based  interceptors in our country for a number of years. In fact, there are  44 ground-based interceptor systems. Unfortunately, they are all on the  west coast because that is where we thought the threat would be. We  discovered at that time, during the Bush administration, that the  threat was from both sides because we recognized that Iran was  developing the capabilities, as well as North Korea and others. So in  order to protect Eastern United States as well as Central Europe, we  had the system that was set up. It was kind of funny because I remember  being there with one of our strongest allies. The system they set up  was one where they had a radar system in the Czech Republic, and they  had a rocket system--a ground-based interceptor--in Poland, right next  door. I remember when Vaclav Klaus was the President of the Czech  Republic, one of our strongest supporters, and he said to me at that  time: Now, if we go ahead and put our system in the Czech Republic and  in Poland, can you assure me that if we incur the wrath of Russia, we  are not going to end up being embarrassed and have the rug pulled out  from under us?   I said: There is not a chance in the world that would happen.   Well, that did happen. In fact, it was a total of 44 ground-based  interceptors that were fielded. That was in Alaska and California, on  the west coast. We went through this where they pulled the rug out from  under Poland, as well as the Czech Republic. Then, in April, came our  first Obama defense cuts, which began disarming America and dismantling  our layered missile defense system. This is critical because we put  this in for the reason that we perceived the threat to be coming in  from the east as opposed to the west coast, and the very system that  would have protected us was taken down by President Obama.   I would say, due to his overall reduced budget requests in defense,  there were not enough Aegis ships. I already mentioned how we are using  those today in defense of many of our allies, including Japan. Since  Kim Jong Un took power in 2009, he has already conducted more than 80  ballistic missile tests. That is far more than his father and his  grandfather conducted.    North Korea has conducted six nuclear tests of increasingly powerful  weapons. The latest test was in September of last year. The major test  actually came after that, and that was on November 28. On November 28,  he demonstrated that he had the range of the United States and the  central part of our country. In other words, it was stated by others  who observed that he now has the capability of reaching any target in  mainland United States.   There were some scientists who did an analysis of what they did on  November 28. They made it very clear. David Wright, an analyst for the  Union of Concerned Scientists, wrote that--this is something that  happened on November 29--that yesterday's test indicates that North  Korea can now hold the United States well within missile range. He  said: ``Such a missile would have been more than enough range to reach  Washington, DC, and in fact any other part of the continental United  States.''   Here is the scary part of this. Those who are not wanting to believe  that the threat is real and the threat is there are saying: Well, we  don't know that the missile he demonstrated on November 28 could have  reached that range if it had a full payload, a load of a nuclear  warhead.   We don't know if they had one or not, but that doesn't give me much  comfort. They also questioned whether or not it could sustain the  reentry back into the atmosphere.   The point is that they now have that capability, and that is  something we have to keep in mind as we are making decisions, because  we have decisions to make, and that is what we are doing right now in  trying to decide how we are going to keep the government from shutting  down and develop some kind of a budget plan that is going to serve us  well.
