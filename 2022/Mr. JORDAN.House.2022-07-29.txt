 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, for years, the Democrats told us: We are not coming for  your guns.   Oh, yes, they are.   Let's be clear. The Second Amendment is as clear as possible. That is  their beef. The Second Amendment says: The right to keep and bear arms  shall not be infringed. But they don't care.   In fact, the sponsor of this legislation said so in committee. He  said: ``Spare me the BS about constitutional rights.'' They don't care  about that fundamental liberty law-abiding citizens in this country  enjoy, and they are coming for your firearms.   Six weeks ago, it was the red flag law, where someone who doesn't  like you can report you to law enforcement or to a judge. There is a  hearing that you can't be at, your counsel can't be present, you  haven't been charged with a crime, but they can take your firearm, they  can take your property, they can take away your Second Amendment  liberties, and then you have to petition for a subsequent hearing to  get that right back. And you have done nothing wrong and have not been  charged with a crime.   Then House Democrats passed the unconstitutional legislation that  said 18- to 20-year-olds can't purchase a firearm. They can fight for  our country, but they can't purchase a firearm. And today they are  coming for your guns, 24 million of them.   That is right, 24 million AR-style rifles are in the hands of law- abiding Americans today, as we speak, and those individuals will not be  able to sell or transfer that property.   In the Heller case, the Supreme Court made clear that the Second  Amendment protects firearms in common use at the time. During the  markup, Representative Bishop asked the chairman: ``Is it the point of  the bill to ban weapons that are in common use in the United States  today?'' And the chairman said: ``The problem is that they are in  common use.''    So, yes, this is the goal. This is why it is unconstitutional.  Couldn't be any clearer. Democrats don't care what the Constitution  says.   Fortunately, courts are correctly applying the Constitution. Last  week, a Federal District Court judge in Colorado, who was appointed by  President Obama, issued a temporary restraining order against the Town  of Superior, Colorado, to prevent it from implementing an assault  weapon ban.   The judge wrote: Plaintiffs have stated that semiautomatic weapons,  as well as magazines that hold more than 10 rounds, are commonly used  by law-abiding citizens for lawful purposes and, therefore, cannot be  banned.   And guess what this bill will do? It won't make communities safer. It  won't make them safer at all. In fact, in the Heller case, the Supreme  Court said: The Second Amendment protects firearms in common use at the  time and also said ``for lawful purposes like self-defense.''   Three weeks ago, July 7, 2022, a Florida homeowner used his AR-style  rifle when individuals forcibly entered his home. After the homeowner  opened fire, the individuals immediately fled. When asked if the  homeowner would face charges, the Escambia County Sheriff Chip Simmons  said: Absolutely not. The homeowner is protecting himself. And in  Florida, you can do that. You can protect yourself.   Democrats tried this ban before. It didn't work. It won't work now.   You know what it will do? It will make communities, I think, less  safe. What will make communities safer, though, is if Democrats stop  defunding the police, stop cashless bail, and start prosecuting  criminals. They are taking away firearms used for self-defense by law- abiding Americans.   This bill is wrong. It will make communities, I think, less safe, and  it is unconstitutional.  [[Page H7512]]    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  North Carolina (Mr. Hudson).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Rutherford).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Arizona (Mr. Biggs).    Mr. Speaker, here is the fact. This bill is  unconstitutional. The Supreme Court made clear the Second Amendment  protects firearms in common use. This bill has eight pages of weapons  and firearms that it bans, including 24 million firearms that law- abiding American citizens possess today. That is the fact.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to my good friend from Texas (Mr.  Gohmert).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Cline).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Pfluger).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Roy).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  North Carolina (Mr. Bishop).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Wisconsin (Mr. Fitzgerald).    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Wisconsin an  additional 30 seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Clyde).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Kentucky (Mr. Massie), the chair of the Second Amendment Caucus.    I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentleman from  Kentucky.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   We haven't said the Second Amendment was unlimited. We quoted the  Second Amendment, the Second Amendment which the Supreme Court has said  protects firearms in common use. Twenty-four million Americans have  these weapons. That is most certainly common use.   The fact that the chair of the Judiciary Committee says, I don't  care, we are going to do it even though we know it is unconstitutional,  that is just wrong.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Arrington), my friend.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I would just say, if the gentlewoman from Ohio wants to come to the  Fourth District of Ohio and debate me on the Second Amendment, I would  welcome her to come to my district anytime she wants to. She can stand  here and lecture all she wants, but I would welcome her to come to my  district. I would be happy to debate her.   My guess is the constituents I get the privilege of representing,  most of them probably agree with me and agree with the United States  Constitution.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close.    Mr. Speaker, red flag laws take all guns from some people. This bill  makes illegal some guns for all people, and we know where they want to  go. We know what they want to do. They want to take all guns from all  people because they can't stand the Second Amendment. They hate the  Second Amendment.   In fact, during the markup, the sponsor of the legislation said this:  ``Spare me the BS about constitutional rights.''   Well, Republicans care about law-abiding citizens' constitutional  liberties: Their First Amendment rights, their Second Amendment rights,  their Fourth Amendment due process rights. All of those have been  attacked by the Democrats over the last several months.   That is why we should vote ``no'' on this legislation and let law- abiding Americans have the respect for the Second Amendment they  deserve.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   This is a 5-minute vote.   The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--yeas 217,  nays 213, not voting 1, as follows:                               [Roll No. 410]                                 YEAS--217       Adams      Aguilar      Allred      Auchincloss      Axne      Barragan      Bass      Beatty      Bera      Beyer      Bishop (GA)      Blumenauer      Blunt Rochester      Bonamici      Bourdeaux      Bowman      Boyle, Brendan F.
