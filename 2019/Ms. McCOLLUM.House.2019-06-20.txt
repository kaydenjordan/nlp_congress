 Mr. Chair, as the designee of Chairwoman Lowey, I move  to strike the last word.    Mr. Chair, I rise to speak about the fiscal year 2020  Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies appropriations bill.   I thank the chairwoman and the ranking member of the full committee  and also my ranking member, Mr. Joyce, for all of his collaboration.   I want people to know that this bill is the proud work, hard work,  and collaboration of our subcommittee, which held 16 hearings. We  received over 6,000 requests from Members of Congress, and we worked  hard to make a bill that reflected the priorities of the entire House.   I also want to note that this bill makes critical investments for the  American people and for our planet. It does that because the  subcommittee had a recommended total of $37.3 billion in discretionary  funding. That is an increase of $1.7 billion over last year.   We also were able to include this year, because of hard work by the  subcommittee led by Mr. Simpson last year, an additional $2.25 billion  in fire cap adjusted funds for suppression operations. That is really  important for the Forest Service in order to fight wildland fires  without borrowing from nonfire programs.   Some of the biggest increases in this bill, however, honor our  Federal and treaty trust responsibilities to provide for the health,  safety, and education of our Native American brothers and sisters.  [[Page H4948]]    Mr. Joyce and I, Mr. Chair, worked on this in a very nonpartisan  fashion with the entire subcommittee. We can be proud that this bill  continues to move us in the right direction in honoring our treaty and  trust obligations.   In fact, this bill invests over $10 billion to support and strengthen  Tribal self-determination, including $1 billion, the highest ever  recommended, for the operation of Native American education programs.  As I said, Mr. Chair, we did that together in the subcommittee in a  nonpartisan way.   For many other agencies in this bill, however, the Trump  administration had devastating cuts.   The President's request was a 31 percent cut to the Environmental  Protection Agency, and that cut would have prevented the EPA from its  mission to keep our communities safe and healthy.   In fact, under President Trump's watch, yesterday, the administration  rolled out what many of us call its dirty power plan. We have evidence  from the scientific community to say that it could contribute up to  1,400 premature deaths annually.   Democrats are fighting back on this bill with important investments  to protect the air we breathe and the water we drink. We boost support  for the EPA's Clean Air Markets programs by $25.6 million, and we  increase congressional oversight to make sure that there aren't any  rollbacks attempted to put the public health at risk.   We also fund the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund at the  authorized level, and we target resources needed to address drinking  and wastewater needs.   This bill also takes a huge step forward in building on what was  started in the Defense bill that we voted on earlier this week to  address the crisis of PFOS, which is contaminating our water.   I am very proud that, after the President signed a bipartisan bill to  permanently reauthorize the Land and Water Conservation Fund even  though the President zeroed it out in his budget, we chose to invest  $524 million in LWCF.   I would like to conclude by talking about climate change for a  second. As we know, the administration has cut everywhere it can to  decimate Federal funding to do research and combat and adapt to climate  change. Our bill does the opposite. It boosts funding for climate  change research, tracking and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions,  and energy and water efficiency programs in the EPA. The U.S.  Geological Survey has its role to play on climate, and we support that.  It also restores very important programs on this that were eliminated  in the Fish and Wildlife Service.   This bill recognizes the importance of science to understand the  impacts of climate change in our natural and cultural resources, in our  ecosystems, and in human health.   It is a good bill, and I think as we go through it, Mr. Chair, and  listen to the amendments we can make a good bill even better.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1300        Amendments En Bloc No. 4 Offered by Ms. McCollum of Minnesota     Mr. Chair, pursuant to House Resolution 445, as the  designee of the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Lowey), I offer  amendments en bloc.    Mr. Chair, the amendments included in the en bloc were  made in order under the rule. I support the amendment, and I urge its  adoption.   Mr. Chair, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman from  Pennsylvania (Ms. Scanlon).    Mr. Chair, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from Oregon (Ms. Bonamici).    Mr. Chair, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from Michigan (Mrs. Dingell).    Mr. Chair, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from Colorado (Ms. DeGette).    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment.    Mr. Chair, this amendment would exempt certain small  incinerators in Alaska from being regulated under the Clean Air Act.   My good friend knows that this amendment is fundamentally different  from what was done in the 2019 bill. That language barred incinerator  rules adopted in 2011 from being enforced but left in place the pre- 2011 rules governing those facilities.   This amendment would bar enforcement of any Clean Air Act rule, and,  for me, that is unacceptable.   These incinerators, as the gentleman pointed out, are currently  burning, but what they are releasing is some of the most noxious air  emissions in the country, some of the most grievous.   It is critical that we ensure that we are complying with clean air  regulations. There have to be some rules to this.   We have an obligation to protect the health and safety of all  Americans, and exempting incinerators in the way that this language is  currently written, for even small and remote ones, from the Clean Air  Act regulations is just something I can't accept at this time.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, as I said, I understand the gentleman's  concerns, but the fact is that this is fundamentally different from  what we did in the FY20 bill in working with the lead Senator from  Alaska, who is the counterpart on the Interior appropriations.    This just goes too far. So, I oppose this as it is currently written,  and I can't go just supporting this, because it completely, completely  eliminates the Clean Air Act rules.   I offer the gentleman an opportunity to go in front of the  authorizing committee, and, at that point, if he wants to talk some  more and we can figure out a way to create a win-win, I would be happy  to help him in the authorizing committee; but I cannot support this  amendment as it stands, eliminating the rules for clean air, at this  time.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, we should not be facilitating the hunting of  species in countries that do not have good domestic conservation  programs and have not demonstrated established, sound, science-based  management programs.   The Interior bill recognizes the importance of these iconic species  and the role they play in the ecosystem. It is imperative to conserve  these species, especially in light of the recent UN report on  biodiversity that warns us that 1 million species face extinction.   This amendment supports the committee's efforts to ensure the  survival of elephants and lions for future and present generations. I  support the amendment.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, pursuant to House Resolution 445, I offer  amendments en bloc.    Mr. Chairman, the amendments included in the en bloc  have been made in order by the rule and have been agreed to by both  sides.   Mr. Chair, I support the amendments and urge their adoption, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Casten).    Mr. Chair, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Levin), another Great Lakes State.    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).                                time  1400     Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Madam Chair, I rise in strong opposition to this  amendment.    Madam Chair, whether or not my colleagues on the other  side of the aisle want to admit it, climate change is real. It is  caused by human activity. And it will--I should say, it is even  currently now having devastating impacts. If we don't take bold action  to reduce climate pollution, it is only going to get worse.   I believe we also have a moral obligation to future generations to  leave this planet better than we found it. Limiting pollution from  power plants is an important part of an overall strategy to limit  carbon pollution and keep global temperatures from rising to levels  that will bring unacceptable risks from extreme weather and other  climate change impacts.   Therefore, I was extremely disappointed that, on Wednesday, EPA  Administrator Andrew Wheeler announced a rule that would repeal the  Clean Power Plan, replacing it with a rule that will lead to 1,400 more  deaths each year.   Those numbers, Madam Chair, are the EPA's numbers. Just think of it.   The administration that is held with the responsibility of protecting  America's air and water so that it is fit for human consumption puts  out a regulation to limit the pollution that actually increases the  amount of pollution  [[Page H4960]]  that we emit, causing more deaths, more asthma attacks, more trips to  the emergency room.   Every year we continue to see communities devastated by natural  disasters related to our changing climate. We are spending billions of  dollars each year helping these communities rebuild in the wake of  those disasters.   We need action to limit climate pollution. Blocking action to limit  carbon pollution from power plants is a step backwards at the exact  same moment we should be leaping forward towards cleaner forms of  energy.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I believe I have the right to close.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, to be clear, many States supported the  clean energy rules of the Obama administration because they know air  knows no boundary. So one State decides it is not going to have clean  air rules, and that drifts into the next State, affecting that State's  health and quality of life. So it was prudent for the Federal  Government to step in and set standards.   No one's power plant was going to be forced to be closed. They were  just being told to clean up the air. So when it leaves one State to  drift into the next State, it is not causing asthma attacks for  children.   I believe we have a moral obligation to future generations to leave  this planet better than we found it. Limiting pollution for power  plants is an important part of an overall strategy to protect us from  the worst impacts of climate change. We owe it to the next generation.  They are watching our actions.   I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, we have many fine employees at the EPA-- great employees--and I would be hesitant to put them in the way that  sometimes the term ``bureaucrat'' is used, because sometimes that can  feel demeaning. So, to the great scientists in the EPA, I just want  them to know that I respect their work.                                time  1430    Madam Chair, I rise in strong opposition, as I said, to this  amendment, which would prevent the EPA from implementing its  endangerment finding that greenhouse gases endanger human health and  welfare.   The EPA's endangerment finding is simply a legal restating of  something that the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said.  Every single scientific academy in the world--and I want to stress  that, Madam Chair. I heard the gentleman talk about some kind of peer  review, but I am going to go with what the national scientific  academies in the world and 97 percent of climate scientists have been  telling us for decades. I am going to go with 97 percent of the  scientists, Madam Chair.   Whether or not my colleague on the other side of the aisle will admit  it, our climate is changing. We know it in Minnesota, and I hear other  people from around the country talk about it. And we do know that it is  caused by human activity.   We are already experiencing negative impacts from climate change. The  severity of those impacts will only increase if we don't reduce climate  pollution.   The endangerment finding does not regulate climate pollution, but it  does say that we need to take action to address it, and I agree.   We have a moral obligation to future generations to leave this planet  better than we found it. Blocking the endangerment rule won't make that  happen for future generations.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Once again, what I see is delay by not going with  scientists around the world.   Madam Chair, 97 percent of the scientists leading the way on what we  should be doing clearly state that human activity has a direct impact  on climate change. We can't ignore the dangers of it.   We need urgent and bold action to address climate change. We don't  need to be putting our heads in the sand. We don't need to be delaying.   I oppose the taxpayers of this country spending more money when we  already have sound science. I oppose wasting time. So I oppose this  amendment, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment in  order to be able to speak on it.   The Acting Chair. The gentlewoman from Minnesota is recognized for 5  minutes.    Madam Chair, I thank both gentlemen for their concern  and dedication to this issue. In the 1990s when I served in the  Minnesota House on our environment and agriculture committee, I first  learned of chronic wasting disease and the way that it was frightening  hunters and people who like to consume deer meat.   We took some action when I was in the statehouse to address this,  only to find out it is a bigger flare-up and something that we need to  address.   In my home State of Minnesota, under the leadership of Governor Walz,  we are putting more time, more energy, and more resources into working  on this issue. That is why my colleagues will find that the House  report accompanying the Interior bill highlights the committee's  concern about chronic wasting disease and the need to continue to  collaborate with partners to develop early detection tools and  compounds to disrupt the transmission of this deadly disease.   As of June 7, 2019, chronic wasting disease has been reported in at  least 24 States in the continental United States as well as in two  provinces in Canada. Once this disease is established in an area, the  risks can remain for a long time in the environment, and we are finding  out that ``a long time'' is a long time.   The lack of treatment or vaccines for this insidious disease  highlights the need for more research. As a member of the Agriculture  Committee, we have been talking to the USDA about what we can do about  disposing of these carcasses because this disease not only appears in  the wild, it also appears in some captive herds that are used for  consumption.   I want my colleagues to know that I look forward to working with them  on this issue. I wanted to use this as an opportunity to let both  gentlemen know that it is in the report language, and we look forward  to the authorizers working more so we can do even more to address this  disease.   Madam Chair, I thank the gentlemen once again for their amendment,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition.   The Acting Chair. The gentlewoman from Minnesota is recognized for 5  minutes.    Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment that  would strike section 118 from the bill.   I want to begin by setting the record straight on what section 118 of  the Interior bill does and does not do. The opponents of this amendment  have characterized the Interior language as preventing energy leases in  the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, ANWR. That is an outright  misstatement, Madam Chair. Although, as I will explain, I can  understand why those who championed the inflated revenue numbers 18  months ago might be a little worried.   On the contrary, the language says that when the Department of the  Interior offers those leases up for sale, it simply must make sure that  the sale raises more than the $500 million that was promised.   In 2017, the Republicans were putting together their tax bill. The  budget resolution directed the House Natural Resources Committee and  the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee to come up with  legislation that would raise $1 billion over 10 years.                                time  1445    Since the lease, that $1 billion was supposed to help offset the cost  of a $5 trillion tax cut. In reality, I believe it was a scam to get  around a point of order. Once the ANWR provision was included in the  tax bill, the Congressional Budget Office said the provision would  raise little more than $2 billion over 10 years, and, by law, half of  those revenues go to the Federal Treasury and half go to the State of  Alaska.   According to the CBO, which got its information from the Interior  Department, the first resale was going to raise $1 billion with $500  million going to the Federal Government. Well, if that $500 million is  what the Interior Department told CBO they could raise from our public  lands, then they should have no problem with the language in our bill,  because that is exactly what our language does. It tells the Interior  Department that if you decide to go forward with the lease sale next  year, then you need to raise the $500 million you promised the American  people. That is called accountability, and the taxpayers have a right  to expect it.   Now, since we don't know exactly how many acres Interior intends to  offer up for lease, and we can't know the exact per acre dollar amount,  but if the department leases a minimum of 400,000 acres required by  law, then all it needs to do is put out a lease sale requirement to the  companies to bid $2,500 an acre for these public lands.   Apparently, the administration and the congressional opponents are  having second thoughts about those promises now and want a little  amnesty. On May 21, the Office of Management and Budget sent the  Appropriations Committee a letter making it clear that the  administration opposes section 118 language. OMB says that the $500  million figure was arbitrary and unrealistic.   Now, how could the administration claim that that number was  arbitrary and unrealistic when CBO estimates were based on the  administration's data?   Where was OMB in December of 2017 when CBO first came out?   More importantly, where were the congressional opponents of drilling  ANWR back then?   Why didn't they sound a little alarmed 18 months ago?   Why not speak up and say: ``Wait a minute, I think this number is too  high, maybe it is unrealistic''?   Well, I suspect they thought they would never be held responsible for  the projections that they were touting back then, and maybe that  explains why the language in the Interior bill is characterized as  preventing lease sales. Supporters know that the department is required  to live up to the promises everyone made, and they may be unattainable  to achieve.   So let me be clear. I oppose opening up ANWR for drilling. But now  that it is in the tax bill, we have an obligation to make sure that the  American taxpayer is protected, and the language currently in the  Interior bill does exactly that, Madam Chair. It ensures that the  public property is not given away to the oil and gas industry for a  song.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    I reserve the balance of my time, Madam Chair.    May I inquire how much time I have on closing, Madam  Chair.    Well, Madam Chair, facts speak for themselves. This  sale was used to offset the tax bill, to keep the American people  confident that we were going to have our house in order when the tax  bill passed. Well, the first sale was supposed to guarantee $500  million, and if they get less than that on the first sale, as the  gentleman said, how much lower does it go on the second?   I just remind people that we need to protect the American taxpayer on  this one and make sure that we don't get taken to the cleaners.   Madam Chair, I oppose this amendment, and I yield back the balance of  my time.    Madam Chair, I rise in very strong opposition to the  amendment.    Madam Chair, this amendment would prevent the  Environmental Protection Agency from enforcing commonsense rules  requiring oil and gas industries to prevent natural gas leaks from  their drilling operations. The rule has been in effect for 3 years now,  and the oil and gas industry is complying with those regulations.   Preventing methane leaks has an important public health benefit.  Leaks from natural gas operations are significant sources of ozone  pollution which trigger asthma attacks and send thousands of children  to emergency rooms every year.   This rule actually saves the oil and gas industry money because  natural gas that is not wasted can be sold.   The proponents of this amendment argue that the rule isn't necessary  because oil and gas companies have an incentive to prevent leaks. But  the simple fact is leaks continue to happen unless companies are  required to prevent them. People might not like eating their  vegetables, but we are all better off for doing it.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, we know for a fact that methane leaks  [[Page H4966]]  contribute to ground level ozone pollution. We know that that is  harmful to human beings. We do know that reducing leaks improves the  bottom line for the oil and gas companies.   So I oppose this amendment. And I want to stand with common sense to  do everything possible to keep these leaks from happening in the  future.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, this amendment, once again, indiscriminately  cuts programs in this bill without any thought to the relative merit of  the programs contained in the bill.   To just reiterate again, fewer patients would be seen at Indian  Health Services, fewer safety inspectors would be ensuring that we  don't have oil and gas accidents on public lands or the other areas  which they oversee, deferred maintenance on our Nation's drinking  water--we don't want another Flint--deferred maintenance on sanitation  infrastructure.   One of the things that Members came up and asked me for, by and  large, to make sure that we took a hard look to see what we could do to  make sure that we protected our Nation's drinking water, and we moved  on what we could do with our sanitation infrastructure.   The National Estuary Program by the President was zeroed out; the  USGS science was cut; school construction for Native American children,  the future of their communities, the future of our shared Nation,  zeroed out; the arts, the humanities, zeroed out; and the EPA cut by 31  percent, the agency that is in charge of making sure we have clean air  and clean water.   More generally, investments in our environmental infrastructure and  our public lands would be halted and the associated jobs would be lost.   This legislation in front of us today that we are talking about  creates lots of good jobs, lots of good-paying construction jobs that  are important to the health of our communities.   This amendment would not encourage agencies to do more with less.  They would simply force the agencies and our constituents to do less  with less, and they have been doing that for too long.   Mr. Chair, I urge Members to oppose this amendment, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  Ohio (Mr. Joyce), the ranking member of the subcommittee.    Mr. Chair, may I inquire as to how much time is  remaining?    Mr. Chair, am I correct that the author of the  amendment has yielded back his time?    Mr. Chair, first, I would just like to address some of  the comments that the gentleman made.   I have the honor and privilege of serving on the Appropriations  Defense Subcommittee as vice chair with Chairman Visclosky, and I take  great pride in the bipartisan work, the nonpartisan work that we do to  make sure that our military is strong and our intelligence agencies  have the tools they need to keep America safe.   Mr. Chair, I just wanted to add that for the record, because there  was, I think, some confusion as to where I and my colleagues on the  Appropriations Committee on both sides of the aisle, when it came to  defense, what our positions were. Our positions are making sure our  servicemen and -women have what they need to fulfill their mission and  come home safely.   But going back to the comments about this amendment, we need to  [[Page H4972]]  stand together. We need to stand together to oppose this amendment,  because it will harm the American people.   There will be less clean water to drink, our air will be not as well  protected, people will go without healthcare, and our communities will  suffer.   Mr. Chair, I oppose this amendment and I encourage my colleagues to  join me in opposing it.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to this  amendment.    Mr. Chair, I would like to clear up a little bit of  information.   There was a time a short while ago where the National Academy of  Sciences asked the EPA, under the IRIS program, to tighten up their  process. It needed fixing. It needed adjusting.   The Agency reacted. They got an A-plus rating from the scientists  now. So the fine-tuning that was unnecessary to make this good program  even greater happened.   But what this amendment would do is it would prohibit the EPA from  funding the Integrated Risk Information System. Now, the Integrated  Risk Information System, or IRIS, is an electronic base containing  information on human health effects that may result from exposure to  various chemicals in the environment.   This was developed by the EPA's staff with consistent information to  uniform risk assessments and regulatory decisionmaking with respect to  health effects from exposures to chemicals found in the environment.   There is a chemical right now that has captured the attention of  people all across the United States, in fact, across the world, and it  is PFOS.   We need now, more than ever, to be laser focused, working with IRIS  to do everything we can to get the data and the information so we know  the health effects from being exposed to these chemicals for both  military and civilian people all across the United States. It is a very  serious problem, and IRIS' program review process is widely considered  to be a gold standard when it comes to accessing chemical toxicity.   Now, it is based on extensive scientific literature; it is peer- reviewed; and IRIS' toxicity assessments are relied upon by programs at  the EPA and across the Federal Government, by States, and it is because  of the high quality of the assessments.   Because these assessments assess risk across a variety of exposure  paths, assessments can inform regulatory decisionmaking across all  media offices in the EPA. So they can look at it holistically and be  making very informed decisions.   It is no surprise, Mr. Chair, that the chemical industry has long  sought to undermine the IRIS program. From their point of view, the  less the public knows about the risk from toxic chemicals, the more  money the chemical industry can make. We ought to be looking out for  the safety and welfare of the American people, not the bottom line  polluters who profit from pollution.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in support of this amendment, and I  thank the gentlewoman from California for bringing it forward.   This bill provides substantial funding to prevent and suppress  wildfires. For the first time, this bill includes $2.25 billion in cap  adjusted fire suppression funding, for a total of $5.2 billion for  wildland fire management.   Forest Service research and development is increased by $10 million  to advance the understanding of wildland fires and climate adaptation.   While the administration proposed to eliminate the Joint Fire Science  Program, this bill includes funding at the fiscal year 2019 enacted  level of $6 million.   Hazardous fuels is $27 million more.   I would like to take this opportunity to remind my colleagues that we  only have the fire cap adjusted funds for 2 years. We must ensure that  any budget agreement includes the fire cap adjusted funds in future  budget years. These critical funds will allow the Forest Service to  fight wildland fires without borrowing from nonfire programs.   Mr. Chair, I appreciate the gentlewoman's efforts to reduce the risk  of  [[Page H4977]]  catastrophic wildfires, and I support this amendment.    Mr. Chair, I rise in support of the amendment from the  gentlewoman from Washington to block the Trump administration from  trying to weaken Mercury and Air Toxics Standards for power plants.   Power plants across the country, as has been pointed out, have  already complied with the rule. In fact, they have been doing it since  2012, and it has given huge health benefits.                                time  1630    The power sector opposes what the Trump EPA is trying to do, unions  oppose what the Trump EPA is trying to do, and so do States and public  health communities.   Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for bringing this amendment  forward, and I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense  amendment.    Mr. Chair, I ask unanimous consent that the request for  a recorded vote on amendments en bloc No. 5 offered by the gentlewoman  from Minnesota (Ms. McCollum) be withdrawn to the end that the question  be put de novo.    Mr. Chair, I move to strike the last word.    Mr. Chair, I rise along with Mr. Joyce to thank our  staff on both sides of the aisle and also our personal offices for all  of the work they have done.   I yield back the balance of my time.  [[Page H4978]]         Mr. Chairman, I move that the Committee do now rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Ms.  McCollum) having assumed the chair, Mr. Himes, Acting Chair of the  Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that  that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 3055)  making appropriations for the Departments of Commerce and Justice,  Science, and Related Agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30,  2020, and for other purposes, had come to no resolution thereon.                            ____________________     Madam Chair, I move that the Committee do now rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Ms.  Shalala) having assumed the chair, Ms. Jackson Lee, Acting Chair of the  Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that  that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 3055)  making appropriations for the Departments of Commerce and Justice,  Science, and Related Agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30,  2020, and for other purposes, had come to no resolution thereon.                            ____________________
