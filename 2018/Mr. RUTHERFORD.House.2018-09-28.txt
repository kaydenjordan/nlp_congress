 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr. Brian  Kelly from Jacksonville, Florida, who has been named a 2018 Angels in  Adoption honoree. This Congressional Coalition on Adoption Institute  award recognizes and honors outstanding individuals who have made  contributions to the adoption community.   For more than 25 years, Brian Kelly has worked as an adoption  attorney. Through his work at his law firm and at Jacksonville Legal  Aid, Brian has touched, literally, thousands of lives promoting  adoption in northeast Florida. He has also worked with the Florida bar  to encourage the practice of adoption laws across the State.   In addition to his professional work, Brian has devoted his life to  serving his community, whether it be serving his church or chairing the  board of directors at Angelwood, a center in Jacksonville that provides  services to people with developmental disabilities. Brian has dedicated  countless hours in service to others.   I have had the opportunity to get to know Brian throughout his work,  and I am pleased to honor him today on behalf of the many grateful  families of northeast Florida. I commend Brian Kelly for this much- deserved honor of being named a 2018 Angels in Adoption honoree.  [[Page H9396]]                                ____________________
