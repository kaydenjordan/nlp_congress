 Mr. Speaker, our country was sent on a journey a week  ago to see how we would respond to the Dobbs decision. This decision  challenges all Americans to decide where they will stand on the  abortion issue.   It is particularly a challenge to the churches of this country who  are supposed to provide moral guidance to the country as to where to  stand.   These are decisions that will have to be made by the citizens, in  part, when they vote. Decisions have to be made by State legislators,  district attorneys as to whether they are going to uphold pro-life  laws, and perhaps, most important of all, individual decisions that are  going to have to be made by women or families who are in a situation in  which some people are going to try to persuade them to have an  abortion.   It is interesting when we talk about this to remember that in 1973,  as far as I can determine, no State between California on the West  Coast and New York on the East Coast had entirely open-ended pro- abortion laws. Nevertheless, at a time where we didn't really have  ultrasounds, every other State ruled that something barbaric was going  on.    You just heard other statistics--we know at 6 weeks a child has a  heartbeat; 7 weeks, feels pain; 10 weeks, jumps if startled, and has  fingers and toes; 15 weeks, sense of taste.   Obviously, anybody who says: What would God want us to do in this  situation realizes a human being has been created by God, and that  human being should be cherished and kept alive.   It was, again, apparently the clergy in 1973, or society as a whole,  did a good job of informing people that something so horrific was  happening in abortion that it should be barred and made illegal. Since  that time, the clergy of this country and the churches of this country  have had 49 years to weigh in with the public and guide them as to how  they should think. We are soon going to find out what a good job they  did or a bad job they did.   In any event, we thank the Supreme Court for reaching the right  decision. Now we put the ball in the court of Americans as a whole,  whether they will respond, recognizing the precious lives that we have  to protect in America, or if they are going down the shoot toward more  of an atheistic view of the world, similar to countries like North  Korea, Red China, countries in which atheism is part of their roots.   The challenge is yours, America--the challenge to the churches.    Mr. Speaker, first of all, just so you all know, you  don't have to worry about waiting 30 minutes. It is not going to be  that long.   I would like to talk about some issues tonight that I don't feel have  been adequately addressed in this forum. The press--not the people back  home, but the press--keeps trying to make a big deal out of January 6.   When I go home, as I am sure for all of my colleagues who go home, 80  percent of the comments deal with inflation, insofar as other things  are being dealt with. It is not January 6.   Nevertheless, there is something that bothers me. Since we are  apparently going to have these hearings on January 6, everything ought  to be able to come out. If I was on that committee, the first thing I  would ask is for all the video from the Capitol that day to be  released.   It seems to me if people genuinely want to know what is going on,  that is where I would start. Therefore, on last October 5, myself,  Congressman Norman, and Congressman Gohmert asked for all the video  from the Capitol to be released that day. It doesn't seem that much of  a difficult request. There were many people still being held in jail,  and the press kept trying to rile up the population and let them  believe something horrible had happened.   I received inquiries from both Republican and Democrat constituents  who felt it would be a good idea if we released the video of what was  going on that day. It would be helpful if Congresswoman Liz Cheney or  Adam Kinzinger also weighed in, saying all that video should be  released. But for whatever reason, it hasn't been released.   One more time, Congressmen Norman, Gohmert, and myself have had to  make a request of the Justice Department to release these videos. It is  getting to the point where no longer is it just an innocent inquiry  because a few people asked for it. People are beginning to think that  the Justice Department must be hiding something.   One more time, we make the request. The request should be made by the  Capitol press corps. There was a time when press in this country, one  of their goals was to get behind the curtain in front of government and  expose what was really going on, and both conservative and liberal  journalists would have quickly asked for these videos. For whatever  reason, they haven't asked for them.   I, again, ask the Department of Justice to release them. But above  all, because I don't think the Justice Department apparently cares what  Congressmen Norman, Gohmert, or Grothman say, the press in this country  that seems obsessed with January 6 ought to demand that the Justice  Department release these videos. After all, it has been 16 months, 17  months, after this took place. It has been 18 months after this took  place. It is high time we found out what was going on there.   Every day that goes forward in which the video is not released, I  think the American public, the small amount that is paying attention,  is going to be more convinced that somebody is hiding something.   Now, I don't want to accuse anybody of anything. I don't want to be a  conspiracy theorist, but my constituents are wondering, when I write  that letter, why we are sitting on the video. If it is so important to  find out what really went on that day, please, Department of Justice,  release the hidden videos and, please, comatose American press corps,  ask that the videos be released.   I have spoken from this microphone many times this biennium about a  tilt toward the totalitarian sort of government that we see going on.  And by totalitarian, I mean the worst type of totalitarian, a Marxist  totalitarian government.   We see a variety of danger signs on the horizon. We began this  session with people being sworn in who, in order to get elected, got  help from Black Lives Matter, a group whose founders made no bones  about the fact that they were Marxist and made no bones about the fact  that they were against the traditional American family, what they  described as the Western nuclear family.   We have then seen online media giants suppress free speech. Now, I  suppose you could say they are private companies, and I suppose you  could say it is their right to suppress free speech or prevent you from  googling something, from getting a cross section of views that are out  there.   Nevertheless, we know, as a practical matter, they have almost a  monopoly in this country, and it is concerning that these companies  that have, as a practical matter, monopolies have decided to suppress  certain speech. They certainly have the heart of a totalitarian  atheist.   The next thing we look at is a growing percentage of the gross  national product no longer being spent by the people who earn the money  but being spent by the government, by the politicians in Washington.  That is another danger sign.  [[Page H6619]]    We see a President openly talking about taking away the freedom to  defend yourself. He wants the only guns to be owned by government  employees. He didn't want the right of defense to rest with the  individual. This would be another trait of a government very different  from that which our forefathers anticipated.   We saw an effort made to have our government deny visas or deny  property to foreigners if they engaged in suppression of human rights.  But the human rights that we know the Biden administration meant were  not fear of murder or robbery or something. The human rights were aimed  at the field of pro-life, so that politicians or other people abroad  who fought for pro-life issues, or issues with regard to so-called gay  rights, if you weren't on the right side, the Biden administration  wanted to threaten foreign officials with taking away the right for a  visa in this country, taking away their right to travel, as well as  taking away their property in this country.    Does that sound like kind of a dangerous thing?   America had better wake up. We are going the wrong way. John Adams  said our Constitution is made for a moral and religious people and is  totally unfit for any other kind.   When you listen to the things that have been going on in this  country, what do you think? Aren't we headed for a very different  country than the moral and religious country that is required to keep  our country going?   There are other things that kind of just amaze me. June is Dairy  Month. Being from Wisconsin, everybody in Wisconsin knows June is Dairy  Month. But for some people around Washington, they don't think  primarily of Dairy Month. They call it Pride Month, and the U.S. flies  the gay flag, and the Vatican, as well as many other countries around  the world.   Do you think our forefathers would have anticipated, particularly  given all the blessings that our country has been given, that we would  decide to fly our flag with, in essence, a sexual preference flag all  around the world? Again, highly questionable.   Then, we have another step in a very unusual direction for a country  that was supposed to be a moral and religious country. We are sending  out requests for grants from nonprofits around the world to promote  humanism and atheism. Isn't that kind of unusual?   Here we are, such a blessed country. What do we do with our money?  Why, we say, does anybody around the world want to promote atheism?   As recently as the 1960s in this country, only 2 percent of the  people said they did not believe in God, only 2 percent in the 1960s.  Look how far down we have gone. Now, we elect a government and are  asking for grants to be given to organizations to promote atheism in  our name.   I mean, when you look at the State Department, I guess the two things  that they will tell people abroad are, if you want to be like the  United States, if you want to follow in its footsteps, follow the pride  flag and follow atheism. Very, very disappointing. I think it is time  that the clergy and the people of America wake up.   I know we are just supposed to talk about inflation. Of course,  inflation is bad, and, of course, this bad inflation was caused by  excessive government spending. That is all true. But there are other  issues that are going on out there as well, and I am very afraid, given  how quickly we have gone downhill the last 40 or 20 or 10 years, where  we are going to wind up in another 10 or 20 or 30 years if this sort of  activity continues to come from our government in Washington.   While we took our 2-week break, we hit 100 murders a year in the city  of Milwaukee. If that happens in the second half of the year, we are  going to wind up hitting the all-time-record number of murders in  Milwaukee, a city that is directly adjacent to my district.   We have to ask ourselves, what can we do to reduce the number of  murders? Part of it, I have always felt, is the decline in the  traditional family. We have spoken, again, from this microphone about  the degree to which our welfare programs seem conditioned upon either  not working or, above all, make sure if you have children, you don't  have them in wedlock because if you have a two-earner household, it is  very difficult to take advantage of all these grants.                                time  2015    Mr. Speaker, this is where some of it comes from, but some of it also  comes from kind of the neutering of the police corps by having  irresponsible politicians calling the police, in general, racists.   When you call all the police racists, which I don't think they are,  you create a chilling influence. Police, particularly in big cities  with high crime rates, where it may be more important they engage the  citizenry than anywhere else, the police back off. When they back off,  you have something that is almost unbelievable to see: a hundred  murders in the first half of the year in the city of Milwaukee.   By the way, I was born in the city of Milwaukee, and as recently as  the early 1970s, Milwaukee had the lowest murder rate of the 20 biggest  cities in the country.   Milwaukee was always proud of how safe it was, and now we are kind of  going the opposite way quickly. At least I believe one of the reasons  is certain politicians. It has become politically expedient for them to  trash the police departments, to, therefore, threaten individual police  with lawsuits, resulting in police not engaging the population enough  and resulting in a high number of murders.   I, therefore, call upon all of our politicians to boldly speak out in  favor of the police and boldly describe to the population as a whole  that we do not have a racist country, which is something else that  should be pointed out.   In my own district, I talk to the Hmong, who came here not even  knowing the language. If you talk to the Hmong, all of their children  and their grandchildren are doing fantastically well, living the  American Dream.   I know an increasing number of people from India in my district,  another example of a group that frequently came to America, didn't know  the native language, and now they are living the American Dream.   But for some reason--I personally believe they are trying to destroy  America--politicians are out there talking about what a horrible,  racist country they have.   I think they do it to divide America and weaken America, but I beg  them to stop doing it that way and to win elections based on issues,  not on name-calling and not on teaching our young people that we have a  horrible, racist country.   Mr. Speaker, I guess for the benefit of all the people listening  tonight, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
