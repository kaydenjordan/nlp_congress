 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this proposed  rule, which begins laying the framework for one of the largest spending  bills in the history of this institution. It is nearly $2 trillion  being dishonestly sold to the people as COVID relief.   With a price tag this big, Mr. Speaker, you would think that the  House Democrats would want this bill to go through the committee  process where Congress and the public can digest this information. But  no. They are attempting to fast-track this bill to make decisions with  no committee, no bipartisanship, no oversight, and no discussion.   Mr. Speaker, this is American taxpayers' money, not government's, and  it is being spent with no accountability and no transparency.   The bottom line is that the hardworking, taxpaying Americans deserve  to have a voice in this process, and I will fight against attempts to  fast-track this bloated bill every step of the way.
