 Mr. Speaker, for too many hardworking families, job  opportunities are down, medical bills are up, and wages are flat--and  people are sick and tired of getting a raw deal from Washington.   Let me tell you what a raw deal looks like.   I met a homecare nurse who lives near me. She works full time. Her  husband works full time, too. All they want to do is give their two  kids the best childhood they possibly can. But they can't even afford  to take their kids to the movies because tickets and popcorn and soda  are just a little too much. When I asked what they do for fun, she said  they have cable television.   So how are we supposed to explain to a family like this, who can only  give their kids the Disney Channel instead of Disney World, that the  majority in Congress just gave $3.5 billion in taxpayer funds to the  six largest banks on Wall Street?   That is a raw deal, and it is wrong. Instead, we should fight every  single day to give a better deal, built on a foundation of better jobs,  better pay, and a better future for all Americans.                            ____________________
