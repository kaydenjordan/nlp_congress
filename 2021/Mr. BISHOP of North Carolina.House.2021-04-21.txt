 Madam Speaker, 172,331 border patrol  apprehensions in March, a 233 percent increase in fentanyl seized, the  worst crisis in 15 years, but more than that, no peak in sight.   President Biden and the Democratic majority bury their heads in the  sand. They have put the United States Government, charged with  enforcing the border, in the service of Mexican drug cartels and their  criminal enterprises. I have been there. I have heard from the CBP.   And Democrats choose this moment to advance this bill to hobble the  authority of the President of the United States to protect the Nation  by excluding foreign nationals he or she might identify as posing a  danger. Think North Korea.   In fact, they strip the President and transfer to the secretary of  state and Homeland Security the President's longstanding authority to  protect the Nation in this way.   And in case you would have concluded otherwise by the rhetoric, this  is not limited to a religious criteria for entry.   I offered an amendment in the Judiciary Committee to defer the  effectiveness of this unwise legislation--to understate--until the  current crisis can be brought under control by restoring the Trump  administration's successful remain in Mexico policy. But Democrats  rejected that and refused to consider it on the floor.   Customs and Border Protection advised us on our trip the week before  last that they told the administration revoking the remain in Mexico  policy would cause a disaster. But they did it anyway.   And here they have doubled down. Just the latest evidence that  today's crisis is intentional. There is no intention to control it.  There is an intention, yes, there is a plan, but the plan is to build  out the capacity for bringing people illegally into the United States.  This is a crisis. They serve not the people of America. You can't have  a country if you don't have a voice.
