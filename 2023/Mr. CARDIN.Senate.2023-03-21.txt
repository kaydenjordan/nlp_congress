 Mr. President, I rise to recognize the 36th annual  Women's History Month.   This year in Maryland, we have some special advancements to  celebrate. In Maryland, voters chose Brooke Lierman as the first-ever  woman independently elected to a statewide office as our new  comptroller. Marylanders also elected Aruna Miller as our second female  Lieutenant Governor and first woman of color and immigrant elected to  statewide office in Maryland.   Here in the U.S. Congress, we have the highest percentage of women  serving in history--28 percent across both the House of Representatives  and here in the Senate. They build on the legacy of pioneers like  former Maryland Senator Barbara Mikulski. She was the first Democratic  woman to win a seat in both the House and the Senate and until recently  held the record as the longest serving female Senator, having now been  surpassed by Senator Feinstein of California.   As the late Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said:         Women belong in all places where decisions are being made.                           Equal Rights Amendment    Mr. President, I was proud to testify recently at the Senate  Judiciary Committee hearing regarding the Equal Rights Amendment, the  ERA. At the most basic level, the ERA is a continuation of the  centuries-long process of expanding what is meant by ``We the People.''   The main clause of the amendment simply states:   [[Page S845]]              Equality of rights under the law shall not be abridged by       the United States or by any State on account of sex.    The vast majority of Americans will hear this and think, Of course,  this should be part of our Constitution.   In fact, many Americans believe that it is already part of our  Constitution. It has been overwhelmingly supported by the American  public, regardless of political affiliation. A poll conducted by the  Pew Research Center in the spring of 2020 found that 78 percent support  the Equal Rights Amendment being added to the Constitution. A separate  poll from AP-NORC similarly found three-quarters of Americans in  support of the ERA, with large majorities of both Democrats and  Republicans in favor of the Equal Rights Amendment.   In addition, 22 States, including my home State of Maryland, have  established State-level ERAs. Six more have some form of explicit  prohibition against sex discrimination in their constitution. Other  States are actively in the process of adding the ERA. For example, in  January, the New York State Legislature sent a State-level ERA to the  voters for consideration on their 2024 ballot. So we already have it in  the majority of the constitutions among States. It is time that it be  added to the U.S. Constitution.   Indeed, 85 percent of countries have explicit prohibitions against  governmental discrimination on the basis of sex. The United States is  the only--the only--industrialized democracy that does not include an  explicit provision in their Constitution. We want the United States to  continue to be the gold standard when it comes to women's equality,  opportunity, and protection against discrimination. Our inaction on  this issue is an outdated barrier to our credibility on the global  stage.   When Congress passed the Equal Rights Amendment and sent it to the  States for ratification, it included a 7-year time limit for the States  to ratify in the preamble of the resolution proposing the Equal Rights  Amendment to the States. This deadline was later extended for 3 years  until 1982, but a total of 35 of the 38 States ratified the amendment  by the extended date of 1982. There is nothing in the Constitution that  provides for a time limit on a ratification of a constitutional  amendment.   In 2017, Nevada activists, led by State Senator Pat Spearman,  reignited the push for the ERA through the first State ratification  since 1977. Illinois followed in 2019. Virginia became the 38th and  final State required by the Constitution to ratify the ERA in 2020.   Since then, the only major remaining barrier has been the ambiguity  caused by the fact that the three final ratifications occurred after  the time set in the original resolution passed by Congress.   With Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, I introduced a joint  resolution to resolve that ambiguity--to remove that last barrier.  Thirty eight States have ratified; it should be part of our  Constitution. It would remove the arbitrary deadline that Congress once  set and to recognize the ERA as validly ratified by the required 38  States. Our S.J. Res. 4 is cosponsored by 52 U.S. Senators, including  Senator Collins and all Senate Democrats and Independents.   This action is well within the Congress's broad power over the  amendment process laid out in article V of our Constitution. As the ERA  Coalition put it, this is the first time in our history that an  amendment has fulfilled all ratification requirements under article V  and has not been recognized.   There is precedent both for constitutional amendments to be ratified  after significant periods and for Congress to pass resolutions to  recognize amendments as validly ratified. There is simply no  constitutional reason nor court ruling that bars us from taking this  step. I point out to my colleagues that the 27th Amendment to the  Constitution which deals with congressional pay increases was ratified.  It took over 200 years to ratify it, and it is now part of the  Constitution of the United States.   There are many reasons why it is important that we do act. The  reality is that women still face serious challenges on account of sex  and that our existing legal framework does not always provide a  sufficient remedy.   As the 28th Amendment, the ERA would serve as a new tool--for  Congress, for Federal Agencies, and in the courts--to advance equality  in the fields of workforce and pay, pregnancy discrimination, sexual  harassment and violence, reproductive autonomy, and protection of the  LGBTQ+ individuals.   The ERA would serve as a constitutional backstop for existing and new  legislation. It would also signal to the courts that they should apply  a more rigorous level of review to laws and government policies that  discriminate on the basis of sex. Enshrining this protection in the  Constitution also ensures enduring protections for all Americans across  the country.   Through this action, we can finish the work started by the  generations before us in order to secure the future of the generations  to come. Our strength is in our values, and no value is more American  than equality. There should be no time limit on equality.   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
