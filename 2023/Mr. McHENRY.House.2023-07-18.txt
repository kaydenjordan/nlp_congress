 Mr. Speaker, as we continue to stress STEM education in  our country, I would like to recognize the North Carolina School of  Science and Math.  [[Page H3645]]    This new campus for the School of Science and Math is located in the  city of Morganton in the Tenth District in western North Carolina.   Students recently finished their first academic year on this new  campus. This is the second campus of the North Carolina School of  Science and Math, the original having opened in Durham in 1980.   Thanks to the hard work of local officials, citizens, and industry  leaders in our region, funding was secured for the western campus in  Morganton, and the first residential class of some 300 students started  last fall.   A special thanks to my friend, State Representative Hugh Blackwell,  whose vision for the western campus made the project a reality and his  great work in the legislature made it possible.   This public high school will fill our workforce with the next  generation of innovators and entrepreneurs and will help these  dedicated students reach their full potential. I salute the graduating  seniors and send best wishes as you continue your educational journey  in the years ahead.                         American Legion World Series     Mr. Speaker, The American Legion World Series is being  held on Monday in my district in the beautiful city of Shelby, North  Carolina, which has been the permanent home of the tournament since  2011.   Beginning August 10, more than 100,000 fans will fill Shelby's Keeter  Stadium over the 6 days of the tournament. They will cheer on eight  teams from around the country as they vie to be crowned the 2023  American Legion World Series champions in the tournament which was  first contested in 1926.                                time  1015    Many former American Legion players had successful careers in the big  leagues, including all stars such as Johnny Bench, George Brett, Dusty  Baker, and the pride of Caldwell County, Madison Bumgarner.   To local leaders in Cleveland County, American Legion Post 82, and  the hundreds of volunteers who will work countless hours to welcome  fans to Shelby, I extend my thanks, and a special thanks for all that  The American Legion does for youth around this country.                            ____________________
