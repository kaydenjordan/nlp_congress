 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Florida for  hosting this Special Order and continuing to elevate this issue and  keep talking about it.   The last time that we were speaking on this floor about the crisis on  our southern border with Mexico, our colleagues on the other side of  the aisle were still denying there was a crisis, if you remember.   In report after report--if you watched CNN, MSNBC, et cetera--they  said it was a manufactured crisis, manufactured by Donald Trump.   To their credit, they finally agreed that there is a crisis. I just  thought, well, such is the state of the Democrats on the other side of  the aisle. But mere acceptance of reality counts for progress around  here. But we have got to be thankful that we are at least having a  conversation sometime.   But you would think, with this crisis on our border--5,000 people a  day coming illegally. That doesn't count the ones coming at points of  entry. Those are in between the points of entry. And that also doesn't  count the ones that weren't caught, right? Those are the ones we  caught.   Usually, Border Patrol says you can times two whatever we caught  because others are getting through. You would think that we would be  working around the clock here to fix this crisis at the border since we  all now agree that there is a crisis.   But, instead, my good friends on the other side of the aisle are  focused on smearing the President. I get the partisanship, but what  really troubles me is they are also focused on smearing Border Patrol  and ICE agents that are duty bound. They raise their right hand and  take an oath to uphold and defend the Constitution and the laws that we  created, that this body created. They are just doing their job that we  asked them to do, and for that, they are being criticized, demonized,  and smeared.   To add further insult to injury, some of our colleagues are now  saying that they want to abolish these folks, the agencies--ICE and  Homeland Security. You didn't hear that wrong. That is a solution.   So, a solution to the problem of people coming illegally, pouring  across the border, offered by the other side of the aisle, in some  cases, is to abolish the agencies and the people who are working to  stop it.   This completely sounds wrongheaded to me. I don't know who that makes  sense to, but it doesn't make any sense to me.   Now, what other ideas have we heard? Of course, amnesty for illegal  foreign nationals. That is going to fix the problem, because if you  know that you can break the law and nothing is going to happen to you,  I am sure that is not an encouragement to keep on breaking the law. I  am sure that is not somehow.   Decriminalizing illegal entry. So, if you have somebody trespassing  on your land and you go to the police and you say, ``Hey, these folks  keep trespassing on my land,'' the police say, ``Well, here is our  solution. We are just going to make trespass legal now. Are you good  with that?''   Well, that doesn't seem like much of a solution.   Eliminating detention facilities. So, recently, a study maintains  that 30 percent of the young people--usually young girls, but not  exclusively, but young people that are being brought in--because these  folks know that if they bring a child with them, it is tantamount to  just immediate entry--30 percent of them had no connection, had no  familial--family connection to the person that they are with.   So, the reason to have detention facilities, among other things, is  to try and figure out: Is this child with a parent or a relative, or is  this child being trafficked?   A solution to this overwhelming problem offered by my friends on the  other side of the aisle is to just get rid of the detention facilities.   So, the last place that this small child is looking for salvation,  for safety, to stop the trafficking that is happening at that time,  looking to America, probably praying and hoping that, finally, when I  get to America, they are going to find out that I am being exploited in  horrific ways.   Our good friends on the other side of the aisle say, No, we are not  going to do any of that. Just keep on exploiting the kids, but don't do  it here. Don't do it in Mexico either. Now, just keep exploiting them  in your town.   Well, that is not much of a solution. To me, that is horrific,  thinking about that.   Of course, then, another solution is providing taxpayer-funded  healthcare for people that came here illegally.   Mr. Speaker, I don't know where everybody lives, but I know that  people in the community that I am privileged to represent are having a  hard time paying for their own healthcare now, let alone paying for  people that came here illegally.   And, again, that is a solution to stop people from coming across the  border offered from our friends on the other side of the aisle.   Let's face it, these are incentives. These aren't solutions to fix  this problem; these are incentives to exacerbate the problem.   I don't know what reality my good friends on the other side of the  aisle are residing in, but, so far, it seems to me their platform has  been amnesty, apathy, or apoplexy.   And we are frustrated because we know that the solutions are out  there. We have worked on them here, and we are happy and willing to  work with our friends and colleagues on the other side of the aisle,  but they seem paralyzed by theatrics in politics.    We know that loopholes in our immigration laws are being exploited by  human traffickers and drug cartels. They are taking laws designed to  help the most helpless, and they are using them for profit at a tragic  cost to children and families.   Yet, the policies and the solutions proposed by our good friends on  the other side of the aisle expand those loopholes or create even  brand-new ones.   And we know, with hundreds of thousands of people streaming across  the border, we need funds for beds and detention space.   Some of our friends on the other side of the aisle say, ``Well, we  don't want you to detain these people, and we are not going to provide  any funding for beds.''   So the answer is, when they come across the border, don't even talk  to them. Just let them keep on going. Let the children stay with their  trafficker, end detention altogether, leaving the trafficked child at  the mercy of their trafficker.   Then there is the dangerous transnational criminal organization, not  only trafficking in children, but the drugs that are ravaging your very  community.                                time  2030    They are coming across our southern border. Barriers, fencing, and  wall, they are a force multiplier, because if our Border Patrol agents  don't have to stare at this place right here on the border because  there is a barrier there, they can look over here where traffickers are  coming across. Without any barrier, they have to look everywhere, and  there is just simply not enough of them.   The other side shut the government down, trying to stop us from  securing the border.   These cartels make massive profits. You heard about El Chapo's  sentence today. It is estimated he was making $3 billion a year  trafficking children and drugs into your community, $3 billion a year.   El Chapo is in jail. Do you think somebody else didn't take over? Do  you think he was the only cartel in Mexico?   The other side is wasting time on this floor passing partisan bills  that have no hope of becoming law. Meanwhile, ICE made more than 1,500  human trafficking arrests, and 97 percent of those were for sex  trafficking. 20,000 children were illegally smuggled into the United  States in December of  [[Page H5991]]  last year alone, 20,000 children. These are little kids.   I know the statistics start to run together, but these numbers must  be recited. As of March this year, CBP has seen over a 50 percent spike  in gang members apprehended at the southern border.   Did you look to see what happened in Los Angeles just this week, the  arrests and the horrific crimes? Is this what we want in our  communities, people hatcheting and macheteing each other to death,  cutting each other apart?   We have a great country. There is no reason to do this.   In the last 2 years, ICE has arrested 266,000 aliens with criminal  records. Those aliens had convictions, including 100,000 assaults,  30,000 sex crimes, and 4,000 homicides.   If you believe the cartels are going to stop making millions a year  if we decriminalize the border and abolish ICE, you are not living in  reality.   Every day, children are being recycled across the border, serving as  human shields. They send them across with somebody; they send them  back; and then, they come back with somebody else. That is trafficking.  There is no consequence to it.   It is time to stop just talking about protecting the children being  exploited. It is long past time to start protecting them and our  communities by closing the loopholes that are used to hurt them.   A famous quote we have all heard goes like this: ``The only thing  necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men and women do  nothing.'' That is happening, Mr. Speaker, in this House.   The country is still waiting on the leadership of this House of  Representatives to do something.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Yoho) for  inviting me and keeping this issue front and center.
