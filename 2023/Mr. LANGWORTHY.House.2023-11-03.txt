 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the heroic and  selfless actions of Buffalo Police Detective AJ Ortiz.   On the evening of August 29, Detective Ortiz was off duty and  traveling in my district near the town of Concord when he noticed  taillights partially submerged in a pond. Without hesitation, he  rescued the three elderly individuals who were trapped inside that  sinking vehicle, saving their lives.   In that moment, Detective Ortiz went above and beyond the call of  duty, but I want to emphasize that his heroism goes beyond just this  single act.   As the second in command of the Buffalo Police Underwater Recovery  Team, he has demonstrated his dedication to public safety and  extraordinary commitment to our community. His training and experience  undoubtedly played a vital and pivotal role in the positive outcome  that would and could have quickly become a tragic situation.   I thank Detective AJ Ortiz for his heroic actions that night and his  continued dedication to serving western New York every single day.                            ____________________
