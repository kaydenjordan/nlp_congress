 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the rule. Although  there are parts of the rule that I agree with, I am going to talk today  about the PFAS Action Act and why I think it is a problem.   Republicans and Democrats alike are concerned about our water  quality. Of course, we want to make sure that we have good-quality  drinking water.   Unfortunately, the PFAS Action Act goes too far. It classifies over  9,000 chemicals as hazardous. This is a huge problem because there are  a lot of materials that are made with PFAS chemicals that aren't  harmful to humans.   In one case in point, in my district, there is a company called W. L.  Gore. Most of you know about it because they make GORE-TEX, but they  also make medical devices. They have 2,000 employees in Flagstaff,  Arizona, and they have 1,000 employees in my district. They make heart  stents.   I went on a tour of their company. They make all kinds of medical  devices that are implanted in human beings that we rely on to save  lives. Yet, those medical devices have a form of PFAS in them. If this  legislation is passed, you are basically going to cause them to be  called hazardous materials, and we won't be able to implant these in  people.   This is a huge problem, and I think that my Democratic friends just  need to think this through a little bit more.   All of us want clean drinking water. But there are so many different  uses of these PFAS chemicals, over 9,000 of them, and some of them are  for really good uses, like these medical devices, the heart stents.   That is why I oppose this rule. I ask my Democrat colleagues to  reconsider. We had an amendment in the Energy and Commerce Committee  that was rejected by the Democrats, although one of the members said  they would like to revisit and fix it.
