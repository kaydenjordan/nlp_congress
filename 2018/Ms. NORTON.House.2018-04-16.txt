 Mr. Speaker, today, marking the signing of President  Lincoln's proclamation freeing slaves in the Nation's Capital, is a  local holiday in the District of Columbia. Many D.C. residents worked  anyway.   Activist groups in the District of Columbia, including DC Vote,  brought residents here, who got more Members to sign on to our D.C.  statehood bill to end taxation without representation for D.C.  residents, who are number one per capita in taxes paid to support the  Federal Government, but with no voting Representatives on this House  floor and no Senators at all.   Even more shameful, as this poster shows, D.C.'s war casualties have  often outnumbered those of the States, more than 10 States during the  Vietnam war, for example.   D.C. residents are American citizens who have overpaid for their  citizenship. It is time for Congress to pay back.                            ____________________
