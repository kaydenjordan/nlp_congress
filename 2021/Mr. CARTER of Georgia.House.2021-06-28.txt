 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the  Hyde amendment and to denounce President Biden's pro-abortion budget.   Since 1976, the Hyde amendment has saved millions of innocent lives  by ensuring that American tax dollars are not spent on abortions. For  over 40 years, Congress has supported the Hyde amendment with  bipartisan support. That tradition seems to have ended with this  current administration as President Biden hopes to pass the most pro- abortion budget in our Nation's history.   As a healthcare professional, father, and grandfather, I strongly  believe in the right to life, just like the majority of Americans. We  must stand up for those who cannot stand up for themselves and uphold  these provisions set by Congress over 40 years ago to save the lives of  the unborn.   Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the Committees on Energy  and Commerce, Ways and Means, and the Judiciary be discharged from  further consideration of H.R. 18, and ask for its immediate  consideration in the House.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise today to show my support for the Second  Amendment and draw attention to its importance. I would like to start  by emphasizing a line from the Second Amendment. `` . . . the right of  the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.''   Let me repeat that: `` . . . shall not be infringed.'' I emphasize  this point because today there are many efforts to infringe and abridge  this essential right. There are a lot of misconceptions surrounding the  Second Amendment, but let me make it clear, the Second Amendment  enshrines the right to self-protection in defense of liberty for all  Americans.   The right to protect yourself is not given to us by our government.  As part of the Bill of Rights, the Second Amendment was not intended to  comprehensively define the scope of our right to bear arms. Rather, it  serves as a prohibition on certain actions our government can take to  infringe on that righ                                time  2015    The Biden administration, however, misunderstands this point. In a  statement last week, the White House stated that the Second Amendment  limits the type of people who could own a gun. Further, it continues to  seek to restrain Americans' rights through other actions.   A recent example is the administration's move to strictly regulate  stabilizing braces that have allowed disabled individuals to more  easily enjoy their constitutionally protected right.   Americans bought 15.1 million guns during the 7-month period from  March through September of 2020, which was a 91 percent leap from the  same period in 2019. The FBI also processed more background checks for  gun purchases in just the first 9 months of 2020 than it had for any  previous full year.   Americans want to be safer, and guns give them that sense of  security. In spite of that fact, my colleagues across the aisle have  made it their mission to restrict this liberty in the name of safety.   However, there is no link between the number of guns and gun violence  in the U.S. The number of guns in America rose nearly 50 percent  between 1993 and 2013. During the same period, gun homicides fell by  nearly 50 percent.   In fact, violent crime has been decreasing for decades, despite an  increase last year, during which we also saw calls for defunding the  police. In 2019, the violent crime rate fell to the second lowest total  rate since 1971, and the murder rate was less than half of what it was  at the 1980 peak.   Restricting the Second Amendment is simply not the answer. This  right, preserved in our Constitution generations ago, cannot be taken  away from ourselves and future generations. We must protect from  intrusions on our right to protect ourselves, no matter how hard the  left works to strip us of this principle.   Madam Speaker, I ask all of my colleagues to join me in standing up  for our Second Amendment right to bear arms.
