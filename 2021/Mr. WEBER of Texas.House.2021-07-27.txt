 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of amendment No.  109 within this en bloc.   My amendment identifies an immediate need of the United States  nuclear industry, the need to provide full funding for construction of  the Department of Energy, the DOE, versatile test reactor project.   As ranking member of the Subcommittee on Energy for the Science,  Space, and Technology Committee, I know that there is no clean energy  future without advanced nuclear. The best vehicle to accelerate us down  the road of emissions reductions is nuclear energy.   The versatile test reactor is an absolutely critical piece of DOE's  R&D infrastructure that will allow U.S. nuclear researchers to validate  and test a wide range of advanced reactor designs right here in the  good old U.S. of A. Any responsible U.S. nuclear energy strategy must  include robust support for this facility.   Madam Speaker, last Congress, as part of the sweeping nuclear  provisions in the Energy Act of 2020, we were able to authorize robust  funding for the versatile test reactor. It was a tremendous  bipartisan--that my friend from Arkansas is pointing out--achievement I  was proud to lead. But this authorization is all for naught without the  yearly appropriations to back it up.   That is why I am very concerned to see that the 2022 appropriations  bill provides no funds, zero, zip, zilch, nada, to keep the versatile  test reactor project on budget and on schedule.   If we are serious about our clean energy future, Madam Speaker, and  we want to decrease our dependence on competitors like China and Russia  for advanced nuclear R&D, we must commit to our investment in this  essential research infrastructure.   The United States can and should lead the world in advanced nuclear.  Moving forward, I will continue to work with my colleagues to  prioritize nuclear innovation and keep America safe, energy  independent, and globally competitive.   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.
