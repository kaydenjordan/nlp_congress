 Mr. President, thank you for the recognition.    Mr. President, I just want to tell you how proud I am to  join Senator Whitehouse today on the floor. I want to thank the Senator  from Rhode Island for continuing to bring the urgency of combating  climate change to the attention of this body. I admire his passion and  intellectual clout, which he has brought specifically to climate change  a number of times here on the Senate floor. He has been a great  advocate for his State of Rhode Island, where we all know there are  going to be very serious impacts--sea level rise is one of the major  ones, but there are many others--as a result of how climate change and  global warming are playing out.   Let's state several things here that are clear. One is that the  science is clear. The Earth's atmosphere is warming at an alarming  rate, and human activity is the principle cause. What we see every day  with our own eyes--extreme weather events around the globe--is clearer  and clearer. But worse and most clear is the harm being done to  millions of Americans and people all around the world as a result of  the destructive effects of climate change.   People are losing their homes, their lands, and their farms. We now  have a new kind of refugee--climate refugees--who are displaced from  their homes by catastrophic weather disasters, including drought and  floods. In 2017 roughly 68.5 million people were climate refugees, and  that number is expected to double to over 140 million by 2050.   Hundreds of thousands are losing their lives. The official death toll  in Puerto Rico from Hurricane Maria is now 2,975, and there are even  higher estimates of losses.   Climate change is the most pressing moral issue of our time. As the  people in Puerto Rico know all too well, as the people of Rhode Island  know well, as the people of New Mexico know well, and as all of our  States and territories know well, it is an existential threat. Yet in  the words of the late, great John McCain--as the Presiding Officer  knows, he was always an outspoken gentleman--``we are getting nothing  done, my friends. We're getting nothing done.''   I know that Senator Whitehouse was an honorary pallbearer at Senator  McCain's ceremony at the National Cathedral. We had 4 days of  celebrating the John McCain that spoke up about core issues that  America really faced. As I mentioned, John gave us that deserved  chewing-out on the Senate floor on July 25 of last year for not working  together, for not working in a bipartisan fashion, and for not reaching  across the aisle. On climate change, we certainly are not getting  anything done, and we are not working across the aisle, as John told us  to do.   The West that John McCain so loved and worked to protect is getting  hit hard. We have less precipitation and less snowpack, and the  snowpack we have is melting earlier. Rivers and reservoirs are running  at historic lows, and some river segments are drying. We now have  abnormally dry conditions in every Western State. We have extreme  drought weather in parts of New Mexico, Arizona, California, Utah,  Colorado, and even Oregon. In my  [[Page S6017]]  home State of New Mexico, every single county is in abnormally dry or  drought conditions.   Here are the drought maps of the West from last week and from the  same time of the year in 2000, when the Federal Government first began  keeping track. This map here is from 2000, when the Federal Government  first began keeping track. Let's look at the contrast, which is very,  very stark.   On the first map, we didn't see the extreme form and exceptional  drought at all, but we can see a very, very stark contrast 18 years  later.   These dry conditions are creating more wildfires that are burning  more acreage and threatening more homes and threatening more lives.   The Mendocino Complex fire in California is the largest fire that  State has ever experienced. Since it began in late July, it has burned  over 450,000 acres, taken one firefighter's life, and destroyed 157  homes. After 2 months, it is still not fully contained.   In my home State of New Mexico, about 20 miles of the Rio Grande,  south of Albuquerque and through the Bosque del Apache National  Wildlife Refuge, we are already dry in May, months earlier than in  typical years. Two weeks ago, farmers in the Middle Rio Grande area in  my State started getting notified that the water stored for their crops  was almost gone--months before irrigation season's end in October. As  of 2 days ago, Elephant Butte Reservoir was only 4.6 percent full--4.6  percent. Back in the 1990s, the reservoir was 27 miles in length.  Today, it is about 10 miles.   Here are the aerial maps of the Elephant Butte from 1994 and 2013.  These photographs show that climate change is here and now. You can see  Elephant Butte here in 1994, and in 2013 you see a very dramatically  shrunken Elephant Butte.   Elephant Butte provides water to over 90,000 acres of farmland in  southern New Mexico and western Texas. It is an economic engine for  Sierra County, the rural county where it is located. We can't afford  for this reservoir to be at 4.6 percent.   John McCain's beloved Arizona is in its 21st year of drought. We have  measured the Animas River in Colorado for 106 years. Two weeks ago, in  Durango, it was at its lowest measured point for this time of year,  ever--ever.   Utah's temperature has warmed 2 degrees Fahrenheit over the last  century. The State's $1.3 billion ski industry has seen warmer winters,  less snowpack, and less powder. Ski resorts that never had to make snow  have to make it now.   Alaska is under singular threat. A warmer atmosphere is rapidly  melting the Arctic's snowpack and glaciers. The seas are rising to  unprecedented levels. Animals such as the polar bears and the walruses,  which depend on ice to survive, are struggling to survive. The iconic  polar bear has been listed as a threaten species since 2008--a direct  result of climate warming.   During the last past century, Alaska has warmed twice as fast as the  global average. Native villages along the sea are under siege. There  are at least 31 Alaskan towns and cities at imminent risk of  destruction. Two Native villages have voted to relocate. Newtok, a  Native village along the river that feeds to the Bering Sea, is  literally collapsing into the water and is already relocating. Their  relocation will cost $100 million. Congress gave them $15 million this  year toward that effort.   The fact is that Native Americans and other marginalized populations  are more vulnerable to the devastation of climate change, but no one is  immune from this. I could recite 1,000 statistics that show how climate  change is hurting the American West, its people, and its lands. The  statistics are there. The science is there. The American people are  there. Congress needs to get there.    The New York Times Magazine recently ran its longest article ever. It  was on climate change, entitled ``Losing Earth: The Decade We Almost  Stopped Climate Change.''   The article showed that between 1979 and 1989, we came to understand  the causes and dangers of the greenhouse effect. During that decade, we  had the opportunity to take action to dramatically reduce carbon  emissions, but we failed.   In 1998, one of the leading climate scientists then and now, James  Hansen, working for NASA, told Congress that it was 99 percent certain  that the global warming trend was not a natural variation but was  caused by buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. He told  Congress 30 years ago that climate change was here--here and now.   During that decade, there was more opportunity for consensus than  today. The oil and gas industry was more receptive to taking action.  Politicians' views weren't as set in concrete. But that generation  failed to act on the science and failed to protect present and future  generations.   There was another opportunity in the early 2000s for Congress to act.  John McCain wanted us to act, but we didn't.   As chair of the Senate Commerce Committee, he held groundbreaking  hearings in 2000 on climate change. He brought the science of climate  change to light in the halls of the Senate.   Then, he and Senator Joel Lieberman crafted the first major,  bipartisan climate change legislation--cap-and-trade legislation-- modeled after similar and successful legislation to curb pollution from  acid rain.   Senators McCain and Lieberman forced a vote on the floor of the  Senate on their legislation in 2003.   John began his speech on the floor in support of his bill, quoting  from Hemingway's ``The Snows of Kilimanjaro":         Kilimanjaro is a snow-covered mountain 19,710 feet high,       and is said to be the highest mountain in Africa. Its western       summit is called . . . the House of God.    John warned then, in 2003, all too presciently, that the snow on  Kilimanjaro may someday be relegated to the realm of fiction.   Some Senators who sit today voted on the McCain-Lieberman bill. The  bill had a chance to succeed, but failed 43 to 55. Kilimanjaro's  glaciers, in fact, have receded dramatically since that vote. The ice  sheets depend on snowfall, which is affected by Indian Ocean currents.  The Indian Ocean's warming, due to climate change, has changed moisture  delivery to Kilimanjaro, and Hemingway's snow is disappearing.   Congress has had a few more bipartisan efforts at addressing climate  change, including my own cap-and-trade bill in the House of  Representatives with Republican Representative Tom Petri. But after the  McCain-Lieberman bill and those efforts failed, we turned to the Obama  administration to take on climate change in earnest.   The Obama administration passed the Clean Power Plan to limit carbon  emissions from powerplants and put the brakes on new coal-fired  powerplants; passed regulations to control methane, a super potent  greenhouse gas from oil and gas operations; and joined with 190  countries in executing the Paris Agreement. All of these initiatives  are now under assault by the Trump administration and industry. The  United States is alone as the only country in the world that walked  away from the Paris Accord.   Turning our backs on climate change means ignoring the national  security threat it represents. Large groups of displaced people and  scarce resources create conflict. The U.S. military--especially the  Navy--recognizes the threat. That is why they created the MEDEA Program  in the early 1990s to analyze the security threats of climate change,  and that is one reason John McCain once worked toward a bipartisan  solution to climate change.   Neither party can claim they have done enough to tackle global  warming, but climate action demands that Republicans step up as Senator  McCain once did.   The destruction to property and lives wrought by global warming does  not distinguish between parties. This is a bipartisan problem that  demands bipartisan solutions, and demands them now.   The West is right in the bull's-eye of climate change, but the West  has great potential to be part of the solution. The West's potential to  generate renewable clean energy through solar, wind, and geothermal is  immense. New Mexico, California, Arizona, Colorado, and Nevada have  some of the highest potential for solar generation in the country, and  virtually all the Western States have immense potential for geothermal  power. We should be harnessing this potential, creating sustainable  jobs, and growing our rural Western economies and industries that are  the future--industries that will help tackle the greatest challenge  humanity faces.  [[Page S6018]]    The American people want Congress to meet the challenges of climate  change. They want to protect future generations, their children, and  their grandchildren.   We can do this, but we must do it now. And we must, as our late and  very great colleague from Arizona urged us, do this on a bipartisan  basis.   Let all of us show the courage, resolve, and independence of John  McCain and do right by today's generation and future generations. Let  us all commit to doing what it takes to reduce our carbon emissions, to  meet the goals of the world of nations, to increase renewable energy to  its fullest potential, and, most importantly, to do right by our  children, our grandchildren, and beyond.   I yield the floor.                           Remembering John McCain     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Olubukola  Adebayo and Christina Youn, congressional fellows in my office, be  granted floor privileges for the remainder of the 115th Congress.
