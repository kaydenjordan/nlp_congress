 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Ryan Redington  on winning the 2023 Iditarod Sled Dog Race, traveling almost 1,000  miles in 8 days, 21 hours, 12 minutes, and 58 seconds.   Ryan has competed in the Iditarod 16 times, and although he may not  be from Wisconsin's Seventh District, he spends his fall and winter  utilizing the lands in Douglas County to train his sled dogs for the  race.   This is not the Redington family's first time in the Iditarod. Ryan's  grandfather is one of the cofounders of the race and is now known as  the Father of the Iditarod.   Ryan has shown us what patience and dedication look like after  recovering from being hit by a snowmobile last year, and I am pleased  that my district got to assist in bringing him and his dogs to victory.   Congratulations, Ryan, on achieving your lifelong dream.                            ____________________
