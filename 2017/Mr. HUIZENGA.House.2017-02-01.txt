 Mr. Speaker, section 1504 of the Dodd-Frank Act was  like  [[Page H850]]  many other provisions that were ultimately included in the sprawling  law. They had absolutely no relationship to the underlying cause of the  financial and housing crisis.   However, some have used the financial crisis to hijack Federal  securities law in order to push a socially motivated agenda.  Specifically, section 1504 of the Dodd-Frank Act requires companies  registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission to annually  report payments such as taxes, royalties, fees, production  entitlements, and those types of things made to a foreign or the U.S.  Federal government relating to the commercial development of minerals,  oils, and natural gas.   Companies subject to section 1504 must report the type and total  amounts of these payments made for each project, as well as the type  and total amounts of payments made to each government. These payments  cover, as I said, taxes and other things that are really business  expenses.   While this may be a laudable goal, using Federal securities law and  the SEC to enforce social issues is inconsistent with the SEC's core  mission and completely inappropriate. Just to remind everyone, the  SEC's mission by law is to: One, protect investors; two, maintain fair,  orderly, and efficient markets; and three, facilitate capital  formation. I would liken what they are doing by having the SEC put this  rule in place sort of like requiring your police department to be in  charge of road repair, too. It is just not their expertise.   The SEC recognized this fact and stated that section 1504 ``appears  designed primarily to advance U.S. foreign policy objectives,'' not  investor protection or capital formation. Notwithstanding the merits of  the underlying policy goals, conducting American foreign policy is not  what Congress created the SEC to do. In fact, just moments ago, the  U.S. Senate confirmed Rex Tillerson as the Secretary of State, and I  would suggest that we let him direct our foreign policy. With all due  respect to the commissioners and the SEC staff, none of them are really  foreign policy experts.   As we debate this resolution, let's be clear on what this isn't  about. Some have tried to argue that a vote to vacate this provision is  a vote for corruption somehow. This couldn't be further from the truth.  Now, I understand and sympathize with the sense and the feeling of this  that this rule makes supporters feel better about themselves, but it  does not solve the real world issues. This foreign rule that has been  brought up is really like comparing apples and oranges with the foreign  rules versus this particular rule. And if we allow them to rewrite this  particular rule, we might actually mirror what the EU and what other  foreign governments are doing.   Despite the claims to the contrary, H.J. Res. 41 does nothing to  undermine the ability of the SEC and the Justice Department to police  against foreign corruption. In fact, both of these agencies still have,  at their disposal, Federal laws, including the Foreign Corrupt  Practices Act, which prohibits bribing foreign officials.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.    And even without this SEC extraction rule in effect,  fraud will still be fraud and corruption will still be corruption. Both  will still be illegal activities that should be punished to the fullest  extent of the law.   Voting for this resolution is a vote to right the ship. This is a  vote to reset the regulatory process. Congress needs to send this  flawed regulation back to the SEC drawing board and instruct the SEC to  get the provision right by promulgating an appropriate rule under  section 1504.   I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to  the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney), the ranking  member of the Subcommittee on Capital Markets on the Financial Services  Committee.   Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the  gentlewoman for yielding to me, and for her leadership in so many  areas, including her leadership on this joint resolution.   I rise today in strong opposition to the resolution, which would  repeal an SEC anticorruption rule. I fail to understand why anyone in  this body would want to repeal something that helps us fight  corruption.   The SEC rule would require companies registered in the United States  to disclose the payments that they make to foreign governments for the  development of oil, natural gas, or other minerals.   Unfortunately, there is a long and very sad history of corruption  where Big Oil or mining companies strike deals with foreign governments  to extract their natural resources. Too often, the money from the oil  or mining company ended up going to pay bribes to corrupt politicians  and not to benefit the ordinary citizens of the country.   The SEC rule is intended to bring some basic transparency to these  deals--that is all we are talking about, transparency--by requiring  U.S. companies to disclose the payments they make to foreign  governments--who the payments went to, how much they paid, who in the  government got the money that should be going to the people.                                time  1530    It tells the people and the country where this natural resources  money is going. This is just common sense, and it is outrageous and  unbelievable to me that anyone would oppose simple transparency rules  that combat corruption.   I have been a long-time supporter of this rule. I spoke in favor of  it during the Dodd-Frank debate, and I sent a letter to the SEC urging  them to finalize this rule as quickly as possible.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record this letter, on which I was  joined by roughly 58 of my colleagues.                                      Congress of the United States,                                        House of Representatives,                                      Washington, DC, June 11, 2014.      Re Implementation of Section 1504.       Hon. Mary Jo White,      Chair, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Washington,           DC.        Dear Chair White: We are aware that the Securities and       Exchange Commission (SEC) recently announced its anticipated       agenda for the next ten-month period, and that the agenda       includes a proposal to initiate rulemaking for Section 1504       of the Dodd-Frank Act by March 2015.        While we are pleased that the SEC plans to begin focusing       its attention on this important provision, which mandates       revenue transparency in the extractive industries, we believe       that the rulemaking for section 1504 should be on a swifter,       more definite time line. We strongly urge you, therefore, to       issue a proposed rule for public comment no later than the       end of this year.        The initial rule issued by the SEC on August 22, 2012       adhered closely to the intent of the law, and we applaud the       SEC for its forceful legal defense of the rule. In light of       the District Court's July 2013 decision, which vacated the       rule on procedural grounds but did not foreclose any       regulatory options, we believe the Commission should issue a       revised rule that is equally strong. The existing rulemaking       record should provide the necessary basis to swiftly schedule       a new rulemaking and to reissue a rule mandating public       disclosure by company and by project with no exemptions.       Anything less would undermine the intended purpose and       benefits of Section 1504 for investors, companies,       governments and their citizens.        We would note that after the SEC issued its rule in 2012,       the rest of the world followed our lead, establishing as a       global norm the public disclosure of oil and mineral payments       by company and by project with no exemptions. The European       Union and Norway passed disclosure laws modeled on the       Commission's August 2012 rule. The Canadian government has       committed to adopt the same requirements and plans to have       legislation passed by April 2015 and regulations in place       that summer. Several globally important oil and mining       companies also support payment transparency at the project-      level, citing significant business benefits, while others       have begun voluntarily disclosing detailed payment       information.        And in March, the United States was accepted as a candidate       country in the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative,       which is a global effort designed to increase accountability       and openness in these industries, and specifically requires       project-level reporting in line with the standard set by       Section 1504 and its sister legislation in Europe.        The implementation of Section 1504 is critical. Resource       revenue transparency allows shareholders to make better-      informed assessments of risks and opportunity costs, threats       to corporate reputation, and the long-term prospects of the       companies in which they invest. It is no surprise, then, that       investors with assets worth over $5.6 trillion recently       called on the SEC to quickly reissue a strong rule to align       with transparency rules in other markets.  [[Page H851]]         Public reporting of extractive payments is also fundamental       to improving governance, curbing corruption, improving       revenue management, and allowing citizens to demand greater       accountability from their governments for spending that       serves the public interest. This, in turn, can help create       more stable and democratic governments, as well as more       stable business environments, which contribute to the       advancement of U.S. national security interests.        Since its passage, Congress has continued to support the       strong implementation of Section 1504 rules. Last year,       legislation to implement an agreement between the U.S. and       Mexico to develop oil and gas reserves in the Gulf of Mexico       (HR 1613) was significantly delayed when the House version of       the bill included a waiver from Section 1504 requirements.        The White House strongly objected to the House bill       precisely because of the waiver, and issued a Statement of       Administration Policy calling the exemption unnecessary and       claiming it would directly and negatively impact U.S. efforts       to increase transparency and accountability in the oil, gas,       and minerals sectors. Congress ultimately passed a version of       the bill that did not include the Section 1504 waiver.        Importantly, the final legislation was supported by the       same industry groups and lawmakers who initially alleged that       Section 1504 would create conflicts of law and put American       companies at a competitive disadvantage.        The court decision, along with data and analysis from the       previous rulemaking process, has provided the Commission with       a road map to develop a revised rule requiring public       disclosure at the project level with no exemptions. We       strongly urge you to prioritize setting out a swift and fixed       timeline for the implementation of section 1504, including       the release of a proposed rule for public comment no later       than the end of 2014.

Mr. Speaker, let's also be clear  about what the SEC's rules do not do. They do not place any  restrictions on who companies can pay money to. It doesn't restrict how  much money they can pay or what they can pay for. It doesn't stop  corruption; it just simply says you have to report it so that the  people in the country--and everyone--knows what is going on.   In fact, there was bipartisan support for this rule. The amendment to  Dodd-Frank that required this rule was known as the Cardin-Lugar  amendment because it was cosponsored by Republican Senator Dick Lugar.  Senator Lugar was a long-time chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations  Committee, so he understood the negative impact that these corrupt  deals could have on developing countries.   The only reason--and I repeat, the only reason--to vote for this  resolution is to help corrupt governments steal money from their  people.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. I yield the gentlewoman an  additional 1 minute.   Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I am going to  repeat this phrase since people were knocking me out of order.   The absolute only reason they should vote for this--and I want to  warn those on both sides of the aisle--is to help corrupt governments  steal money from their people; so I strongly urge a ``no'' vote.   Now, several of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have  pointed out that the foreign and corrupt rule will take care of this,  but the foreign and corrupt rule only covers bribery. It doesn't cover  unjust enrichment. It doesn't cover governments stealing from  themselves.   Use of the Congressional Review Act to strike the rule would prohibit  the Commission from promulgating any rule that is ``substantially  similar'' to that rule, effectively preventing it from ever fulfilling  its statutory mandate in the Dodd-Frank Act, contrary to the will of  Congress.   I urge a strong ``no'' vote.    Will the gentleman yield?    Will the gentleman yield?    Will the gentleman yield?    Will the gentleman yield?    Mr. Speaker, I will point out, though, what my  resolution does, is it directs the SEC to go back to the drawing board.  It is not our job to write the rule. You are asking for that proposal.  The SEC wrote a rule; it got struck down by the courts. They got sued  again.    Mr. Speaker, I would be happy to write a rule. I am not  sure that the gentleman from Massachusetts would be happy with it. I am  not sure that the SEC would be happy with it.   Again, having that debate here in the well of the House, I was not  here for the writing of Dodd-Frank. I am dealing with the echo effects  of it, and that is what we are trying to do right now. So rather than  us having that, I put it back to the SEC.
