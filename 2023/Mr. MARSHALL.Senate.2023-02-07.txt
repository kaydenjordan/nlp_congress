 Mr. President, I rise today to honor and  recognize Commander Cade Keenan of the Missouri Air National Guard.   Cade Keenan, of Great Bend, KS, was recently named commander of the  139th Operations Support Squadron, 139th Airlift Wing, of the Missouri  Air National Guard in St. Joseph, MO. In this role, Commander Keenan  will lead 46 full-time instructor pilots, navigators, flight engineers,  loadmasters, and other support staff of the 139th Airlift Wing.   Commander Keenan has served our Nation faithfully, with his first  deployment being to Uzbekistan in support of Operation Enduring  Freedom, as well as regularly deploying throughout southwest Asia  between 2003 and 2020. An expert in infrared weapons and defense  systems, he instructed crews from across the USAF, USMC, and 10 partner  countries in combat tactics for the C-130, C-17, C-160, and C-235  aircraft. As a command pilot, Commander Keenan has 4,764 hours in  military aircraft, with 852 of those hours being in combat.   Commander Keenan has earned a certificate in electo-optical and  infrared applications from the Georgia Tech Research Institute, a  master of business administration from Colorado State University, and a  bachelor of science in industrial engineering from Kansas State  University. He has also graduated from the USAF Advanced Instrument and  USAF Weapons schools. Commander Keenan's extensive experience, wide  breadth of knowledge on U.S. Air Force operations, and his impressive  academic achievements give me great confidence in his ability to lead  the 139th Operations Support Squadron. He will certainly make his  country, the State of Kansas, and his community proud.   I now ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing Commander Cade  Keenan for his recent promotion, as well as thank him for his dedicated  service to our Nation.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today to honor, in my  opinion, the Kansan of the year, Willie Fritz. Fritz is currently the  head football coach at Tulane University in New Orleans, which saw  unprecedented success this year, culminating in a thrilling victory  over the University of Southern California in the Cotton Bowl Classic.   To give some background on Coach Fritz, he graduated from Shawnee  Mission Northwest High School in 1978 and went on to be a dual sport  athlete in basketball and football at Pittsburg State University for 4  years, both fantastic Kansas institutions. After multiple assistant  coaching roles at various colleges--including Pittsburg State--Coach  Fritz landed his first head coaching job at Central Missouri in 1997  and began his run of success as a head coach. He would stay at Central  Missouri for 12 years and then went to coach at Sam Houston State and  Georgia Southern before arriving at Tulane in 2016.   During his time at Tulane, his teams have played in three consecutive  bowl  [[Page S257]]  games from 2018-2020, winning two, but this season the program's  success was historic for Tulane. Coach Fritz and the team made their  mark first by winning Tulane's first-ever American Athletic Conference  Championship after beating the University of Central Florida. The team  then not only won the program's first Cotton Bowl, but did so in heroic  fashion by coming from behind 28-14 at halftime and scoring 16 points  in the final 5 minutes to beat USC and Heisman winner Caleb Williams by  a final of 46-45. The team finished the season ranked No. 9 in both the  coaches and AP polls at the end of the year. Following a 2-10 season in  2021 in which Tulane lost 17 players to season-ending injuries and were  forced to play two of their home games on the road due to damage from  Hurricane Ida, the 10-win increase marks the greatest turnaround in  college football history.   The success for Tulane's football program didn't stop on the field  though. This year alone, the team had 46 players receive Academic All- AAC honors and holds an 87 percent graduation rate. Both are true signs  of the high standards that Coach Fritz certainly holds his team to.   For as much success as the team has had, I would be remiss not to  mention a few of Coach Fritz's individual achievements. After the  Cotton Bowl victory, Coach Fritz now has the most bowl appearances ever  by a Tulane coach and now boasts a 236-119-1 career record. He was also  awarded both the Bobby Dodd Coach of the Year Foundation's 2022 Dodd  Trophy and the George Munger College Coach of the year award. He is  deserving of all these accolades and has also been recognized for his  efforts on giving back and making a positive impact in the New Orleans  community.   The only blemish on Coach Fritz's resume is that he had beat my alma  mater, Kansas State, in Manhattan, KS, this season. Since he is a  Kansan, I am willing to look past that one. I now ask my colleagues to  join me in congratulating Coach Fritz on an incredible season at  Tulane. May he see continued success throughout his career.                            ____________________
