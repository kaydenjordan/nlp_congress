 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor my  wife, Shannon, because this is the 21st anniversary of her last  chemotherapy treatment after being diagnosed and treated for colon  cancer in 1999.   This is a day that we will all remember. It is the day of success,  much different from the day of her diagnosis just a little over 6  months before that.   We were a young couple with a 2-year-old daughter and didn't know  what the future held. But because of the great American medical system  and the research that was done out here at places like the NIH for  years before my wife was diagnosed, she was able to get the surgery and  the treatment she needed to now celebrate this anniversary.   On that last day, when that poisonous chemotherapy stopped having to  enter her veins, little did we know we would be blessed with two more  children, twin boys, just a short time later. They were born less than  a year from then.   While our daughter is now 23 and our sons are 20, this is an  opportunity to talk about the greatness of America's healthcare system  and the greatness of the ingenuity within our healthcare system in this  country.   What is frustrating to me, Mr. Speaker, is that sometimes I hear my  colleagues on the other side of the aisle talk about how we on this  side of the aisle want to get rid of preexisting conditions coverage.  Every time I hear that, it hurts because I have seen what my wife went  through. I live, she lives, and our family lives with her preexisting  coverage every day.   Let's stop playing politics with healthcare. Let's celebrate what  America is all about and how we help heal the world. Let's do it today,  the day that I get to honor the love of my life, my wife, Shannon.   Shannon, I can't thank you enough for who you are. I can't thank you  enough for your courage. And I am so blessed to be able to call you my  wife.                            ____________________
