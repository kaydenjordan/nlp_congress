 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, over 2 weeks ago, the four congressional  leaders in the White House reached an agreement to raise the budget  caps and extend the debt ceiling. The House has already passed the  legislation that codifies the agreement into law. The President  supports it. He is even making calls--evidently, from press reports-- asking Republican colleagues to support it. So the last piece of the  puzzle here is the Senate.   Speaking for the minority, Democrats have no objection to voting on  the budget caps deal as soon as possible. I say to my friend the  majority leader: Why don't we vote on the caps deal this morning and  send it to the President's desk? There is no need to wait until later  in the afternoon today, tonight, or tomorrow to get this done.  Democrats are ready to pass it right now if the majority leader would  call it up for a vote.                            ____________________     As trade negotiations with China continue this week, I  want to press the President again to stay tough and hold out for the  best possible deal. If China is unwilling to make significant reforms  to its economic model, President Trump must be prepared to walk away.   I believe the President's instincts on China are right. I have not  been afraid to say so, despite our vast political and moral  disagreements. But if we are going to be successful in these  negotiations, it will be up to President Trump--no one else--to keep  the pressure on Chinese leaders this week.   There are a few things he can do. The most significant point of  emphasis for the President should be Huawei, the Chinese telecom giant.  China has responded to the administration's justified restrictions on  Huawei, unlike any other action the President has taken. It is our  greatest source of leverage.   President Trump, hold tough on Huawei. Don't let there be giant  loopholes.   I am told that under the purported proposal being talked about, 80  percent of Huawei's products could still be sold to us. If we have a  total boycott of Huawei, then China will beg us to come to the table  and make real concessions. It is the best leverage we have--even better  than the tariffs. China wants Huawei to dominate the world. They will  find a way to do it unless we are tough as can be.   I say to President Trump: I know these multinational corporations are  pressuring you to cut a quick deal. The President should not listen to  these big corporations who want him to cut a deal quickly. Many of  these same corporations are the ones that have shipped jobs overseas  through the last decades. They are the ones that took jobs away from  American workers and moved them to China. I understand those corporate  executives. They are supposed to be totally subservient to their  shareholders. Their shareholders say: Whatever you have to do to bring  the price up, do it.   That hurts American workers. It hurts American security. It hurts the  American economy, especially when it comes to Huawei.   President Trump, don't listen to the siren call of those same  corporations that have created part of the problem with China to now  get you to back off. Yes, they will have a little pain. They have made  billions at large from dealing with China and letting China get away  with stuff like taking jobs away from the United States into much lower  paid, lower standard jobs in China.  [[Page S5209]]    Trade negotiations with China are far too important to the future of  American business and American workers to sacrifice just because a  handful of American corporations are worried about their quarterly  profits. Their quarterly profits are nothing compared to America  maintaining its technological dominance, its technological superiority  that China keeps trying to steal from us, in some ways legitimate, in  many ways not.   Another point of emphasis for the President's team--this is one the  President cares less about, but that is OK--is China's human rights  record. China released a new policy outlining the use of force against  Hong Kong's protest. Its military built up forces along the border. We  have seen this movie before at Tiananmen. It was a horror movie--one  that resulted in hundreds, if not thousands, of unarmed Chinese  citizens being mercilessly slaughtered by their own Army under the  direction of the Chinese Communist Party. We cannot have a sequel to  this atrocity. The administration should push back against China's  militarism and stand up for the autonomy and democratic rights of Hong  Kong citizens.   I have read some of these columns where they say: Can't we get along?  We can't get along because, first, China doesn't play fair and has  stolen trillions of dollars and millions of jobs from America and seeks  to keep doing it. They have been duping our Presidents, pushing them  around, making agreements, and breaking them. Second, we can't get  along with China because of what it does to its citizens--the Uighurs  in Western China and now the citizens of Hong Kong.   What we have seen with China is that when we are tough and strong,  they back off. When we show any glimmer of weakness--as we are showing  in floating a deal, a lessening of the restrictions on Huawei--they  take advantage.   Let me say this to all of those in this administration who are urging  the President to back off on Huawei and let them buy some of our  products. There is a bipartisan group here in this Senate who will work  very hard to prevent that from happening legislatively. The most likely  vehicle is the NDAA. I think we will get broad support from Democrats  and Republicans in the House and Senate. So to those in the  administration who are trying to back off, don't even try it.                            ____________________     Looking back on this work period, it is a shame that the  Senate, once again, has made no progress--none--on the issue of  election security.   Only a week ago, Special Counsel Mueller called Russia interference  one of the greatest threats to democracy he has seen in his career, a  threat that he said continues ``as we sit here.''   Despite Mueller's warning--a warning echoed by prominent Republicans,  Trump appointees, such as FBI Director Wray, Director Coats, and our  entire Senate Intelligence Committee led by Richard Burr, a colleague  of ours--Leader McConnell has not brought election security to the  floor. In fact, he has blocked Democratic requests for a debate on  election security, dismissing our ideas as a ``partisan wish list.''  That is political rhetoric to avoid a problem that shouldn't be  partisan at all.   Using paper ballots is not partisan. Making sure that our election  machines are safe from hacking is not partisan. Giving the States  resources to better manage their elections is not partisan. That is  American. Our elections are sacrosanct and these are commonsense,  widely agreed-upon reforms that will make our elections safer,  particularly in this dangerous new world where powers that have malice  toward the United States--Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea--can use  new technology to reach into our election structure.   This is not 1940 or even 2005. We need to strengthen our election  security, and it should not be a partisan issue. When Leader McConnell  calls it a partisan issue, he is ducking to avoid it for reasons  unknown to almost anybody.   Recent Republican opposition to election security has been  disappointing. I say to my Republican colleagues: Where are you? Why  aren't you telling the Republican leader that we ought to do something?  Every one of our Republicans is complicit when Leader McConnell blocks  election security because they could join with us. If they began to  join with us, my guess is that Leader McConnell might put some  legislation on the floor. We want to debate it. We want to discuss it.  Leader McConnell and our Republican colleagues may not exactly agree  with our ideas--although many are bipartisan--but we should at least  bring things to the floor, discuss them, and get something done.  Unfortunately, we don't see much action.    It was precisely a year ago that the Democrats last sought to secure  funding for election security when the Senate Republicans voted down  our amendments. Unfortunately, it appears that Leader McConnell will  not take action before the August work period. Yet I assure the  American people and Leader McConnell that this issue is not going away.  The Democrats will press for election security when we return and again  when the Senate debates appropriations bills.   This is about protecting the wellspring of our democracy, the  vitality of our democracy, and the sacrosanct nature of our democracy.  To call it political demeans everything. Young men and young women from  Bunker Hill on--for hundreds of years--have died to protect our  elections. You have to protect them in a different way now with there  being technology and cyber threats, but the idea of protecting them  burns just as brightly in the American heart, and Leader McConnell is  somehow impervious to all of that.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on climate, I am pleased to share that  the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works did something  amazing and groundbreaking yesterday. It passed the first ever climate  title in a transportation reauthorization bill.   Thanks to the Senate Democrats on the committee and to particularly  Ranking Member Carper's hard work, the highway bill actually includes  $10 billion that will be dedicated to climate-focused programs and  policies in order to reduce emissions and improve the resiliency of our  transportation infrastructure to climate change and natural disasters.  It includes funds for States to reduce carbon emissions, support for  electric and alternative-fuel vehicles, reductions in emissions from  ports and roadways, and investments in climate-resistant  infrastructure.   Less than a year ago, I said, in moving forward, the Democrats would  demand that climate change be addressed in any infrastructure bill.  This bill, with its $10 billion investment in climate, is a product of  that demand. This will be the first time serious money has been  included in an infrastructure package to fight climate change, but it  certainly will not be the last.   The clock is ticking when it comes to climate change. We need to make  progress whenever we can and as quickly as we can. If the Republican  leader will not bring legislation to the floor, the Democrats will be  prepared to take the lead and fight for climate progress at every  opportunity we get. That is precisely what this $10 billion climate  investment in the highway bill represents. Again, I thank Senator  Carper for his leadership, his skill, and his persistence in getting it  done.   Protecting our country and the world from the threat of climate  change is no less than a moral obligation. When we return from the  recess, the Democrats will continue to look for more opportunities to  make progress on climate change.                            ____________________     Mr. President, finally, during the debate last night,  when it came to healthcare, half of the Democratic Presidential field  engaged in a healthy debate, a great deal of which was focused on the  No. 1 issue to American voters--healthcare.   Despite different policy proposals, the debate shows that the  Democratic Party is completely united on the idea of universal  healthcare coverage as well as on the need to lower the costs and  improve the quality of healthcare for every American. Yet one point  that should have been made during the debate but unfortunately wasn't  should  [[Page S5210]]  have been the fact that the Republicans are actively sabotaging our  current healthcare system.   Whether you are one of the more moderate Members on healthcare or are  one of the ones who have a more broad, more sweeping proposal, it is  the difference between the parties. Yet those differences almost pale  compared to the differences between every Democrat on that platform and  the Republicans, because the Republicans are seeking to undo  healthcare, to sabotage healthcare, and to have fewer people covered.  As a result of their ideas, thoughts, and lawsuits, costs are going up.   There is a huge gap between the parties on healthcare, and I am glad  we are having an active debate on how to move forward to cover more  people and have it cost less. While we are doing that, the Trump  administration is doing the opposite. It is expanding junk insurance  plans, reducing funds to help Americans locate and sign up for the  right insurance, and ending cost-sharing payments that help low-income  families afford care.   The congressional Republicans have tried and have, thankfully, failed  to repeal the Affordable Care Act. The coup de grace, of course, is the  fact that now the Trump administration--with the support of many  Republican attorneys general and the complicity of just about every  Member of the Senate on the Republican side--is supporting a lawsuit  that would invalidate the Affordable Care Act entirely, which would  kick tens of millions off of their insurance and eliminate the  protections for preexisting conditions for the over 100 million  Americans who have those preexisting conditions, and just about every  Republican is going along with that.   The difference in the 2020 elections between the Democrats and the  Republicans on healthcare will be apparent and glaring, and it will far  and away subsume any differences we may have on policy.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
