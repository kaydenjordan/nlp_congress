 Madam President, there was such an interesting  occurrence that happened down the street a bit at 1600 Pennsylvania  Avenue last weekend, and it is when White House Press Secretary Jen  Psaki unveiled the scheme that her colleagues in the West Wing had  worked out with Big Tech.   Well, what they are setting about to do is to remove--and I am  quoting her--``problematic'' content from Facebook and other digital  platforms. That is right. They, the White House team, have decided that  they are going to work with Big Tech, and they are going to remove  ``problematic''--their term--content from Facebook and other digital  platforms.   Now, I am certain that the White House was very confident that the  press would treat this rather bizarre admission like they have treated  other blatant oversteps coming out of this administration. After all,  they, the press, have provided reliable cover for this White House  since Inauguration Day.   But here is the problem. It is no longer Inauguration Day. There is  now a record to consider, and I will tell you what, no matter what they  do, the mainstream media is not going to be able to turn the clock back  on this overstep.   In just 6 months, the Biden administration has done an admirable job  showing the American people exactly who they are. We have seen enough  at this point to take the admission of being in cahoots with Big Tech  at face value. The administration has intentionally overwhelmed the  airwaves with big promises that are conveniently light on details.   And there is a good reason for that. What President Biden and the  Democrats are trying to do would fundamentally transform this country  into something that we, the people, would have a very difficult time  even recognizing.   They got off to a great start toward their goals by killing jobs in  the name of climate extremism and opening the border to a flood of  illegal immigrants with no plan at all to manage the influx. They just  said: Let's send them to the States, and let local communities and  States cover this cost.   They tried to dupe the American people into getting behind a so- called infrastructure plan that was anything but infrastructure. Then  they doubled down on a brazen attempt to extend the Federal  Government's control over schools and homes. They labeled this spending  spree the American Families Plan to provide cover for yet another  attack on, what else, the nuclear family.   Then they launched an all-out war on the ballot box in the name of  the people. And now we see that they worked out a perfect system to  force the opposition to shut up--just throw a flag on your opponents  and watch their digital footprint and their freedom of speech  evaporate.   There is a way to shut them down. It is called government-approved  messaging. Obviously, somewhere in the White House, they tucked their  realities that they alluded to back in January, and now this is what we  are seeing.   I know we already have members of the mainstream media who are  running defense on behalf of this little collaboration between the  White House and Big Tech, but it is time to get serious about what is  going on here. The President of the United States is using the full  force of his administration to silence his political opponents. That is  correct.   This isn't just dystopian. It also raises serious questions about how  much pressure the Federal Government can put on a private entity to  restrict political speech. Think about that. This administration,  working with Big Tech, is going to deem certain messages government  approved and others as being open to censorship. It is, indeed, a  complete violation of the trust the American people put in Joe Biden  when they sent him to the White House.   But as the new majority has made clear, to tear down and rebuild the  United States in their own image is something that is a goal. And in  order to do that, they attack the foundation. They have to get rid of  all the things that make America so incredibly special: our commitment  to safety and security, the importance of the family, and the near  sacrosanct promise of free speech and open debate.   They have gotten off to a pretty good start, those Democrats. But for  their vision to take hold, the Democratic majority must convince a  critical mass of their countrymen to adopt their same narrow viewpoint.  Fortunately, the American people are not accustomed to doing what they  are told simply because an authority figure said go do it.   Here is a quote that former President Reagan made regularly, and I  know we have heard it and seen it on this floor several times so far  this year:         Freedom is never more than one generation away from       extinction. It has to be fought for and defended by each       generation.    That is so important for us to remember. It is important because it  is something that we are seeing really kind of lived out right now. We  have to take this as something of a warning when you look at the steps  that this administration is taking. If anything, they are taking big  steps to see just how far they can push the limits of democracy: How  much will the people take? How much freedom are they willing to give  up?   Just about every single policy coming out of this White House has  been used by the Democrats as a weapon to diminish freedom in the name  of a preapproved socialist fantasy. And in that fantasy, there is no  room for free speech or dissent. Censorship becomes normalized. It is  expected. Collectivism replaces individualism. The philosophies of  democracy and self-determination fall victim to the moving goalposts of  a living Constitution, and freedom is reduced to an outdated trope that  only the unenlightened cling to.   I wonder, how many people in this country do you think actually have  that as a goal? How many do you think are wanting to give up their free  speech and their freedom and hand it over to the government and let the  government decide what they are going to give back to them, how much  freedom they are going to allow them to exercise over their daily life,  over their children's education, over the education that they want to  have, or the job they want to have, or the home they want to live in,  or the car that they want to drive? Do you really think that Americans  want to give their freedom up?   Since the 2016 election, the left has existed in a state of perpetual  hysteria. It has been over the threat that our God-given freedom poses  threats to their radical, socialist agenda. But instead of taking the  conventional route of persuasion, they chose a high-pressure guilt  campaign to force people into a prepackaged American experience. They  want everyone marching in line with the daily talking points because we  want calm, they say. Democracy is too messy. It is too unpredictable.  No one wants to exist in that system, they say.   But I differ in my opinion. Yes, it is messy, but this big,  beautiful, diverse mess is what sets this country apart. It makes us  strong and successful and unites us under the common cause of freedom.  And as we are all well aware, it has also turned this shining city on a  hill into a magnet for criticism from nations foundering under the  disastrous consequences of their great socialist experiment.   I would implore my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to stop  trying to fit in with these failing systems. Stop diminishing the cause  of freedom because it inconveniences you. Abandon your fear of open  debate. This constant refusal to engage says much more about the  strength of your policy positions than it does about ours. Above all,  stop ignoring the American people. They didn't vote for this. They do  not want this.   It is so interesting to me every weekend to go home and listen to  Tennesseans who talk about the changes  [[Page S4945]]  that they have seen in the Democratic Party and the policies that are  coming forward that they are rejecting because they do not want to give  up their freedom. They are willing to fight for their freedom so that  their children and their grandchildren know the promises of the  American dream and have the opportunity to live their lives in freedom.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
