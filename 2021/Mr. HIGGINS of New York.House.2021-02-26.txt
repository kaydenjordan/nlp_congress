 Mr. Speaker, the American Rescue Plan is  bold action needed to meet this defining moment.   Seventy-six percent of Americans are rooting for its passage: direct  payments to Americans; help for teachers and students, to return both  of them to the classroom; help for neighborhood restaurants to reopen  and to recover; help for local and State governments; and billions for  vaccine making and distribution.   Wall Street or Main Street has always been a false choice. This is  about the neighborhood streets and the homes where real families live  and struggle every day to give their kids a fighting chance.   Mr. Speaker, give their kids a fighting chance. Let the recovery  begin.
