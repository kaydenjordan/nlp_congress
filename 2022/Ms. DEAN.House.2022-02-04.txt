 Mr. Speaker, for decades we have heard elected officials  rightfully decry the loss of American jobs, and then promise to bring  them back.   And for generations Americans have waited for that promise. Here is  the chance.   Since January 2000, the United States has lost over a quarter of all  domestic manufacturing jobs. That means a decline of more than 4.7  million jobs in just two decades.   Real people have paid the consequences. I have seen it in my own  district, suburban Philadelphia; in places like Pottstown, Boyertown,  Norristown that have lost manufacturing jobs and opportunities.   The America COMPETES Act is a chance to revitalize these and other  communities as well as to strengthen our national security. Here are  some highlights:   $52 billion to maintain and expand our production of semiconductor  chips right here at home, which run our cars, phones, computers,  healthcare system;   $45 billion to improve our supply chains, with a special focus on  producing more of our critical goods here; and   Investments in scientific research and innovation so that we are not  only in this century but we are globally leading it.   This bipartisan legislation should be an easy ``yes'' for everyone in  this Chamber and everyone in the Senate to pass. The America COMPETES  Act is not a political win. It is a win for America.                            ____________________
