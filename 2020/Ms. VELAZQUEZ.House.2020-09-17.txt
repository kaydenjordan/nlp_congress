 Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of House  Resolution 908, which condemns the anti-Asian rhetoric that has arisen  because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Madam Speaker, our Asian friends,  neighbors and family members have been unfairly targeted by bigotry in  the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Using terms like the ``China Virus''  and ``Kung Flu'' is offensive to the communities I represent in the  Lower East Side and Brooklyn. Our friends and neighbors in these  communities are essential workers and small business owners who  provided critical services to our community as the pandemic raged  across New York City, and continue to play an essential role in our  city's recovery from the virus. Unfortunately, New York City has seen a  spike in bias crimes. We cannot let hate crimes go unpunished, let  alone condone them.   As the resolution states, there are over 2 million Asian Americans  and Pacific Islanders  [[Page H4508]]  working on the frontline combatting against the pandemic. We must stand  in solidarity with our friends and neighbors by denouncing the vitriol  and anti-Asian sentiment. Our response to this pandemic should have  been a unifying moment for our country. Instead, the administration has  actively sought to inflame racial tensions. Today, we say ``no more''  to the anti-Asian rhetoric from the White House. I am proud to  cosponsor this bill and I want to thank my colleague from New York  Representative Grace Meng, for her leadership on this issue and urge  all my colleagues to support its passage.
