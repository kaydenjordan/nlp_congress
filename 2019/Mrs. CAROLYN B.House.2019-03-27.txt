 MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong  support of the rule and the underlying bill, and I particularly thank  my colleague, Rosa DeLauro, for decades of work in support of H.R. 7.   In 1963, Congress passed the Equal Pay for Equal Work Act prohibiting  an employer from paying men and women different wages for the same  work. It helped, but 56 years later, the typical woman working full- time year-round is still paid only 80 cents for every dollar paid to  her male coworker. That amounts to more than $10,000 each year.   The gap is even worse for women of color. African American women make  only 61 percent of a White man's earnings. Native American women make  just 58 percent, and Latina women a mere 53 percent.   But let's be clear. Pay discrimination doesn't just hurt women. It  hurts entire families and the overall economy. Women are the sole or  primary breadwinners in half of U.S. households with children. So  passing this bill would not just help women and families, it would help  our entire economy. According to some estimates, equal pay could cut  poverty among working women and their families by more than half and  add over half a trillion dollars to the U.S. economy.   The Paycheck Fairness Act is simple and straightforward. It protects  all employees' right to free speech by ending the unfair prohibitions  that can make it a firing offense for someone to simply tell a coworker  how much they make. It strengthens workers' ability to challenge  gender-based wage discrimination.   It is long overdue, and it is fair. When women succeed, America  succeeds, and our overall economy succeeds.
