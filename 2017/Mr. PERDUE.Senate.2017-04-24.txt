 Mr. President, I rise tonight to speak briefly about our  new Secretary of Agriculture, my first cousin Sonny Perdue. I grew up  with this man. I probably know too much about him, but we won't go  there tonight. He grew up on a farm. He became a doctor of veterinary  medicine and served in the Air Force. He had an ag business for the  past 40 years. He and I have been in business together. I have seen his  integrity, and I have seen his responsibility all my life.   He is the first Republican Governor in over 135 years in our State in  Georgia--just 15 years ago now, I guess. He served two terms. He  created the Commission for a New Georgia, and he started an economic  development focus in our State that has carried on for the last 15  years and has yielded the fact that our State today, by independent  reports, is the best State in the country in which to do business.   Tonight, he has been confirmed as our next Secretary of Agriculture.  I could not be more proud for him, for our family, and, most  importantly, for our country. I want to be the first in this august  body to call my cousin Sonny Perdue by his new title: Mr. Secretary.   I believe he is an outstanding candidate. I want to commend the  President of the United States for his nomination. I think this is  further evidence that this President, Donald J. Trump, is building an  outstanding Cabinet with which to change the direction of our country,  to get this economy going, to put America back to work again, to  reengage internationally, and develop a fair and level playing field  for the rest of the world economically.   As Secretary of Agriculture, my cousin has a big job, and he has a  big responsibility. I look forward to working with him as a member of  the Senate Agriculture Committee to make our agricultural and farming  and ranching industries vigorous and strong now and for future  generations.   I yield the floor.
