 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the lives of those  who fought and those who died so valiantly during the attacks at Pearl  Harbor. On December 7, 78 years ago, the unthinkable happened. Our  Nation was attacked in one of the most horrific events we have ever  endured on our own soil. That day that will live in infamy also  compelled the United States to enter the second World War.   The bombs that destroyed the USS Arizona, 169 aircraft, and most of  our Pacific fleet, rocked the Nation to its core. The attack killed  almost 2,500 servicemembers plus 49 civilians and wounded 1,200 more.  They were sons and daughters, they were brothers and sisters, and above  all, they were heroes.   And today we stand with those who lost family and friends, and we  stand with the heroes who have defended and those who continue to  defend our freedoms today and our way of life. We must never forget,  and we must always honor their sacrifice.                            ____________________
