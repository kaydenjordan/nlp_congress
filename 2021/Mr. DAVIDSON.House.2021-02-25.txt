 Mr. Speaker, the so-called Equality Act is not about  tolerance. It seeks to impose the will of this body on the American  people in violation of the Constitution.   It establishes a woke heresy code, seeking to eliminate distinctions  between male and female at every level. It cancels women's and girls'  sports, requiring that biological males compete for their records,  championships, and scholarships.   It nullifies the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. Rather than  preserve the constitutionally protected freedom to disagree, disguised  as equality, it compels participation on your terms for abortions,  weddings, and all of religious, vocational, and civic life. It pursues  what Hillary Clinton said in 2016: You will just have to change your  doctrine.   Let me assure you, that will not happen. Colleagues, we must defend  freedom and defeat this bill.
