 Mr. Chair, I rise to speak up for the people of Guam, who  are facing immediate danger from the Chinese and North Korean missiles.  China's DF-26 missiles has been dubbed the Guam Killer.   Also, North Korea repeatedly threatens my island, and our American  defense systems cannot simultaneously track or shoot down missiles from  two directions at once.   Let's also be mindful of the fact that servicemembers from across the  Nation serve on Guam and face similar peril.   I urge my colleagues to support my amendment with the safety of your  constituents in mind. Please vote to protect the people of Guam and  vote in favor of my amendment to truly fund Guam missile defense.
