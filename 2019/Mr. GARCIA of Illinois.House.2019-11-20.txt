 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to honor the  memory of my dear friend Tom Vasquez, who passed away on July 23. Tom  was one of the founders of our progressive movement in Chicago, and we  were partners in many battles.   He was born in Matamoros, Mexico, and eventually found his way to  Chicago, settling in the working-class community of Little Village. In  the early 1980s, Tom was part of a group of young people who saw the  disparities and lack of political representation in our community and  sought to address these inequalities.   He stepped up, led the change, and helped create the Independent  Political Organization of the 22nd Ward. He was a precinct captain for  many years. He organized block clubs and he was involved in schools in  the local community. On election day, he was always getting people to  the polling places. He attended many community meetings and mentored  many young people in the community. He did this all while holding a  full-time job with the Chicago Transit Authority and being a member of  a local union.   Tom's passing has left a gap not only for his family but for the  entire community that benefited from his service and commitment to  justice.   Tom, may you rest in peace.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, before I begin, I ask  unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to  revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on the  subject of the Special Order.    Madam Speaker, first of all, I would like to  thank Representative Pressley for dedicating this time in honor of the  Transgender Day of Remembrance and, of course, naming many of the  victims of violence who have met this fate simply for being who they  are. As a member of the Equality Caucus, I am proud to call her my  colleague and my friend.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Green).    Madam Speaker, tonight, we find ourselves at  a troubling time for all workers across the country: Income and wealth  inequality are at an all-time high, and union representation is at a  historic low. These facts mean that all workers have a harder time  making ends meet.   It is time to reset the balance of power in our economy between  working people and corporate interests.   For decades, collective bargaining rights have been under relentless  assault, especially by the Republican Party, in an effort to disempower  working people and hand our democracy to corporate America. Tonight, I  am proud to bring together my colleagues from the Congressional  Progressive Caucus and our friends to talk about the PRO Act.   The Protecting the Right to Organize Act is a landmark step to  restore the rights of working people to join unions and collectively  fight for fair wages and working conditions.   The PRO Act rebalances the scales between workers and corporations by  enacting strong enforcement measures against employers who violate  labor laws, strengthening the right to negotiate and organize unions,  and empowering workers to report abuses of their rights.   I thank my colleagues for joining me to stand up for workers and  their right to organize.   I also want to recognize the true creators of wealth in our economy,  the working men and women of America.   To begin tonight's deeper conversation, I call on a person who  represents a district that has been at the heart of growing the economy  and driving the economy for average Americans over a long period of  time. He comes from trade union organizing and represents an  overwhelmingly working-class district in the great State of Michigan.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Levin).    Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Scott,  who, of course, is also the Chair of the Education and Labor Committee.  Part of the reason why he knows so much about the bill is he happens to  be the bill's chief sponsor.   Mr. Speaker, we are going to hear from another part of the country,  and  [[Page H9114]]  we are going to the West Coast to get a better understanding of why  representatives in this House from all over the country are uniting  behind this important piece of legislation.   Next, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. Takano), who is a  member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus and also chairs the  Committee on Veterans' Affairs of the U.S. Congress.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  California. Before we go to the East Coast and hear the voices of  working people there and why they support the PRO Act, I would like to  share with you a brief story about myself in Chicago.   When I was growing up in Chicago, both of my parents were proud union  members. In fact, they were both Teamsters. My father worked at a cold  storage facility, and my mother worked at a candy factory on Chicago's  West Side. Both relied on their union jobs to raise our family, and  they retired on their union pensions, which enabled them to purchase a  comfortable home for their family.   There will be more stories from Chicago, but right now I would like  to go to the East Coast and hear from another member of the Progressive  Caucus. He hails from the State of New Jersey. I yield to the gentleman  from New Jersey (Mr. Norcross).    I thank the gentleman from New Jersey for  sharing that wonderful story.   Women in this body overwhelmingly support the PRO Act for good  reason. The PRO Act would help level the playing field and move all of  us toward a greater sense of economic justice.   This evening, we are very fortunate to hear from a voice also from  the East Coast who will get to the crux of why this is such an  important tool for economic justice in our country. She is a member of  the Progressive Caucus of this body and someone who is passionate and  compassionate about providing equal opportunity for everyone in our  country.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs. Watson  Coleman).    Mr. Speaker, if I could inquire how much time  is remaining in the Special Order hour?    Before I introduce and as a prelude to the  remarks that we will hear from the following speaker, I would like to  share a story about the great city that I hail from and the great State  that I represent here, the State of Illinois. It has a proud labor  history that is filled with stories of courage and sacrifice by workers  striving to organize.   Since the 1800s, workers organized in mines and factories fighting  the abuses of powerful industrial interests. Chicago earned the  reputation as a city of big shoulders, a working-class and hardworking  city. Workers were killed in the Haymarket massacre of 1886, a struggle  that led to the 8-hour day and the end of child labor.   The country's first national strike started in Chicago when train  workers across the country joined a strike that began in Pullman,  Illinois. Federal troops were sent in to break up the Pullman Strike,  but it was so significant that Congress created Labor Day shortly  afterward.   One of the Nation's most deadly mine disasters happened in Illinois  in 1909. The tragedy prompted better enforcement of child labor laws  and advanced the movement for workers' compensation.   Working people joining forces in unions helped lift up all workers  across the country.   With that opening remark, Mr. Speaker, I would like to yield next to  the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Pocan), who also happens to be one of  the cochairs of the Congressional Progressive Caucus.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  Wisconsin for his remarks.   So what is the essence of the Protect the Right to Organize Act? We  have heard from my colleagues today about the many ways that unions  have made America strong. From the 8-hour day to building the middle  class, we have a lot to thank the labor movement for. Unions are an  integral part of increasing wages and addressing income inequality.   Still, special interest-funded attacks on labor laws have eroded  union membership for years. For too long, greedy companies have used  extreme measures to stop working people from exercising their right to  join together and negotiate for their rights and their working  conditions.   While the economy is working very well for the wealthy, our middle  class continues to shrink. The cause is simple: policy choices,  especially by Republicans in the House at this time, in the Senate, in  State legislatures, and the Presidency that have stripped workers of  the power to stand together.   The Protecting the Right to Organize Act is a historical proposal  that restores fairness in the economy by strengthening the Federal laws  to protect workers' rights to organize.   We need the PRO Act at a time when Trump wages war against the labor  movement. We need the PRO Act to build an economy that works for all  working families and not just the wealthy.   The lessons I learned from unions--that individual justice is only as  good as collective justice--continue to inform my career in public  service, and I hope every worker can have the opportunities that unions  gave me.   I got a chance to work at a young age. I joined a union. It helped me  pay for my college education. I did well in the community that I still  live in. That is why I approach banding together for the welfare of  working people.   Tonight, you have heard from people from coast to coast, all over our  country, from the South and from the heartland. These are individuals  who are fighting for working people to, again, level the playing field  and create a real purpose of economic justice to lift everyone up in  our country.   As we move forward with the PRO Act, I call upon the American public  to understand that it is time for economic justice and it is time for  prosperity for all. And, with that, I ask them to call on their  Representatives in the U.S. Congress to make this law a reality for all  working men and women across the Nation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
