 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for yielding to me  this evening and being here with other colleagues because we know, and  we have said over and over again, that we face public health and  economic crises unlike any that our country has seen in a generation.   More than 245,000 Americans have died of COVID-19. Tens of millions  are out of work. And we know how communities of color have suffered  acutely and disproportionately.   While we have known about some of these issues in the past, about the  inequities in our healthcare system, in our economy, this virus has  exposed and shone a light on the depths of the injustices and  inequities that exist for communities of color. While we need to fight  the virus, we need to fight the virus of injustice.   In my home State of Connecticut, as of last Thursday, Black people  accounted for more than 14.5 percent of Connecticut's COVID-related  deaths when they are just 12 percent of the population.   Mr. Speaker, 18 percent of COVID cases are Hispanic, outpacing the 17  percent they make up of our State's population.   Yet, this data is not perfect, which is why I have been so proud to  work with my friend and my colleague, Congresswoman Barbara Lee, to  require the Health and Human Services agency and the Centers for  Disease Control and Prevention to provide Congress with the data on  which communities are bearing the worst impacts so that we can make  sure that testing--once we have an administration that takes testing  strategy seriously--is focused on those communities and that they get  the resources they need going forward.    My colleague from California, Congresswoman Lee, has been  indefatigable in questioning the issue of the data that we have on  communities of color, and she did this long before we probably could  spell ``coronavirus.'' To be frank, it is frustrating that we even had  to put this requirement into law.   The CDC is complying with the reporting, but we keep a vigilant eye  on that information. We have more work to do to ensure that we have  complete data.   Through November 12, 47 percent of cases had unknown race and  ethnicity in the CDC's surveillance system. That is just not good  enough. This moment demands the boldest possible efforts to secure  affordable healthcare, to address the deep racial disparities exposed  by this virus, to help families.   I am proud to chair this subcommittee, which has been central to our  response to this pandemic and the disparities that it has exposed.  Together, my colleagues on the committee and on this subcommittee, we  have appropriated $280 billion in emergency funding for education, for  health, for working people throughout the pandemic. Through the good  offices of my colleagues, Congresswoman Lee and Congresswoman Bass, we  inserted language that would focus on the issue of disparities and how  we address them. We could add $400 million in the latest iteration of  The Heroes Act.                                time  2030    Yet the United States Senate has refused to do anything to help  struggling Americans and get us to a place where we can test everyone,  that we can do contact tracing, and that we can provide treatment.   We know more is needed. So, as I mentioned, the House has passed two  additional relief packages, and we looked at boosting SNAP benefits by  15 percent; expanding access to paid leave and paid sick days; and  expanding and improving the child tax credit for one-third of our  children, which includes half of Black and Hispanic children, who are  currently left behind because their families earn too little. If we do  not address the virus, we will not be able to do anything about turning  our economy around.   Let me say a thank-you to Congresswoman Barbara Lee, who has been a  tireless champion for communities of color, for organizing this Special  Order. She and I, along with others, are committed to bringing to bear  the full weight of the Federal Government for the communities of color,  not only in my district, but around the country, because together we  can and we must do better. People's lives are depending on it.   We know what we need to do to save lives. It is incomprehensible that  we can't get to a protocol which allows us to save people's lives and  those in communities of color, which are affected the most.
