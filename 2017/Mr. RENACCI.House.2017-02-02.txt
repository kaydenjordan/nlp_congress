 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Sam Johnson of Texas for  his work on this important resolution and his many years of service to  our country.   Mr. Speaker, in the final weeks of President Obama's final term, the  Social Security Administration finalized a rule that flat out  discriminates against millions of individuals with disabilities by  denying them their Second Amendment rights.   But it gets worse. Not only does the rule place these innocent  individuals' names in the National Instant Criminal Background Check  System, it does so in a way that strips them of their due process.  Specifically, it would subject these people to a very timely appeals  process requiring them to prove their own innocence before their name  could be removed.   In other words, this rule turns due process on its head by shifting  the burden of proof from the government to the individual to ensure  their constitutional right is not stripped away.   Moreover, as a member of the Social Security subcommittee, I am very  concerned that this rule falls way outside the bounds of the Social  Security Administration's mission. Instead of using the Social Security  administrator's field office staff to help Ohioans manage and  understand their benefits, this rule diverts resources away from that  core mission toward one that is constitutionally suspect.   That is why I am proud to be an original cosponsor of Chairman Sam  Johnson of Texas' resolution that protects Americans' Second Amendment  rights and protects Americans with disabilities, their constitutional  right, to due process under the law.   I urge my colleagues to support this joint resolution of disapproval.
