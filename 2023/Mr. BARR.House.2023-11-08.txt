 Mr. Chair, I thank Mr. Womack, chairman of the Financial  Services and General Government Subcommittee, not only for his  leadership but his rabid support of the Razorbacks. Kentucky and  Arkansas have a big rivalry in basketball, but in this case we are on  the same page because the chairman has rightly included in this year's  FSGG appropriations bill my legislation, H.R. 1382, the Taking Account  of Bureaucrats' Spending Act, or the TABS Act, which would separate the  Consumer Financial Protection Bureau from the Federal Reserve System,  make it an independent agency and subject it, importantly, to the  congressional appropriations process.   The TABS Act would remedy the serious constitutional defect in the  structure of the CFPB as established by the Dodd-Frank Act under which  the CFPB draws its funding uniquely from the Federal Reserve instead of  from Congress, like most other executive branch agencies. Specifically,  Dodd-Frank delegates to the Director of the CFPB the unilateral power  to decide in perpetuity how much money he wants for the agency to carry  out its broad and potent regulatory and enforcement powers.   The Director then requests such amount from the Fed, which is itself  exempt from the congressional appropriations process, making it double  insulated from accountability. The Fed is then required to provide such  amount to the Bureau, no questions asked. This is a constitutional  aberration, and it is a violation of the separation of powers.   Although the total amount the Director can request is capped in the  law, the cap is so high that it effectively grants the CFPB Director  unfettered discretion over the Bureau's amount of funding and how it is  spent. No other Federal agency in the entire Federal bureaucracy is  funded in this manner. Indeed, there is no analogue for the CFPB  anywhere in the history of the U.S. executive branch.   Even among self-funded agencies, the Bureau is unique. It is a  perpetual self-directed, double-insulated funding structure that goes a  significant step further than that enjoyed by any other agency, again,  in the history of our Republic.   The TABS Act would fix this. It would bring much-needed  accountability to the CFPB and uphold the Constitution's separation of  powers and the exclusive grants of the appropriations power to  Congress.   I want to make a couple of points about the TABS Act. First, the  purpose of this bill is not to repeal or undermine consumer protection  laws. Rather, the purpose is to address the constitutional defect in  the CFPB's funding structure. No one is objecting to the utility of  some Federal consumer protections, but we should also agree that the  Constitution reserves to Congress the sole authority to set funding  limits for the CFPB and other executive branch agencies.    I note that the FY24 FSGG bill would fund the CFPB at near current  levels. I also note that H.R. 2798, the CFPB Transparency and  Accountability Reform Act, which was marked up out of the Financial  Services Committee on April 26, included the TABS Act, and authorized  to be appropriated from unobligated amounts contained in the Consumer  Financial Civil Penalty Fund $650 million for FY24--again, at levels  comparable to what the CFPB received from the Fed this year.   My friends on the other side of the aisle can't make the argument  that we are trying to defund the agency, that we are trying to gut  consumer protection laws because we are manifestly proving we are not  doing that. We are funding the agency the way it should be. This  clearly demonstrates that the TABS Act is not about eliminating  consumer protections or the CFPB, but it is about upholding the  Constitution. It is about defending the Congress, this institution.   If this bill is enacted into law, the Bureau would continue to  operate. The only difference would be that the Congress would oversee  their spending in the same way it does for all other consumer  protection agencies in most of the rest of the Federal Government.                                time  1000    As you know, the Supreme Court recently heard the case of Community  Financial Services Association of America v. CFPB in which the agency's  funding structure was challenged as violating the Constitution's  separation of powers and the appropriations clause, which provides  that: ``No money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence  of Appropriations made by law . . . ''   If the Supreme Court strikes down the CFPB's funding structure, as it  should in this case, this bill will ensure that the agency continues to  operate.   Following such a decision by the Court, chaos would not ensue, as  some have suggested, nor would there be great uncertainty in the  marketplace about the status of consumer protection laws and  regulations.   On the contrary, this legislation demonstrates that Congress is  prepared to assert its appropriations power to stabilize preexisting  consumer laws and make sure that the CFPB is funded with better and  more meaningful oversight in the event that the Supreme Court strikes  down the funding mechanism.   The Founding Fathers wanted to make sure that the legislative  branch--the people's elected Representatives in Congress--make the key  decisions about our government, especially how tax dollars are spent.   As Madison wrote in Federalist Paper No. 58: ``This power over the  purse may, in fact, be regarded as the most complete and effectual  weapon with which any constitution can arm the immediate  representatives of the people, for obtaining a redress of every  grievance, and for carrying into effect every just and salutary  measure.''   This is a sound principle, which in the context of the CFPB or any  other executive branch agency, every member of Congress, Republican and  Democrat, should defend.   This is not a partisan issue. This is about defending this  institution and our power of the purse. I ask my friends on the other  side of the aisle: If Congress passed legislation funding the  Department of Defense or the CIA in the same manner as the CFPB is  currently funded, would that be acceptable? Would we want those  agencies to be completely unaccountable to our oversight?   The appropriations process is the primary means by which Congress, on  a bipartisan basis, oversees those agencies, as well as all consumer  protection agencies.   Now, some will say that Congress can change the CFPB's funding  structure at any time so there is really no problem with the structure.  Well, this is ridiculous. This is absurd.   Our Constitution does not permit elected Representatives in Congress  to delegate away our authority, which is textually reserved to the  Congress, to some other branch of government or an executive branch  official. It requires that the key decisions remain in the hands of the  elected Representatives of the people.   Congress cannot delegate away its responsibilities without  undermining the separation of powers, even if it could pass legislation  to retake such responsibilities in the future.   Instead, it is the Supreme Court's duty to strike down laws that  violate  [[Page H5556]]  the Constitution, even if Congress could remedy those violations. For  example, the Supreme Court strikes down laws that violate the First  Amendment or the Commerce Clause, even though Congress could remedy  those violations. There is no reason why the same should not be true of  laws that violate the appropriations clause.   Moreover, in Seila Law, the Court struck down the infringement of the  President's removal power over the director of the CFPB. I hope now it  protects Congress' power as it did the President's power in Seila Law.   After all, the Supreme Court's role is not just to prevent the  erosion of presidential powers but also Congress' power. The reason the  CFPB's funding structure is so problematic is that when Congress  delegates its core responsibilities away to administrative agencies,  the value of each American's vote is diminished.   As Congress has delegated more responsibilities and more authorities  to administrative agencies, Americans have come to increasingly believe  that their votes do not matter. They see that changes in Congress don't  change policies set by agencies.   Lack of congressional control over the CFPB creates the opportunity  for special interests to capture the CFPB who run the agency according  to their own ideological vision, not according to the will of the  American people. Changing the CFPB's funding structure would be an  important and commonsense step in restoring faith in our democracy.   It is important to recognize that the structure of the CFPB is an  aberration in our government. No other agency is funded by the Federal  Reserve at the level set by the director of the other agency.   Now, I know a lot of people have raised concerns that striking down  the funding structure of the bureau would open up the question of  constitutionality of the Federal Reserve and a few other agencies that  are funded through assessments or other funding streams that they incur  in their operations.   The funding structure of the CFPB is unique. Unlike other agencies  that may be funded by a specific source of funding that they raise in  the course of their operations--seigniorage in the case of the Federal  Reserve; fees on banks in the case of the Comptroller of the Currency;  deposit insurance premiums in the case of the Federal Deposit Insurance  Corporation; tariff revenue in the case of the Customs Service--the  CFPB is different. There is no analog. It determines its own funding by  taking funds from the Federal Reserve. No other agency obtains its  funding by taking funds in this way. Further, there is no nexus between  its statutory responsibilities, consumer protection, and its funding  source, the Federal Reserve.   In conclusion, while there has been much debate about where to draw  the constitutional line on how agencies can be funded consistent with  the appropriations clause, the funding structure of the CFPB is one  we should all agree goes too far.    As with the Supreme Court determination in the Free Enterprise Fund  case that double insulation on removal was too far with respect to  limits on the presidential removal authority, the same should apply  here.   The funding structure of the CFPB goes too far without having to  answer or raise questions about other agencies. Granting Federal  agencies the authority to derive their funding from the Federal Reserve  outside of the appropriations process is a dangerous precedent and is  fundamentally inconsistent with the Constitution's separation of  powers.   The Federal Reserve seigniorage for money creation is not a piggy  bank. Forcing the Federal Reserve to pay for other government  operations risks compromising the Fed's monetary policy independence.   For these reasons, I urge the Supreme Court of the United States to  do the right thing: to vindicate the separation of powers and to uphold  Congress' appropriations authority over Federal executive branch  agencies.   I urge my colleagues to remedy this constitutional defect, pass the  Womack appropriations bill, pass the TABS Act, and restore  congressional appropriations authority.    Mr. Chairman, I will be brief in response to my friend, the  gentleman from Maryland, who makes the arguments that the authors of  the Dodd-Frank law made, which was that we designed this to be  independent. Well, that is fine. That is what they wanted, but they  can't do it unconstitutionally.    As the Fifth Circuit said very, very well, while the defenders of the  structure of the agency, of the CFPB, contend that there is no  constitutional infirmity because the funding scheme was actually  enacted by Congress in the Dodd-Frank law, and, therefore, it is  constitutional.   In essence, the bureau contends that because Congress spun the  agency's funding mechanism into motion when it passed the act, voila,  the appropriations clause is satisfied.   That is not the way the Constitution works, Mr. Chair. This body  cannot unconstitutionally delegate away our most fundamental power,  which is the power of the purse.   Vote for the Womack appropriations bill. Restore the power of the  purse. Defend this institution.    Mr. Chair, I thank my friend from Pennsylvania, and I  compliment and applaud him for introducing a very legitimate amendment  to address the unconstitutional structure of the agency and the fact  that they are a rogue agency.   There is no greater critic of the CFPB than me. Ask Mr. Chopra about  that. However, I reluctantly rise in opposition, which may surprise my  colleagues on the other side of the aisle, to the amendment. It is not  because the agency doesn't deserve a check the way Mr. Perry wants but  because it is important for this institution that we assert, in the  long run, the appropriations power of this body. That is why I support  the Womack bill, which funds the agency and deprives the Court of the  excuse to uphold the agency.  [[Page H5590]]         Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, my amendment would prohibit the Treasury  Department from issuing General License No. 8H, which was issued by the  Office of Foreign Asset Control on October 25.   It represents a fundamental policy shift in our approach to Russia  and ending its aggression against Ukraine. This amendment is a  recognition that the Biden Treasury Department's Russian oil price cap  policy has failed. It is not curbing Moscow's war spending because the  cap has proven unenforceable, especially outside of the G7.   Russian oil is trading well above the cap, funneling billions of  dollars and, in fact, trillions of rubles into Putin's war machine.                                time  1215    It is also a recognition that President Biden and Climate Czar John  Kerry's climate agenda and war on American energy has come in direct  conflict with our national security and our efforts to counter Russian  aggression. Their climate policies have limited the tools available to  them and pushed our country into pursuing a woefully ineffective price  cap strategy in lieu of closing the huge loophole they created for  energy-related transactions in their sanctions on Russian banks.   That is right. For the Americans watching on television who have been  given the impression that President Biden is being tough on Moscow, the  truth is, they are allowing oil sales to finance the war. That is the  Biden policy, to create a huge loophole for energy-related transactions  that allows Putin to finance this war.   License number 8H is an extension of authorizations by this  administration going back to the very start of the war in Ukraine. It  permits U.S. persons to engage in any transaction with sanctioned  Russian financial institutions if the transaction involves Russian  energy. This is the Biden administration's weak policy toward Russia.   It includes not only Russian energy sales but even production,  refinement,  [[Page H5596]]  and transport. Despite sanctions, again, on Russia's leading banks,  including restrictions on the Central Bank, OFAC licensing has exempted  dealings that support the most vital source of export earnings for  Moscow.   Why this administration punishes American energy but rewards Putin's  energy is beyond comprehension. This is simply perverse. On the one  hand, the Biden administration is greenlighting Russia's efforts to  earn hard currency for its war machine even as it asks Congress for  billions of dollars to defend and reconstruct Ukraine. The left hand  destroys while the right hand rebuilds, but somehow the administration  is stumped that this war grinds on without end.   Had Biden continued the Trump administration's energy dominance  strategy, he would not be as constrained as he is today, and global  energy markets would be far less dependent on Russian oil and gas,  making a full embargo or sanctions without a general license far less  painful for us and our allies.   My amendment says enough is enough. If we really want to help the  Ukrainian freedom fighters, we have to end Russia's ability to wage  war. That means cutting off every avenue available for it to fund its  hostilities.   As The Wall Street Journal reported just this week, Russian tax  revenues for oil and gas surpassed $17 billion last month, an increase  of 25 percent from the previous year. These revenues are bolstering  Moscow's abilities to threaten Ukraine with the government planning to  increase military spending by 70 percent next year.   Under my amendment, the United States will not be complicit in these  energy sales. It will ensure that sanctioned Russian banks are, in  fact, sanctioned. The loopholes that Russia has enjoyed for over a  year, thanks to President Biden, will be closed, and we will send a  signal to the world that turning a blind eye to Russian exports is  over.   At the same time, passage of this amendment must be viewed in the  broader context of the administration's multilateral efforts to ensure  the continued supply of Russian energy.   Even if we close off the U.S. and its financial system from these  transactions, the Treasury Department has convinced our European allies  to roll back EU sanctions under a price cap scheme for oil. Treasury's  own data has shown that the price cap still allows Russia to earn  billions of dollars each month in oil sales. Moreover, with Urals crude  prices rising, the World Bank recently concluded that the price cap  ``appears increasingly unenforceable.''   The only way to counteract this trend will be to acknowledge once and  for all that the war in Ukraine will not end until Russian energy dries  up. That means enforcing sanctions, not rolling them back. The first  place to start is here at home with OFAC licensing.   My amendment is an important step toward this goal. If you want to  get tough on Putin, stop his energy exports.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this measure and bring  energy dominance back to the United States.    Mr. Chair, I appreciate the sentiment, and I am with Mr.  Hoyer on providing support for Ukraine, but the 8H license is actually  the loophole. It is the exception to the sanctions.   I give President Biden credit and Secretary Yellen credit and Wally  Adeyemo credit for the sanctions on Russian banks and the Central Bank.  The problem is the huge loophole they have created with the general  license.   What my amendment proposes to do--and I just came from a meeting with  Deputy Treasury Secretary Adeyemo, a great patriot--but what we are  trying to say is the price cap is not working; close the loophole,  sanction Russian energy exports. I offer that as a bipartisan  amendment.    Mr. Chair, to answer the question, that is a very good  question. That is the key question.   To the administration's credit, they are trying to solve this  difficult question: How do we impose sanctions on Russia and Putin  without hurting our allies?    And us, because unfortunately our allies are overdependent  on Russian sources of energy.   The problem is because of this price cap scheme that they have  concocted, Russian oil is trading above the cap, so it is not exactly  affecting anything.   The truth is, there are two solutions. Number one is to decrease our  and our allies' dependence on Russian gas by increasing our own  production. This is where the administration's climate agenda is in  conflict with our national security.   Secondly, the general license is the problem. If they repealed the  general license and did what Treasury does all the time on sanctions  and to help our allies in case-by-case scenarios with a special  license--let's say, for Germany in a particular case, okay, that is  fine; they retain that authority, Treasury would--but a general license  that says Putin can sell all of his energy with no ramifications  whatsoever through a general license is not tough on Russia.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, my amendment prohibits funds from being used to  implement the Biden administration's January 2021 executive order  titled ``Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad.''   The Biden administration issued this executive order under the guise  of protecting United States' national security and foreign policy, yet  Republicans see right through this.   This executive order is yet another example of the Biden  administration's effort to circumvent the people's House and advance  their radical anti-American energy agenda by depriving the energy  industry of the financing it needs from our capital markets.   Perhaps if we want to work in our national security interests, Mr.  Chair, we should bring energy independence and dominance back to the  United States by promoting, not working to prevent, the financing of  the very capital-intensive energy sector.   We should block misguided ESG initiatives where the ultimate goal is  to politicize the allocation of capital and steer investments into the  Democrats' desired climate transition. To protect national security  interests, we should pass H.R. 1 and unleash American energy not just  for our economy but for our national security.   Instead, unsurprisingly, the Biden administration releases this  executive order that calls for the U.S. to rejoin the Paris Agreement,  creates a National Climate Task Force consisting of members from  multiple Federal agencies, including the Secretary of the Treasury and  the Secretary of Defense, which will result in agencies taking their  eye off the ball of real systemic risks in our financial system and  global stability to focus on political initiatives and calls for a  government-wide approach to the climate crisis.   What might be the most egregious is the executive order's call to  tamper with financial flows to align with a pathway toward low  greenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient development. The Biden  administration is calling for the government to put its thumb on the  scale of free-flowing capital, pick winners and losers, and pursue an  agenda to starve energy companies of the financing that they need and  redirect capital into speculative green energy technologies that,  frankly, are unproven and will not actually fix the climate.   This is in direct contradiction with our national security interests,  increases our energy dependence on our adversaries, and is once again  showing us Democrats are exploiting the most envied capital system in  the world to pursue their most radical and detrimental agendas. My  amendment will put a stop to this.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues, for the interest of our economy but  also for the interests of national security, to support this amendment,  and I yield back the balance of my time.
