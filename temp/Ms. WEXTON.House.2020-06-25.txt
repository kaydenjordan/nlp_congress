 Mr. Speaker, the horrifying murder of George Floyd awoke  the conscience of America to a generations-old system of racial  injustice. Since then, Americans--led mostly by young people--in all 50  States and in every part of my district have taken to the streets to  demand action, and that gives me hope.   The Justice in Policing Act is an important step towards real change.  This bill will implement meaningful reforms to increase transparency  and accountability in policing: banning chokeholds, stopping no-knock  warrants, establishing new standards for policing, combating racial  profiling, reforming qualified immunity, and much more.   As a former prosecutor and defense attorney, I have witnessed  firsthand the unequal application of justice toward Black Americans,  and I know more needs to be done. But the Justice in Policing Act  provides concrete legislative solutions that will help reform a deeply  unequal system of policing right now.   I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this bill  today. What we are witnessing is a once-in-a-generation call to action.  Let's not fail to answer the call.                            ____________________
