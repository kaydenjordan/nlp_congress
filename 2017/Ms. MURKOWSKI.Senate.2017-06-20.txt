 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, I have nine requests for committees to  meet during today's session of the Senate. They do not have the  approval of the Democratic leader; therefore, they will not be  permitted to meet.   I ask unanimous consent that a list of committees requesting  authority to meet be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:         Committee on Armed Services        Committee on Energy and Natural Resources        Committee on Foreign Relations        Committee on the Judiciary        Committee on Intelligence        Subcommittee on Communications, Technology, Innovation, and       the Internet        Subcommittee on Public Lands, Forests, and Mining        Subcommittee on Multilateral International Development,       Multilateral Institutions, and International Economic,       Energy, and Environmental Policy        Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism             40th Anniversary of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System     Mr. President, I have come to the floor this afternoon  to mark the 40th anniversary of the first oil moving through the Trans- Alaska Pipeline System. In Alaska, we call it TAPS. This is an 800- mile-long engineering marvel that runs from the North Slope of Alaska  to tidewater in Valdez.   Forty years is a good, long history. I recognize that, and so this  afternoon, in the interest of time, I will abbreviate the history, but  I want to start the story of our pipeline in the late 1960s. Believe it  or not, this was a pretty bleak moment for oil exploration in Alaska.  Despite great promise, many companies had given up on exploration on  the North Slope. By some accounts, at that point in time, there were at  least 14 dry holes that had been drilled before ARCO and Humble Oil  Company decided they were going to sink just one last well. It was  actually an ARCO executive who described it ``more as a decision not to  cancel a well already scheduled to go ahead.''   That well, Prudhoe Bay State No. 1, would prove to be a game changer  for Alaska. We had discovered oil. We discovered oil on the North Slope  and a lot of it. We quickly learned that Prudhoe Bay would be one of  the largest oilfields in global history, by far the largest ever  discovered in the United States. Early estimates, at that time,  suggested as much as 9 billion barrels of oil could be recovered from  it. We have learned over these intervening 40 years that we so far  underestimated that.  [[Page S3626]]    Yet it was not just the issue of discovering the oil. Prudhoe Bay is  located in a very remote part of the State, as far north as you can  go--a pretty inhospitable area given the climate--far away from  population centers in the lower 48. So a lot of challenges needed to be  overcome before production could begin.   Initially, it was like, OK, how do we move significant quantities of  oil? How do we transport this oil to market? It was Dan Yergin, in his  book ``The Prize,'' who did a great job of describing the various  choices that were out there.   He wrote: ``Icebreaker tankers that would travel through the frozen  Arctic seas to the Atlantic were seriously considered. Other  suggestions included a monorail or fleet of trucks in permanent  circulation on an eight-lane highway across Alaska.''   They then ``calculated that it would require most of the trucks in  America'' to do this. There was also ``a prominent nuclear physicist  recommended a fleet of nuclear-powered submarine tankers that would  travel under the polar ice cap to a deepwater port in Greenland--the  port to be created, in turn, by a nuclear explosion. Boeing and  Lockheed explored the idea of jumbo jet oil tankers.''   Obviously, none of those ideas came about, and some probably for very  good reason, but after significant study and debate, a pipeline emerged  as the best way to transport Alaska's oil. While two routes were  considered--one over land, which would run across Canada--an all-Alaska  route was ultimately chosen as the best way to go.   Yet, even then, pipeline construction could not begin right away.  There were serious debates in the State over issues like taxes and  tariffs and pipeline ownership, and it really consumed our State's  legislature for years. The land claims of the Alaska Natives needed to  be settled. This occurred in the landmark legislation that passed in  1971.   Then it was in 1973 that Congress took up the Trans-Alaska Pipeline  Authorization Act. As part of that debate here on the Senate floor,  Alaska's Senators offered an amendment to deem the environmental impact  statement for the pipeline to be sufficient and to shield it from what  could have been decades of litigation by its opponents. This was a  critically important aspect to the debate and really to the future of  the pipeline in order to ensure that this construction would not be  delayed by litigation.   The vote was as close as votes get here in the Senate. It was  deadlocked 49 to 49, and sitting in that chair, the Vice President at  the time, Spiro Agnew, cast the deciding vote in Alaska's favor. So  every time I see the bust out here of Vice President Agnew, I look at  him. Other people reflect on Vice President Agnew in different ways. I  reflect on that deciding vote that allowed us to proceed with our  Trans-Alaska Pipeline.   The pipeline bill went on to pass the Senate on a strong bipartisan  basis. Not long after that, then-President Richard Nixon signed it into  law. This was tremendous news for Alaska because we would be allowed to  move forward with the construction.   The construction of this pipeline was a monumental undertaking, but  that monumental undertaking was also done with considerable speed. In  April of 1974, construction on a 360-mile haul road began. We now call  it the Dalton Highway. It was finished in 154 days.   For those of you who have heard my plea on the floor and to  colleagues who have been in committees when I have talked about the  history of my efforts to try to get a 10-mile, one-lane, gravel,  noncommercial-use road for the people of King Cove, I think about what  we were able to accomplish in 154 days with that haul road that allowed  us to then help to facilitate the buildout of the pipeline.   The pipeline itself was the largest privately funded infrastructure  project ever undertaken in America at the time. It was significant. It  was significant for Alaska, of course, but it was significant for the  Nation as well. Its total cost came to be about $8 billion. In October  of 1975, there were about 28,000 people who were working to make this  pipeline a reality, and that pipeline was completed in 1977. Again,  initial construction of the haul road began in 1974. It was completed  in October 1977, which was just 3 years and 2 months after construction  began. I am told it was actually 10 days ahead of schedule, according  to one estimate, which is pretty remarkable.   The Trans-Alaska Pipeline--and I cannot find a picture that really  shows the line well--an extraordinary line, which again, is 800 miles  long, running from the North Slope to an ice-free Port of Valdez at  tidewater. It crosses three mountain ranges, including Atigun Pass,  which has an elevation of more than 4,800 feet. It reaches a grade of  55 degrees at one point in the Chugach Range. So it goes up incredible  mountains and down the other side. It crosses more than 600 streams and  rivers, and more than 400 miles of it are elevated above the ground.   We have it elevated aboveground here, but in certain areas, you can  follow the pipeline either by air, or occasionally, you can see it from  the road. It is probably one of the most photographed pipelines in the  country, but you will see it go underground in many areas. About half  of it is buried underground.   This was part of the engineering that allowed for the recognition  that you are building in a permafrost area, so it is how you ensure  that you are not having an impact in the ground and the area around it.   It crosses a major fault line, the Denali Fault. Back in November of  2002, we had a 7.9 magnitude earthquake just about 90 miles from  Fairbanks on that Denali Fault. The pipe moved 7\1/2\ feet  horizontally--moving back and forth this way--and 2\1/2\ feet  vertically. This pipeline was designed for an 8.5 earthquake. It allows  for 20 feet of horizontal movement and 5 feet of vertical movement.   The engineers not only worked to cross some extraordinary terrain but  also recognized that this was in an area in which earthquakes did  happen. It is extraordinary to listen to the stories of the engineers  who inspected every inch of that line after that earthquake in 2002 and  to hear their comments about, truly, this engineering marvel.   There are so many stories about the construction of the pipeline just  as Alaskans, as we have lived through those pipeline years. It is hard  to really capture what it was like to be in Alaska during the time of  the construction of that line. We saw our population boom as we saw new  workers come into the State. I was living in Fairbanks at the time. I  was a high school student and was going into college there. Obviously,  that was my town. In my town, all of a sudden there were people from  Louisiana, Texas, and Oklahoma. I can remember seeing guys in cowboy  boots in Fairbanks in the winter on the ice and thinking that these  guys are going to figure out how to change their footwear. But we  worked to welcome these people who were there to really help make a  difference.   There were pressures on our community. You could not find a hotel  room. You couldn't find a rental car. It was hard for the grocery  stores to keep the shelves stocked in many of the towns. We saw a  significant investment in our communities in many different ways. There  were a lot of wild stories and tales, some which are appropriate to  tell years afterward, some which still keep us smiling, but we do not  talk too much about them. There are many good stories out there.   I am proud of this extraordinary infrastructure that we have in  Alaska--an extraordinary energy asset--and to be celebrating the fact  that, for 40 years now, this pipeline has been not only contributing to  Alaska, but contributing to the Nation as something that, as Alaskans,  we do look to with pride.   This pipeline is not just a piece of pipe; it is an economic lifeline  for the State of Alaska. Over the course of 40 years, TAPS has become  the veritable backbone of our State's economy. It has helped us create  jobs to the point at which our oil and gas industry either employs or  supports fully one-third of the Alaskan workforce. So it is pretty  significant in terms of its impact.   It has generated tremendous revenue for our State, some $168 billion  at last count, which has been used for everything from roads, to  schools, to essential services. It really has helped build the State  and continues to allow our State to operate.   TAPS has allowed us to create our permanent fund, which we have used  to  [[Page S3627]]  convert the revenues from a nonrenewable resource--oil--into something  that will make an enduring contribution to the growth and the  prosperity of future generations.   Our pipeline has also allowed us to keep our tax burdens low, which  is critical in a State like Alaska, where the cost of living is  extraordinarily high. Alaska has one of the lowest tax burdens of any  State, and that is thanks to the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System. It also  allows us to keep other industries, whether it is fishing or tourism-- keep their taxes much lower than they would otherwise be. The scale of  this is often hard to imagine.   Dr. Terrence Cole, who is a history professor at the University of  Alaska, put it this way back in 2004: ``Prudhoe Bay oil was worth more  than everything that has been dug out, cut down, caught, or killed in  Alaska since the beginning of time. The discovery of the Prudhoe Bay  oil field in the late 1960s fulfilled even the most optimistic dreams  for statehood.''   From day one, Alaska's pipeline has also strengthened the energy  security of our Nation. Remember, TAPS began operating in the wake of  the first Arab oil embargo. It helped tide us over during the 1979 oil  crisis. It has insulated us from OPEC and has lessened our dependence  on nations who do not share our interests. It has provided reliable and  affordable energy that is needed by millions of Americans all up and  down the west coast. It really is hard to imagine Alaska without the  Trans-Alaska Pipeline. It is hard to imagine the consequences that  America would have faced without the 17.5 billion barrels of oil that  it has now safely carried to market. Think about that--17.5 billion  barrels of oil over the past 40 years. It is no exaggeration to say  that, while we built a pipeline, that pipeline helped us build our  State.   Today, as we mark the 40th anniversary of TAPS, we can also take  stock of the challenges that it faces. Many are a direct result of the  decisions made--or perhaps not made--in this very Chamber. While our  pipeline once carried 2.1 million barrels of oil per day, accounting  for a full quarter of America's supply, today, that amount has been  crimped down to just over 500,000 barrels a day. It is not due to lack  of resources--not at all--but instead it is due to our lack of access  to those resources. Alaska has never lacked for energy, just the  permission to produce it, despite the promises that had been made to us  at statehood and beyond.   According to the Federal Energy Information Administration, we have  at least 36.9 billion barrels of oil. That is enough to produce 1  million barrels a day for the next 100 years. We have prolific  potential in our National Petroleum Reserve, which was specifically set  aside for oil production. We have world-class resources in our offshore  areas, in the Beaufort, and in the Chukchi Seas in our Arctic Outer  Continental Shelf. We have what is believed to be North America's  largest untapped conventional oil field, which would occupy about one  ten-thousandth of the nonwilderness 1002 Area within the Arctic  National Wildlife Refuge. Again, this is an area that was specifically  set aside for development, and the Federal Government recommended that  it be opened for that purpose back in 1987--a 30-year anniversary  there.    So while we have the resources, what we need are partners at the  Federal level who will work with us to restore throughput to the Trans- Alaska Pipeline. I welcome the new administration and its commitment to  helping us produce energy--energy for Alaska, energy for the Nation.   I want to end with a quote from the Fairbanks Daily News-Miner. This  is an opinion piece by VADM Tom Barrett, who is the president of  Alyeska Pipeline Service Company. This is the TAPS operator. He has  written this opinion piece, and he states as follows: ``Though there  has been a lot of change on TAPS in 40 years, one unwavering constant  remains: the commitment of the people who work on TAPS today to provide  safe, reliable, operational excellence, 24 hours a day, seven days a  week, resilient amid all of Alaska's extreme geography and weather.''   I think about the men and women--the engineers, the workers, the  contractors, and all those who do such an incredible job to deal with  the day-to-day to keep that oil flowing safely. Again, as we recognize  40 years of safely transporting this oil, I want to repeat to my  colleagues: TAPS, or the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System, is not just a  pipeline; it is an economic lifeline for us. It is source of security  and prosperity for us as a nation.   So I join my delegation and my colleagues--Senator Sullivan and  Congressman Young--and all of the Alaskans who are marking this  anniversary today, as TAPS reaches 40 good years. We look back, and we  appreciate the past, but we also look forward and set our sights on  another good 40 years to come.   Mr. President, I thank you, and I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hoeven). The Senator from New Mexico.
