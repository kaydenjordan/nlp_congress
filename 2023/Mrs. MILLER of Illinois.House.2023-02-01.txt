 Mr. Speaker, Americans have a fundamental  right to keep and bear arms that shall not be infringed.   The unelected bureaucrats at the ATF do not have the constitutional  authority to ban guns and violate the Second Amendment rights of  American citizens.   I am proud to join my colleagues to fight to block Joe Biden's pistol  brace gun ban and also to fight to defund the ATF.                                time  1030    In Illinois, Governor Pritzker signed an unconstitutional gun ban  that violates the Second Amendment rights of my constituents. Joe Biden  and J.B. Pritzker's policies released dangerous criminals and defund  the police, and then they want to take our Second Amendment right to  defend ourselves.   I am a proud member of the House Freedom Caucus and the House Second  Amendment Caucus. We are united in our opposition to these  unconstitutional attacks on the rights of the American people.   Mr. Speaker, I will always stand for our constitutional rights and  protect our Second Amendment rights in Congress.                            ____________________
