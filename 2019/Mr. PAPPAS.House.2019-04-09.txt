 Mr. Speaker, when we took our oath in January, no issue  before us was more critical than healthcare.   Over the past 100 days, we have fought the administration's efforts  to gut the Affordable Care Act at every turn. We must keep at it  because the ACA has allowed 53,000 New Hampshire residents to enroll in  Medicaid expansion. The coverage for substance use disorder makes it  the best tool we have to fight the opioid crisis.   We also voted to empower House counsel to defend coverage for those  with preexisting conditions. Half the adult population in my State of  New Hampshire has a preexisting condition. We can't go back to the days  when insurance companies could discriminate against them.   We have also introduced legislation that will lower premiums,  strengthen patient protections, and crack down on junk plans that could  send New Hampshire families right into bankruptcy.   Lowering costs and expanding access to care must continue to be at  the top of our priority list. Nothing is more important to the health  of our districts and the well-being of this Nation.   Let's work together to improve our healthcare system, not play  politics with it.                            ____________________
