 Madam Speaker, I rise today to denounce the partisan  motivations and lack of transparency behind Speaker Pelosi and Chairman  Schiff's impeachment proceedings.   For the past 10 months, my colleagues across the aisle have operated  with one sole motivation: undoing the results of the 2016 election. As  such, Congress has failed to advance the priorities of the American  people.   We have not funded crucial legislation to fix our outdated and  crumbling infrastructure. We have not addressed the crisis on the  southern border. Meanwhile, the opioid epidemic continues to rage on.   All we have to show for the past 10 months is a handful of liberal  messaging bills that have no chance of being made into law.   While the priorities of the American people have been pushed to the  side, all of Congress' energy and resources have been diverted to  behind-closed-door impeachment proceedings far from beyond the sight of  my fellow colleagues and completely hidden from the taxpayers.   This is not why I came to Congress. This is not what we were sent  here to do. The American people deserve better.                            ____________________
