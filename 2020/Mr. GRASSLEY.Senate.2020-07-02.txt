 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 1  minute in morning business.    Mr. President, the Department of Defense is the only  agency that can't get a clean audit. Sometime around 1990, there was an  audit law passed directing Departments to get to a point where they  could get a clean audit. DOD is still the only one that hasn't.   Sometime around 2010, I believe, we laid down a requirement that the  clean audit date ought to be met by 2017. Well, that wasn't met. So,  for decades, DOD has been saying that they are almost there. Now they  say it will be at least another 5 years before a clean opinion can be  reached.   One reason they haven't been able to do that is the outdated mess of  hundreds of financial management systems. Yet the Department of Defense  still wants to spend almost $200 million on an annual audit.   I urge my colleagues to support my amendment to pause the audit  effort that is doomed to fail anyway and, instead, invest that $200  million in updating the Department of Defense financial management  system because, until they get the financial management systems right,  DOD will never be capable of having a clean audit.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I have made a career in the Senate  fighting against government waste, fraud, and abuse. Most recently, I  have found this waste in an office within the Department of Defense  called the Office of Net Assessment. Its purpose is to produce an  annual net assessment, which is a long-term look at our military's  capabilities and those of our greatest adversaries.   I am here to say to my colleagues that that office has lost its way.  When I began a review of Stefan Halper's contracting work at the Office  of Net Assessment, something didn't look right. So I asked the  inspector general to look into it.   For those who are unaware, Stefan Halper was a central figure in the  debunked Russia collusion investigation. Stefan Halper secretly  recorded Trump campaign officials during Crossfire Hurricane. Halper  also received over a million taxpayer dollars from the Office of Net  Assessment for several ``research'' projects, but the inspector general  found some problems with that contract.   The Office of Net Assessment didn't require Halper to submit evidence  that he actually talked to the people he cited in his work, which  included Russian intelligence officers.   Secondly, the Office of Net Assessment couldn't provide sufficient  documentation that Halper conducted all of his work in accordance with  the law.   And, three, the Office of Net Assessment didn't maintain sufficient  documentation to comply with all Federal contracting requirements and  Office of Management and Budget guidelines.   The inspector general also found that these problems were not unique  just to Halper's contracts, which indicates, then, systemic issues  within the Office of Net Assessment. Moreover, it has been reported  that some of the individuals that Halper cited as sources in his  research have denied contributing to Halper's work.   Oddly, Office of National Assessment Director James Baker has  repeatedly told me that Halper's deliverables were ``high quality'' and  ``conformed to the requirements set forth in the contract.''   What planet does the Office of Net Assessment live on?   The office spends almost $20 million a year of taxpayers' money every  year. Yet according to a deposition of Mr. Baker, the Office of Net  Assessment hasn't performed any annual net assessments since 2007.   A net assessment is the Office of Net Assessment's core mission. It  even says so in the title. Its purpose of doing net assessments got  lost along the way.   Moreover, after I began my oversight work at the Office of Net  Assessment, a Department of Defense directive regulating the Office of  Net Assessment was changed to provide cover for the unit's lackluster  performance. Isn't that convenient? When your work is to do net  assessment and you have been in existence for decades, and since 2007,  you haven't been doing your net assessment, you issue a directive  changing what the purpose of the Office of Net Assessment is all about.  They did it pretty simply.   On April 14, 2020, the word ``shall'' was removed from the December  23, 2009, version of the directive that required the Office of Net  Assessment to produce what their title said--``net assessments.'' The  new version also changed the Office of Net Assessment's research scope  to generic research, seemingly untethered to a net assessment--how  convenient.   This swamp needs to be drained.   Last week, I introduced an amendment to the Defense bill that does  several things. First, it reduces Office of Net Assessment's budget to  $10 million a year instead of $20 million a year. Second, my amendment  requires the Secretary of Defense to create a comprehensive plan to  ensure that the Office of Net Assessment performs what the title of the  agency says it is supposed to do--an annual net assessment--and  complies, at the same time, with every dollar they get with Federal  contracting requirements. This would take it back to the reason why it  was first created decades ago.   Third, the amendment would require the Department of Defense  inspector general to study and report on the Office of Net Assessment's  contracting failures and determine if the net assessment can be done  for less than $10 million.   And, fourth, it requires the Government Accountability Office to  perform an audit of the effectiveness of the comprehensive plan.   Right now, it is pretty clear that the Office of Net Assessment lacks  leadership and discipline, and it is also pretty clear that it has  wasted tens of millions of dollars over the years. Congress must take a  stand. That is why I am here to encourage my colleagues to support my  amendment.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the  Prescription Drug Pricing Reduction Act of 2020. This is a bill that I  have been working on for the past 18 months. I made lowering  prescription drug costs one of my top priorities as I resumed the role  of Chairman of the Finance Committee at the beginning of this Congress.   I made it my priority as it's a top concern for Iowans and all  Americans. My constituents throughout the state voice concern about  being able to afford their prescription medications. I hear about this  issue as much as any other. Poll after poll shows that the concern I  hear in Iowa is shared across the Nation. The need for Congress to act  to provide patients with much-needed relief is also a common takeaway  from these polls and from talking to my colleagues. Iowans want action.  Americans want action.   Lowering prescription drug costs and providing relief to patients is  actually what this bill does.   For the vast majority of my time working on the bill, the Senator  from Oregon, Ranking Member Wyden, has been my partner. All of the  policies in this bill, which improve Medicare and Medicaid and bring  much needed transparency across the supply chain, were co-authored by  the Ranking Member. The Finance Committee reported the initial version  of this robust bill in July 2019 by a vote of 19-9. I worked with  Ranking Member Wyden and others to make bipartisan improvements to the  bill. These improvements have made an already good bill better. I'm  introducing this updated version today. It remains a truly bipartisan  bill.   It's a bipartisan bill that helps patients and reduces government  spending. According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the  bill would save seniors and Americans with disabilities $72 billion in  out-of-pocket costs in Medicare Part D and reduce premiums by $1  billion. The entire bill would save taxpayers nearly $100 billion--a  rare source of bipartisan budget savings in an era of trillion dollar  deficits. Even Americans in the commercial market would see savings.   It's a bipartisan bill that helps patients, reduces Federal spending,  and lowers commercial costs. That's a rare feat. It's something of  which we should all be proud.   So why is the bill only being introduced with Republicans as co- sponsors?   The reason, unfortunately, is that the Democrats recently walked away  from the bill. They walked away from the good faith negotiations that  produced this bipartisan product. They did so for political reasons.  They put politics, and their drive for power, ahead of patients. From  conversations I have had with colleagues on the other side of the  aisle, this was a leadership-driven decision. Maybe the thinking is  that they'll block Senate Republicans from securing a win, or that  they'll be able to say that President Trump hasn't followed through.   They can say that, but it doesn't make it true. The introduction of  this bill, with a number of my Republican colleagues, shows that  Republicans are the ones on the side of patients. And to question the  commitment of President Trump to lowering prescription drug prices is  outlandish.   President Trump campaigned on expanding prescription drug  affordability and fairness. He released a comprehensive plan that  included numerous policy ideas. He and his Administration have taken  bold regulatory action. Some of those actions are being fought in the  courts by stakeholders that support the status quo. Some have been  opposed by Congressional Democrats.   As the Administration's ability to act through regulation can only  take us so far, President Trump called on Congress to pass an overhaul  of the drug pricing system. In fact, he mentioned my work on this  specific bill in his State of the Union address earlier this year, and  he called on Congress to send a bipartisan bill to his desk.   We should be celebrating the introduction of this bill today as  another key step closer to responding to President Trump's call for  bipartisan action. While it remains the most prominent reform bill that  contains bipartisan policy solutions, today's introduction reveals that  Democrats are more interested in positioning for elections than  producing results. This is disappointing to me. But it makes clear to  the American people that they can count on Republicans to take action  on the issues that are important to them.   President Trump has worked harder to lower prescription drug prices  than any President in memory. He has stood up to special interests. I,  along with my colleagues cosponsoring this bill, and other Republicans,  stand with him. I only wish my colleagues on the other side of the  aisle were as committed. I urge that they stop the political posturing  and work in a bipartisan way to deliver the relief that Iowans and all  Americans deserve.   I yield the floor.                                  ______                                         By Mr. DURBIN (for himself and Ms. Duckworth):   S. 4202. A bill to amend the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 to expand  online benefit redemption options under the supplemental nutrition  assistance program, and for other purposes; to the Committee on  Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.
