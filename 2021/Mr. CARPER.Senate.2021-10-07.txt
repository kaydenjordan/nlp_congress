 Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I  appreciate my colleague from Montana's efforts to get the northern  border travel back to normal. I understand that this is an important  issue in Montana, and it is important to families along our northern  border, not only Montana but across our Nation.   I just want to flag a couple of things, if I can. This legislation  has not been considered just yet in the Homeland Security and  Governmental Affairs Committee on which I serve and formerly chaired.  Given the importance of this issue, I will be more than happy to work  with my colleague from Montana on a path forward from this time.   I am concerned, having said that, that this legislation, as is, is a  bit too broad and could have unintended consequences, including making  it harder to address future challenges at our borders. Having said  that, fortunately, the Biden administration is already taking action to  safely and responsibly reopen our border, including the recent  announcement to expand the eligibility of travelers to enter the U.S.  via air travel that will go into effect--I believe it is next month.   Again, I appreciate my colleague's efforts here and am ready to work  with him, as I said to him just a few minutes ago, more than willing to  work with him on this bill within the Homeland Security Committee where  I serve as a senior Democrat, and we can look at changes to refine the  legislation and help build bipartisan support for it.   Unfortunately, however, tonight I have to object.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to yield back the  remaining time on both sides.
