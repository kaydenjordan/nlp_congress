 Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment.    Mr. Chair, this amendment will prohibit the leasing plan  from including a whole new swath of Federal lands.   This is a solution in search of a problem because many of these areas  are already protected. I went through the list. I don't see any that  aren't.   Under existing law, many of these places aren't open for oil and gas  leasing. Nothing in H.R. 21 would change that fact.   President Biden campaigned on a platform to end fossil fuels, and on  day one of his administration, he imposed a moratorium on energy  production on Federal lands. The Biden administration has leased fewer  acres than any other administration dating all the way back to World  War II. H.R. 21 will reverse the dangerous precedent set by President  Biden and his administration and unlock the natural resources owned by  the American people for the benefit of all.   The SPR shouldn't be used for political purposes. Drawing down to  influence gas prices is wrong when the SPR is set aside for national  emergencies, a time of war. It is a strategic asset for the American  people, not to be used to influence elections.   This amendment will increase gas prices and weaken our energy  security by reimposing the Biden administration's leasing moratorium.   It is wrong. It is messaging. I get it. You are okay with releasing  gas and oil out of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to influence gas  prices, weakening our Nation if a natural disaster should strike.   We need to replenish the SPR. We need to do it with the American  resources that we are blessed with in this country. That is what H.R.  21 does.   Mr. Chair, I urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment.    Mr. Chair, once again, this amendment would further allow  the President to abuse the SPR by draining it without declaring a  national emergency under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act, giving  him the ability to once again use the SPR for political purposes, and  that is wrong.   It is set aside for national emergencies, true national emergencies.  Hurricanes hit the coast. We just saw one in Florida this year. We all  remember Hurricane Katrina. We have adversaries threatening us around  the world.   We need the SPR full. We don't need it to be released to influence an  election. We need it there for national emergencies. This amendment  would further allow the President to abuse it.   The statute is clear, and emergency triggers to use the SPR are very  well defined. The law requires the President to declare that a ``severe  energy supply interruption'' exists.   The only reason a severe supply interruption exists is because of  their policies, the policies of the Biden administration that took oil  and gas production in this Nation off the table.   We have American resources here. We are blessed in this Nation with  abundant natural resources, but we are cursed by liberal politicians  who don't want America to be energy independent. They don't want us to  be energy dominant.  [[Page H437]]                                     time  0930    They want to take those resources off the table for production to  increase supply to meet demand to lower prices for consumers,  manufacturers, and people across America.   The statute defines a supply interruption as follows: ``An emergency  situation exists and there is a significant reduction in supply which  is of significant scope and duration.''   There was no emergency situation existing when the President withdrew  oil from the SPR.   ``A severe increase in the price of petroleum products has resulted  from such emergency situation.''   Where was the emergency?   Yes, we had higher prices because supply was low due to the policies  of the administration that took oil and gas production off the table.  He created the emergency if you want to call it an emergency.   Number three: ``Such price increase is likely to or may cause a major  adverse impact on the national economy.''   There is a solution. Drill here. Drill now. Produce American energy.   The SPR is a critical national security asset. We have said that over  and over and over and over and over on this side. It is a national  asset paid for by the taxpayers, set aside for the use of this Nation  in time of a real emergency. A real emergency.   The SPR is a critical national security asset. It should have only  been utilized in accordance with the law. This amendment would affect  that.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no,'' and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in support of this amendment, which  would simply clarify that the President is not authorized to make  emergency drawdowns of the SPR for political purposes. It is pretty  simple.   Imagine if a Republican administration would have done what this  administration did. You all would be hollering from the tops of  buildings in the streets.   It is clear. President Biden has abused his emergency powers to raid  our SPR for political gain. The SPR was meant for true emergency energy  supply interruptions. President Biden has mismanaged the SPR.   Mr. Chair, 250 million barrels, over 40 percent of the SPR, has been  drained in less than 2 years; it happened in 15 months.   We need to unleash American energy by expanding energy production on  Federal lands across the country. We are going to work on that in the  House majority, to expand American energy. We are fighting--like  Marjorie is--to deliver affordable and reliable energy for all  Americans.   We are also fighting to maintain and bolster our energy security.  That is  [[Page H438]]  what this is about: energy security, national security.   H.R. 21 furthers these goals, and I support this amendment and the  passage of H.R. 21.    Mr. Chair, I move to strike the last word.    Mr. Chair, the Democrats try to paint this picture that  rising energy costs was Putin's war, Putin's gas hikes.   I had to do some research. The gentleman from North Carolina tried to  make this all about the war in Ukraine, the reason the President did  this. Just a little factoid: The first drawdown of SPR was 2 months  before Russia invaded Ukraine. So this isn't about a national emergency  related to Ukraine or related to Vladimir Putin. This isn't Putin's  price hike on gasoline for American consumers.   This is the Biden administration's war on American energy. He said it  on the campaign trail, and he is implementing it today. He implemented  it from day one, and it continues.   The SPR is a strategic asset for the American people to meet their  needs in a time of crisis, such as a national emergency or time of war.   Let's just be clear. It should not be used for political gain or  political influence. The American people see right through this. They  appreciated a little bump--and that is all it was, a speed bump--at the  pump for them. The prices went right back up.   It didn't have much influence on the price of energy in this country.  What can have an influence on the price of energy in this country is  producing American energy resources.   My goodness. We are blessed in this Nation with natural gas and oil  to meet the demands of a growing economy.   Your constituents and mine are paying the price at the pump. It is  time to unleash American energy dominance, which we can.   Mr. Chair, I yield to the gentlewoman from Georgia (Ms. Greene).    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  0945     Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, the education of my colleagues continues.   A plan?   The administration in violation of the law that requires a 5-year  drilling plan on OCS. I was on the MMS 5-year OCS drilling study  committee. I know what the law is. The administration needs to create a  5-year plan for drilling offshore on Federal lands. That is a plan.   We talked about oil and how we shouldn't import oil. There are all  kinds of different oil: heavy and light. Our refineries are set up to  take a certain kind of oil. We were called a net exporter when we  exceeded the demand in this country. We had a surplus and were able to  export it. Net exporter because we are still going to import oil  because our refineries are set up to take that kind of oil and not  necessarily the oil that is produced here.   My friend mentioned our neighbors to the north in Canada producing a  lot more oil.   They don't have refineries up there to meet their demand. They need  to send that oil somewhere to be refined and made into all of the  miraculous products that come out of a barrel of hydrocarbon. It  doesn't just produce diesel fuel and gasoline. So they have to send  that oil somewhere.   But the stoppage of the Keystone XL pipeline kept that oil from  coming to the United States of America.   Guess what, Mr. Chairman?   They have got to send it somewhere else. They have got to send it  overseas to be refined somewhere. That is the reason that Canada may  pay higher prices for gasoline.   We have the solution. Bring that oil here. Let us refine it. Let's  put American workers to work at refineries. We haven't built a refinery  in this country since I don't know when.   We can meet a lot of different goals in this country and globally by  refining more of that product here. That is a plan for you.   The Keystone pipeline is important for our refineries and the energy  sector and for our allies both north and south in Mexico and Canada. We  can be North American energy secure. We can actually be hemispherically  energy secure by working with our colleagues.   H.R. 21 is about the SPR, about requiring nonemergency use to be  accompanied by a plan to produce American oil resources. There is the  gentleman's plan.   By requiring a plan to limit oil imports, this amendment aims to harm  American families by imposing costly trade restrictions into the global  market for oil, which would drive up fuel prices.   OPEC doesn't play by these rules. America is the top producer in the  world; increasing energy production leads to more security and price  stability especially when prices are set by OPEC and the global market.   This amendment undermines the purpose of the bill and undermines  American energy affordability and security.   Mr. Chairman, I urge a ``no'' vote for my colleagues, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I wish to speak on the point of order. This is  absolutely germane. It is the same subject, and it meets all the rules.   Mr. Chairman, I support the amendment.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, recollection serves me that you guys on that  side of  [[Page H441]]  the aisle blocked an amendment or a bill that Republicans put up during  the Trump administration that actually made this very point, to allow  President Trump to buy oil at a low price and refill the SPR. You all  said no. You can't make this stuff up.   The government should not be in business. The government is here to  serve the people, to meet the constitutional responsibilities  enumerated in the Constitution of the United States, and I don't see  that the government is a business that should make a net profit on  anything.   Taxpayer dollars go to purchase something as a strategic asset for  emergencies, not to be traded as a commodity so that the government can  make a profit. I guess you all wanted to make a profit so you could  keep spending money--over $31 trillion in debt.   The government shouldn't impose price controls at all. That is not  what a democratic republic does.   If Democrats are so concerned with fiscal oversight of the Department  of Energy, they should take a look at the so-called Inflation Reduction  Act, which allocated over $400 billion in Federal funding to clean  energy.   Picking winners and losers in the marketplace, that type of  government control over our energy is the exact type of policy that got  us here in the first place, that got us to where we are today, why we  are even having this debate.   I look forward to conducting future oversight over the implementation  of the Inflation Reduction Act during this Congress, and I will say  once again, and I will say it ad nauseam, the SPR must only be used to  protect Americans in the time of a true emergency--natural disaster,  war, that type thing--not for political purposes, as it was used by  this administration to lower gas prices before a midterm election to  influence politics in this country. That was the wrong use of it.   If a Republican administration had done that, you would be making the  same argument that I am making, that it was wrong. It was wrong then;  it is wrong today; and it will be wrong tomorrow. It shouldn't be used  that way. It is for national emergencies, period.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment.    Mr. Chair, this amendment seeks to delay the operation of  the bill pending an unregulated contingency.   Let me just say this: I was on the Natural Resources Committee for a  while, and I think the person in the chair was on that committee, as  well. I remember we were talking about seismic testing, and there was  this huge outcry that seismic testing would harm marine mammals.   We got a letter on BOEM's website that said that there is not a  single verifiable instance anywhere in the world, off the coast of  Africa and the Mediterranean, off the coast of the United States,  anywhere in the world, that a marine mammal was harmed or killed by  seismic testing.   I just read an article this week, though, that whales are washing up  onshore, and they believe it might be attributed to offshore wind  production. Are you going to include that in this? Those are marine  mammals.   It is just amazing that these amendments are put in place. This  amendment invokes an entirely different statute and agency, the Marine  Mammal Protection Act and the Department of Commerce. I could make the  argument that it is not germane. I am not going to do that.   This amendment prohibits a leasing plan from including any tract on  the Outer Continental Shelf if it would adversely impact marine  mammals. Show me where a marine mammal has been killed from oil and gas  production or exploration.   As I just pointed out, there is not a single verifiable instance, and  ironically, that was during the Obama administration. That was Obama's  Bureau of Ocean Energy Management that had the letter on their website,  their chief biologist.   That was a fun debate in that committee. They were holding up seismic  permits, but they would permit a wind farm offshore, a solar panel that  was frying birds or knocking endangered species out of the air in a  heartbeat, but wouldn't let us go after these abundant resources that  we had offshore and onshore.   This is nothing more than an attempt to delay the implementation of  H.R. 21. There is nothing in the bill that changes any laws relating to  protection of marine mammals.   It is worth noting that about offshore wind.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this messaging  amendment from the other side, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment.    Mr. Chair, the Biden policies are causing inflation  across this country and not allowing America to come roaring back after  the pandemic.   The first thing he did was stop oil and gas production in this  country--ended leases, stopped Federal leasing--and that has caused gas  prices to go up, which affects all of our constituents, not just the  lower income ones, but all of them.   The lower income people pay a higher percentage of their  discretionary income for energy due to this administration's policies.  That means they have less money to spend on other commodities that they  want to buy to improve their lives.   If you want to lower inflation in this country, let's get the economy  back. One way to get the economy back is to provide cheap diesel fuel  so that those commodities can be transported across the country and so  that diesel fuel is affordable for the farmers to plant their crops and  harvest their crops.   Inflation is going to continue because of this administration's  policies affecting energy prices for our farmers. Commodities are going  to be higher than they are today because of the input costs. Fertilizer  comes from energy sources. That is an input cost. Diesel fuel for  tractors and trucks transports the crops from the farm to the  processors to the store.   If we want to lower inflation in this country, we do it through  American energy dominance. We have the resources. All we have to do is  go tap them. Increase supply to meet demand. That is how you lower  prices, and that is how you address the inflationary data that we are  seeing.   Inflation is caused by this administration spending too much money,  printing too much money, and not increasing American energy security.  Providing plans under H.R. 21 that will lead to an increase in  production of American energy creates wealth, creates jobs, creates tax  revenues, leads to lower prices, and definitely combats inflation.                                time  1015    We know this from the shale revolution, which helped hardworking  Americans; added to their jobs, added to their bank accounts, added to  their spending, increased economic activity, a healthy economy, limited  inflation.   Energy is the foundation of everything in modern life. When the price  of energy goes up, everything does. It is not just transportation  fuels.   When you put a barrel of hydrocarbon under pressure, it separates,  and miraculous products are produced that are used by this Nation and  the world, so it is not just for transportation fuels.   Low-income Americans feel the pain the most. Let's support building a  healthy economy to reduce inflation and ensure American energy  security.   I will go back. This bill deals with the SPR. The drawdown by this  administration to affect energy prices for American constituents-- voters--right before an election wasn't a proper use of it then, it  won't be a proper use of it today, and it will not be a proper use of  it in the future. It is there for emergencies for this Nation. That is  what it should be used for.   We need to replenish the SPR so it will be available in a time of a  true emergency in this country.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this amendment, and  I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I reserve a point of order against the  amendment.    Mr. Chair, I insist on the point of order.    Mr. Chair, the amendment violates clause 7 of rule XVI of  the Rules of the House because it is not germane to the underlying  bill. It fails the tests for subject matter and fundamental purpose.   The amendment opens up new statutes and topics. Specifically, the  amendment would amend section 3009 of America's Water Infrastructure  Act of 2018; page 27, line 8 for reference.   That statute is not amended by H.R. 21. It is not even discussed.   The amendment would create a new regime of government supply and  price controls not at all contemplated in this bill's simple leasing  plan. It is totally different in subject matter, totally different in  purpose, totally different in the end game. For that purpose, the  amendment is not germane.   I would also note that this amendment has been determined to have an  impact on direct spending, although CBO has not yet determined the  magnitude.   I say the amendment is not germane in so many ways, and I look  forward to the ruling.    Mr. Chair, I move to strike the last word.   The ACTING Chair. The gentleman from South Carolina is recognized for  5 minutes to strike the last word.    Mr. Chair, the more things change, the more they stay the  same. Members of Congress are standing on this floor talking about buy  low, sell high.   I look back two Congresses ago during the Trump administration, and  the Republicans stood on this floor and offered this very thing: to  allow the President of the United States to buy a commodity--oil--at  the lowest price possible so that we could replenish the SPR. Thank God  for acknowledging that fact.   Unfortunately, oil isn't cheap right now. You're not going to be able  to buy oil very low. Unless we change the policies of this country and  start producing American energy, increasing supply to meet demand  lowers prices. It is very simple: Economics 101.   The answer to our energy insecurity is not reflexive Democrat Big  Government price controls which will restrict energy resource  development and supply and drive up energy costs, which we are seeing,  adding to the current inflation rate which is over 6 percent.   The GDP numbers came out today. Very slow growth in this Nation. We  have a solution: produce American energy, fuel the economy, help your  constituents, lower transportation fuels, lower energy costs for their  homes through American energy resources. Price controls always end with  gas lines and fuel shortages.   Truckers were stuck this year on the side of the interstate for days  because of diesel fuel shortages. I talked about that earlier.   Consumer prices are through the roof. Anything transported by an 18- wheeler is going to cost more on the consumer shelf because the price  of diesel fuel is passed on to the consumer in the prices. It is how  the economy works.   Cargo ships, planes--everybody is paying more for fuel. That will  result in higher prices and inflation as a direct result of the Biden  administration's policies to end American energy production and  ultimately, American energy dominance.   The U.S. is the number one oil and gas producer in the world, and we  have the resources here to produce millions more barrels a day.   H.R. 21 is about restoring U.S. leadership in the world in the realm  of energy production. It is about reducing political interference in  markets and unleashing the benefits of free and open markets and  encouraging innovators to invest and take risks, and end our dependence  on OPEC to demand and set price controls for our global market.   The shale revolution just didn't happen in countries with price and  supply controls. It happened because of innovation in this country. It  happened in America where we encourage the entrepreneurial spirit  instead of a top-down government-controlled economy. It is estimated  that the shale revolution saves U.S. consumers $203 billion annually.  That equates to about $2,500 per family.   Guess what?   Because of the Biden administration's policies, those same  constituents of ours are paying about $2,500 more per year in costs;  not just energy costs, but inflationary costs all across the spectrum.                                time  1030    It also lowered energy-related greenhouse gas emissions by an  estimated 527 million metric tons per year because of natural gas.   If we want to alleviate the burden of record-high energy prices on  the American people, the American families, Democrats should reverse  the regulatory death grip on the policies they have on the oil and gas  industry.   I have a solution: Build more pipelines in this country, and let's  get the resources where they are needed in our States and in our  communities, in our homes.   Rather than destroy the SPR by turning it into a political tool, as  we saw the Biden administration do, let's unleash American energy  production and become American energy dominant once again.   Mr. Chair, I urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment, and I yield back  the balance of my time.                       Announcement by the Acting Chair
