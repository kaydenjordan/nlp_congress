 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to recognize eight cities in  Texas' Third Congressional District that have received this year's Tree  City USA designation by the Arbor Day Foundation.   Allen, Fairview, Frisco, McKinney, Murphy, Plano, Prosper, and Wylie,  all located in Collin County, have proven they care about ensuring the  environment around them is thriving and full of life.   These Collin County cities understand that trees serve an integral  purpose in our community, including improved health, clean air and  water, and a positive impact on business and homes in the area. Not  only are these communities dedicated to providing necessary municipal  tree care, but they are encouraging their residents to do the same.   I commend these cities for their investments in green infrastructure  and for creating a lasting, positive impact for generations to come.   I ask my colleagues in the House of Representatives to join me in  congratulating these eight communities on their efforts to maintain  healthy and green environments and neighborhoods.                            ____________________
