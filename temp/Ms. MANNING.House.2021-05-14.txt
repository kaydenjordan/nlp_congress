 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in favor of the  Pregnant Workers Fairness Act.   As a working mother, this bill is very personal to me. When I was  pregnant with my third child, I experienced premature labor, and my  doctor ordered me to be on bed rest for 10 weeks. I was fortunate to  work for an employer who allowed me to keep my job, work a reduced  schedule from home, and continue earning my wages.   After my daughter was born, I was still able to take my full  maternity leave to care for her, and once I returned to the office, I  continued to work for that same firm for many years in part because of  the accommodations that were made for me during my pregnancy.   This experience should not be unique to me. The Pregnant Workers  Fairness Act will ensure that every person who needs reasonable  accommodation during pregnancy will be given those accommodations so  they can work to continue to support their family and contribute to  their workplace.   I am proud to cast my vote in favor of the Pregnant Workers Fairness  Act, and I urge my colleagues to join me.   Mr. Speaker, I will include in the Record a letter from the National  Education Association.                            ____________________
