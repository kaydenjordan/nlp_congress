 Madam President, I request that I am able to make my  remarks prior to the vote.    Madam President, I rise in support of Jonathan Meyer's  nomination to be general counsel at the Department of Homeland  Security, or DHS.   Mr. Meyer understands the unique challenges facing DHS, and he has  the legal and management experience and vision needed to succeed in  this important role. Throughout the confirmation process, Mr. Meyer has  demonstrated that he understands the complex legal issues facing DHS  and the importance of ensuring the Department cooperates with  congressional oversight.   DHS has not had a Senate-confirmed general counsel for over 2 years.  DHS needs qualified, Senate-confirmed leaders in place to effectively  carry out its critical mission of safeguarding our Nation. Mr. Meyer is  an accomplished lawyer and dedicated public servant who is well  qualified to serve as the Department's chief legal officer.   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the confirmation of  Jonathan Meyer to be general counsel for DHS.                            ____________________
