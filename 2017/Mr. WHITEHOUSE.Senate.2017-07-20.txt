 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    I ask unanimous consent to be allowed to speak as in  morning business for up to 15 minutes.    Mr. President, to the disappointment of the American  [[Page S4091]]  public, the world scientific community, and even to corporate giants  like Goldman Sachs and Cargill, President Trump recently decided to  withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement. He cited as  justification a slew of alternative facts. Some of the most egregious  of these alternative facts came from a National Economic Resource  Associates--a group we will call NERA in this speech--report that was  commissioned and promoted by a group that calls itself the U.S. Chamber  of Commerce but fronts for the fossil fuel industry. ``U.S. Chamber of  Carbon'' might be a better and more accurate name for it.   The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, so-called, is a heavy hitter in  Washington. It was the second largest spender of anonymous outside  money, or dark money, in the 2016 Federal elections, second only to the  National Rifle Association. In addition to all that political election  spending, it wields the largest lobbying force on Capitol Hill. In  2015, the chamber dropped over $100 million on lobbying.   The U.S. Chamber of Commerce is one of climate action's most  implacable enemies, as everybody here knows, despite the good climate  policies of so many companies on its board. Along with Senators Warren,  Sanders, and others, I examined this inconsistency between the  positions of the chamber and of its board members in our recent report,  ``The U.S. Chamber of Commerce: Out of Step with the American People  and its Members.''   Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record  excerpts from the report, ``The U.S. Chamber of Commerce: Out of Step  with the American People and its Members.''   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:  The U.S. Chamber of Commerce: Out of Step With the American People and                                Its Members         A Report from Senators Sheldon Whitehouse, Elizabeth       Warren, Barbara Boxer, Bernard Sanders, Sherrod Brown, Jeff       Merkley, Richard Blumenthal, and Edward Markey                 (Select Climate Change Specific Excerpts)                              Executive Summary         The United States Chamber of Commerce (the Chamber), the       largest lobbying organization in the country, has used its       considerable resources to fight legislation in Congress and       Obama Administration actions on tobacco and climate change at       home and abroad. A series of 2015 New York Times articles       exposed the Chamber's aggressive tactics to help the tobacco       industry fight international antismoking laws, regulations,       and policies, and described the organization's systematic       efforts to undermine the Environmental Protection Agency's       work to address climate change and carbon pollution. These       activities raised questions about the Chamber's policy-making       process; one analyst concluded that ``the Chamber is at odds       with the interests of some, if not most, of its membership in       three other areas: climate change, minimum wages and       tobacco,'' and described its advocacy as ``aligned with the       small number of companies that are its largest       contributors.''        In response to the 2015 allegations, Senators Sheldon       Whitehouse, Elizabeth Warren, Barbara Boxer, Bernard Sanders,       Sherrod Brown, Jeff Merkley, Richard Blumenthal, and Edward       Markey examined the positions and actions of Chamber Board       members to determine the extent to which the Chamber's       activities on tobacco and climate change reflect its Board       members' views and interests. The analysis focused on the 108       private-sector members of the Chamber's Board of Directors,       which the Chamber describes as ``the principal governing and       policymaking body of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. . . .       [that] determine[s] the U.S. Chamber's policy positions on       business issues and advise[s] the U.S. Chamber on appropriate       strategies to pursue.'' The findings of this analysis--based       on correspondence with the Chamber's Board members and a       review of publicly available information on Chamber Board       member positions on tobacco and climate change--reveal the       following:        The Chamber's positions and actions on tobacco and climate       change are at odds with those of its Board members.       Approximately half of the companies on the Chamber's Board of       Directors have adopted anti-tobacco and pro-climate positions       that contrast sharply with the Chamber's activities. Chamber       Board member companies have acknowledged the public health       harms of tobacco and support the efforts of their employees       to quit smoking. They have also taken public positions and       actions in support of efforts to reduce carbon emissions and       address climate change. Despite the positions of its Board       members, the Chamber opposes efforts in Congress and by the       Administration to address these issues.        Not a single Board member explicitly supported the       Chamber's lobbying efforts. In response to inquiries from       several senators, 21 Chamber Board members distinguished       their actions from the Chamber's on tobacco by describing       their own positive efforts, and five respondents       distinguished their actions and positions on climate change.       Five additional companies on the Chamber's Board explicitly       disagreed with the Chamber's positions on tobacco or tobacco       lobbying activities. For example, Chamber Board member       Celgene stated that it ``[does] not support tobacco use or       policies that promote tobacco use.'' Steward Health Care       Systems elaborated on its disagreement with the Chamber's       actions, saying that it ``was the only company on the Chamber       Board that went on record to oppose the initiative.'' Other       respondents sidestepped key questions and failed to respond       to questions about how they viewed the Chamber's activities.       Not one Board member explicitly supported the Chamber's       actions on tobacco and climate.        The Chamber's decision-making process and Board policy       decisions are not transparent. Ten Chamber Board members       revealed, in their responses to the congressional inquiries,       that they had no knowledge of or input into the Chamber's       lobbying activities on tobacco or climate issues. For       example, Chamber Board member Edward Jones, Inc., indicated       that the company ``[was] not advised of any campaigns... [and       is] not aware of any processes'' to develop these campaigns.       Sempra Energy reported that ``the issues raised in [the]       letter have not been discussed during the short time [it has]       been a member of the organization.'' Despite the Chamber's       description of the Board as its ``principal governing and       policymaking body,'' not one Chamber Board member explicitly       indicated that they were fully aware of and able to provide       their input and views to the Chamber regarding its actions on       tobacco and climate.        The findings in this report raise serious questions about       the Chamber's credibility and its actions on tobacco and       climate policy, and indicate that the Chamber does not       accurately represent the positions, input, and knowledge of       its membership.                               I. Introduction         The United States Chamber of Commerce is the largest       lobbying organization in the country. OpenSecrets, a       nonprofit, nonpartisan research group that tracks the effects       of money and lobbying, showed that in 2015 alone, the Chamber       spent roughly $85 million on lobbying efforts, more than       twice the amount spent by the second-highest organization       (the National Association of Realtors). During the 2013-2014       election cycle, the Chamber spent $35 million on political       expenditures (through super PACs, 501(c) organizations, and/      or political party committees) that were ``outside'' or       independent of candidates' campaign committees.        The Chamber has used its considerable resources to fight       legislation and government action on tobacco and climate       change at home and abroad. A series of 2015 New York Times       articles exposed the Chamber's aggressive activities helping       the tobacco industry to fight international antismoking laws,       regulations, and policies, and described the organization's       systematic efforts to undermine the Environmental Protection       Agency's work to address climate change and carbon pollution.        While the Chamber claims that it ``reflects the grassroots       views of the entire business community'' and that it       represents the ``interests of more than three million       businesses of all sizes, sectors, and regions'' when it       interacts with Congress, its positions and actions on tobacco       and climate do not appear to reflect or communicate the       positions of many of its member companies. The following       analysis shows that approximately half of the companies on       the Chamber's Board of Directors have publicly taken       positions on tobacco and climate change that are in conflict       with the Chamber's actions and positions. This calls into       question the Chamber's allegedly transparent decision-making       process, and suggests that the Chamber does not accurately       represent the positions of its member companies.        Moreover, the Chamber's lobbying is at odds with its own       public positions. The organization strongly professes that it       is anti-tobacco, saying that it ``is not in the business of       promoting cigarette smoking at home or abroad, period.'' It       also claims to support the environment, saying that it ``has       in its public documents, Hill letters and testimony,       supported efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the       atmosphere,'' and calling for a ``comprehensive climate       change law.'' Plainly, there is a broad gap between the       Chamber's stated policies, its Board members' positions, and       its actual lobbying activities.          III. The Chamber's Lobbying on Tobacco and Climate Issues         When the Chamber weighs in, many in Washington, D.C.,       listen. The Chamber is the largest lobbying organization in       the country and claims to represent the ``interests of more       than three million businesses of all sizes, sectors, and       regions'' when it interacts with Congress. OpenSecrets, a       nonprofit, nonpartisan research group that tracks the effects       of money and lobbying, showed that in 2015 alone, the Chamber       spent roughly $85 million on lobbying efforts, more than       twice the amount spent by the second-highest organization       (National Association of Realtors). During the 2013-2014       election cycle, the Chamber spent $35 million on political       expenditures (through super PACs, 501(c) organizations, and/      or political party committees)  [[Page S4092]]       that were ``outside'' or independent of candidates' campaign       committees.        The Chamber has attacked U.S. climate policies with similar       zeal. According to The New York Times, in early 2014, a group       of 30 corporate lawyers, coal lobbyists, and Republican       political strategists gathered at the Chamber's headquarters       to devise legal strategies to dismantle the President's Clean       Power Plan--before President Obama had even introduced a       draft proposal of it. The Chamber has also been vocal about       its opposition to climate action when testifying before       Congress. For instance, the Chamber has testified in       opposition to the Paris Agreement, despite the fact that many       of its Board member companies have pledged to support the       goals of the Agreement. Additionally, nearly all of Chamber       campaign contributions--94%--have reportedly gone to climate       change denier candidates.                                 V. Findings         Based on the responses to the Tobacco and Climate Letters       and public positions and policies of Board members, the       report finds that:        Approximately half of the companies on the U.S. Chamber of       Commerce's Board of Directors have anti-tobacco and/or pro-      climate positions.        None of the respondents to the Tobacco and Climate Letters       expressed explicit support for the Chamber's activities, and       numerous Chamber Board members distanced themselves from       Chamber activities on tobacco or climate.        The Chamber's decision-making process lacks transparency,       even with respect to its Board members. A number of Board       members were unaware of key Chamber policymaking and lobbying       decisions on tobacco and climate.                          Climate Change Findings         Almost half of the Chamber Board members (52 of 108, 48%)       have taken public positions supporting efforts to reduce       carbon emissions and address climate change, including eight       of the companies that responded to the Senate inquiry on       Chamber climate policies (see Appendix V). The remaining       Board member companies appear to have no public position on       climate change as a public health or environmental issue.        These 52 companies that support efforts to address climate       change, have undertaken their own initiatives to reduce       carbon emissions, support the EPA's work on climate change,       or have publicly committed to support of the Paris Agreement.        Indeed, many Chamber Board members are national and       international leaders on this issue. For example:        Allstate is a member of the Ceres Company Network, a group       of companies that have agreed to improve their environmental       and social performance, publicly report on their       sustainability practices, and continuously improve their       performance and disclosure on sustainability issues. Allstate       was also named to the Climate Disclosure Leadership Index       (CDLI) from 2008 to 2014 for its efforts to reduce its carbon       footprint and transparency on its climate change adaptation.        AT&T is one of more than 150 companies to have signed on to       the American Business Act on Climate Pledge. AT&T has       committed to reduce its direct greenhouse emissions by 20       percent and reduce its electricity consumption by 2020.        BMO Financial Group stated that it is ``focused on reducing       our environmental footprint, setting clear goals and       consistently maintaining carbon neutrality across our entire       enterprise.''        Las Vegas Sands was named to the CDP's ``A list'' in 2015       for its efforts to address and disclose corporate climate       change information.        Ryder received the EPA SmartWay Excellence Award in 2013       and 2014 in recognition of its efforts to address carbon       pollution and emissions.        Sanofi ``strives to reduce [its] environmental impact, so       that [it] can contribute to decreasing the effects of climate       change. This includes a two-pronged approach to reduce [its]       carbon footprint and to combat diseases directly correlated       with climate change.'' Sanofi says that it has reduced its       carbon emissions by 60 times, cut transport costs by 50       percent, and has set a goal of reducing its water consumption       by 25 percent between 2010 and 2020.        3M is a founding member of the National Climate Coalition.       In its 2015 Sustainability Report, 3M touted its ``history of       proactive leadership in addressing both the challenges and       opportunities presented by climate change and energy       conservation.''        UPS stated it was ``pleased to join 12 other firms at the       White House on July 27, 2015, in launching the American       Business Act on Climate Change . . . [W]e pledged first to       reduce our carbon intensity by 20% by 2020, from a 2007       baseline. Second, we plan for our alternative fuel and       technology fleet, which will number about 8,000 trucks by the       end of the year, to have driven a cumulative 1 billion miles       by 2017.''        No Chamber Board members that responded to the Senate       letter explicitly supported the Chamber's lobbying actions on       climate policy. Seven respondents to the Climate Letter       indicated that they do not agree with every action taken by       trade associations of which they are a member, and three       companies declined to express a position. Two of the eleven       companies that responded to the Climate Letter (Citadel and       HCSC) indicated that they were not involved in the Chamber's       climate-related activities, and the other nine did not       indicate whether they were involved in the Chamber's climate       policy decision-making process.        Despite the fact that nearly half of Chamber Board members       have acknowledged the risk of climate change or are actively       working to address the risks of climate change, the Chamber       has opposed executive action on climate and lobbied heavily       in support of legislation undermining climate action,       assembling a ``vast network of lawyers and lobbyists ranging       from state capitols to Capitol Hill, aided by Republican       governors and congressional leaders,'' to oppose President       Obama's climate change regulations.                                VI. Conclusion         The Chamber claims that it ``reflects the grassroots views       of the entire business community when the organization       testifies before Congress or regulatory agencies,       disseminates reports or statements to the media, or sends       comments or letters to Capitol Hill and to policymakers.'' It       states that ``everyone involved in the process must help       develop positions that benefit the entire business community,       rather than any given narrow interest . . . The process must       be open and above board.''        But this investigation fmds these claims to be plainly       untrue. Despite its claims of a representative policy-making       process, the Chamber does not speak for many of its Board       members on two of the most pressing public health issues of       our time. The discrepancy between how the Chamber and its       Board members act on tobacco and climate is stark. Bloomberg       columnist Barry Ritholtz contends that it is easy for the       Chamber to ignore its numerous member companies that oppose       its stance because one third of its revenue comes from just       19 companies, many of them in the energy industry.        Indeed, based on the responses of Chamber Board member       companies, the Chamber seems to act at will, without broadly       consulting its leading members about fundamental policy       positions on which it spends millions of dollars in collected       dues.        Some American business icons have demonstrated leadership       by disaffiliating themselves from the Chamber over       fundamental policy disagreements. Apple, Exelon, and Pacific       Gas and Electric (PG&E), have left the Chamber over its       destructive climate policies. Nike left the Board for similar       reasons, and other members--Intel, Johnson & Johnson, and       Microsoft--publicly disagree with and distance themselves       from the Chamber's climate position. And CVS Health withdrew       its membership from the Chamber last year due to the group's       tobacco lobbying.        Many Chamber members do good work to address the risks of       tobacco and climate change. But too many of these members       quietly disapprove of the Chamber's positions without taking       action. As long as these Board members lend their tacit       support to an organization that spearheads systematic efforts       against policies to limit tobacco and climate change, it is       difficult to accept their claims that they are anti-tobacco       or good on climate.        We encourage Chamber Board members to stop looking the       other way where there is disagreement, and defending their       Chamber membership as supporting free speech. This       positioning makes it appear as though they're trying to have       it both ways and damages their credibility and efforts in       support of positive action. These companies should take       responsibility for the positions and actions of the Chamber,       and use their leverage as an opportunity to shift the tenor       of a powerful lobbying force away from harming public health       and towards positions that help reduce tobacco use and       address the risks of climate change.     When President Trump announced his withdrawal from  the Paris Agreement, he used these alternative facts from that chamber- commissioned NERA report. Here is what Trump said:         Compliance with the terms of the Paris Accord and the       onerous energy restrictions it has placed on the United       States could cost America as much as 2.7 million lost jobs by       2025. . . . This includes 440,000 fewer manufacturing jobs.    End of alternative facts quote.   This was another assertion:         By 2040, compliance with the commitments put into place by       the previous administration would cut production for the       following sectors: paper down 12 percent; cement down 23       percent; iron and steel down 38 percent; coal--and I happen       to love the coal miners--down 86 percent; natural gas down 31       percent. The cost to the economy at this time would be close       to $3 trillion in lost GDP and 6.5 million industrial jobs,       while households would have $7,000 less income and, in many       cases, much worse than that.    End quote of his alternative facts.   Countless reviewers, including PolitiFact, Scientific American--that  known crazy, phony, liberal publication, Scientific American--CNBC, and  Fortune magazine, fact-checked the President's speech. It did not fare  well. PolitiFact warned us to ``take these statistics with a grain of  salt.'' An analysis of the underlying report was done by Kenneth  Gillingham, an economics professor at Yale University. He pointed out  that the NERA study made up a hypothetical set of policy actions to  reach those goals. Those policy actions may well never have been  [[Page S4093]]  taken by anyone to comply with the Paris Agreement, but that was what  they used. Second, NERA only modeled the cost side.   You have heard the phrase ``cost-benefit equation.'' They only looked  at the costs. They didn't ever look at the benefit side. This is phony  accounting when you only look at one side of the ledger.   NERA, of course, has a history of producing misleading reports for  its industry sponsors. In 2015, it released a report for the National  Association of Manufacturers on the proposed ozone standard, claiming  it would cost as much as $140 billion per year. On the cost side, EPA  estimated it would cost a fraction of what NERA estimated, less than 12  percent. The economic consulting firm Synapse analyzed the NAM report  and found it ``grossly overstates compliance costs, due to major flaws,  math errors, and unfounded assumptions . . . these assumptions and  other flaws led NERA to overstate compliance costs by more than 700  percent.''   That is just on the cost side. Once again, they didn't even bother to  look at the benefits. It is a one-side-of-the-ledger-phony analysis. Of  course, the chamber commissioned NERA to do the same thing for it on  climate: overestimate the costs and ignore the benefits. In this world  of climate denial, this is a classic maneuver.   Senator Ted Cruz cited the NERA report in his CNN op-ed urging  President Trump to pull the United States out of the Paris Agreement a  day before President Trump cited these stats in his withdrawal speech.   Cruz, Trump, and the chamber ignored more than 1,000 companies that  supported the United States remaining in the Paris Agreement, including  several chamber member companies. Some of these have publicly distanced  themselves from the chamber as a result of the President's decision. A  recent Bloomberg news article was headlined, ``Paris Pullout Pits  Chamber Against Some of Its Biggest Members.''   Citigroup said: ``We have been outspoken in our support for the Paris  agreement and have had a dialogue with the Chamber about how its views  and advocacy on climate policy are inconsistent with Citi's position.''  Similar distancing came from Dow and Ford.   Over the weekend, the Washington Post ran a piece, ``Is the most  powerful lobbyist in Washington''--that is the so-called U.S. Chamber  of Commerce--``losing its grip,'' exploring this tension around climate  in more detail. The article said: ``[P]erhaps the most nettlesome issue  for the Chamber has been climate change.'' It calls out the chamber's  claims to be neutral on the Paris Agreement, while actually providing  ``ammunition for foes of the agreement.''   The article highlights the chamber's climate denial efforts,  including its 2009 proposal to hold a public trial on climate science-- what it dubbed ``the Scopes monkey trial of the 21st century.'' New  Mexico-based utility PNM Resources actually quit the chamber because  that idea was so preposterous.   The Washington Post identified 8 of the 25 companies that signed an  ad in the New York Times supporting the Paris Agreement as chamber  members, including GE, Microsoft, and Walt Disney. The CEOs of these  companies publicly criticized President Trump's decision.   Microsoft's Brad Smith said:         We're disappointed with the decision to exit the Paris       Agreement. Microsoft remains committed to doing our part to       achieve its goals.    GE's Jeff Immelt said:         Disappointed with today's decision on the Paris Agreement.       Climate change is real. Industry must now lead and not depend       on government.    Walt Disney's Bob Iger said:         As a matter of principle, I've resigned from the       President's Council over the #Paris Agreement withdrawal.    The chamber is out of step with its own members on climate change,  maintaining a scientifically untenable position as every one of our  State universities knows. Who is pulling the chamber's chain? It is  hard to tell since the chamber hides from the public who its donors  are, but I suspect the answer is the same as to why the Republicans  continue to revive the hated, zombie healthcare bill despite huge  public distaste for it.   Mr. President, that brings me to the nomination of John Bush to the  U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. The chamber's rigid anti- climate stance is part of a fossil fuel political program that holds  this Chamber in a state of intimidation and inaction on climate change.  As Congress cowers before this fossil fuel political presence, we are  now advancing the nomination of a climate denier to the Federal bench.   John Bush was not nominated because of any track record of  distinguished performance or demonstrated commitment to public service.  To the contrary, his most notable achievements seem to be a series of  wildly offensive blog postings and public statements, denying that  climate change is real and mocking it, comparing a woman's right to  choose to the evil of slavery, casually using vile slurs against gay  people. On and on goes the list.   Bush has written a number of posts dealing with environmental issues  in which he insists on placing the terms ``global warming'' and  ``climate change'' in quotation marks, insinuating that they do not  really exist. Tell that to your home State universities.   With this appalling track record, why was he nominated? It is not  hard to figure that out. He is here because through those offensive  blog posts and by flagging himself as a loyal climate denier, he  signals himself as a willing foot soldier of the big special interests.  These big special interests are intent on capturing our courts, just as  they have captured so much of Congress.   Judicial nominees like Mr. Bush are exactly what these special  interests want, to make sure they can, first, maintain their dark money  influence. That is their most particular key. That is the mother ship  off of which all the other special interest mischief they perform comes  from and of course to see to it that these big interests are never held  accountable to the American people. That is the signal he sends.   Bush has flagged that he will rule the right way for the big special  interests that fund the Republican Party, and the special interests'  big reward is his nomination and confirmation. He has shown that he is  familiar with the recipes when it comes time to cook the decisions.   My Democratic colleagues and I respect any President's desire and  prerogative to fill the vacancies in the executive and judicial  branches. Even though I understand we will not see eye to eye with our  colleagues across the aisle on every nominee, Senate Democrats have  given the President's nominees a very fair shake. This is no normal  nominee. This is a freak who lowers the bar on judicial nominees  forever.   If Mr. Bush wants to exercise his First Amendment right to spout  offensive, ignorant, and hateful nonsense as some kind of nutty  Breitbart blogger, he is free to do so, but that is not the measure--or  has not until today been the measure of a Federal judge for the U.S.  Court of Appeals.   Mr. Bush is patently unqualified for this position, well outside any  version of the mainstream, and his appointment can reasonably be  predicted to bring dishonor and preordained partiality to the  judiciary. I regret we are at this point.   I yield the floor.
