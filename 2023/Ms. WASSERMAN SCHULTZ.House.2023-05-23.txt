 Mr. Speaker, it is with a heavy heart that I  rise to recognize the remarkable life of Judy Gilbert-Gould.   Judy Gilbert-Gould, a lifelong resident of Miami, passed away on  April 21, 2023, at the age of 88. She was the daughter of the late  Stanley C. and Martha M. Myers and sister to the late Kenneth M. Myers.   As a young woman, Judy became involved in the National Council of  Jewish Women, eventually serving as president of the Miami chapter. In  recognition of her service, Judy was awarded NCJW's highest honor, the  Hannah G. Solomon Award, for her commitment to the advancement of human  welfare.   Judy later served in several other important professional and  leadership capacities.   Working under then-Dade County State's attorney Janet Reno, Judy was  the director of victim-witness services in the State's Attorney's  Office to help prepare rape victims to testify in court.   Later on, Judy's professional career concentrated on working for the  Jewish people. In 1983, Judy joined the Greater Miami Jewish  Federation, where she served for many years as director of the Jewish  Community Relations Council, the JCRC.  [[Page H2509]]    As the JCRC's executive director, Judy adroitly mobilized and engaged  Miami's Jewish community on many levels. She led our citizen activists  in building relationships with Members of Congress on both sides of the  aisle, was pivotal in the pro-Israel movement here at home, and  successfully advocated for the national agenda supported by the Jewish  Council for Public Affairs.   On a personal note, we worked closely together to address a multitude  of issues facing our community, from the scourge of anti-Semitism to  ensuring we maintain our strong U.S.-Israel relationship.   Shortly after I was first elected to Congress, under Judy's  leadership role at the Greater Miami Jewish Federation, she approached  me with the idea to sponsor legislation that would create a month  during which we honor the contributions American Jews have made to the  fabric of our Nation.   I introduced a resolution, and since 2006 our Nation has celebrated  Jewish American Heritage Month each May to educate Americans about the  contributions Jewish Americans have made and continue to make to our  country, helping to reduce hate, anti-Semitism, and bigotry.   Judy's commitment to Miami's Jewish community and the State of Israel  was exemplary, and I will miss her guidance and wisdom.   My heart is with her family in mourning the loss of this kind,  generous, and compassionate soul. We were forever privileged to have  shared this time with Judy. May her memory be for a blessing.                            ____________________
