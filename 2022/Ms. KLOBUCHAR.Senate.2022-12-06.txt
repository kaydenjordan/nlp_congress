 Mr. President, I come to the floor today to support  Elizabeth Bagley's nomination to serve as Ambassador Extraordinary and  Plenipotentiary to the Federative Republic of Brazil.   Elizabeth brings to this position significant experience in  diplomacy, law, and foreign affairs. Over the course of her incredible  career, she has served our country as Ambassador to Portugal, as a  senior adviser to multiple Secretaries of State, and as congressional  liaison to the Helsinki Accords and the Camp David Treaties.   At the State Department, she was the first person to serve as the  Special Representative for Global Partnerships, an office which worked  to advance foreign policy priorities through private sector engagement.  She has a background in international law and shared that expertise  with the students at Georgetown University Law Center. Through her  years advising key leaders like Madeleine Albright, Hillary Clinton,  and John Kerry, Elizabeth gained the experience needed to represent our  country on the world stage.  [[Page S6978]]    We all know about the key role Ambassadors play in diplomacy. U.S.  and broader democratic efforts suffer when we do not have an Ambassador  in place--someone to officially represent the U.S. Government, to lead  our Foreign Service Officers abroad, and to strengthen diplomatic ties  with other nations.   This is particularly true of Brazil, a country that is home to a U.S.  Embassy, four consulates, a branch office, and decades of partnership.  More than 40,000 students, teachers, and professionals have  participated in exchanges between the United States and Brazil. The  United States is Brazil's second largest trading partner, and our  governments and law enforcement agencies work closely together to  combat money laundering, arms trafficking, and human trafficking.   To manage the many challenges facing the world today--food shortages  from Russia's invasion of Ukraine, rising temperatures and extreme  weather events, continuing recovery from the pandemic, and China's  growing influence around the world, we need capable Ambassadors in  place to share democratic values and secure America's place in the  world. Time and time again, Elizabeth Bagley has proven herself to be  the kind of leader who is up for the task.   Don't take it just from me. Elizabeth has been awarded the Secretary  of State's Distinguished Honor Award, given for those who have made  significant contributions to the Agency's mission, and the Portuguese  Government has conferred upon her the Grand Cross of Prince Henry the  Navigator, Portugal's highest civilian honor.   I am proud to say I will be voting for Elizabeth Bagley as Ambassador  to Brazil, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.                            ____________________     Madam President, I want to thank Roy. We have been  through a lot together, and I am so proud to call him a friend, as well  as Abby. I have such fond memories of our work together. I have really  fun memories of when we once went to Canada--remember that?--with all  the Canadian interparliamentarian groups; the work we did on adoption  when no one thought we could get anything done, and we stood up for a  number of really important bills; and the work we did on travel and  tourism to make sure our country could compete with other countries  around the world when it came to foreign tourists.   One of my favorite ones was when Senator Duckworth was pregnant and  wanted to have permission to bring her baby on the floor just for the  first year or 6 months when there were late-night votes and the like. I  thought that was  [[Page S6983]]  going to be really easy, and I told her we could get it done. Then,  every single month, I looked at her, and she was getting more and more  pregnant, and I realized I wasn't accomplishing my job. Roy and I  worked on that together.    One of my fond memories of that is Senator Hatch being surrounded by  media and being asked about it, and he said: Well, that is OK if we  have 1 baby on the floor, but what if we have 10 babies on the floor? I  said: We already have 10 babies on the floor.   In any case, we were able to get that done.   As Roy mentioned, on a more serious topic, the sexual harassment  rules--we instituted training, but we also updated the rules, which is  a very difficult issue. We were working with Senator McConnell and  working with Senator Schumer, as well as the House, to get that done.   Our work on protecting election officials--Roy, having been a  previous election official, understood that. We had a bipartisan  hearing with the secretaries of state from red States and blue States.  That was a major moment for me.   But probably the thing I most remember was on January 6 when we had  started the morning with this beautiful celebration and the ceremony of  this walk with the young women with the mahogany boxes. Everyone here  knows exactly what I am talking about. The insurrection went on, and  Roy showed so much leadership that entire day in working with his  colleagues, because while the police were on the frontlines, as we  recognized today, Roy was doing a lot of work in working out how the  process was going to work once we got through there. You know, he was  the guy who made that work late into the night.   Then, in the end, at about 3:30 in the morning, it was Vice President  Pence and Roy and myself and those three pairs of pages with the  mahogany boxes, walking through the corridors, where we knew that  throughout the Capitol there was broken glass and spray-painted  columns, and Roy just kept doing his job.   Afterwards, when we got to the House, we knew that democracy had  prevailed.   We came back to the Senate--remember this?--and the Sun was coming  up. It is like 4 in the morning at this point, and we decided to go  down to the Parliamentarian's offices, which were destroyed. One of the  beloved members of our Parliamentarian's staff's family picture was on  the floor. The whole thing was a mess. We stood there and committed  that we were going to not just clean up the Capitol and improve the  security but make this all better. That kind of drove my work in the  last year.   But what I most remember about that particular moment at 4 in the  morning is that we walked out of that room, which was ransacked, and  Roy looked at me, and he looked at me with that typical Roy  understatement, and he said: Well, see you tomorrow morning. And I go:  OK, Roy.   That is Roy. He did what he said he would do. We did a report  immediately on security in the Capitol--we got it done in 6 months-- with Senator Peters and Senator Portman about what had to be done. We  made a bunch of changes. We hired a new chief, and we went on from  there, because, for Roy, it is always, I will see you in the morning.   And we know, Roy, that we are going to see you in the morning, that  you are not going to be a stranger, that you will stay a friend to so  many of us. Thank you for your incredible service to the people of your  State, to this Senate, and to the United States of America.
