 Mr. President, I rise today to join Granite  Staters in mourning the loss of John DiStaso, whose tenacious, in- depth, and effective political reporting reflected--and was a tribute  to--New Hampshire's independent, skeptical, and engaged political  culture.   John got his start in our State as a correspondent for the New  Hampshire Union Leader. Beginning as a staff reporter in 1980, John  rose to spend many years as the senior political reporter at the Union  Leader, becoming an expert on the most pressing issues facing New  Hampshire and the political campaigns that help define the Granite  State and the Nation. Ending his tenure at the Union Leader in 2014,  John later took his talents to WMUR, where he helped lead the station's  political coverage.   For any of us who were the subject of his reporting, it was always  clear that  [[Page S2130]]  John loved what he did and deeply believed in the importance of  journalism to our democracy. He asked tough questions, he chased  scoops, and he brought a Granite State lens to everything he wrote.  Politics wasn't a game to him, and he took seriously his role of  bringing political news directly to the voters.   John is perhaps best known for setting the standard for first in the  Nation primary coverage, chronicling our primary for decades. First and  foremost, Granite Staters turned to him to get everything that they  needed to know as they grilled candidates at townhalls, and made their  choices at the ballot box. And John was surely on speed dial for  countless national political reporters who relied on him for his  insights and analysis on our unique and historic primary, because no  one knew the first in the Nation primary better than John.   Day in and day out, John tirelessly reported the news, ensuring that  Granite Staters always knew the latest, not only on elections but also  on critical issues facing our State, like the substance misuse  epidemic. No story was too big or too small for John. Throughout his  40-year career in the Granite State, he interviewed four sitting  Presidents, as well as countless New Hampshire elected officials and  national leaders.   The impact of this coverage extended far beyond the page or the  screen. Granite Staters are some of the most informed and engaged  voters in the country, and that is in no small part due to John's deep  commitment to sharing New Hampshire political news directly with the  people. His passion for reporting helped fuel the Granite State  practice of deeply engaged citizen participation in democracy.   John's love of journalism, his understanding of its importance to  nurturing and protecting, our democracy, and his commitment to getting  it right reflect the very best of New Hampshire--even if he was a  Yankees fan. He will be missed.                            ____________________
