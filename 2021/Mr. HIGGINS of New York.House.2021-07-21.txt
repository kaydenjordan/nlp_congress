 Madam Speaker, last year, in my hometown of  Buffalo, New York, we experienced a 90 percent increase in gun  violence; 355 people were involved in this.   As of July of this year, 46 people have lost their lives to gun  violence. This morning, the Gun Violence Prevention Task Force heard  from experts in community violence interventions. These experts  affirmed what we know; that gun violence in our country is tearing  families and neighborhoods apart. Their testimony adds support for our  efforts to provide $5 million in the American Rescue Plan Act funding  to groups in Buffalo to prevent and reduce violence before it occurs.   This funding will support trusted messengers, good messengers,  credible messengers; a coalition of peacekeeping organizations who will  work on our streets to stop violence before it occurs.   Congress passed the American Rescue Plan to deliver relief to  communities ravaged by the pandemic. Now our communities are facing a  spike in violence that began during the pandemic.   Madam Speaker, they need help, and they need help now.                            ____________________
