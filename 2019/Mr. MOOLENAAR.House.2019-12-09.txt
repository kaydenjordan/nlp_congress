 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Congressman  Dan Lipinski  for his leadership on this legislation. As always, I have enjoyed  working with him and serving with him as the founding co-chair of the  bipartisan Congressional Chemistry Caucus here in the House.   Chemistry has improved the daily lives of every American, and I want  to thank Chairwoman Johnson and Ranking Member Lucas for their  leadership working together to bring the Sustainable Chemistry Research  and Development Act of 2019 to the floor this year. This legislation  will further the incredible progress chemistry has already  [[Page H9362]]  made in the daily lives of people around the world, with new and  exciting products and lifesaving cures and innovations.   Chemistry also employs hundreds of thousands of people in good-paying  jobs and has made the country the world leader in an endless list of  industries and fields. Today's legislation will help that progress  continue by directing the Federal Government to improve its  coordination of sustainable chemistry research.   The Sustainable Chemistry Research and Development Act of 2019 will  bring together the Federal Government, the private sector, and the  scientific community to support groundbreaking research in chemistry  and keep our Nation at the forefront of innovation.   I thank my colleagues for their support.                                time  1530
