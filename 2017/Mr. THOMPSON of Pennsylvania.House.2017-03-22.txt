 Mr. Speaker, recently, the House  Education and the Workforce Subcommittee on Early Childhood,  Elementary, and Secondary Education hosted a hearing to discuss the  state of career and technical education in America, as well as changes  that can be made to strengthen CTE and better prepare students of all  ages for the workforce.   One of the biggest challenges facing career and technical education  is the stigma associated with it. Through the years, we have seen  wrongheaded claims that students involved in the trades lacked  ambition. Those misplaced assumptions are slowly subsiding, but not  soon enough.   CTE has established itself as a path that many high-achieving  students choose in pursuit of industry certification and hands-on  skills that they can use right out of high school, in training  programs, or in college.   At this hearing, we heard from many knowledgeable witnesses,  including Mike Rowe, the television host of the television show ``Dirty  Jobs.'' Mike shared his experience as a young student who didn't know  what career path he wanted to follow. So, he looked no further than his  local community college.   His eyes were open to hundreds of courses that he could afford to  study. And Mike said: ``That experience opened doors I didn't even know  existed. But that same experience is precisely what thousands of kids  are discouraged from pursuing every year.''   Mr. Speaker, the reality is, a huge gap exists in communities  nationwide. There are jobs out there, good family-sustaining jobs, but  the unemployed or underemployed are either ill-prepared or lack the  appropriate training to fill these vacancies. The answer to this  problem starts with career and technical education.   That is why last Congress I introduced Strengthening Career and  Technical Education for the 21st Century Act. This bill, which passed  the House in the fall by a vote of 405-5, aimed to close the skills gap  by modernizing the Federal investment in career and technical education  programs and connecting educators with industry stakeholders--the job  creators.   I look forward to reintroducing similar legislation with my Career  and Technical Education Caucus co-chair, Congressman Jim Langevin from  Rhode Island, later this month.   During the hearing, Mike Rowe described naysayers as viewing a job in  the trades as a ``vocational consolation prize.'' Well, Mr. Speaker,  nothing could be further from the truth. We must change this stigma,  this bias, and help encourage American students to study a career that  they are interested in and that they are passionate about. The list is  endless with career and technical education, and the jobs are out  there.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, today is Brain Injury  Awareness Day, and I welcome those who are in Washington today to share  their stories.   This is near and dear to my heart. I spent nearly 30 years in  healthcare rehabilitation services, and this was one of my areas of  practice and expertise. I served as a board member for the Brain Injury  Association of Pennsylvania, and I helped form a brain injury support  group for the patients and their families that I served.   The theme for this year's campaign is ``Not Alone.'' This is a  platform for educating the general public about the incidence of brain  injury, and the needs of people with brain injuries and their families.  The campaign also works to destigmatize the injury, empower those who  have survived, and promote the many types of support that are  available.   The need to raise awareness is great: more than 3.5 million children  and adults sustain an acquired brain injury each year, but the  incidence is unknown.   Mr. Speaker, everyone recovers at a different pace, but the support  the patient receives can actually let them know that they are not alone  in this fight.                            ____________________
