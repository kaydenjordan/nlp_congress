 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of repealing  the 2002 AUMF. The repeal of this authorization, which in 2002  authorized our use of military force in Saddam Hussein's Iraq, would  have no effect--none--on current U.S. military operations.   To be clear, as a former CIA officer who worked counterterrorism  issues, our own Nation's security is always my priority.   Today's vote is about that, our national security and the  responsibility of Congress to exercise its constitutional authority  over decisions of war and peace. It is not about one particular  President, party, or administration. It is about Congress'  constitutional responsibility, our duty to debate and vote on sending  our Nation's servicemembers off to war.   But Congress has long evaded this duty, allowing President after  President to use the 2001 AUMF--not this one, the one we are discussing  today--to authorize varied military operations without Congress taking  responsibility.   And after nearly two decades, the American people have waited to see  principled leadership on ending the cycle of endless war. We must  update the 2001 AUMF. But today's vote is on the now-defunct 2002 AUMF.  Repealing this AUMF is a good first step towards Congress taking  responsibility on behalf of the servicemembers we represent.                                time  1115     Madam Speaker, I rise today in recognition of the  selflessness, courage, and resilience of my constituent, Mike Lecik.   Mike served in the United States Air Force and deployed twice to the  Middle East as a military firefighter. After returning home to Powhatan  County, he was diagnosed with multiple myeloma, a blood cancer linked  to the carcinogenic conditions of his work.   The VA does not currently recognize the service connection between  firefighting and diseases such as myeloma, leaving many veterans like  Mike unable to get the care they need.   Since his diagnosis, Mike, and his wife, Tiffany, and their family  have demonstrated incredible strength, and I am deeply inspired by his  commitment to ensuring that no other military firefighters face these  same challenges.   In his service overseas and through his advocacy at home, Mike  represents the best of Virginia's Seventh District. Driven by his story  and in coordination with Mike, I recently introduced the Michael Lecik  Military Firefighters Protection Act. This bill would recognize cancer,  lung disease, and other serious illnesses as presumptive service- connected disabilities for our Nation's veteran military firefighters.    I thank Mike for his tireless work on this issue, and I thank my  colleague, Congressman Bacon, for joining me in this effort to do right  by the thousands of veterans and their families, people like my  constituent, Mike Lecik.                            ____________________
