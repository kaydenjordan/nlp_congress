 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to bid farewell to a vital  member of my team and my right-hand man in Rhode Island for the last 7  years. Seth Klaiman joined my staff as district director and then my  Rhode Island chief of staff after working for several cycles on my  reelection campaign. The people of Rhode Island's Second District could  not have asked for a more dedicated public servant.   Seth worked nonstop, and he embodied the phrase ``underpromise and  overdeliver.'' His organizational skills are unparalleled, and he was  instrumental in helping me manage my most valuable resource, my time,  on behalf of the people of Rhode Island.   Seth is leaving to serve as chief of staff to our State Treasurer,  Seth Magaziner. It is a terrific opportunity for him to continue to  serve the Ocean State. And while I am sad to see him go, I wish him the  very best of luck in his new role.   To Seth, his wife, Ann, and their new son, Sebastian, I offer my  sincerest thanks for your years making me look good and all the work  you have done on behalf of the people of Rhode Island. I often say that  we are only as good as the people around us, and I am lucky to have had  a decade spent with you.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the conference  report to accompany H.R. 6395, the William M. (Mac) Thornberry National  Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021. I have served with  Ranking Member Mac Thornberry for nearly 20 years, and I thank him for  his service to the Nation and for his bipartisan leadership.   Mac, it has been an honor, and you will be missed.   I congratulate my colleagues, particularly Chairman Adam Smith, for  his leadership in crafting the National Defense Authorization Act for  the 60th consecutive year.   The portions of the NDAA under my purview provide direction and  oversight for Special Operations Forces and  [[Page H6921]]  the defense intelligence enterprise. The bill supports scientists and  funds STEM programs that will diversify our workforce. It also advances  several policy priorities in artificial intelligence and cyberspace,  including 27 recommendations from the Cyberspace Solarium Commission on  which I serve.   Among the most important, notably, this bill establishes a long- overdue provision that I authored, the Senate-confirmed national cyber  director within the Executive Office of the President. The national  cyber director will be the singular point of strategy development and  implementation and will provide vital coordination to keep us safe in  cyberspace.   This bill also funds two Virginia-class submarines and the first  Columbia-class submarine. I was proud to work with Chairman Courtney to  fight cuts to the President's budget that would have eliminated a  Virginia-class submarine. I am equally proud to represent the workers  in Rhode Island who make such important and unique contributions to  building the most sophisticated weapons systems ever built, which are  vital to our national security.   In all of my efforts on the NDAA, I have been privileged to serve  with my ranking member, Congresswoman Elise Stefanik, by my side. I  thank her for her contributions and her commitment to bipartisanship.   I also want to thank my colleagues and the staff on the Intelligence  and Emerging Threats and Capabilities Subcommittee and my personal  staff for their tireless efforts to get the NDAA across the finish  line.   Finally, this bill provides a 3 percent pay raise for our men and  women in uniform, although no price can ever be put on their invaluable  service. Every day, servicemembers put their lives on the line to  protect our way of life and keep us safe at home, and we owe them an  enormous debt of gratitude that we can never repay.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan  commitment to national security.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Connecticut  (Mr. Larson) for yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of S. 578, the ALS  Disability Insurance Access Act, which ensures that individuals who are  diagnosed with ALS are not forced to wait to receive the Social  Security Disability benefits that they have earned and they so  desperately need.   The onset of a disability can be a difficult, challenging, and often  disorienting time. However, by eliminating the 5-month waiting period  for ALS patients to receive disability benefits, we can help families  facing this difficult diagnosis focus on their health and well-being  instead of worrying about how to keep a roof over their head or put  food on the table.   Madam Speaker, I applaud my good friend and colleague, Senator  Sheldon Whitehouse, for championing this bipartisan effort in the  Senate. He has been a strong voice for the ALS community as co-chair of  the Senate ALS Caucus, and I have been proud to work with him on this  legislation.   Madam Speaker, I also recognize our colleague here, Representative  Seth Moulton, for his leadership as well.   Madam Speaker, I also want to recognize one of my constituents,  Christa Thompson, who has been a dedicated crusader for the ALS  community. Christa knows the struggle all too well, as she has watched  her husband, Olin, battle this devastating disease.   Christa, a proud mother of three boys, made it her mission to engage  with me and my delegation colleagues early on, and it is in large part  due to her efforts and the efforts of ALS advocates everywhere,  including my good friend, J.R. Pagliarini, who has been such a champion  of ALS back in Rhode Island, that we will be able to provide some  important relief to families.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this important  measure.   Let's make a difference for these families and those diagnosed with  ALS.
