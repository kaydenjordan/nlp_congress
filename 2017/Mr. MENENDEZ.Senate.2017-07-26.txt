 Madam President, I intend to offer a motion to commit  the reconciliation bill to the Committe on Health, Education, Labor and  Pensions with instructions to report the same back to the Senate in 3  days, not counting any day on which the Senate is not in session, with  changes that prohibit eliminating or reducing funding to States unless  the Congressional Budget Office certifies that such changes will not  increase the number of uninsured Americans, decrease Medicaid  enrollment in Medicaid expansion States, reduce the likelihood  nonexpansion States will expand, or increase the State share of  Medicaid spending.   I am offering this motion to ensure individuals who gained coverage  due to the Affordable Care Act's Medicaid expansion do not lose their  coverage and States that expanded Medicaid are not penalized by this  bill.   The following Senators support my motion to commit: Durbin, Heinrich,  Udall, Booker, Shaheen, and Blumenthal.   I ask unanimous consent that the full text of my motion to commit be  printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                     Motion to Commit With Instructions          Mr. Menendez moves to commit the bill H.R. 1628 to the       Committee on Finance with instructions to report the same       back to the Senate in 3 days, not counting any day on which       the Senate is not in session, with changes that--        (1) are within the jurisdiction of such committee; and        (2) prohibit eliminating or reducing funding available to       States to provide comprehensive, affordable health care to       low-income Americans by eliminating or reducing the       availability of Federal financial assistance to States       available under section 1905(y)(1) or 1905(z)(2) of the       Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396d(y)(1), 1396d(z)(2)) or       other means, unless the Director of the Congressional Budget       Office certifies any such changes will not--        (A) increase the number of uninsured Americans;        (B) decrease Medicaid enrollment in States that have opted       to expand eligibility for medical assistance under that       program for low-income, non-elderly individuals under the       eligibility option established by the Affordable Care Act       under section 1902(a)(10)(A)(i)(VIII) of the Social Security       Act (42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(10)(A)(i)(VIII));        (C) reduce the likelihood that any State that has not opted       to expand Medicaid under the eligibility option established       by the Affordable Care Act under section       1902(a)(10)(A)(i)(VIII) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C.       1396a(a)(10)(A)(i)(VIII)) would opt to use that eligibility       option to expand eligibility for medical assistance under       that program for low-income, non-elderly individuals; or        (D) increase the State share of Medicaid spending under       that eligibility option.     Madam President, I intend to offer a motion to commit  the reconciliation bill to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor  and Pensions with instructions to report the same back to the Senate in  3 days, not counting any day on which the Senate is not in session,  with changes that No. 1, are within the jurisdiction of such committee;  and No. 2, ensure that the bill shall not take effect until the  Secretary of Health and Human Services certifies under oath, with  standing given to each State attorney general for any charges of  perjury, that no individual with a preexisting condition will be unable  to receive the necessary medications to sustain their life, limbs,  eyesight, or other necessary healthcare and medications for the  preexisting condition due to a State cutting essential health benefits,  minimum services, or necessary medication from the insurance plans  offered through their exchanges. I am offering this motion because  individuals with preexisting condition must not lose access to the  medications they need to manage their conditions and live full,  productive lives.   The following Senators support my motion to commit: Shaheen and  Blumenthal.  [[Page S4288]]    I ask unanimous consent that the full text of my motion to commit be  printed in the Record.
