 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Royce, Ranking  Member Engel, subcommittee Ranking Member Sherman, also my colleague  from Texas and the coauthor, Representative McCaul. I thank them for  all of their hard work on this.   Every day, diplomats work to advance the interests of the United  States, often at embassies and consulates in the most dangerous pockets  of the world. They risk their lives to be our Nation's frontline  civilians and are faced with having to adapt to changing technologies  that often come with security risks.   As Members of Congress, and especially those who conduct oversight of  the United States State Department, we must protect our diplomats who  serve our Nation from any threats posed by evolving technology,  including fitness trackers, for example, that expose location.   That is why I joined my fellow Texan, Chairman  Michael McCaul, to  introduce the Protecting Diplomats from Surveillance Through Consumer  Devices Act. This bill requires the State Department to account for  these devices in the security policies of U.S. embassies and consulates  worldwide and update embassy and consulate security policies by  addressing vulnerabilities associated with location-tracking consumer  devices worn by diplomatic personnel.   These frontline civilians risk their lives in service to the United  States. As lawmakers, we have a responsibility to ensure these brave  diplomats and development workers have the protections they deserve.   I am glad to see this bill being considered on the House floor today,  and I request and urge the support of all of my colleagues.
