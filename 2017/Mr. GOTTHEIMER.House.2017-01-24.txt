 Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition to the rule  and the underlying bill, H.R. 7. Forty-four years ago this week, before  I was even born, the Supreme Court recognized that the government has  no business coming between a woman and her doctor when it comes to  making personal medical decisions. Yet now, decades later, many in  Washington seem determined to turn back the clock on progress on  women's health and women's rights.   The new administration recently instituted a rule that would limit  the ability of women around the world to access accurate information  about their bodies and make their own medical decisions. And now the  House is considering a radical bill that would not only undermine a  woman's right to make her own healthcare decisions, but also her  ability to even choose her own health insurance plan. On top of that,  the bill would actually raise taxes on small businesses who provide  their employees with access to comprehensive health coverage and impose  unfair burdens on the women of the United States military. These are  the facts.    I will always fight back against efforts to limit choice in women's  health, and that is why I strongly oppose this bill. This past weekend  we saw millions of women around the country and around the world,  including hundreds in my own hometown of Wyckoff, New Jersey, where I  was, rally against these backward and dangerous policies.   I urge my colleagues to turn their focus from rolling back women's  rights to actually focusing on getting things done for the people of  this country--creating jobs and lowering taxes.
