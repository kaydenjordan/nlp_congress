 Mr. President, I appreciate what the leader just said  about COVID. It certainly reflects the feelings of people in my State  that we have to get going.   But I am here on a different matter today. Since the 1780s, we have  had an extraordinary list of Secretaries of the Senate. The outgoing  Secretary Julie Adams is one of those extraordinary people who have  been here, and I have had the distinct pleasure and honor of serving  with so many.   But let me be personal for a moment. On Monday, in my role as  President pro tempore, I will administer the oath of office to an  amazing person, Sonceria Ann Berry. She will become the Secretary of  the Senate.   This is a woman who earned her bachelor's degree in education from  the University of North Alabama, and she has had so much experience in  the Senate. She first worked for Senator Howell Heflin of Alabama.   I had the pleasure of serving with Senator Heflin--as I found when I  would travel to Alabama with him, he usually would be greeted with  ``Hello, Judge.'' He was a man who had an extraordinary sense of how  the Senate worked but made very clear to me how much he relied on Ann  Berry. She worked with other good friends of mine: Senator Pat  Moynihan, whose office was right down the hall from mine, and Senator  Edwards and Senator Carper. She took time out from her duties in my  office to help stand up Senator Jones' office.   She came to the Leahy office in 2007, and she worked with my chief of  staff, J.P. Dowd. They gave such leadership to my office, and I have  found that almost daily, I would stick my head into Ann's office and  say: Here is the situation; what do you think we should do here or  there? I knew what a go-to in the Senate she had been for generations  of staffers, a mentor to dozens of young staffers and interns. I have  also said over and over again that we Senators are merely a  constitutional impediment to our staffs. Well, this impediment was  delighted he could go to Ann Berry and seek help and advice.   I think of her and her family--Reginald, her wonderful husband, and  her daughter, Elizabeth, whom I have had a chance to see grow up to  become a young woman who is distinguishing herself working here in the  Senate.   I also think of her sayings, like ``This, too, shall pass'' or ``I  may have been born at night, but I wasn't born last night.'' ``There is  more than one way to skin a cat,'' or sometimes when we had been here  late into the night, she says, ``Nothing good happens after midnight.''  But with her, everything good happened.   I think of the Senate and all of us in it, in a way, as a family.  Over my years here, I have become more and more aware of that. But Ann  Berry truly was. I don't know how many times somebody working in my  office would have an issue--not just the professionals things; she was  always there to answer those and give direction. They would go in and  say, ``You know, I have had this thing that has been troubling me'' and  know that they could get wonderful advice but also advice in  confidence.   I will admit that my grandchildren, my wife and I think the world of  her. We do have one grandchild, now 15, but  [[Page S875]]  for the last few years, he would be in my office, and he would say, ``I  want to go leave a note for Miss Ann,'' and young Patrick would go and  leave notes for her. It is a kind of family.   I think the world of our majority leader. When he told me that he  wanted to appoint Ann Berry as Secretary of the Senate, I told him I  will forgive him this once only because of her extraordinary  capabilities.   I will speak more about her next week, but one thing that is going to  give me pride because of who it involves is that on Monday, as  President pro tempore, I will administer the oath of office to the  extraordinary Ann Berry, and I will do it as one of the proudest  moments since I have been here.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
