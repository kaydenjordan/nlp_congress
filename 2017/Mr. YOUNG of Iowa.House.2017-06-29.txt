 Mr. Speaker, yesterday, I was at the White House  with President Trump and the parents and relatives of those daughters  and sons who were killed by those who are here illegally. The stories  were very heavy. They should weigh on all of us.   One story that was shared was given by Michelle Root about her  beautiful daughter who was struck down and killed in a senseless way by  someone here illegally. Michelle is in the gallery here today, and she  is a great advocate.   In late January 2016, Sarah's parents, Michelle and Scott Root,  started their day with joy. On that day, their beautiful daughter,  Sarah, graduated. She had the whole world ahead of her. But for  Michelle and Scott, the day ended with loss and tragedy. It was the  unimaginable loss of their daughter. Sarah was killed by a drunk driver  here illegally. It is so senseless. Sarah had her whole life in front  of her.   Through incompetence and uncertainty about the law or the policy, or  both--but for sure, a lack of common sense--Sarah's killer was  released. Today, Sarah's killer is free.   Today, Sarah's parents, Michelle and Scott, and Sarah's brother,  Scotty, fight for Sarah's justice. They fight for her honor. They fight  to make sure no other parent or loved one has to go through the tragic  ordeal they had to go through.                                time  1500    My vote today is about policy, but it is in honor of Sarah Root. It  is hard to find a love stronger than a parent has for their child.  Sarah will always be loved and certainly not forgotten by her family  and friends and those who never even met her. She has touched their  hearts. They continue to advocate, and so must we.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the chairman, my colleagues in Iowa and  across the border in Nebraska who support this legislation and fought  for it to be incorporated into this bill.   God is taking care of Sarah now. Her memory lives on. I urge the  passage of this legislation.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. It is not in order to refer to persons in  the gallery.
