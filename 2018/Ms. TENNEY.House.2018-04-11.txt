 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4293, the Stress  Test Improvement Act, bipartisan legislation by my great colleague, the  gentleman from New York (Mr. Zeldin).   We keep hearing about megabanks, but all banks affect industries,  small businesses, and large businesses. So every time we adjust the  marketplace and we make more regulations, you also impact small  businesses as well, and our ability to survive. As the owner of a small  business, this affects me as well.   But stress testing is an important tool that can encourage the safety  and soundness of an individual depository institution and the overall  health of the banking system, including all banks, across all sizes and  sectors. However, the Federal Reserve has implemented its stress  testing in a manner that imposes unnecessary burdens without providing  proportionate benefits. This is especially true for smaller  institutions for which the cost of this exercise is disproportionately  burdensome. It can also affect larger banks.   H.R. 4293 would fix the tests so they can properly show smarter ways  to strengthen a financial institution's planning. This legislation  improves the Federal Reserve's stress testing processes mandated by the  Dodd-Frank Act by requiring a select group of banks, or bank holding  companies, to conduct internal, company-run stress tests once a year  rather than semiannually.   I want to thank Mr. Zeldin again for sponsoring this, as always, a  bipartisan piece of legislation. And it is important to note that, if  we are going to reduce regulations and burdensome fees and procedures  on companies, it has to be across all sectors, not just one. And I  think this legislation shows that and shows the sponsor's willingness  to do that.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman, and I urge all my colleagues on  both sides of the aisle to support this legislation.    Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize six high school  seniors who were selected as finalists for the Oneida County Good  Citizens Award, presented by the Oneida County Chapter of the DAR, the  Daughters of the American Revolution.   The 2018 finalists were Rachael Powles, Elizabeth Militillo, Crystal  Lin, Madden Barnes, Abigail Hall, and William Thomas. Rachael Powles  from Sauquoit Valley Central School was the first prize winner and will  go on to represent Oneida County at the State level.   These six outstanding individuals were chosen based on their academic  achievements, extracurricular activities, and an essay contest. These  students clearly have a great future ahead of them, and it is great to  see such strong youth leadership coming from Oneida County.   I wish the first prize winner, Rachael Powles, the best of luck as  she continues in the New York State competition, and, hopefully, we  will be seeing her in Washington, D.C., as a national finalist.   Madam Speaker, I ask that Members join me in congratulating these  students on displaying qualities of service, leadership, and  patriotism. The Daughters of the American Revolution is a highly  respected organization that is devoted to our community, our children,  and our Nation. Being a finalist in this wonderful organization is an  honor, indeed.                            ____________________
