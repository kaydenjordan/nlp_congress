 Mr. President, this week I have the honor of  recognizing Larry ``Skip'' Ahlgren of Petroleum County for his  dedication to his community and volunteer efforts.   Skip currently serves as president of the Montana Association of  State Grazing Districts and previously served as county commissioner.  These titles are only the beginning of his service to Petroleum County.  Skip and his wife Diane spend hundreds of hours volunteering in various  community groups and focus putting their time into Montana's youth.   Winnett Agriculture Community Enhancement and Sustainability, ACES,  is a group cofounded by Skip that brings Petroleum County producers  together to address the problems facing the environment and their  community. The group also works with Montana's youth to create  opportunities that will bring them back to the community where they  were raised. As farmers and ranchers play a key role in one of the most  rural counties in Montana, Skip saw an opportunity to serve them and  created this incredible organization.   Skip is described by friends and colleagues as an all-around good  guy, a man who embodies Montana values, and a true friend. It is my  honor to recognize Larry ``Skip'' Ahlgren for his service and  dedication to Petroleum County.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today to honor the legacy of  David W. Armstrong, Jr., of Helena, MT on the occasion of his 100th  birthday.   Dave is a distinguished World War II veteran who played a pivotal  role in the U.S. Army's plan to liberate Norway from Nazi occupation as  well as numerous search and rescue missions across northern Europe.   Dave first came to Helena in February 1943 to begin training sled and  pack dogs at nearby Camp Rimini. Camp Rimini was one of only two sites  that produced dogs for the Army's K-9 Corps during the war. Later, Dave  found himself stationed in Newfoundland, where he and his dogs  participated in the recovery of downed personnel and sensitive  equipment from aircraft wreckage sites in Greenland and Baffin Island.   After the war, Dave returned to Montana with his wife Alice and  founded the annual Race to the Sky, which preserves the legacy of the  soldiers and the dogs who served at Camp Rimini. Dave also preserved  the legacy of this special program in his 2008 memoir ``Camp Rimini and  Beyond.'' Were it not for his efforts, the memory of this unique  program and its special place in our State's history may have been lost  to time.   On behalf of a grateful Nation, I want to thank Dave for his service  to our State and to our Nation.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I have the honor of  recognizing Butte Police Officer Nick Butorovich for his heroism in the  face of danger.   On Tuesday, September 15th, 2020, during a routine late night shift,  he  [[Page S7847]]  pulled an unconscious woman from a rolled-over, burning car, just in  time, saving her life. The woman suffered second- and third-degree  burns, but because of Officer Butorovich's quick and selfless actions,  the driver is alive today.   Butte Sheriff Ed Lester told the community, ``This is an outstanding  example of a patrol officer doing his job and being in the right place  at the right time. If Nick arrived 30 seconds later or hesitated  because of the danger, this woman would not have survived.''   When Officer Butorovich arrived at the scene, he saw an SUV at an  intersection rolled over and burning--as other emergency personnel were  on the way. He immediately located the driver still hanging upside down  by her seatbelt in the burning car. She was unconscious.   As flames were consuming the car, Officer Butorovich quickly cut her  free and dragged her to safety--without concern for his own personal  safety. During the rescue, he sustained second-degree burns.   Butte Fire Chief Jeff Miller also agreed that the driver would not  have survived without his quick-thinking actions, saying, ``From what  my guys told me, when they arrived--and they were fairly close behind  the police--that it wouldn't have been long at all, that they most  likely wouldn't have been able to save her, that it would have been too  late. He was there just in time, took the appropriate action and  literally saved her life.''   Officer Nick Butorovich proudly continues the tradition of law  enforcement in his family. He is the grandson of former Butte Silver- Bow sheriff, the late Bob Butorovich, who served his community for more  than 12 years.   Officer Butorovich exemplifies what it means to serve as a law  enforcement officer in Montana, and I thank him for his heroism and  service.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I have the honor of  recognizing Shirley Anne Johnson of Missoula for her many decades of  service to her community through the Fraternal Order of the Eagles.   Mrs. Johnson was born in Bozeman, MT, in 1939 and lived in several  different communities across the State while growing up. She eventually  settled in Missoula with her husband Ted and became an elementary  school teacher. During those years, she joined the Fraternal Order of  Eagles Auxiliary and rose through the ranks, eventually chairing her  local auxiliary club and becoming grand auxiliary president for the  State of Montana.   During her work for the Eagles, Shirley donated much of her time to  the creation and maintenance of Missoula Manor Homes, a nonprofit  retirement home for seniors in need. Shirley and her husband were  involved in Missoula Manor Homes from the very beginning. They played a  direct role in securing land and overseeing its construction. In later  years, she donated her time to Missoula Manor Homes bake sales every  month, raising money for the residents of the facility.   Mrs. Johnson continues to serve her community, volunteering for the  Missoula Food Bank and remaining involved with the Eagles. She has 10  grandchildren and 18 great-grandchildren. In October, she was honored  with the Legion of Honor Award by the Chapel of the Four Chaplains for  her nearly six decades of community service.   Shirley Anne Johnson embodies the spirit of community that is so  common across Montana. I congratulate Shirley and thank her for  steadfast commitment to service.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I have the honor of  recognizing Mr. George McClure of Gallatin County for his decades of  service to the Bozeman community, including his 25 years as a volunteer  at Hospice of Bozeman Health.   George spent his career as a professor of architecture at Montana  State University. After many years of educating our State's next  generation of architects, he retired in the mid-1900s. Yet his service  to the community was not finished.   Once he retired, he began volunteering at Hospice of Bozeman Health.  For the last 25 years, George has shown up to volunteer every single  Tuesday. His volunteer work focuses on administrative and paperwork  jobs, allowing the nurses and other staff to be more focused on patient  care. The staff say of George that ``he magically gets it done'' and  that ``he is the wind beneath our wings.''   Even the COVID-19 pandemic has not slowed George down. Despite the  potential risk to his own health, he has continued to show up every  Tuesday throughout the pandemic to do his volunteer work. His presence  always gives the staff at Hospice of Bozeman Health a much needed  morale boost as they deal with the grim reality of the pandemic and  continue to care for patients.   I thank George for his tireless service and his courage to carry on  despite the hardship of the pandemic. He exemplifies what it means to  put service before self.                            ____________________
