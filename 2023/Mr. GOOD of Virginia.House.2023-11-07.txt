 Madam Speaker, I rise to recognize the 16  million brave men and women alive today who valiantly served this  Nation in the United States military.   Every year, on November 11, we unite as a nation to celebrate and  honor all veterans who selflessly put their lives on the line, fighting  for the freedoms that make this the greatest country on Earth.  [[Page H5481]]    Veterans have made considerable sacrifices serving this Nation. We  must honor them and ensure they receive the benefits promised for their  noble service. That is why I am introducing the Veterans Education is  Timeless Act of 2023, removing arbitrary expiration dates for education  benefits for veterans and their families.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill and uphold the  commitments we have made to the men and women who serve and fought on  our behalf.   As we approach Veterans Day, I express my profound gratitude to all  veterans and especially recognize the 45,000 who live in Virginia's  Fifth District. It is an honor to recognize and represent these  Americans who sacrificed so much to defend the freedoms we enjoy.                            ____________________
