 Madam President, I thank Senator Schumer for those kind  remarks earlier.   As you know, I announced last year that I wasn't running for  reelection, and if I had known everyone was going to be so nice to me,  I might have announced it earlier.   I am not the only Senator who is giving a farewell speech. Many of us  got to hear Lamar Alexander last week. Lamar is the perfect example of  what a U.S. Senator should be. Before I was wet behind the ears in the  Senate, in my first week here, Lamar invited me and Jill, my wife, to  dinner. There it began. Jill and Honey, Lamar's wife, became fast  friends, and Lamar and I grew closer, building the kind of friendship  that is essential here in the Senate. We worked together to get things  done for our States in bolstering our National Laboratories and  conserving our great outdoors. Something else we shared was Mario, our  barber in the Senate barbershop. To be honest, that is the best place  to learn the wisdom of the Senate--by sitting in Mario's chair.   Friendships like I have with Lamar and Mario are what I will miss  most about the Senate. It is the friendships because, as any good  Senator will tell you, friendships are what get you over the finish  line. I will cherish the friendships I have forged over the last 12  years.   I will miss serving the people of New Mexico in Congress. The  greatest honor of my life has been doing that, and I am confident that  New Mexico will be in good hands with my friend Senator Heinrich, my  great partner over the last 8 years. With his dedicated advocacy for  our communities and his love of the land--all of that--Martin has been  an inspiration, and Senator-Elect Ben Ray Lujan, whom I have the  privilege of calling a friend, I know will fight for New Mexico  families every single day in the Senate.   I will miss the righteous struggle we take up in these Halls to build  a more perfect Union, and I will miss all of you--my staff, colleagues,  and everyone who works around the clock--and the unsung heroes who keep  the Senate running, people like John, Leigh, Mary Anne, and all of the  folks who are here in front of you. There are too many to thank.   First and foremost, I thank my staff. Every Senator here knows we are  only as good as the people on our teams, and as my friend Patrick Leahy  says, we Senators are often just a constitutional impediment to the  staff. Over the years, I have been blessed with staffers who are full  of talent, skill, drive, and heart.   I don't want to leave anyone out, so I ask unanimous consent to have  printed in the Record a list of all of my staff who have been part of  Team Udall   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:         Ned Adriance, Anna Alexander, Beverly Allen, Anna Apodaca,       Gabe Apodaca, Lauren Arias, Michael Bales, Paloma Arroyo-      Lefebre, Jonathan Black, Greg Bloom, Jessica Borchert, Billy       Busch, Rene Camacho, Xochitl Campos, Jack Carpenter, Nick       Carter, Sameer Chintamani, Dorcas Cisse, Leeanne Clark, Sarah       Cobb, Emma Coghlan, Jennifer Collins, Michael Collins,       Clinton Cowan, Tiffany Cox, Laura Creech, Walter Cross, Kevin       Cummins, Cal Curley, Laura Davidson, Reyes De La Cruz,       Sabrina De Santiago, Leticia Delgado, Francesca Di Palma,       Kristine Dietz, Meredith Dixon, Noelle Dominguez, Elizabeth       Driggers, Pablo Duran, Roger Duran.

I want to say thank you from the bottom of my heart to  each of you for your hard work, your public service, and your  commitment.   I want to thank my family--my parents Stewart and Lee Udall, who  instilled in me the will to do good and to be good.   To my brothers, sisters--my sister Lori, who is here--and cousins who  [[Page S7252]]  have supported me throughout my three decades in elected office, thank  you.   To Amanda, our daughter, who is my forever campaign manager, and to  Judge Jim, our son-in-law and just recently a judge in New Mexico, I  thank them for their constant love and support.   Most importantly, thank you to my brilliant and beautiful partner of  42 years, Jill Cooper Udall. Jill has been my rock. She has been my  chief counsel. She has been my everything, and I couldn't have asked  for a better partner with whom to have this public adventure.   It has truly been an adventure for this son of the West, for after  20-plus years, it is time for me to go back home. As the great western  writer Wallace Stegner wrote, ``It is not an unusual life curve for  Westerners to live in and be shaped by the bigness, sparseness, space,  clarity, and hopefulness of the West--to go away for study and  enlargement and the perspective that distance and dissatisfaction can  give--and then to return to what pleases the sight and enlists the  loyalty and demands the commitment.''   Stegner said that we fall into two categories. We are either boomers  or stickers. Boomers ``pillage and run.'' Stickers are ``motivated by  affection, by such a love for place and its life that they want to  preserve it and remain in it.''   I am telling you here today that I am a sticker. I am also an  optimist. I want to be more accurate: I am a troubled optimist. I have  tried to open my eyes to the challenges we face, while never losing  conviction in our ability to meet those challenges.   As the scientist Rachel Carson said, one way to open your eyes is to  ask yourself, ``What if I had never seen this before? What if I knew I  would never see it again?''   I believe this Nation has arrived at a moment when we are opening our  eyes to the enormous challenges before us and also to their solutions.  Our planet is in crisis--facing mass extinction and climate change. Our  people are in coronavirus--ravaged by a pandemic that has laid bare the  inequities of our society. Also, our democracy is in crisis as the  people's faith in their government is shaken.   We cannot solve one of these crises without solving the others, and  that is why I am troubled, but all I have to do to be optimistic is to  look around me. I look at the young people across this country who are  calling for change, for climate action, for voting rights, for  immigrant rights, and for economic, environmental, and racial justice.  They have held sit-ins in my office--probably in yours too. They are  demanding that we do better, and their determination gives me hope. I  am optimistic as I look back on the small acts of kindness and the big  acts of progress that define my time in the Congress. I believe that  there are lessons in these accomplishments.   Now, you may know me as someone who wants to reform the filibuster,  but to be clear, I have always supported the talking filibuster. So, if  you will indulge me--and by the rules of the Senate, you have to; you  can leave, but I get to keep talking--   (Laughter.)   --I would like to talk about a few of the highlights of my career and  what I have learned from them.   As you know, protecting America's outdoor treasures is a cause close  to my heart. It is something of a family project. My family homesteaded  in the West almost 180 years ago, and like generations of Udalls before  me, I grew up with a special connection to the land--to the gorgeous,  untamed beauty of the West, to the 60-mile vistas, to the snow-covered,  rugged mountains, alpine lakes, and abundant wildlife. Mitt Romney  knows this, for our great-grandfathers settled the same small western  community. Stegner called the West the ``geography of hope.'' It sure  is for me. It is what has inspired much of my public service, and that  is why I am so proud of what we have accomplished together to conserve  our natural heritage.   On the Appropriations Committee, we have worked together for  resources for our public lands and environmental protection, on a  bipartisan basis, in the face of massive proposed cuts, and we have  held off anti-environmental riders that have had no place in these  bills.   Thank you to my friend Lisa Murkowski, who has been the best partner  I could ask for in this work. In New Mexico, where public lands are  central to our way of life, we have had enormous success unlocking tens  of thousands of acres of enchanted land for all of us to enjoy--and for  Martin to hunt on every now and then. Each of these efforts was  collaborative and community-driven, and that collaborative work has  culminated in one of the biggest conservation victories in American  history--the passage of the Great American Outdoors Act. Thanks to the  determination of a grassroots coalition and many champions here in  Congress, we got this bill over the finish line.   For the first time, we have realized the promise of the Land and  Water Conservation Fund--the promise my father envisioned almost 55  years ago, when he helped to create our Nation's most successful  conservation program. After more than 20 years of fighting for this in  Congress, I am thrilled we have gotten it done, and we have gotten it  done together.   The law is a model for how conservation and economic recovery can go  hand in hand. It will help us to achieve the urgent goal of protecting  30 percent of our lands and waters by 2030. Enacting the Great American  Outdoors Act, at a time of immense division, is a tremendous feat, and  it tells us a lot about what we are capable of. It tells us that  conservation is popular--a political winner. Environmental protection  can be an area of cooperative action, and it must be if humanity is to  survive and prosper.   As I talk about my love of the land, I cannot neglect to acknowledge  how much I have learned from the original stewards of this land--Native  Americans, indigenous people. I got my start in politics by working  with my father in fighting alongside the Navajo uranium miners who had  been hurt and many who had died. They had been hurt by this Nation, by  our nuclear weapons program. My work as vice chair of the Indian  Affairs Committee has been the honor of a lifetime and another area in  which this committee has achieved bipartisan progress.   I thank my chairmen, Senator Hoeven and Senator Barrasso before him,  for their partnership and friendship. We have worked together as a  committee for better healthcare, education, housing, and urgently  needed resources for Native communities, especially as they battle this  pandemic.   The Federal Government's obligation to uphold its trust and treaty  obligations is sacred. Some of my proudest achievements have been the  result of working with Tribal leaders to advance the Indian Country's  priorities and to support New Mexico's 23 Tribes   Recently, a bipartisan coalition passed legislation to strengthen the  principle of Tribal self-governance, provide Native entrepreneurs  critical resources, and secure investments in Native language  revitalization.   The achievements I remember most fondly are ones like these--those we  did together. Indeed, those are the only kinds of achievements that are  possible in this body.   Take the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century  Act--our landmark reform of the Toxic Substances Control Act. It was  the biggest environmental reform in a generation. I was proud to lead  that effort to protect our families from toxic chemicals. It was hard  work, and it took years. But if you can get a project where Jim Inhofe  and Ed Markey are working for the same goal, you can get a lot done  around here.   It is another example of how friendships get you over the finish  line. My friendship with David Vitter, my partner on TSCA reform, was  sort of like Ted Kennedy and Orrin Hatch's friendship, a political odd  couple--me, the son of Mormon pioneers; David, a son of New Orleans-- two very different political backgrounds and different views on the big  problems before us.   But I will never forget the dinner we had after Frank Lautenberg  passed away, when we decided to take on TSCA reform. We looked at each  other after that dinner and shook hands and said: We are going to get  this done.   And we did. It passed the Senate unanimously. We agreed that there  was a problem, and we found common ground on a solution. That is still  possible in the Senate.   But I didn't come here to just list accomplishments. You can check my  [[Page S7253]]  Twitter feed if you want to see more of that. I do want to share some  final thoughts about challenges our Nation faces before I leave the  Senate.   I believe that, for all of us here, public service is a calling. It  certainly is for me. In my life I have had the privilege of learning  from many dedicated servants. One of them was Senator John McCain.   Senator McCain was a friend to me and a friend to my family. When  John first came to the House, my Uncle Mo--big Uncle Mo, 6 feet 5  inches--took him under his wing. John did the same for me, and we  worked together on issues like campaign finance reform, Native American  issues, and others.   John often said to me: ``We disagree in politics--but not in life.''  Let's remember that. ``We disagree in politics--but not in life.''   My great-grandfather helped settle St. John's, a small farming and  cattle community on the Arizona-New Mexico border, in the 1880s. He had  an embroidery that hung on his frontier home that read: ``If the good  folks don't get into politics, the scoundrels will take over.''   I believe there are a lot of good folks here in the Senate, but the  system we are caught in makes it too hard to work together. We need to  remember that we disagree in politics but not in life.   I am not the first to say in a farewell address, and I won't be the  last: But the Senate is broken. The Senate is broken, and it is not  working for the American people.   We are becoming better and better political warriors. We are good at  landing a punch, at exposing the hypocrisy, and at riling each other  up, but we aren't fostering our better angels. Our peacemaking skills  are atrophied. Every hurt takes time to heal, and each time we hurt  each other, it sets us back.   But, unfortunately, the structures we have built reward us for  hurting one another. We need to reform those structures or we will  never make that progress we need to make.   I have proposed Senate rules changes when I was in the minority and  when I was in the majority to make sure this institution does not  remain a graveyard for progress.   The Founders did not envision a Senate requiring 60 votes to act. The  filibuster came to be through historical accident, and it is now woven  into the institutional framework. The promise of the filibuster is that  the majority will find common ground with the minority, but the reality  of the filibuster is paralysis--a deep paralysis.   On top of this, we have a campaign finance system that is out of  control. John McCain told you that over and over again, and he called  money the cancer growing on our democracy. And John McCain knew a lot  about cancer.   Secret money floods campaigns to buy influence instead of letting the  voters speak. Voting rights are under attack. We can do our best to be  good people in a system like that, but it is no surprise that America's  faith in government is declining.   These structures are antidemocratic. They reward extremism. They  punish compromise.   Our government is supposed to respond to the will of the majority  while protecting the rights of the minority. Instead, we have ``the  tyranny of the minority.'' That tyranny is super wealthy, politically  powerful, and dangerously out of touch with the American people.   The majority of Americans support pandemic relief, healthcare for  every American, action on global warming, racial justice and police  reform, and so many other priorities that don't see much progress in  the Senate.   People are losing their faith in the system--rightfully so. We have  to do something to fix this.   If we are to take bold action necessary to tackle the urgent problems  before us, we must reform our democracy. We must make it easier to  vote. We must end the dominance of Big Money, and we must root out  corruption.   And we do not have any time to waste. We have no choice but to be  bold because the crises before us demand bravery. Hundreds of thousands  of Americans are dead from a pandemic--a pandemic that this  administration has callously ignored, a consequence of its continued  rejection of science. In New Mexico, we have surpassed 108,000 cases,  over 1,700 are dead, and tens of thousands have lost their jobs.    Meanwhile, our Nation is facing dual climate and nature crises of  epic proportions. Earlier this year, much of the American West was  engulfed in wildfire. As an arid State, New Mexico is in the crosshairs  of climate change. We lose a football field's worth of nature every 30  seconds.   A million species are at risk of extinction because of human  activity. Our planet's life support system is under threat. As the  climate crisis worsens, ecosystems are destroyed, and as ecosystems are  destroyed, we emit more harmful greenhouse gases. We cannot solve one  crisis without solving the other.   Protecting nature is about protecting humanity. It is just that  simple. And marginalized communities, communities of color, low-income  communities, and indigenous people are bearing the worst consequences  of the environmental destruction and pollution caused by the rich and  the powerful.   We have the power to solve these crises--the power and the  obligation. All it takes is clear eyes and political will and  remembering that we may disagree in politics but not in the future that  we want for our children.   When I was a young man, I spent the summer of 1969 in the mountains  of Colorado, teaching students wilderness skills. Each night, we would  look up and open our eyes to the Moon. It seemed impossibly far away.   I am reminded of Rachel Carson's words: ``One way to open your eyes  is to ask, what if I had never seen this before?''   When we emerged from the wilderness, we learned what Apollo 11 had  achieved. We had landed on the Moon--the Moon that seemed so impossibly  far away.   We should never forget that we can do--we, all of us, can do--the  impossible when we open our eyes to the challenge and work together to  meet it.   So as I return home to the West, I am clear-eyed about--even troubled  by--how far away our destination is. But I am optimistic that we will  get there, like we always have.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following  members of my staff--Ned Adriance, Lauren Arias, Clinton Cowan, Renee  Gasper, Cara Gilbert, Annie Orloff, Leo Sheehan, and Lisa Van  Theemsche--be given floor privileges for the remainder of the 116th  Congress.
