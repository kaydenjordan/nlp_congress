 Mr. President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute. Upon such notification,  the Congress has 30 calendar days during which the sale may be  reviewed. The provision stipulates that, in the Senate, the  notification of proposed sales shall be sent to the chairman of the  Senate Foreign Relations Committee.   In keeping with the committee's intention to see that relevant  information is available to the full Senate, I ask unanimous consent to  have printed in the Record the notifications which have been received.  If the cover letter references a classified annex, then such annex is  available to all Senators in the office of the Foreign Relations  Committee, room SD-423.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                    Defense Security                                              Cooperation Agency,                                                      Arlington, VA.

The total estimated program cost is $500       million.        This proposed sale is consistent with U.S. law and policy       as expressed in Public Law 96-8.        This proposed sale will support the foreign policy and       national security of the United States by helping to improve       the security and defensive capability of the recipient, which       has been and continues to be an important force for political       stability, military balance, and economic progress in the       region.        The recipient and the United States Air Force (USAF) will       have the opportunity to fly together, which will support       disaster relief missions, non-combatant evacuation       operations, and other contingency situations. These services       and equipment are used in the continuing pilot training       program currently at Luke Air Force Base, Arizona. This       program enables the recipient to develop mission ready and       experienced pilots through CONUS training. The training       provides a ``capstone'' course that takes experienced pilots       and significantly improves their tactical proficiency.       Training is a key component of combat effectiveness.        The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not       alter the basic military balance in the region.        The prime contractors will be URS Federal Services, Inc.,       Germantown, MD and L3, Greenville, Texas. At this time, there       are no known offset agreements proposed in connection with       this potential sale.        Implementation of this proposed sale will not require the       assignment of any additional U.S. Government or contractor       representatives to the recipient. The USAF will provide       instruction, flight operations, maintenance support and       facilities. Approximately 100 U.S. contractors will provide       aircraft maintenance and logistics support for the F-16       aircraft.        There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness       as a result of this proposed sale.                            ____________________
