 Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Mr. Speaker, I rise with concern about some of the  wording in the preamble. I think this is the reason why we should  actually go through the normal process, not a suspension process for  something as critical as this resolution.   Clearly, I have no argument against the threat that Russia has  against democracies in Europe. My problem is with page 2, line 3: ``. .  . internal threats from proponents of illiberalism.'' That is a  progressive, leftwing dog whistle for Poland and Hungary. Why in the  world, as Russia is attacking Ukraine, and Poland is the center for  bringing our military assistance into Ukraine, why in the world in a  preamble would we appear to attack one of our NATO allies?   It is unnecessary. It is unwise.   Again, having a Center for Democratic Resilience, I don't have an  argument with that. My argument is with the preamble that clearly  includes inflammatory language toward two of our best allies in NATO:  Poland and Hungary.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
