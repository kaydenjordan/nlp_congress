 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of this  rule because it is time to, once and for all, end the harmful  regulations caused by this disastrous law.   Mr. Speaker, let me take just a few moments to talk to you about the  harmful effects Dodd-Frank has had on my home State of Texas. As of  just a few months ago, in Texas alone, 358 State or federally chartered  banks, credit unions, or thrifts have either closed or merged since  2010, when Dodd-Frank became law.   According to our Texas State Banking Commission, the last bank or  credit union chartered in Texas was in 2009, in a State with one of the  healthiest economies in the country. Mass consolidations and closures  have left many Texans few options, something the previous  administration promised.   While Dodd-Frank aimed at fixing our recovering financial system,  one-size-fits-all regulations have only hurt one person: the consumer.  Increased bank fees, less access to consumer credit products, 1,000- page rules, and billions of dollars in regulatory costs all have become  the hallmark of our financial system over the last 7 years.   To my friends on the other side of the aisle, I will leave you with  this: If you support crushing regulations that have hurt our community  banks and our credit unions, if you support taxpayer bailouts, if you  support an agency that is accountable to none, and if you support less  accountability for both Washington and Wall Street, would you please  vote against this rule and the underlying bill?   But if you support financial opportunity for all, taxpayer bailout  for none, less regulations on small community financial institutions,  and more accountability and transparency, then support this bill,  support consumers, and support Main Street America.   In God we trust.
