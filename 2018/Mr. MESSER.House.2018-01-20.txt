 Mr. Speaker, the Schumer shutdown is proving, once again,  that the U.S. Senate is broken.   The House did its job and voted to keep the government open. Now both  Republicans and Democrats in the Senate need to do their job, too.   Unfortunately, because of the filibuster, the Senate is being  governed by a liberal minority that would rather shut down the  government and play politics than pass President Trump's agenda and  listen to the will of the American people.   If they don't want to do their jobs, then we need to move on without  them. It is time to end the filibuster in the U.S. Senate. The American  people demand it. The Senate needs to change its rules.   If there was no filibuster, this government shutdown would already be  over, because the bill for government funding got 50 votes in the  Senate last night.   So let's stop the political games. End the filibuster, open our  government, and put the American people back in charge.
