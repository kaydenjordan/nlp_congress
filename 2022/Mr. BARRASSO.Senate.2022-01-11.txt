 Mr. President, I come to the floor today to join my  distinguished colleague from Arkansas. I agree with everything that he  has said about this latest power grab by the Democrats in the U.S.  Senate--of their effort to change the rules, to rig the rules, of  course, through an agenda which I see, as do so many Americans, as  radical and extreme and dangerous and scary. What the Democrats are  proposing right here is to muzzle the voices of half of the country.   So why are they doing this? Well, it really has nothing to do with  the priorities that are the priorities of the folks from my home State  of Wyoming or from the previous speaker's home State of Arkansas or  from the next speaker's home State of West Virginia. Oh, no, it has  nothing to do with that. It has nothing to do with the priorities that  the Gallup poll tells us are the concerns all around America: the  coronavirus and the crisis we face there; the crisis at the southern  border, where we are looking at almost 2 million illegal immigrants  coming into the United States; crime in the cities, with murders up  year after year and just amazingly up this year.   Then, of course, there are the raging fires of inflation, which are  cutting into people's paychecks so that money doesn't go as far. When  families in home States are looking at the fact that they are going to  be paying about $3,500 more next year than the last and the year before  that just to keep up, to maintain the quality of living, they have a  lot of concerns. What the Democrats are trying to do isn't even one of  them because the Democrats are trying to take a Federal takeover of  elections. That is what they are trying to pass. They want to cram  through a bill that they know otherwise would not pass.   So what is in the bill? Well, the Democrats want to do things like  ban voter identification. You know, in my home State of Wyoming and I  know in the previous speaker's State of Arkansas and the soon-to-be  speaker's State of West Virginia, we know that people believe, if you  want to get a ballot and if you want to vote, you should have to prove  you are who you say you are.   In the home State of the Presiding Officer and the former Presiding  Officer and in many States, if you want to go to a restaurant, you have  to show your papers to prove you were vaccinated or to go into a  building or to go to a sporting event. Yet the Democrats are proposing  that you shouldn't have to show anything to prove you even are who you  say you are in order to vote.   What about the incumbents who want to vote for this thing? Oh, did we  mention there are taxpayer dollars going to incumbent Members of  Congress to pay for their political campaigns? No wonder so many of the  Democrats have voted for this. It is money into their own pockets.   The Democrats want Washington, DC, to micromanage elections across  the country. They want to rig the rules of the Senate so they can enact  this unpopular bill to take over elections in America.   The American people aren't asking for this. This recent Gallup poll  that I alluded to asked people what they thought was the most important  issue facing the country. Voting laws didn't even crack the top 20. In  a list of 23, it came in as 23rd. It is the Democrats' No. 1 priority,  and it is the last priority of the American public. It wasn't even an  asterisk. It didn't even get 1 percent of the vote.   If the Democrats take over the Senate to take over elections and  break the rules of the Senate, there will be no stopping them from  passing the rest of this dangerous and extreme agenda.   Democrats know that there is an election coming in November. They can  read the polls. They know it is not looking good for them. They know  there is a very unpopular President in the White House. They know that  their numbers are sinking, that their ship is sinking, and that they  will soon be in the minority in both the House and the Senate.   Frankly, the election for the Democrats in the election after that  doesn't look so good either because it only took 1 year for the people  all across the country to recognize that the current President of the  United States, Joe Biden, is both overwhelmed and ineffective as the  President of the United States. There is no denying that.  [[Page S139]]    Changing the rules, as the Democrats are proposing to do, really is  their last chance to pass their leftwing, fringe ideas. It is the last  chance to pack the Supreme Court. The Democrats in this body introduced  legislation to pack the Supreme Court, to add four Democrats to the  Court. It is the last chance to add new States to the Union. It is the  last chance to give amnesty to millions of illegal immigrants. It is  the last chance before Democrats lose control of the Congress.   So why do they want to change the rules? It is because their agenda  is so unpopular with the American people. They understand, as one  Democrat said to another, that we have got to do it now because it is  our last chance to force socialism on the American people whether they  want it or not.   Instead of changing the rules, the Democrats should change their  agenda. The Democrats should focus on what the American people say is  important to them. It is our constituents who determine what is  important to them. They are to communicate it to us. We are to  represent them.   What is important to them? Well, it is getting ahead of the  coronavirus, it is securing the border, and it is really to stop adding  fuel to the fire of inflation when paychecks can't keep up with the  costs of gas and groceries.   A Wall Street Journal story yesterday was about all of the Democrats  who signed a letter saying: money from New England, Members of this  body--they said energy costs are so high, the government should do  something about it. This is after Joe Biden kills the Keystone XL  Pipeline and stops oil and gas exploration, and their own home States  are blocking pipelines which could carry inexpensive energy to the  people who live there. Yet the Democrats want the government to do  more. The government has done enough damage already.   There are lots of ideas that could pass the Senate and the House and  be signed into law that would actually help the American people. Those  are the things the American people are asking for. The American people  are not asking for a blatant Democrat power grab to force through a  very liberal agenda. People don't want to be muzzled. They don't want  to have their voices silenced. They want real solutions. They don't  want the Democrats' radical agenda.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I come to the floor to congratulate and  commend the remarks by the senior Senator from Alaska. She certainly  knows from whence she speaks.   I remember so well the discussion that she just mentioned with regard  to the energy bill and HRCs and the effort for a cleaner environment,  and it was through the process that we were able to come up with  legislation that we believe--all believe--was a better result for the  Nation and for the environment.   It took longer than any of us wish it would have taken, but it was  through that process. And had we been in a situation without the  ability to filibuster, we would have never gotten to such a good result  because a 50-50 Senate is--basically it is a mandate to move to the  middle.   So I commend the senior Senator from Alaska. She knows from whence  she speaks. She is very high up in seniority in the institution. She  has institutional memory, more than many, many Members of this body,  and when she says what goes around comes around and the shoe is, at  another time, on the opposite foot, she knows what the implications of  those are and why what the Democrats are proposing now is in the wrong  direction for the country.   So I believe it is misguided, and I concur with her comments.  [[Page S146]]                                     Nord Stream 2    Mr. President, I come to the floor today on another matter, and that  is to support sanctions on Vladimir Putin and his Nord Stream 2  pipeline.   This body will be voting on that very issue in the next day or so,  and I am urging my colleagues to support S. 3436, which is known as  Protecting Europe's Energy Security Implementation Act.   Let me just explain why this is so important. And it is important  because right now, Vladimir Putin has mobilized close to 100,000 troops  near the border with Ukraine. They are nearly encircling the country of  Ukraine. Our intelligence community has warned of a potential Russian  invasion of Ukraine in the next month or so.   So why is this happening? Well, Vladimir Putin has always wanted to  control and dominate Ukraine. This is nothing new. He invaded in 2014.  He illegally annexed Crimea and continues to occupy Crimea today. Now,  he wants more, and he is now also flush with cash. With Joe Biden in  the White House and the Democrat energy policies, Vladimir Putin has  hit the energy financial jackpot.   You don't have to take my word for it; take it from the Biden  administration. Joe Biden's Under Secretary of State for Political  Affairs is one of his top Russia experts for our own State Department.  She has spent her entire career working on issues related to Russia,  Ukraine, and Europe.   Well, in December, she testified before the Foreign Relations  Committee. She testified about increasing Russian aggression on the  Ukraine border. She said, ``Energy is the cash cow that enables these  kinds of military deployments.''   She said Vladimir Putin ``needs the energy to flow as much as the  consumers need'' it to flow.   But why is that? Well, it is because of Russian energy that Putin is  able to pursue these dangerous military ambitions.   The late Senator John McCain, with whom I have traveled on several  occasions to Ukraine, used to say, ``Russia is a Mafia-run gas company  disguised as a country.''   Energy is the only successful sector of the Russian economy. Natural  gas is what is propping up the Russian military and the entire Putin  regime. Vladimir Putin uses energy as a geopolitical weapon, and he  knows how to use it.   He uses energy to coerce and to manipulate our allies and our  partners in Europe. If they don't do something that Putin wants or they  do something that he doesn't like, he can turn off the power and turn  off the heat. We just saw an example of this in November, when Russia  threatened to cut off gas flows to the small and neighboring country of  Moldova. Moldova had to declare a state of emergency.   Well, under Joe Biden's energy policies, Europe will soon be in a  state of energy emergency as well. It is because Europe already gets  almost half of its gas imports from Russia. With the Nord Stream 2  pipeline from Russia to Germany, the imports will only need to go up,  and they will go up.   Under Secretary Victoria Nuland told the Senate Foreign Relations  Committee, ``We have been counseling Europe for almost a decade now to  reduce its dependence on Russian energy.''   A decade. A decade includes the administrations of both President  Trump and President Obama. Yet Joe Biden has done everything he can to  cripple American energy production.   What happens with that? Well, it makes our allies more dependent on  Russia for energy. It gives more power to Putin.   Under Joe Biden, American energy production hasn't really recovered  yet to the 2019 levels. This is a direct result of the anti-American  energy policies of this White House.   On his first day in office, Joe Biden killed the Keystone XL  pipeline. He then blocked new oil and gas leases on Federal lands. We  are now producing 1.4 million fewer barrels of oil each day than we  were before the pandemic.   We are, in the U.S., now, using more oil imported from Russia than we  are using oil from our own home State of Alaska. It is a national  disgrace to be dependent more upon Russia for oil than we are from our  neighboring State of Alaska.   Joe Biden's National Security Advisor even pleaded with Russia to  produce more oil--hard to believe, hard to believe that the National  Security Advisor for Joe Biden in the White House would plead with  Russia to produce more oil.   Well, the administration actually put the Russian energy request on  the White House website. Joe Biden would rather have America buy energy  from our enemies than sell energy to our friends.   Joe Biden would rather have European nations dependent on Russian  energy than increase American energy production and exports from home  here to our allies. It is completely backwards.   Under Joe Biden, American energy production is down and energy  prices, as any consumer knows, is way up. American families are caught  paying the price for these policies of the Democrats and the Biden  administration.   In November, we saw the biggest energy price increase in 10 years.  CNBC reports that one in five American families can't afford to pay an  energy bill this year. Roughly the same percentage have kept their home  at an unhealthy low temperature because they can't afford the cost to  heat their home. People who traveled for Christmas just faced some of  the highest Christmas Day gasoline prices in history. American families  are getting squeezed, and Putin is getting rich.   Joe Biden is against American pipelines, but in May, he gave a green  light to Vladimir Putin's pipeline between Russia and Germany. This is  a betrayal of American energy workers. It is a betrayal of America's  allies in Europe.   If the Nord Stream 2 pipeline is completed, it will double the amount  of Russian natural gas flowing into Germany. Putin will be able to  manipulate the price and the availability of energy to European nations  in the middle of winter. He will be able to hold half of Europe  hostage.   Stopping this pipeline should be an area of bipartisan agreement in  this body. In fact, it was an area of bipartisan agreement until Joe  Biden became President. Even Joe Biden said that he was against the  pipeline--well, until he was for it.   Many Democrats voted for the sanctions against the pipeline on more  than one occasion, but when Joe Biden flip-flopped, so did they.   Senate Democrats now are running interference for Joe Biden. But  Democrats just spent 4 years talking about Russia, Russia, Russia-- obsessed with Russia. They spent 4 years going on TV, spreading  conspiracy theories, all of which were false.   Yet now, the Democrat caucus is attempting to protect the Kremlin's  greatest geopolitical weapon.   For the Democratic Party, this is a return to tradition. Democrats  were soft on Russia during the Cold War, soft on Russia under the Obama  administration. Hillary Clinton gave the Russians a great big reset  button. President Obama was caught in a hot-microphone moment telling  the Russian President at the time that he would have more flexibility:  Tell Vladimir I will have more flexibility after I am reelected.   Democrats talk tough--they did under the last administration, that  is. But now we are back to the old Democratic playbook. This is the  kind of Washington, DC, partisanship the American people hate--the same  thing Democrats did with Iran when Barack Obama was in the White House.   An American President must always negotiate from a position of  strength. Democrats tend to think if you give Putin or the Ayatollah  something they demand, that they will then play nice. That is not how  the real world works. Vladimir Putin is cunning, he is opportunistic,  and he is aggressive. He sees an opportunity, and he takes it. He can  smell weakness. He respects strength, not statements.   The Nord Stream 2 Pipeline from Russia to Germany will be an enormous  transfer of wealth from our allies to our enemy. It will make our  allies weaker, and, of course, it will make Vladimir Putin stronger.  When Putin gets stronger, he gets even more aggressive.   History should not be kind to those who gifted Putin a pipeline,  pointed like a gun into the heart of Europe.   This vote to support sanctions on the Nord Stream 2 Pipeline is our  chance  [[Page S147]]  to undo a great mistake, and it may also be our chance to prevent an  even greater mistake.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.
