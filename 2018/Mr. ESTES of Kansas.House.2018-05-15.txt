 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address one of the  important drivers of our economy: The way we develop the workforce of  tomorrow.   Since the founding of our country, American workers have led the way  in being the most productive and innovative in the world. However,  technology and changing demands require that we identify new ways to  maintain our competitive edge.   After nearly 10 years of stagnant growth, our economy is, once again,  booming, thanks to cutting taxes and cutting regulations. Yet today,  our economy faces a new challenge. At this moment, there are a record  6.6 million job openings in our country.   While we currently have the lowest unemployment rate in 18 years,  there are still millions of Americans looking for a job. However, every  day, I hear from employers throughout Kansas, and our country, about  their difficulty filling open jobs because our workforce does not have  all the skills it needs.    I believe this is because, for decades, politicians, educators, and  even parents, have told students that the only way to succeed is to get  a 4-year college degree. While a college degree is extremely important,  some jobs are critical in requiring that. Today, we are seeing that  many college students are graduating with crippling student loan debt  and have trouble finding a job, while we have a shortage of skilled  labor positions, such as welders, machinists, truck drivers, and people  with other needed skills.   Because of this, I believe we have no choice but to change the way we  are developing our workforce. We need to empower students to have more  opportunities to prepare for the careers they want, whether through  technical schools, community colleges, or universities.   Kansans have led the way with this by passing Kansas Senate bill S.  155, which allows high school students to graduate with either, or  both, a technical or college-ready certificate. Through this effort, I  believe Kansans can serve as a model for this country on how we train  our workforce.   As a Member of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, I  have been proud to work on several ways to do this, including amending  the Prosper Act, which will reform higher education and student aid, to  allow students to complete work studies as apprentices in the fields  that they are studying.   That amendment will help students to be more marketable once they  finish their degrees, and builds on our need to support apprenticeship  programs throughout the country. This also helps minimize outlandish  student loan debt too many students and families are racking up.   In addition to working on the Prosper Act, I have also proposed the  HOPE Act, which will allow TANF assistance dollars to go toward a  successful workforce development program, one which is called Jobs for  America's Graduates, or JAG.   Earlier this month, I met with some JAG students at Newton High  School in Newton, Kansas, and heard about how the program has prepared  them for their careers after high school. Allowing more TANF dollars to  go toward this program can help many at-risk students and get more  people off of assistance and on to successful lives.   These are part of our overall goal of making sure every American can  get the skills they need to fulfill their potential.                                time  2030    Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairwoman Foxx and the Education and the  Workforce Committee for their work towards this goal. Together, we can  advance legislation which will maintain and grow America's leadership  in our global economy.    Mr. Speaker, that is right. We have an  innovative aerostructure environment in Wichita. In fact, Wichita is  known as the air capital of the world. We are always looking for  skilled employees to fill those jobs, to help keep planes running, keep  parts being produced through the process.   Our businesses have worked with community colleges and partnered with  Wichita State University and are partnering with high schools to help  make sure that the skills are available so those employers can have the  employees that they need to help keep their operations running.   It has been a great transition we have made as we have gone through  the baby boomers, who are now starting to retire and starting to leave  the workforce. We need to make sure that we have enough skilled  employees to replace them as they are retiring and make sure that we  keep America's economy growing strong.
