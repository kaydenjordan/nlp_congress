 Madam President, in a bit, I hope to be able to put  forward and pass a unanimous consent request, asking the Senate to take  up and approve the nomination of Ms. Michele Taylor to serve as the  U.S. Representative to the U.N. Human Rights Council, with the rank of  Ambassador. Before I put that request forward, I want to  [[Page S770]]  take just a few minutes to talk about why Ms. Taylor is, in my view,  the right choice for this important role and why the Senate must act on  her nomination quickly.   In blunt terms, Michele Taylor is simply a champion for fundamental  human and political rights. She now serves on the board of the National  Center for Civil and Human Rights. She has been a leader with other  humanitarian groups, including the Anti-Defamation League and the U.S.  Holocaust Memorial Museum Council. She has battled for the rights of  women and other vulnerable Americans.   On a personal level, I come from a family who lost some relatives in  the Holocaust. Ms. Taylor is the daughter of a Holocaust survivor. It  is absolutely essential that fighting against the rise of anti-Semitism  is a key part of America's diplomacy. Ms. Taylor certainly understands  that.   I am confident she will work to lead our partners and allies toward a  more peaceful, prosperous future, grounded in respect for human  dignity.   In the Senate, there is bipartisan interest in ensuring that the  United States stands up and battles for human rights around the world.  For example, on the Finance Committee, Senator Brown, Senator Crapo,  and I have put in a lot of hours in recent years to address the scourge  of forced labor in China and elsewhere in the world. I know, also, that  this is a subject that the President of the Senate cares deeply about.  This is just one of the human rights atrocities that our country must  stand up to forcefully.   The Senate must show that our concern for these issues is more than  just idle talk. That is why the Senate must not delay the nominations  of highly qualified individuals, like Ms. Michele Taylor, who are up  for consideration in key roles in advancing human rights.   There is a matter of the sensitivity of the time as well. The regular  session of the U.N. Human Rights Council begins on February 28, which  is, obviously, just days away. It is essential, in my view, that we  confirm our representative now. Delaying Ms. Taylor's confirmation  simply hinders the United States' ability to advocate for American  values and help vulnerable people who are suffering under abuse and  oppression around the world.   Moving this nomination forward is an opportunity for the Senate to  show this Chamber's commitment to advancing human rights is, in fact,  more than just talk. There is a deadline--a specific, concrete  deadline, February 28--that is bearing down on the Chamber. There  simply is no more time to delay on this important nomination.   We await a colleague who would like to have a chance to be heard on  this, to consider it. I do hope that we can work this out here in the  afternoon. Hopefully, the Senate will wrap up business this afternoon  because this really is time-sensitive.   Members talk about matters that actually may be coming up; this one  is upon us. I do hope that we will be able to clear Ms. Michele Taylor  to serve as U.S. Representative to the U.N. Human Rights Council with  the rank of Ambassador before the close of business today.   Thank you.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, earlier this afternoon, I made it clear I  was going to put forward a unanimous consent request asking the Senate  to take up and approve the nomination of Michele Taylor, to serve as  the U.S. Representative to the UN Human Rights Council with the rank of  Ambassador, and in just a minute and a half or so, I will make that  unanimous consent request.   Ms. Taylor has an exceptional record with respect to humanitarian  issues. She has served on the Anti-Defamation League, the U.S.  Holocaust Memorial Council. She has been a strong advocate for the  rights of women.   I come from a family who lost relatives in the Holocaust. Ms. Taylor  is the daughter of a Holocaust survivor. And it is absolutely essential  that we up the ante in the fight against anti-Semitism, and that is a  key part of this country's diplomacy.   The reason that I am making this unanimous consent tonight is that  Michele Taylor is unquestionably qualified for this important post, but  there is a real time sensitivity to her nomination being cleared  tonight. The regular session of the U.N. Human Rights Council begins on  February 28, obviously just a few days away. It is absolutely essential  that we confirm our representative now. Delaying Ms. Taylor's  confirmation would obviously hinder the U.S. ability to advocate for  American values and help vulnerable people who suffer under abuse and  oppression around the world. And she will be able to build on some  particularly important work that is going on in the Senate Committee on  Finance, led by Senator Brown and Senator Crapo, working, for example,  on forced labor and other issues that involve critically important  human rights questions.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to executive session to consider the following nomination:  Calendar No. 640, Michele Taylor, of Georgia, for the rank of  Ambassador during her tenure of service as United States Representative  to the UN Human Rights Council; that the Senate vote on the nomination  without any intervening action or debate; that the motion to reconsider  be considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action  or debate; that any statements related to the nomination be printed in  the Record; that the President be immediately notified of the Senate's  action.    Mr. President, today is a doubly special day. February 17  is the 46th anniversary of the founding of the Pension Rights Center.  February 17 is also the birthday of Karen Ferguson, the long-time  director of the Pension Rights Center, who passed away recently.   The Pension Rights Center as helmed by Ms. Ferguson was known as a  tireless advocate for the right of workers and senior citizens to enjoy  a dignified and secure retirement. Their passion for retirement  security is something that I have also shared since the 1970s, when I  helped to found the Oregon Gray Panthers, an organization dedicated to  improving the lives of senior citizens. The support of the Pension  Rights Center and Ms. Ferguson was instrumental in the passage of  recent legislation such as the Setting Every Community Up for  Retirement Enhancement Act of 2019 and the financial assistance program  for distressed multiemployer pension plans in the American Rescue Plan  Act.   On this double anniversary, I urge my colleagues to reflect on the  progress that has been made so far in improving retirement security in  the United States and to double down in our efforts to fight for  further improvement.                            ____________________
