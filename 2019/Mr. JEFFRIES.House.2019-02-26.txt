 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Democratic Caucus, I  offer a privileged resolution and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 148         Resolved, That the following named Members be, and are       hereby, elected to the following standing committees of the       House of Representatives:        Committee on Ethics: Mr. Brown of Maryland.        Committee on Natural Resources: Mr. Tonko.        Committee on Small Business: Mrs. Craig.        Committee on Veterans Affairs: Mr. Levin of California (to       rank immediately after Mr. Lamb).    Mr. JEFFRIES (during the reading). Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous  consent that the resolution be considered as read and printed in the  Record.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentleman for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this so-called declaration that  is anchored in a phony, fraudulent, and fake national emergency.   There is no crisis at the border. There is no basis in law or in fact  for this unconstitutional emergency declaration.   Illegal border crossings have not increased; they have decreased.  There is no evidence of increased criminal activity on the border.  There is no evidence of increased drug trafficking on the border. There  is no evidence that terrorists are pouring into the United States of  America on the southern border.   This is a fantasy made up by a xenophobic administration to support a  medieval border wall that this Article I Congress rejected. That is why  House Democrats will work to defeat it.   Mr. Speaker, vote ``yes'' on the resolution of disapproval.
