 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  the 40th anniversary of the CBYX program.   This unique program has had more than 26,000 American and German  participants contributing to the cultural and political exchange among  the citizens of our countries, tying us ever closer together.   As co-chair of the German-American Caucus, my office is proud to host  Pau Drexler. He is 23 years old and hails from the southwestern part of  Germany.   On August 9 of last year, Pau and 74 other young professionals from  Germany landed in Washington, D.C., to start an exchange year as part  of the Congress-Bundestag Youth Exchange. As the word ``exchange''  implies, 75 young Americans landed during that same time in Frankfurt,  Germany.   As part of the program, participants aged between 18 and 25 are  placed from Alaska to Texas and New York City to Los Angeles. This  diversity is reflected in the great variety of jobs that they are  trained in. Whether bakers, mechanics, or tailors, the CBYX program is  an ideal occasion to exchange knowledge, skills, and experience on a  professional level, but there are personal connections that emerge from  the participants' immersion into daily life of their host communities,  as well.    Many of Pau's fellows have already formed great bonds with their host  families and classmates. Consequently, Clara, a participant of the 35th  CBYX cohort who also interned on the Hill, visited her initial and  Pau's current host family last weekend in D.C.   The CBYX program is jointly funded by the U.S. Congress and the  German Bundestag. It is an extraordinary chance for young minds to  learn about different perspectives and create a better understanding of  these in their host and their home communities.   Mr. Speaker, as the chairman of the German-American Caucus, I want to  emphasize the importance of this program as it strengthens the bonds  between our countries not only on a governmental but also on a civic  level.   The CBYX is an unprecedented exchange program and a great example of  how cultural and political exchange amongst citizens can positively  impact international relations in a different, more grassroots, and  hands-on way.                   Mount Jewett to Kinzua Bridge Trail Club     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  congratulate the Mount Jewett to Kinzua Bridge Trail Club for winning  Pennsylvania Trail of the Year.   This section of the Knox and Kane Rail Trail in McKean County is a  7.8-mile-long trail. The former rail line now provides a level trail  for walking, jogging, biking, and horseback riding. In winter months  cross-country skiing and snowmobiling are also popular.   The Knox and Kane Rail Trail spans four counties in Northern  Pennsylvania and is a source of outdoor fun for the whole family,  whether you are local or, quite frankly, a visitor passing through.   The Pennsylvania Trail of the Year Award is given by the Department  of Conservation and Natural Resources to help build enthusiasm and  support for trails across the State and to raise public awareness about  the value of Pennsylvania's land and water trail network.   Mr. Speaker, Pennsylvania continues its tradition of being a leader  in trail development by providing its citizens and visitors with more  than 12,000 miles of trails.   Congratulations to the Mount Jewett to Kinzua Bridge Trail Club for  this tremendous accomplishment.                            ____________________
