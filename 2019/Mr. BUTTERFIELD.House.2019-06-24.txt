 Mr. Speaker, yesterday, at World Tabernacle Church  in Rocky Mount, North Carolina, I had one of the highest honors in my  life, to speak at the funeral service for Private First Class William  Hoover Jones who served in the Korean war.   He went missing on 26 November 1950. His remains were recently  returned to U.S. soil by the North Koreans. The funeral service was  handled by H.D. Pope Funeral Home, and he will be interred at Arlington  National Cemetery on August 22 of this year with full military rites.   Mr. Speaker, with your permission, I will read into the Record my  remarks from the funeral:   ``As Representative for North Carolina's First Congressional  District, please allow me to extend official condolences to this family  on behalf of the President and Congress of the United States of  America.   ``PFC William Hoover Jones gave his young life on the battlefield on  foreign soil in defense of our country as part of the historic 24th  Infantry Regiment, a Black Army regiment first organized in 1869  following the Civil War.   ``Private First Class Jones fought on the front line for the Republic  of South Korea during the Korean war.   ``For his service, Private First Class Jones was promoted to private  first class and posthumously awarded the Purple Heart, the Combat  Infantryman Badge, the Korean Service Medal, the National Defense  Service Medal, the Republic of Korean Presidential Unit Citation, and  the Republic of Korea War Service Medal.   ``This Nation is indebted to PFC Jones for his service to our country  and for offering the highest sacrifice for freedom. His life.   ``PFC Jones was born in Nash County in 1931 at the beginning of the  Great Depression. Life in Nash County during that period was Third  World. Not only did African Americans suffer from second-class  citizenship, but they suffered from extreme poverty. Undoubtedly,  William Hoover Jones wanted a better life.   ``On 31 May 1950, at the tender age of 18, Hoover enlisted to serve  for 3 years in the Army, recognizing that he would be deployed to Korea  to engage in a deadly war. I am confident that he volunteered not only  to defend our Nation and our Nation's interests, but to seek a better  future for himself.   ``The record reflects that Private Jones was poorly trained as an  infantryman. History reveals that most Black soldiers of that era were  poorly trained. Though his training was incomplete, Private Jones was  deployed to Korea, placed in an all-Black unit, Company E, 2nd  Battalion, 24th Infantry Regiment of the 25th Infantry Division.  President Truman had ordered that unit integrated in 1948, but as of  1950, integration in the unit had not occurred.   ``The Black soldiers of the 24th Infantry fought valiantly, but the  North Koreans and the Chinese were too fierce and greatly outnumbered  our soldiers.   ``The only African American officer serving the 24th Infantry was  Lieutenant Leon Gilbert of York, Pennsylvania. Lieutenant Gilbert led  his soldiers into fierce battles with the enemy near the 38th parallel.  On 1 September 1950, recognizing that the 24th Infantry was literally  on a suicide mission, Lieutenant Gilbert ordered his soldiers off of a  deadly hill. The division's commanding officer directed Lieutenant  Gilbert to return his soldiers to the fight, but he refused.   ``Gilbert was court-martialed for his refusal. He was given a death  sentence. After widespread outrage from Black Americans, President  Harry Truman commuted the sentence to 20 years of imprisonment. He  served 5 of those 20 years.   ``Because of these events, the 24th Infantry Regiment was disbanded,  but the division was desperately in need of infantry soldiers.  Therefore, the 24th Infantry was reactivated and forced back to the  front line. It was there that PFC Jones went missing on 26 November  1950 at the age of 19 years old.   ``He was recovered by the North Koreans, and his remains have been  secreted for the past 68 years. They were returned to American soil  just a few weeks ago. That is the record of PFC Jones and the story of  the 24th Infantry Regiment in the Korean war.   ``PFC Jones represents a generation of young African American men who  stood for this country when this country didn't stand for them.   ``I thank the Department of Defense for its efforts in recovering and  transporting these remains and enabling this ceremony as we salute an  American hero.   ``Finally, I pray solace will be found in knowing that a loved-one's  remains are home. His soul is in Heaven, and he died on the battlefield  with integrity. God bless each of the members of his family.''   Mr. Speaker, I am grateful for the opportunity to honor and recognize  the life and work of Private First Class William Hoover Jones.                            ____________________
