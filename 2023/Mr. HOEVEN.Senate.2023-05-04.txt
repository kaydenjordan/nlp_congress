 Madam President, I thank my colleague from Maryland and  appreciate the opportunity to make my remarks before this session ends  today.   I rise to once again call attention to the growing and unprecedented  crisis at our southern border. This crisis is a result of the Biden  administration's open border policy. It is a function of the Biden  administration's failure to secure the border and enforce our laws.   In fiscal year 2022, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the CBP,  encountered almost 2.4 million individuals attempting to illegally  cross the southern border. That was an increase of 37 percent from  fiscal year 2021 and a more than 400-percent increase from fiscal year  2020. In the first 6 months of fiscal year 2023, Customs and Border  Protection had already--already--encountered more than 1.5 million  individuals--a pace that will surpass even the record numbers of last  year.   Now, with the title 42 public health order set to expire next week,  it is only getting worse. Take a look. Anybody can turn on their  television and check it out. It is only getting worse.   In response to the expected surge of illegal crossings, the Biden  administration announced that they are going to send 1,500 troops to  the southern border to help with paperwork. Well, it is good they are  sending the troops down there, but without a change in the policy, it  is not going to get the job done. They are not able to do the job that  they can do and need to do. The Customs and Border Protection officers  and agents on the frontlines do the best job possible, but they face an  impossible task given the Biden administration's actions that continue  to exacerbate the crisis--the Biden administration's open border  policy.   I have seen firsthand the work of these dedicated individuals,  including of the members of the North Dakota National Guard from my  home State. I have traveled down to Texas on numerous occasions to draw  attention to the border crisis. I have been to Del Rio. I have been to  Eagle Pass. I have been to El Paso and to the Rio Grande Valley. In  each of these border towns, it is clear now more than ever that more  needs to be done. And it is not just the stopping of illegal migration;  it is to prevent human trafficking and to prevent drug trafficking.  This affects every State in our country.   I also traveled with a bipartisan congressional delegation to Mexico,  to Ecuador, to Colombia, and to Guatemala to outline the need to work  with these nations to stop illegal immigration and prevent drug  trafficking and human trafficking.   These are all part of our efforts to draw attention to the problem  and outline solutions that will stem the tide of illegal immigration.   To stop this crisis, the Biden administration has to change its  policy, and there are several things that can be done right now to make  that happen.   First, the Biden administration needs to implement the Migrant  Protection Protocols or the ``Remain in Mexico'' policy, which requires  people seeking asylum at our southern border to wait in Mexico while  their cases are adjudicated.   Second, reinstate the safe third country agreements, which require  individuals coming from places like El Salvador or Honduras or  Guatemala to seek asylum in their own countries first or they are  returned to their countries to await the outcome of their claims.   Now, title 42 expires on May 11. The border is already in crisis, and  it will just get worse, but the reality is, if those two policies are  reinstated, then the Customs and Border Protection professionals can  get on top of the problem. In other words, let them do their jobs. Put  in place border policies that will enable our Customs and Border  Protection professionals to do their jobs.   It has been shown that those policies will work. I just gave you the  numbers going back to 2020. We are not guessing on this. We are not  guessing. We know it works. Those two policy changes will enable our  Customs and Border Protection professionals to get control of the  border, and with title 42 expiring on May 11, they need to be  implemented now.   We have to do more. We need our border wall. We need personnel. We  need technology. All those things need to be part of creating a secure  border. But right now, particularly with title 42 expiring, we need to  implement those two policy changes and enable our Customs and Border  Protection professionals to do their job.   Border security is national security.   With that, I yield the floor.                            ____________________
