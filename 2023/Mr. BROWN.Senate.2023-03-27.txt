 Madam President, I thank Senator Rubio for his comments.   Whenever I hear my colleagues rail against China--and I agree with  that 95 percent of the time. Whenever I hear them say things like that  they want to be the world's most powerful country, the most powerful  government, I agree with that.   But, as Senator Rubio said--this isn't a debate between him and me. I  just want to make a couple of comments. I want to talk about worker  safety, in a moment, which I know the Presiding Officer cares so much  about.   I go back half a generation. Senator Rubio wasn't here then, but many  of his ideological soulmates were here then. This Congress couldn't  stop itself, from Presidents Clinton and Bush 1 and Obama and Bush 2  and Trump--couldn't help themselves--from giving all kinds of breaks to  American corporations and incentives to American corporations to go to  China, to move to China.   So they shut down production in Duluth, MN. They shut down production  in Mansfield, OH, my hometown, and Toledo and Youngstown.   As corporations were lobbying Congress, I worked and I teamed up with  Lindsey Graham, a Republican, against that. We were unsuccessful, as  corporations lobbied Congress to give China something called permanent  normal trade relations.   So they shut down production in Ohio. They moved that production to  China. And what happened? They taught China a whole lot about  manufacturing, and they created a whole lot of wealth in China.   Now we are surprised about TikTok. We are surprised that the Chinese  military is as powerful as it is. I just think it is important that we  remember, when we listen to corporate interests in this body who lobby  here to weaken, to push jobs overseas, that these are the kinds of  things that happen. And I hope we learn from that, and I hope we take a  lesson and apply it to TikTok into the future.   So, Senator Rubio, thank you for raising the issue.                                Worker Safety    Madam President, I want to talk about worker safety for a moment. On  Friday, seven American workers went to work in West Reading, PA, at the  RM Chocolate Factory to provide for their families.   I spoke to Senator Casey about this, who is the senior Senator from  Pennsylvania and who is one of the leaders in fighting for worker  safety in this body. I spoke with him about it a few minutes ago.   Those seven workers never came home after an explosion leveled the  plant. Our thoughts are with the families who lost sons and daughters,  workers who were paid decent wages, not exorbitant wages--decent  wages--and never returned home to their families.   We will learn more about what went wrong. I know Pennsylvania workers  will always have an ally with Senators Casey and Fetterman on this  issue and so much more.   This struck me in a more emphatic way because I believe it was 1 day  before the 112th anniversary of the Triangle Shirtwaist factory fire.  That  [[Page S972]]  tragedy woke up the Nation to the dangers that workers face in their  jobs--dozens of workers, because the management had locked the factory  doors because they were afraid that some of these low-paid, mostly  women, some of them very young, workers might steal a blouse or two.  They locked the factory doors. So when this fire broke out in a very  flammable environment, workers jumped out the windows to their deaths-- dozens and dozens of workers.   That made a huge difference in Congress finally dealing with worker  safety.   In fact, a woman who was nearby, heard the sirens, and came to the  scene was named Frances Perkins. She became the first female Secretary  of Labor, under President Roosevelt. She stayed with him his entire 12- plus years in office and played a big role, with Senator Wagner, in  writing the most pro-worker legislation in this Nation's history,  especially on worker safety.   Now, Madam President, I wear this pin on my lapel. I have worn it  since it was given to me 25 years ago, at a workers' Memorial Day  rally, by the steelworkers. It is a picture of a canary in a bird cage.   The mine workers, 120 years ago, used to take a canary down in the  mine. If the canary died from toxic gas or lack of oxygen, the mine  worker got out of the mine. He had no union, in those days, strong  enough to protect him. He had no government, in those days, that cared  enough to protect him.   We changed that because of worker safety laws. We changed that  because of unions. This tragedy in West Reading, PA, reminds us that  our work to protect workers and make workplaces safer never ends.   I think about those steelworkers who lost their lives near Toledo in  an explosion in a refinery in Oregon, OH, last year. Max Morrissey and  Ben Morrissey were brothers who died in that accident.   I think about the Norfolk Southern worker who worked for Norfolk  Southern, and, because of its culture of laying off workers and  compromising safety and paying big compensation bonuses to executives,  the worker at Norfolk Southern lost his life earlier this month.   No worker should have to worry about returning--kissing her husband  goodbye, kissing his wife goodbye, kissing his or her children goodbye,  they should not have to worry about returning home. That is why we  should stand up to corporate lobbies that always want to cut costs-- worker safety be damned.   We know what happened. We saw in East Palestine what happened because  the railroad laid off a third of its workers and then they compromised  on safety. We saw what happened in Silicon Valley Bank when they didn't  pay attention to consumers and regulators and the public interest.   And, again, workers always pay the price. We know what will happen.  Every time there is an industrial accident, people are upset; they  worry about it.   But the companies continue to lobby regulators for weaker laws. We  see it here with corporate lobbyists. We see it in the regulatory  Agencies, when they always want to weaken consumer laws, they always  want to weaken environmental laws, they always want to weaken worker  safety laws, and communities always pay, and workers always pay.   That is why a union card is so powerful. It means higher wages,  better benefits, and a safer workplace. If you love this country, you  fight for the people who make it work, whether they punch a clock or  swipe a badge or whether they work for tips or whether they work on  salary. You fight to keep people safe on the job. That is our job here,  to make sure we do that better than we have in the past.   I yield the floor.
