 Mr. Speaker, I am from California, and almost 2 years  ago, the State passed a bill known as AB-5, where all workers would be  presumed as employees unless the worker can show that they satisfy all  three prongs of what is known as the ABC test.   It went into effect in January 2020, and it had quite a few  exemptions in it--barbers, musicians, translators, home inspectors,  golf caddies, things like that. But after the bill passed, flaws were  found in it. They had to go back and legislate again to add newspapers.  They had to go back and extend the time for others for when it would  kick in.   So, what is happening? Here in this House, we are on H.R. 842. Now, I  had an amendment that would provide for some of those exemptions. This  provides for zero exemptions for this requirement that all would be  presumed as employees.   We are going to go ahead and do actually worse than the State of  California, passing the PRO Act without the exemptions.   Government should be here to foster economic growth, not restrict it.  The PRO Act would kill growth, squash innovation in the gig economy and  the American economy.   Why are we going backward here when we can learn from California's  mistake?                            ____________________
