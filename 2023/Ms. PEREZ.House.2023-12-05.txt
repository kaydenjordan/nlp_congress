 Mr. Speaker, today I take a moment to recognize Jordan  Duncan, an exceptional educator and firefighter in my district.   Jordan has been teaching in Washington State for a decade, and during  this time, he has made a real impact on the students with his  innovative teaching techniques.                                time  1030    From taking his students to nearby forests to teaching them the  ecological importance of timber to using his firefighter experience to  teach them about wildfire safety, he has continuously made his students  excited to learn about STEM through real-world applications and  outdoor, hands-on experiences.   Jordan's unwavering dedication to his students and contributions to  the field of education have not gone unnoticed. This year, he was  awarded the FieldSTEM Teacher of the Year award by the Pacific  Education Institute. This recognition is a testament to his efforts in  educating the next generation.   Jordan's passion for promoting outdoor learning for students is  admirable, and I hope he continues to inspire and brighten the future  of our youth through hands-on education.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Jordan for his hard work, and I congratulate him  on this well-deserved recognition.                Plastic Trees Antithetical to Environmentalism     Mr. Speaker, today, I would like to share that I was  deeply disturbed to read some antifarmer propaganda in a national news  publication.   Going out and buying a plastic Christmas tree that will take 5,000  years to degrade is antithetical to the real spirit of  environmentalism.   My county, Lewis County, is the number one producer of Christmas  trees in Washington State, and we grow Christmas trees for a living in  the State, so this is a big deal.   This terrarium view of nature, where you can buy plastic to celebrate  nature, is antithetical to the true spirit of American values and  environmentalism.   I applaud all of our farmers who are fighting hard to keep this  tradition alive.                 Recognizing Importance of Cranberry Growers     Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the hard work and the  importance of cranberry growers in southwest Washington.   Washington is the fifth largest producer of cranberries in the  country, and cranberry growers have been cultivating the land for more  than 100 years.   Pacific County's Long Beach Peninsula in my district is one of the  three main cranberry regions in Washington, with about 1,300 acres of  land dedicated to production.   This year, the price of cranberries is expected to increase to an  estimated $42 per barrel, according to Malcom and Ardell McPhail, two  Ilwaco-based cranberry growers.   While there was an oversupply of cranberries in 2017, the dry summer  this past year caused a water shortage that has seriously affected bog  irrigation. As the effects of climate change continue to reach across  agricultural industries, I commend the resilience and dedication of  cranberry growers in southwest Washington.   I remain committed to fighting for policies that sustain and  strengthen the agricultural sector and will continue to focus on  Federal policies that support small family growers like Malcolm and  Ardell during times like this.              Supporting Ukrainian Refugees Enriches Communities     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a community effort  in southwest Washington.   The ongoing war in Ukraine has resulted in countless Ukrainian  citizens being forced to flee their homes, leaving behind everything  they once knew. However, in the midst of all this chaos, turmoil, and  pain, it fills me with hope to witness Washington extend a welcoming  hand to many of these refugees, offering a safe haven and a chance to  rebuild their lives.   One example of this is the School of Knowledge, a place where  Ukrainian children can learn important subjects, like reading, math,  music, and Bible studies, all in their native Ukrainian tongue.   For Ukraine refugees in my district, this Saturday school serves as a  vital lifeline, allowing them to stay connected to their culture and  heritage while forming new bonds with our community.   I ask my colleagues to join me in remembering that as we support  Ukrainian refugees in their journey to start anew, we also enrich our  local communities' culture and self-sufficiency.   Knucklebusters Provide Hands-on Experience Through Community Engagement     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Skamania County  Knucklebusters Association Skills Center in my district, a place that  resonates with my own background as the owner of an auto repair and  machine shop.   I visited the Skamania County Knucklebusters this past May, and I  learned about the free auto repair program they offer to teenagers.   The diverse range of hands-on skills development classes they host  include shop safety and tool usage and brakes and tires. These classes  equip young students with essential life skills, like how to use a  wrench.   Nobody sitting in these classes asks themselves when they will use  this in real life, yet they deeply complement STEM and fields like  geometry and physics.   In addition to their educational efforts, they also provide services  to the community at a reasonable cost, making it accessible to all and  providing teenagers with access to hard skills and self-sufficiency.   What is even more commendable is that the Knucklebusters are an all- volunteer organization, which means they are motivated by the simple  desire to  [[Page H6117]]  pass on their knowledge to the next generation. They are discerning  about their volunteers, ensuring that they are all quality mechanics  committed to producing quality, safe work.   I am so grateful for folks like the Knucklebusters for embodying  education principles beyond just theoretical learning and instead  involving practical, hands-on experiences through community engagement.                            ____________________
