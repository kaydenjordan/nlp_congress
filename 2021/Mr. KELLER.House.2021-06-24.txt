 Mr. Speaker, one of the greatest threats that emerged  from this pandemic is an expanding government unwilling to relinquish  control and restore Americans' God-given rights.   We see it all across our country. President Biden and liberal  Governors tout the ``follow the science'' talking point while failing  to follow the science themselves, keeping in place pandemic  restrictions while knowing full well that our economy can fully reopen.   While the left virtue signals, pushing radical policies like vaccine  passports and critical race theory, American families are still  struggling to make ends meet. Tens of thousands of businesses have  closed their doors for good, and our children have fallen behind  because they are denied in-person learning.   Some Federal agencies are still not operating at pre-pandemic levels.  We have American veterans who cannot access records they need for  treatment and benefits they earned because of career bureaucrats who  can't be bothered to go back to work. This is wrong and completely  avoidable.   Here, in Congress, we see the hypocrisy of the left on display.  Speaker Pelosi lifts the mask mandate for the House floor, but keeps  the people's House closed to the public. We have Members of this body  not showing up and voting in person. The people that we represent go to  work every day, and they expect us to do the same. Americans have never  been and never will be a nation ruled by fear and control.   Reopen the Capitol Building, reopen our country, and restore freedom  and power to the American people.
