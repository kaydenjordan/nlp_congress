 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my support for the  conference report on the National Defense Authorization Act, which  passed the House of Representatives today.  [[Page H9240]]    In a great bipartisan moment, the NDAA received overwhelming support  to authorize almost $700 billion in defense spending and set priorities  for our military, including the largest pay raise for our troops in 8  years. The conference report kept funding important to Georgia's 12th  District, included in the earlier versions of the FY18 NDAA, such as $8  billion in funding for cyber operations and over $85 million in new  military construction to prepare for our cyber warriors at Fort Gordon,  like new family housing and a new gate.   Ensuring that our soldiers, sailors, and airmen are equipped with the  facilities and resources they need to fight the battles of today and  tomorrow is crucial to our Nation's safety and security.   Days after celebrating one of the most important days of the year  honoring our veterans, I am happy to say that, with the passage of H.R.  2810, we have provided for the common defense, supported our  servicemembers, and worked to close the critical readiness gap.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise with great privilege to celebrate  National Bible Week.   As stated, it has been 76 years since President Franklin Roosevelt  declared this National Bible Week. I thank Congressman Lamborn for  recognizing the importance of honoring God's Word here tonight.   Just 16 short years ago, I learned the most valuable lesson of my  life. I realized I had to change my priorities. Part of that change was  to put God first. A big part of that commitment was the reading and  studying of His Word through prayer and meditation. It is easy to say,  but difficult to do.   I had come to a point in my life where I made a covenant with God on  my knees, which reminds me of God's instruction to Joshua 1:8, ``This  book of laws shall not depart from your lips, but you shall meditate on  it day and night so that you may be careful to do according to all that  is written in it; for then, you will make your way prosperous, and then  you will have true success.''   I learned to gradually believe all the wonderful promises God made  through His Word, and he credited to me His righteousness, just as He  did our spiritual father Abraham in Genesis 15:6, ``I learned it was  not my will be done, but His will be done.''   I learned what Jesus Christ had done for me and the entire world and  how he leads me in all my endeavors and has called me to places I never  imagined I would go. One of those is right here.   Years ago, I could never have imagined myself here tonight, speaking  on  [[Page H9252]]  this floor in the United States House of Representatives, representing  the great people of Georgia's 12th District. But here I am, by the  grace of God.   In this endeavor, I meditate often, and as said in Philippians 2:  ``Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit, but in humility  consider others more important than yourself. Each of you should look  not only to your own interests, but look to the interests of others.''   At a time when many Americans are increasingly divided, I often  remind myself and those around me to have faith in Him and to remember  the Judeo-Christian values our Nation was founded on.   The Bible's influence on or founding documents can still be seen here  today and was mentioned tonight. Again, when the Constitutional  Convention reached an impasse, Ben Franklin asked clergymen to come in  and pray and read the Scriptures. They united around the greatest  constitutional document created in the history of mankind.   Americans are looking to Congress to come together to find solutions  for rising healthcare costs, a simpler, fairer Tax Code, and let's get  our good folks back to work again. It is time to put the American  people's interests above political will.    The division in this Nation is real. They are evident right here in  this body. How could our behavior ever show the world to believe that  God sent His Son to save the world?   This is when we should look to God's provision. The truth can always  be found through faith in him. Jesus summed it up when he prayed for us  in John 17:21: ``That all of them may be one, Father, just as You are  in me and I am in You. May they also be in us so that the world may  believe that You sent me.''   My inspiration is found in Psalms 51:10-12, David's Prayer: ``Create  in me a pure heart, O God, and renew a steadfast spirit within me. Do  not cast me from your presence or take your Holy Spirit from me.  Restore to me the joy of Your salvation and grant me a willing spirit  to sustain me.''   As we enter the Christmas season, one of the most important seasons  of the year, we all must remember to keep His Word close and let it  lead us in all that we do.   I am grateful that we have a President who actually wishes a merry  Christmas as we all celebrate the birth of the Savior of the world.   God bless.                                time  1915
