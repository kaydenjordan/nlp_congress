 Mr. President, I ask consent that the veto message on S.  906, the Driftnet Modernization and Bycatch Reduction Act, be  considered as  [[Page S8002]]  having been read and spread upon the Journal in full and that the  message be printed in the Record.   The veto message is ordered to be printed in the Record as follows:  To the Senate of the United States:   I am returning, without my approval, S. 906, the Driftnet  Modernization and Bycatch Reduction Act. America's fishermen have made  great sacrifices to ensure that our Nation's marine fisheries are a  sustainable economic engine for coastal communities. Under my  Administration, the number of United States fish stocks subject to  overfishing is at a historic low. This achievement is the result of a  transparent and collaborative regulatory process that is supported by  regional fishery management councils. At council meetings, fishermen  work with Federal Government and State government representatives to  meet their statutory obligations under the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery  Conservation and Management Act.   In passing S. 906, the Congress has ignored the fact that the  regional fishery management process has had strong, bipartisan support  since its creation. By forcing the West Coast drift gillnet fishery to  use alternative gear that has not been proven to be an economically  viable substitute for gillnets, the Congress is effectively terminating  the fishery. As a result, an estimated 30 fishing vessels, all of which  are operated by family-owned small businesses, will no longer be able  to bring their bounty to shore. At a time when our Nation has a seafood  trade deficit of nearly $17 billion, S. 906 will exacerbate this  imbalance.   Further, S. 906 will not achieve its purported conservation benefits.  The West Coast drift gillnet fishery is subject to robust legal and  regulatory requirements for environmental protection that equal or  exceed the environmental protections that apply to foreign fisheries.  Without this fishery, Americans will import more swordfish and other  species from foreign sources that frequently have more bycatch than our  own fisheries. If the Congress wants to address bycatch, it should  insist on a level playing field for imported seafood instead of  crushing American fishing families.   My Administration has done more for American fishermen than any  President before me. On May 7, 2020, I signed an Executive Order on  Promoting American Seafood Competitiveness and Economic Growth to  bolster our domestic seafood industry while curbing illegal,  unreported, and unregulated fishing abroad. On June 5, 2020, I issued a  Proclamation on Modifying the Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine  National Monument to open it to commercial fishing that is conducted in  accordance with the Magnuson-Stevens Act and other applicable laws,  regulations, and requirements. And as fishermen struggled to stay on  the water during the pandemic, I issued a Memorandum on Protecting the  United States Lobster Industry and later made approximately $530  million available, through the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Seafood  Trade Relief Program, to support the United States seafood industry and  fishermen affected by retaliatory tariffs from foreign governments.   My Administration would support provisions of the enrolled bill, if  passed separately, which would authorize fee collection in a different  fishery--the Pacific Halibut fishery. This authority is needed to  implement a provision of the International Pacific Halibut Commission  Convention, to which the United States is a party. However, for the  sake of American fishermen nationwide, I will not let the Congress  circumvent the fisheries management process by effectively terminating  a fishery without appropriate consultation and input from fishery  management councils. If this occurred, it would increase our reliance  on imported seafood and take away the livelihoods of hard-working  Americans and their family businesses. It is my duty to return S. 906  to the Senate without my approval.                                                      Donald J. Trump.
