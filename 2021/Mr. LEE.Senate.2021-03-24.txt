 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that at the  conclusion of my remarks, I be allowed to present an excerpt of my  speech in Spanish. I will provide transcripts both in English and in  Spanish of those paragraphs.    Madam President, I have read the accounts and so have many  of you. A young mother from Honduras, two young sisters from Guatemala,  a 6-year-old child from El Salvador--they were all told by a local  cartel that, for a price, a better life awaits them in America.   They are told, as evidenced by those chanting ``Biden, Biden'' at the  border, that this new President has opened the borders and that amnesty  is imminent, so get in while you can.   These vulnerable people are flocking to smugglers and violent  criminals and paying them all that they have for their chance to get in  while they can. In the last month, traffickers have allegedly made as  much as $14 million a week smuggling men, women, and children across  the border.   Once indebted to cartels and coyotes, the price these vulnerable  people pay is far more costly than money. According to media reports,  men are used as slaves; women are raped endlessly. In fact, one-third  of the women making their way to the border are reportedly sexually  assaulted, and 68 percent of the people coming across the border are  physically assaulted.   Children are rented, trafficked, and ``recycled,'' as they put it,  forced to pose as the child of one illegal immigrant after another to  activate the so-called Flores get-out-of-jail-free card. One former  Border Patrol agent told me that the smugglers prefer to use babies  because they are unable to tell Border Patrol agents that these are  not, in fact, their parents.   What of those who escape the clutches of the cartels? Well, estimates  of how many children are currently in Customs and Border Patrol custody  vary from more than 4,000 children to well over 15,000. Thousands of  these children are being held, packed into housing facilities, for well  over the 72-hour limit required by Flores--and with no end in sight.   The Biden administration is doing all it can to hide the humanitarian  crisis created by its own immigration policies--a disaster that  Secretary Mayorkas refuses to acknowledge as a crisis. It denied media  access and appears to be enforcing an unofficial gag order on Border  Patrol agents. Journalists have not been permitted inside the detention  facilities since President Biden took office.   Now, it shouldn't be a surprise to any of us that the Biden  administration's open border policies have resulted in this  overwhelming crisis--and a crisis it is. This is what then-Candidate  Biden promised us in the very first  [[Page S1740]]  Democratic Presidential primary debate. He promised us that when he  became President, there would be immediate surges along the border.  Unfortunately, in this case, he has delivered exactly what he promised.  How exactly did he deliver? Well, first, he made it known that once he  was elected, the border would be open for business. Then he reversed  course on a number of Trump-era commonsense immigration policies. This  incentivized vulnerable people to entrust their lives and the lives of  their children to dangerous coyotes and cartels.   What are these policies? The safe third country policy, implemented  by the Trump administration, requires asylum seekers to apply for  asylum in the first safe country in which they arrive. President Biden  has moved to repeal that rule.   The expansion of the Flores Settlement agreement also creates  perverse incentives in our immigration law. Flores is about protecting  children, and yet, in the application of the expansion, we have put  children in even greater danger of becoming victims of trafficking and  cartel manipulation.   The Biden policy of keeping all unaccompanied alien minors in the  United States, as my fellow Senator from Utah has pointed out, actually  incentivizes parents to separate themselves from their children by  entrusting their children to a cartel or coyote to bring them to the  United States for their chance at amnesty.   By moving to loosen the requirements of asylum and expand its  application, President Biden has invited immigrants, who could find  safety in other regions of their own country or an adjacent country, to  make the dangerous journey to the United States.   What we need are clear requirements to preserve the opportunities for  asylum for those who need it the most. America is the land to which  those seeking a better life look for relief, and we should provide  relief where we can. We also have a duty to protect our border, our  citizens, and our laws, our national interests. At the very least, we  have a duty to eliminate policies that empower cartels and coyotes to  exploit women and children. We must stop incentivizing vulnerable  people to make a journey that will very rarely lead to the outcome they  desire.   To this end, and together with Congressman   Andy Biggs and several  of my fellow Senators, I have introduced the Stopping Border Surges Act  to address some of the more egregious loopholes in our immigration  laws.   This bill remedies the expansion of the Flores Settlement agreement  that puts so many children in danger by requiring the release of minors  with any adult claiming to be the child's parent. It provides expedited  processing for unaccompanied minors from all countries--processes  currently available only to children from Mexico and Canada. Immediate  processing will blunt the incentive for parents to send their children  on this dangerous journey alone. In an effort to end the trafficking of  children by cartels, it strengthens protections for children released  to adults within the United States. It tightens the asylum process so  that we can better serve those who genuinely need the protections we  can offer, and it incentivizes immigrants to enter our country through  official ports of entry.   This bill offers a new commonsense series of reforms that will help  stem the flood of immigrants at our border and free vulnerable women  and children from the clutches of the cartels and of the coyotes. For  that reason, I urge all of my colleagues to support it, to join it, and  to vote for it.   Now, having previously received consent, I would like to conclude  these remarks in Spanish, remarks directed specifically to those who  might be considering making the dangerous, perilous journey to the  southern border of the United States before sending their families.   (The English translation of the statement made in Spanish is as  follows:)         Please do not send your wives and daughters on this journey       only to be sexually assaulted by the coyotes and cartels. We       hear story after story of smugglers kidnapping women and       children and holding them hostage even after they cross our       border. In the year 2019, the New York Times documented       dozens of cases of these women. This is just one of those       stories involving Melvin, a 36-year old mother of three from       Guatemala:        For weeks in that locked room, the men she had paid to get       her safely to the United States drugged her with pills and       cocaine, refusing to let her out even to bathe. ``I think       that since they put me in that room, they killed me,'' she       said. ``They raped us so many times they didn't see us as       human beings anymore.''        Please, listen to Melvin's story. Do not make that the       story of your family.    Madam President, as if in legislative session, I ask unanimous  consent that the Judiciary Committee be discharged from further  consideration of S. 884; that the Senate proceed to its immediate  consideration; I further ask unanimous consent that the bill be  considered read a third time and passed and that the motion to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.    Madam President, I appreciate the sentiment expressed by my  friend, my distinguished colleague, the senior Senator from Illinois,  particularly when he expressed the desire no longer to have people send  their children on the long, perilous journey from Central America to  the United States. On that, he and I certainly agree, just as we have  agreed on a number of other issues over the years.   I do think it is regrettable that we are not able to reach this  agreement today. This is something we ought to be able to solve right  here, right now. This is a very dire set of circumstances.   We have to remember what we are talking about is dealing with the  Flores agreement. We are in a position where so many of the children  coming up through these caravans are in danger because we have in place  policies that require the release of minors to any adult claiming to be  the child's parent. We ought to have expedited processing requirements  for unaccompanied minors, just as we have in place already for  unaccompanied minors coming from Mexico and coming from Canada.   It makes me wonder: What is it about children from Central American  countries--from any country other than Canada and Mexico--that makes  them undeserving of that same expedited processing requirement? This is  something we need to do.   Yes, I understand that our immigration system is a mess and needs  reform, but I don't understand why it is that anyone would want to  accept the default assumption that we can't fix anything with  immigration; we can't even fix this problem subjecting these  unaccompanied minors from Central American countries, including  Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador. Why can't we give them any relief  here until such time as we can come up with a comprehensive immigration  reform proposal?   It is disappointing to me that we can't do that today. We will keep  trying, keep moving on this effort. This is important.   Look, regardless of where one stands politically, what party one  belongs to, I don't think it is too much to ask to suggest that we  shouldn't give kids over to anyone claiming to be their parent without  proof, without processes to make sure that is a safe person. We  wouldn't want our own children treated that way. We shouldn't treat  them that way.   Thank you.
