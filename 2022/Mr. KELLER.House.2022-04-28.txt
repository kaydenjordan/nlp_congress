 Mr. Speaker, in Fiscal Year 2021, Customs and Border  Patrol seized 11,000 pounds of fentanyl at our southern border. During  the same period, opioid deaths jumped to 75,000, up from 56,000 deaths  the prior year.   This is no coincidence. Even in a hearing on combating the opioid  crisis this week, not a single one of my Democratic colleagues called  for President Biden to end his open border policies that have allowed  the free flow of fentanyl or other illicit drugs into the United  States.   During the hearing, the former Acting DEA Administrator testified  that securing the border is a commonsense approach to stopping drug  traffickers and giving power back to our law enforcement.   On one hand, Washington Democrats say they want to solve the opioid  crisis. On the other hand, they are supporting policies and politicians  that have left our border open.   Washington Democrats need to get serious. If we want to solve this  opioid crisis, we must secure the border and restore law and order.                            ____________________
