 Mr. President, I want to start by saluting my friend,  our colleague, the Senator from Alaska, for his moving and powerful  statement and for his service as a marine and now a Senator from  Alaska. It has been a great honor to work with him on many issues,  including national security issues.  [[Page S5731]]    I thank you.    Mr. President, I am going to read from just two of  those letters that expressed the urgency of Senate action on this.   This is a letter from the Thurgood Marshall College Fund, from the  president and CEO, stating that the Thurgood Marshall College Fund  ``strongly encourages the Senate to take-up the FUTURE Act immediately  and pass the bill before the opportunity slips away. While we  appreciate the prospects of a longer-term or `permanent' solution to  Title III, Part F, we are skeptical that such a proposal would receive  the requisite approval by Congress before September 30th.''   I think we can understand their skepticism given the fact that the  30th is Monday and the Senate is going to be out this afternoon.   They go on to say:         Therefore, it is imperative that the Senate act with all       deliberate speed on the bi-partisan, bi-cameral FUTURE Act.    Mr. President, I have another letter from the UNCF, which is another  organization dedicated to supporting these important institutions.   Quoting from the letter from their president and CEO:         It is imperative that the Senate pass the FUTURE Act       because funding for HBCUs, TCUs, HSIs, and other [minority-      serving institutions] expires September 30, 2019. While we       support a permanent extension of mandatory funding, H.R.       2846, due to its passage in the House of Representatives, is       the surest way for these institutions to maintain funding for       FY 2020 and FY 2021. We strongly believe that passing this       bill now will address the immediate funding needs of our       institutions.    This is a bill that has broad support. This is a bill where--the  program expires on Monday, just a few days from now. There is really no  excuse for not taking this up and voting on it now. I hope, since that  is obviously not going to happen--my colleague tried to get unanimous  consent earlier today to take up and vote on this bill--I hope we will  move with all deliberate speed as soon as the Senate reconvenes so that  we can get this important work done.   I yield the floor.
