 Mr. President, I rise today to oppose the nomination of  Radhika Fox to be Assistant Administrator for Water at the EPA. I  certainly appreciate her willingness to serve, and I have found her to  be quite personable and friendly. So this is not a personal statement.   But even though she is not yet confirmed, she is already in place as  the lead political appointee in the Water Office of the EPA. In that  capacity, her recent announcement of overreaching regulatory proposals  under the Clean Water Act cemented my opposition to her nomination.   Ms. Fox's position on the appropriate scope of the Clean Water Act  was not clear last month when I voted on her nomination in the EPA  committee, of which I am the ranking member. At that markup in May, I  noted that I could not support Ms. Fox at that time because she would  not commit to maintaining the navigable waters protection rule issued  in 2020. As I noted at the time, she would also not state that the 2015  waters of the United States rule was overreaching. So I really couldn't  pin her down on any opinion on this very important rule.   I now know why she would not commit to maintaining the navigable  waters protection rule when she testified before the committee and  avoided providing direct responses in her written responses to my  followup questions. The administration did not support the rule and,  apparently, the EPA opposed it completely.   Last week, Ms. Fox and EPA Administrator Regan, as well as the U.S.  Army Corps of Engineers, announced their plans to repeal and replace  the rule in its entirety. EPA and the Corps of Engineers are going to  completely rewrite the regulations that determine whether a business, a  farm, or a citizen needs to obtain a Federal water permit. The Federal  Agencies announced that they had decided they are not going to keep any  part of that rule and that they are going to start from scratch.   That was at odds with what Ms. Fox conveyed to me in a phone call  that she did make the previous day to inform me they were going to be  making an announcement. She was just very incomplete, and it was  extremely disappointing to me and to the many States and businesses  that support the navigable waters protection rule, which--unlike the  2015 waters of the United States rule it replaced--is the law  presently. The navigable waters protection rule is the law of the land  in all 50 States. That made it clear when Federal permits would be  needed, and it gave States more control over how to permit water bodies  in their borders.   Throughout her nomination process, when I asked Ms. Fox about the  administration's plans, she expressed a desire to hear from  stakeholders in order to create a ``durable'' rule. Ms. Fox did not  conduct any formal public stakeholder process before announcing the  decision that was made to repeal the navigable waters protection rule.   The administration has said it plans to repeal the rule and then put  in place guidance from the 1980s while we wait and while they come up  with a replacement. Changing the regulations three times in a short  period of time--2015, 2020, and now 2021--simply does not meet her  commitment to develop a ``durable'' definition.   Instead, ever-changing rules create a game of regulatory ping-pong  across administrations. These are big far-reaching rules. That  permitting uncertainty hurts our economy at a time when we need growth,  and it does so without additional environmental protection in my home  State.   We often forget that the Clean Water Act allows States to regulate  their waters as much as they like. The definition of ``waters of the  United States'' only determines Federal jurisdiction. In fact, that is  the keystone of the Clean Water Act.   The administration's promises of transparency and creating regulatory  certainty simply are not reflected in these actions, and their goals,  stated to a briefing of congressional offices during a briefing call,  are particularly troubling. They pointed to the prior converted  cropland exemption and treatment of ditches under the current rule as  ``implementation challenges'' that they want to address.   It doesn't take much to understand what that means. The  administration intends to require more Federal permits for prior  converted cropland and ditches on private land. That is a gross  overreach of the Federal Government's authority under the Clean Water  Act, and it is questionable whether the EPA and the Army Corps of  Engineers could even vet the sheer volume of permit applications that  would come their way.   I encourage Ms. Fox to engage with stakeholders from agriculture to  mining, to construction, to home building before issuing the official  proposal to repeal the navigable waters protection rule, and I urge Ms.  Fox to make that engagement meaningful. Simply checking the box that  these stakeholders have had the opportunity to talk to members of the  administration is not meaningful engagement.   If officials of the administration truly engaged in a transparent  process where they took stakeholder feedback into account, they would  learn that the best way to provide regulatory certainty is to keep that  navigable waters protection rule in place. I cannot support Ms. Fox's  decision to undo such a foundational rule without any public engagement  and to do so in a way that appears to be more expansive than the  overreaching Obama rule called the ``waters of the United States  rule.''   So I urge my colleagues to vote against Ms. Fox's nomination on the  basis of what she has already done and in most probability will do in  the future surrounding this very, very important topic   I yield the floor.    Madam President, I thank my colleague from Missouri,  Senator Blunt, for his leadership on this issue.   We had the hearing and the markup in the Rules Committee. I think  that we could tell from the debate that the amount of holes and  misinformation that is contained within S. 1 is the reason that I call  it the so-called For the People Act.   Ronald Reagan famously said that the nine most terrifying words in  the English language are ``I'm from the government, and I'm here to  help.'' This can be applied to many examples of what we do here.   What seems more pertinent, I think, now is this latest partisan  attempt to federalize one of America's most sacred functions, and that  is our elections. Advocates claim that this sweeping effort, which  comes in the form of legislation ironically called For the People Act,  is to get more people to vote. Let's be clear. Everyone--Republicans,  Democrats, Independents--we all want to see more people voting. The  good news is that we have already been doing that across the country  and in my home State of West Virginia.   Remember, last year we were voting under a pandemic, under incredibly  difficult situations for everybody. Our State of West Virginia ran a  very successful election suited to our State. We had thousands more  people vote in 2020 than they did in 2016. In fact, the total number of  ballots cast in 2020 was more than any other election in West  Virginia's history, with the exception of the 1960 election. The 1960  election, remember, was the Presidential election that President  Kennedy won after he had a very successful and a pivotal victory in the  primary in West Virginia as the first Roman Catholic running for  President. More than 158 million ballots were cast in 2020. That is a  7-percent increase since 2016. This is under a pandemic.   Every State decided the best way to get maximum participation. Last  November, every single State saw higher turnout rates compared to the  previous Presidential election. If more people are, in fact, voting,  what is this Democratic-proposed legislation really about? And that is  where it is about the federalization of elections and election power  grab. I believe it lacks credibility. It is really about a way to  implement absurd and downright un-American provisions in the bill that  prioritize power over the will of the people.   I am glad to say that some of my Democratic colleagues are finally  acknowledging the concerns with this bill. During the Rules Committee  markup, Republicans and Democrats offered a number of amendments, some  of which were adopted on a bipartisan basis. That is what we are  supposed to do--work it through committee. These amendments have been  heralded by some of my Democratic colleagues as an example of how we  can work together on this issue.   Despite the bipartisan amendments in the Rules Committee--despite  this--the version that the majority leader may bring up for a vote does  not include any of the amendments that were adopted during the markup  even though they had bipartisan support. To me, that is a clear sign  that the majority is not trying to cooperate in good faith but, rather,  trying to ram through a partisan bill that will encroach on the States'  abilities--my State's ability--to ensure a free and fair election and a  well-attended election at the same time.   The legislation would strip States of their constitutional authority  to run elections and allow the Federal Government to determine what is  best.   It would ban voter ID laws, which are adopted in many States, mine  included, which maintain the integrity of elections in my State and the  majority of others. Quite frankly, I haven't heard one person in my  State complain about having to take an ID to the polls or to submit an  ID with their vote.   The bill would also force States to administer same-day voter  registration--a cumbersome mandate that many States won't be able to  comply with for dozens of reasons. In my State, it is internet  connectivity. Many of our polling areas wouldn't be able to accept  same-day registration because they can't connect, unfortunately, to the  bigger system to find out if this person is fraudulent or not.   It would also require that States mandate the unpopular and dangerous  practice of ballot harvesting, which is ripe for fraud. Now, I will  tell you, some States have made ballot harvesting legal. Some States  have same-day voter registration. Good for them. They decided what is  good for their State through the constitutional duty of States to run  elections.   Speaking of fraud, this bill would mandate absentee ballot boxes,  drop boxes, and force county clerks to accept regular ballots filed in  the wrong precinct without proof of residency, both of which leave the  door open to voter fraud.   If that is not enough, if signed into law, West Virginia's e-voting  system and others like it--this is the e-voting system that allows our  Active military who are deployed overseas to be able to vote safely by  their mobile phone, and the legislature opened that up to people with  disabilities to be able to use an e-voting system. This bill would  severely curtail that and negate it in many cases. That is an expansion  of voting rights that this bill would take away.   This legislation would allow government funding of congressional  campaigns, with small donations being matched with Federal funds. Now,  we heard from our friend Senator Cruz in our committee. He talked  about, if his contributions were matched for the first 3 months of this  year, he would get millions of dollars, over $20 million of public  financing for his campaign. I highly doubt my Democratic colleagues  would want the Federal Government to help Senator Cruz in the financing  of his campaign. As a matter of fact, he himself, Senator Cruz, said he  doesn't want that at all either.   The bill also would make the FEC, the Federal Election Commission,  which oversees our elections and our finances, which is now a neutral  three Republicans, three Democrats on the Commission, as it always has  been--it would make it into a partisan majority vote. Well, if you are  going to be making decisions on my colleague from Florida's election or  my election on financials, or the Presiding Officer's election, do we  really want a political organization making those? Not when we have had  a nonpartisan FEC for years and have enforced our campaign laws and put  them above party politics. But remember, this is only about getting  people to vote, so don't worry.   The disaster doesn't stop with politicizing the FEC; it would also  remove the authority of States to draw district maps and would mandate  how you do that. Our States can figure out how best--some of them have  commissions. Some of them do it by the legislature. Some of them do it  by the supreme court. Let's let the States make that decision.   I just think that the biggest demonstration of opposition to this  bill has come from the West Virginia County Clerk's Association. It  adopted a resolution in opposition to S. 1 that 54 of the 55 county  clerks in my State signed. These are Republican and Democratic county  clerks.   Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the  Record this letter from the West Virginia County Clerk's Association   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                     June 10, 2021.           WVCCA Resolution Opposing the Passage of H.R. 1 & S. 1         Whereas, the United States Constitution recognizes the       authority of the legislatures of each State to regulate the       times, places, and manner of holding federal elections; and        Whereas, election administrators and county officials were       not given an opportunity to provide input on the drafting of       H.R. 1 and S. 1 prior to the introduction of the legislation,       unlike previous bipartisan federal election reforms; and        Whereas, H.R. 1 and S. 1 preempt state law that currently       restricts ballot harvesting for the prevention of fraud, by       expressly providing that states ``may not put any limit on       how many voted and sealed absentee ballots any designated       person can return to the post office, a ballot drop-off       location, tribally designated building, or election office'';       and  [[Page S4568]]         Whereas, H.R. 1 and S. 1 preempt state law by mandating       same-day registration, regardless of the severe lack of       internet service and broadband in rural areas: an impossible       feat in West Virginia; and        Whereas, Same-day registration provisions in H.R. 1 and S.       1 lack proper security protections, multiplied by the lack of       internet capability in polling locations in West Virginia,       which undermines the integrity of our elections by making it       impossible for election officials to confirm any new voter's       eligibility prior to them casting any ballot or from       guaranteeing that no voter both registers and votes more than       once in an election on Election Day; and        Whereas, H.R. 1 and S. 1 preempt state law by prohibiting       requirements for physical proofs of identification for       regular in-person and absentee voters, and requiring states       to accept just a voter's signature affidavit as proof of       eligibility and proper registration; and        Whereas, H.R. 1 and S. 1 preempt state law and adoption of       voting systems by requiring decertification of current,       federally certified voting systems, and forcing states to       purchase new voting equipment--none of which currently       comport with the most recently adopted voluntary voting       system guidelines (adopted Feb. 2021 by EAC)--wasting       millions of dollars in recent upgrades purchased with HAVA       funding across West Virginia and requiring new manufacturing       by vendors and purchases by counties to the tune of tens of       millions of dollars in WV alone; and        Whereas, H.R. 1 and S. 1 creates multiple so-called       ``private rights of action'' that would lead to election       administrators being targeted for lawsuits all across the       country for both real and imagined violations, and causing       county clerks to spend more time defending themselves in       court than preparing to make sure that elections are run       smoothly and securely; and        Whereas, H.R. 1 and S. 1 places dozens of additional       mandates on county clerks while providing no ongoing       operational funding to fulfill the requirements, causing       potential cuts in county budgets to law enforcement and       public safety; and        Whereas, H.R. 1 and S. 1 preempt state law by forcing       county clerks to accept regular--not provisional--ballots of       voters who vote in the incorrect precinct, without sufficient       evidence of eligibility or proof of residence; and        Whereas, H.R. 1 fatally contradicts the reliability and       security of electronic transmission by permitting voters to       cure signature deficiencies electronically (see Sec. 1621)       but prohibiting UOCAVA, voters living with disabilities, and       first responders called away for service from transmitting       absentee ballots securely using extensively tested procedures       and methods; and        Whereas, H.R. 1 and S. 1 lump dozens of state agencies and       educational institutions into ``voter registration       agencies,'' and requires them to integrate into an automatic       voter registration system without regard to current systems,       data collection practices, or security creating more       opportunities for voters' registrations to be mishandled and       mistransmitted, and likely resulting in security lapses for       agencies currently not covered under the Critical       Infrastructure designation of the Department of Homeland       Security; and        Whereas, H.R. 1 and S. 1 preempt state law by mandating new       dates for the early in-person voting period without regard to       state-specific success and voter participation under current       election calendars; and        Whereas, H.R. 1 and S. 1 preempt state law by requiring       absentee ballot drop boxes and increasing security concerns       for absentee ballots that currently do not exist under state       laws: Now, therefore, be it        Resolved, that the West Virginia County Clerk's Association       opposes the passage of H.R. 1, S. 1, or any other legislation       that impedes the state's ability to administer elections in       an overreaching, one-size-fits-all approach out of Washington       D.C.

Madam President, they raise numerous grievances, many of  which I have talked about. They talk about the voting machines they  have right now, which they have spent a lot of money on, that would all  be taken offline. You would have to fully replace all of that. They  also fully reject the usurping of what is their constitutionally based  responsibility to run elections safely, securely, and on time. So I  appreciate the letter from our clerks and certainly understand their  deep, deep concerns. The right to vote is a constitutional right, and  on that, we are in agreement.   I got to go to a citizenship ceremony wherein 20 new citizens joined  our country after having waited to get into our country. After becoming  citizens, the best and most precious right they get is that right to  vote. Yet S. 1 is merely a partisan power grab that includes all kinds  of unrelated, harmful provisions. It strips the States of their  authority to run their elections. To put it simply, States do not need  the Federal Government to strip them of their authority and impose  burdensome requirements to fix problems that do not exist. That is  exactly what this bill does, and it is why the For the People Act does  not live up to its name.   Thank you.
