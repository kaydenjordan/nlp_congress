 Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and  thank Mr. Ron Nutz of Haddam, KS.   Last September, I traveled to Washington County and met many  outstanding Kansans, amongst them was Mr. Ron Nutz. Ron is responsible  for spearheading the construction of the Mark Nutsch Horse Soldier  Monument and the 9/11 Memorial in Washington County, KS. Mark Nutsch  served as a Ranger in the Army and as a special forces officer,  deploying on multiple combat tours. Shortly following the 9/11 attacks  on our country, he led his team into northern Afghanistan and fought  against the Taliban and al-Qaeda, much of the time on horseback.   I would like to thank Ron for the work he has done towards the  completion of this project. The monument will depict a soldier on  horseback and will also incorporate the stone, lapis lazuli, which is  found throughout Afghanistan. The groundbreaking ceremony will be held  on June 27.   I now ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing Mr. Ron Nutz for  all of his hard work, as well as in wishing him nothing but success in  the future.                            ____________________
