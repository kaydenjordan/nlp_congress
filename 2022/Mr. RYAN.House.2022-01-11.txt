 Madam Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to come to the  floor this afternoon about a topic I wish we didn't have to address.  This is the plague in our country of fentanyl and fentanyl overdoses  that so many families throughout this country have had to deal with.   Coming from Ohio, we have, unfortunately, been on the front-end of  the opiate crisis. We have been on the front-end of the heroin crisis.  And now we are on the front-end of the fentanyl crisis.   I have a picture here of Rachel, who is from Akron, Ohio, who died at  17  [[Page H38]]  years old. Her life was tragically cut short because she took a fatal  overdose of cocaine that was unknowingly laced with the synthetic  opioid carfentanil.   Carfentanil, for those of you who haven't been paying close enough  attention to all of these issues, is 100 times more potent than  fentanyl and 10,000 times more potent than morphine.   So we have young, talented, beautiful people--in this case, a high  school student--who had so much promise, so much life, so much  personality. I speak with her mom often and listen to stories about and  see pictures of this beautiful young woman.   Now, her mom, Cindy, carries on her daughter's legacy, providing  peer-to-peer programming at local schools and in the local community.   We failed Rachel. This country failed Rachel and her mom and her  family and all of the families across this country.   We thought we had at one point enough attention on the issue of  opioids, on the issue of heroin, now on the issue of fentanyl. Then the  pandemic came, and this issue has been on the back burner.   My remarks here today on the floor of the United States House of  Representatives, one of the greatest deliberative bodies in the entire  world, are to try to bring attention to this issue, to try to scream  from the rafters so that we don't have any more Rachels, we don't have  any more families that have to experience the heartache, the tragedy,  the gut-wrenching experiences that so many families have had over the  past few years.   This is something that we can do. Think about this: 80 percent of the  overdoses in Ohio are from fentanyl.   The fentanyl starts in China, it goes to Mexico to get processed, and  then it comes over the border. So as a country, we have to focus--and I  will give the Biden administration a credit. We have seen progress in  this regard. We have seen progress. We have seen an increase in people  getting busted at the border, which is appropriate, but we have a long,  long way to go.   We need an awareness campaign across the country so that young kids,  who otherwise would make a simple mistake and now it ends their life,  that they know, that their peers know, that their schools know. There  is not a corner of Ohio, Madam Speaker, that I can go to that I won't  meet families who have experienced this kind of tragedy.   It is incumbent upon us. As one of the co-chairs of the Addiction,  Treatment and Recovery Caucus, we have been dealing with this in a  bipartisan way. We passed the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act,  the CARA Act, in a bipartisan way.   We know that there are so many issues we can fight about. There are  so many issues we can argue about here in this body. But I hope and  pray that one of them isn't this issue that we need to address  collectively here in the United States Congress.   We need to, I think, begin by going back to the opiate issue, going  back to the Sackler family, going back to all the profits that were  made off of getting so many millions of Americans hooked on opiates,  hooked on painkillers, and merge that in with a broken economy where  there is so much hopelessness in so many quarters of the United States,  where so many communities have been disinvested in, deindustrialized,  left to rot. Then you have families that are knowingly increasing the  amount of opiates, playing with the FDA, going through the loopholes,  which is what the Sackler family has done. They need to be punished to  the point where they don't get the right to the deal that they want,  Madam Speaker; they don't get the right to the deal that they want,  because that is how it has been in the United States.   If you are a wealthy corporation, you can get away with just about  anything. If you are a rich person in the United States, it almost  doesn't matter what crime you commit; you are going to get away with  it.   But, meanwhile, in Youngstown, Ohio; Steubenville, Ohio; Portsmouth,  Ohio; or Akron, Ohio, it trickles down. It has been those communities  who have suffered greatly, including Dayton, Ohio, because of this  epidemic.   Over the holidays, my wife and I were able to watch an amazing  documentary on Hulu called ``Dopesick,'' with Michael Keaton, Rosario  Dawson, and others, that went through the Sackler family approach to  painkillers. It was set in Virginia. Michael Keaton is from western PA  and a graduate of Kent State in Ohio. They were highlighting Virginia,  but this is an issue everywhere, where these good and honest and decent  people found themselves getting hooked because of the wealth and  profits that one family wanted to earn on the backs of the American  people.   So here we are today. We need to make sure that the Sackler families  of the world are punished and put out of business, quite frankly, and  we need to also make sure that we begin to take the bold steps we need  to take to make sure that the Rachels and the other kids and the other  people across this country, to the tune of a 100,000 deaths last year,  because of fentanyl.   So I believe we need to take a firmer stance. While I support what  the Biden administration has done, we need to go a hell of a lot  further. I believe we need to start having a conversation in this  country, knowing that China knows that they are sending fentanyl to  Mexico that makes its way into the United States, that they need to be  punished with tariffs. They need to be punished. They are killing our  kids. This is killing our kids.   We can't just stand around. We need to take the money from the  tariffs, support our border, support the cops who are on the beat in  these different communities. We need to put that money towards  addiction treatment, to make sure everybody can get better if they have  got some issue, and we need to grow the economy in these communities.                                time  1545    But we can't just stand by and hope this problem goes away, because  it is not. It will get worse, and there will be more families, more  destruction, more hopelessness, more ruined lives.   As we are trying to compete against China economically, we need to  make sure that Rachel and these other young, bright minds are on the  economic field playing for the United States of America. That is what  this is all about.   So we have to have a whole-of-government approach. We have a whole- of-government approach when it comes to the pandemic, right? The only  way you can have any success is when you have a whole-of-government  approach. This means Federal, State, and local coordination. This means  coordination with nonprofits. This means coordination with law  enforcement. This means coordination with the Border Patrol.   This is about us all coming together. You can't tell me we don't have  the imagination in the United States to figure this out. This is about  making it a priority.   What I am doing here tonight, and what many activists across the  country are doing, is trying to get this back on the front burner  because other than a few articles in the paper, it has been on the back  burner.   We need to make sure we increase the resources necessary to keep this  garbage out of our country or to know who has it the second they bring  it in here. We have to make sure all of our kids are aware that this  could be put in cocaine or meth or something else and that if you have  an issue with drugs, you can actually get the treatment that you need  and that no one is priced out of the market so that they can get better  and get healthy and become self-sufficient and become good citizens and  members of society and off to the races we go to try to outcompete  China because we care about our citizens. That is what this is all  about.   You are going to be hearing a lot from me in the coming weeks and  months. We are building a coalition of the families around Ohio and  across the country who want to begin to move this issue forward.   I do want to take a minute or two to talk about the power of  fentanyl. I mentioned carfentanil. But 1 kilogram of fentanyl--1  kilogram; 1--has the potential to kill 500,000 people.   The money that is being made off of this substance will blow your  mind, which is why it continues to come over the border from China,  from Mexico. Much of the fentanyl comes through the southern border  that is being looked at by the cartels. A lot of the China-sourced  fentanyl comes through the international mail, and some comes from  China through Canada.  [[Page H39]]    As I said, fentanyl is responsible for 80 percent of Ohio's overdose  deaths. Roughly 79 percent of meth, cocaine, psychostimulant overdose  deaths in Ohio were from supplies contaminated with fentanyl. The  pervasiveness of fentanyl contaminating other drugs has made overall  fatality rates for all drugs much higher than before, and we are seeing  it across the board.   We have the STOP Fentanyl Act. We have legislation with Annie Kuster  and others. There is a Manchin-Portman bill in the Senate, which  permanently makes fentanyl-related substances a schedule I controlled  substance. This is something that we have to address, and we have to  address it in a bipartisan manner.   I would just like to say, lastly, Madam Speaker, that these parents  have been through the ultimate tragedy. Having to put one of your own  kids to rest, there is no greater heartbreak. There is nothing worse  that could happen to a parent.   So I am pledging, and I know other Members are pledging, to keep up  the fight because, as some of these parents have told me, there is  nothing left to lose for them. These parents have had their hearts  ripped out of their bodies. They live with the pain every day. They  wake up in the middle of the night and open their eyes and hope it was  a nightmare, open their eyes in the morning and hope it didn't really  happen, that they could walk down the hall and their kid would still be  lying in their bed.   There is nothing more inspiring than seeing these giants, these  parents who are taking their pain, taking their experience, taking  their heartache and are saying: We have to fight. We can't let this  happen to another parent, to another brother or sister, to another  family member.   People like Cindy started Rachel's Angels, which is a group back in  Akron, Ohio, and there are so many groups across the country that have  sprung up because of these tragedies. We want to unite these groups. We  want to take the fight to the American people, to Congress, here in the  House and in the Senate, and get the resources we need to make sure  that these overdose deaths stop, that the companies producing these  kinds of drugs get punished, that the people peddling this stuff get  punished, and that we get the resources we need to keep this garbage  out of our country.   While this may be the first time this year that I stand up and speak  on this topic, it will not be the last. We are encouraging everybody,  Madam Speaker, to reach out to their Members of Congress, whether they  are Democrats or Republicans, and let's get this issue of fentanyl  deaths back on the front burner of the agenda here in the United States  Congress.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
