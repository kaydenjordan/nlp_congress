 Mr. President, so, on AI, yesterday, I met with a  bipartisan group of Senators--two Democrats, including myself, and two  Republicans--to talk about spearheading our bipartisan efforts to focus  on comprehensive AI legislation.   Our group agreed that because AI technology is developing so quickly,  Congress has to move fast. Over the past several weeks, my staff and I  have met with close to 100 CEOs of companies who do AI--scientists, AI  academics, leaders in the industry of many different viewpoints, and  critics of AI. And I plan to continue to do this.   If harnessed responsibly, AI has the power to do tremendous things  for the public good. It can unlock unimaginable marvels in medicine,  business, national security, science, and so many other areas of life;  but if left unchecked, AI has the power to do tremendous, tremendous  harm.   It can accelerate misinformation, breed new forms of racial  prejudice, create severe economic disruptions, and hinder human agency  in the most severe of ways.   So let me make a few observations in light of my conversation and our  meeting.   First, as I said a month ago, Congress must move quickly. Many AI  experts have pointed out that the government must have a role in how  this technology enters our lives; even leaders of the industry say they  welcome regulation. So if we were to fulfill our role properly, our  approach to AI must be fast-moving. We can't move so fast that we do  flawed legislation, but there is no time for waste or delay or sitting  back. We have to move fast.   Second, our group also agreed that any approach must be bipartisan.  AI technology already touches virtually every industry, field, and  facet in our society, so our process must be collaborative and must  draw from a broad and bipartisan range of views and issues.   And, third, we think we have a good case study for how the bipartisan  process can work: CHIPS and Science. When the Senate passed CHIPS and  Science, both sides came together on an issue that impacted the Nation  and involved a lot of committees, inputs, and views--much like AI will.  And because there was so much bipartisan overlap in CHIPS and Science,  as there is in AI, it makes it a lot easier to do this in a way that  brings bipartisan groups together from the very beginning.   So I hope CHIPS and Science can be a model for how we approach AI. I  thank my colleagues--so many of my colleagues--not just the four of us  who met, for their attention on this pressing issue, and I look forward  to continuing to work with a wide range of Senators for many committees  and from both sides of the aisle as we move forward.    Mr. President, the negotiations are currently making  progress. As Speaker McCarthy has said, he expects the House will vote  next week if an agreement is reached, and the Senate would begin  consideration after that.   Following the vote on the Abudu nomination, Members should remain  aware and be able to return to the Senate within a 24-hour period to  fulfill our responsibilities to avoid default.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, as I mentioned earlier, negotiations  continue making progress. As Speaker McCarthy says, he expects the  House will vote next week if an agreement is reached, and the Senate  would begin consideration after that. Members should be aware and be  able to return to the Senate within a 24-hour period to fulfill our  responsibilities to avoid default. But I also want to take a moment to  talk about some of the work the Senate has made progress on recently in  the last work period.   Over this work period, the Senate confirmed more than seven district  court judges and three new circuit court judges--Bradley Garcia,  Anthony Johnstone, and Nancy Abudu--confirmed earlier this afternoon to  serve a lifetime appointment on the Eleventh Circuit that represents  Florida, Georgia, and Alabama.   Ms. Abudu's appointment to the bench is barrier-breaking. She will be  the first Black woman to preside on the Eleventh Circuit, and her  circuit is home to nearly 8 million--8 million--Black Americans,  including the Presiding Officer's great State.   We have a duty to ensure that Federal judges are individuals of the  highest caliber, and that includes appointing judges from a wide  variety of personal and professional backgrounds. Ms. Abudu meets that  higher standard, and she will serve admirably on the bench.   With the confirmation of Ms. Abudu, the Senate has now confirmed 129  judges under President Biden--129.   Elsewhere, the Senate passed the bipartisan Fire Grants and Safety  Act so firefighters can better afford lifesaving equipment and  personnel, particularly in smaller, more rural, and more suburban  areas, where the equipment is harder to find and harder to afford.   Senators also reintroduced the SAFE Banking Act to enable cannabis  businesses to access critical banking structures. Just last week, the  Banking Committee held its first hearing on this legislation. And I  will also work to make sure we include criminal justice provisions to  SAFE Banking.   Last week, the Commerce Committee moved on the bipartisan Railway  Safety Act out of committee. I will work  [[Page S1737]]  with Senators on both sides, including Senators Brown and Vance, the  two lead sponsors, as well as Casey and Fetterman, also sponsors, to  bring the Railway Safety Act for a vote soon.   I will likewise work with my colleagues on efforts to make  prescription drugs more affordable, including insulin. Last week, the  HELP Committee advanced significant drug reforms, and it is my hope  this process will continue to move forward in a bipartisan manner and  will enable us to lower the cost of prescription drugs, particularly  insulin.   This work period, I joined with colleagues and committee chairs to  announce the next steps in the Senate's effort to outcompete the  Chinese Government and preserve America's global leadership in the 21st  century. Last week, the Commerce Committee marked up bipartisan  legislation on the U.S. semiconductor supply chains, and, this week,  the Appropriations Committee held a bipartisan hearing on investments  to outcompete the Chinese Government. The House Government Affairs  Committee also marked up several bills on security and competitiveness.  Our committees will continue working on various efforts on this issue  during the next work period. Outcompeting the Chinese Government will  be one of the great challenges of our generation, and we must be clear- eyed and act accordingly.   So this has been a busy stretch for the Senate on a number of  different fronts: more judges, progress with Fire Grants, SAFE Banking,  Rail Safety, competing with the Chinese Government, prescription drug  reform, and a whole host of important issues.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  consider the following nominations: all nominations placed on the  Secretary's desk in the Air Force, Army, Marine Corps, and Navy; that  the nominations be confirmed en bloc; that the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or  debate; that no further motions be in order to any of the nominations;  and that the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session and be in a period of morning business,  with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the  consideration of S. Res. 221, submitted earlier today.    I know of no further debate on the resolution.    I ask unanimous consent that the preamble be agreed to,  and that the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the  table with no intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate  proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 222, submitted earlier today.    I ask unanimous consent the resolution be agreed to, the  preamble be agreed to, and that the motions to reconsider be considered  made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.

Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask that it stand adjourned under the previous  order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 3:52 p.m., adjourned until  Friday, May 19, 2023, at 9:45 a.m.                            ____________________
