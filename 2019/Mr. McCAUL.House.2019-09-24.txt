 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the First Responders Passport  Act, and I thank the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Chabot) for introducing  this bill.   Americans who answer the call to service in response to disasters  abroad are some of the best that America has to offer. Often first on  the scene when calamity strikes, our fire and rescue teams are the  embodiment of the generosity of the American people. Their commitment  and sacrifice earn immense goodwill toward our Nation.   This bill will help our first responders obtain the overseas travel  documentation that they need in a quick and cost-effective way.   For these reasons, it deserves our unanimous support, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio  (Mr. Chabot), a senior member of the Foreign Affairs Committee and the  author of the First Responders Passport Act.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close.   Mr. Speaker, America's first responders represent to the world the  humanity at the heart of our Nation.   I, again, thank the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Chabot) for his  expression of support for their overseas activities, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of Congresswoman Wagner's  Southeast Asia Strategy Act.   This bill will promote U.S. cooperation with the Association of  Southeast Asian Nations and establish a comprehensive interagency  strategy for engagement in Southeast Asia.   ASEAN is the center of Asia's strategic and economic future and  critical to the administration's Indo-Pacific strategy. Southeast Asia  has been a critical global crossroads for hundreds of years, and it is  growing even more important in the 21st century. Trillions in trade  pass through regional sea-lanes, including vital energy supplies for  U.S. allies and adversaries.   China's territorial aggression in the South China Sea and its  predatory Belt and Road Initiative are central to the region's  geopolitics. Southeast Asia's rising economies are becoming important  drivers of regional growth as its developed economies begin to slow.   The Southeast Asia Strategy Act is a welcome step to ensure that this  critical region receives the interagency focus that it deserves and  that it requires.   Mr. Speaker, therefore, I urge my colleagues to support this measure,  and I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1515     Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Missouri (Mrs. Wagner), the vice ranking member of the Committee on  Foreign Affairs and the author of the Southeast Asia Strategy Act.    Mr. Speaker, in closing, I would like to thank  Congresswoman Wagner, the vice ranking member of the Foreign Affairs  Committee, for introducing the Southeast Asia Strategy Act.   The administration's national security strategy has recommitted the  United States to great power competition, and the People's Republic of  China is our primary strategic competitor.   The Indo-Pacific region is at the center of this competition, and  Southeast Asia is at the center of the Indo-Pacific.   Mr. Speaker, for these reasons, I urge my colleagues to support the  bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the Burma Political  Prisoners Assistance Act, introduced by the gentleman from Michigan  (Mr. Levin) and the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. Wagner).   True to our founding ideals, the United States must continue to stand  as a beacon of hope and freedom in the world. This includes voicing our  support for political prisoners who are in chains only because of their  peaceful dissent.   Although recent years have seen elections in Burma, the human rights  situation there still remains grave.   Burma's brutal military remains constitutionally immune from civilian  oversight or control. It still has not been held responsible for the  unspeakable, bloody genocide against Burma's Rohingya population 2  years ago, which displaced hundreds of thousands of people in  Bangladesh and India.   Criticizing the government remains a dangerous business in Burma. A  lot of things can get you thrown into jail, or worse: honest reporting  about military violence against ethnic minorities, telling the truth  about the use of child soldiers, or expressing political dissent, among  other things.   As a result, there are hundreds of prisoners of conscience in Burma.  All people deserve fundamental rights of speech and political  expression and to be free from arbitrary imprisonment.   Mr. Speaker, for these reasons, I am pleased to support this  bipartisan bill before us today. The brutal Burmese military continues  to exercise outsized influence over the government in that country and  tramples the rights of many who dare to dissent. True to American  ideals, this measure expresses our solidarity and concern for political  prisoners in Burma and, really, throughout the world, and it deserves  our full support.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague on the other side of the aisle, Mr.  Levin, for his strong, bipartisan support for this measure, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of Chairman Engel's BURMA  Act of 2019. The Foreign Affairs Committee unanimously adopted this  bill, reflecting a bipartisan consensus that the Burmese military's  atrocities against the Rohingya people must not go unanswered.   The committee has a decades-long history of holding Burmese forces  accountable for their crimes. This is important, now more than ever  after their so-called clearance operations against the Rohingya in  August 2017.   The world watched in horror as Burmese troops razed villages to the  ground, killed indiscriminately, committed unspeakable acts against  women and children, and laid landmines in the path of refugees as they  fled into neighboring Bangladesh.   Today, over 1 million Rohingya remain in Bangladesh, living in  desperate conditions, unable to return to their home safely.   The scale and scope of this crisis unites this whole House. Last  December, this body adopted Congressman Chabot's resolution, H. Res.  1091, declaring that the Burmese military is guilty of genocide.   Chairman Engel's BURMA Act of 2019 will selectively revive the  sanctions regime against the Burmese military, which was recklessly  scrapped during the last administration. This step is long overdue, and  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bipartisan effort.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, I thank Chairman Engel for introducing the  BURMA Act of 2019 in this Congress.   The Burmese military is responsible for genocide, yet they continue  to wield constitutional power over Burma's government and significant  influence over Burma's economy.   This bill is a long-overdue response to that injustice and will  reimpose costs on the toxic influence of the Burmese military.   Again, I urge my colleagues to support this bill.  [[Page H7885]]    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution, which  Chairman Engel and I introduced earlier this year.   The U.S. alliances with Japan and South Korea remain critical to U.S.  national security interests in the Indo-Pacific and around the world.  The trilateral cooperation we share with both of these allies is  essential now more than ever, as we face China's aggressive expansion  with its Belt and Road policy and North Korea's continued nuclear  belligerence.   But the relationship between South Korea and Japan continues to be  burdened by historical grievances surrounding imperial Japan's conduct  both before and during World War II.   These tensions have flared up since late 2018, developing into an  export control dispute and, more recently, affecting our security  cooperation.   For instance, last month, South Korea announced that it will withdraw  from the General Security of Military Information Agreement with Japan.  This key intelligence-sharing pact is essential to our joint responses  to North Korean missile launches and other fast-developing military  crises. South Korea's withdrawal will take effect in November, so it is  essential that this confrontation between the two important U.S. allies  be resolved as soon as possible.   Chairman Engel's resolution is a timely reminder of the U.S.  relationship with both of these critical security partners and the  enduring importance of our trilateral cooperation.   In addition, Mr. Speaker, Japan has now banned certain products to be  exported to South Korea that are used by South Korea and Samsung, which  is in my district. They are the largest foreign investment in the  United States. Samsung will be hamstrung in its ability to create  semiconductor chips and bring them to the United States and its  facility out in Austin, Texas, in my district.   For all these reasons, and national security reasons, most  importantly, I urge my colleagues to support this measure.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this bipartisan resolution  focusing on refugees and displaced persons, and I want to thank the  gentleman from California (Mr. Ted Lieu) and the gentleman from Florida  (Mr. Diaz-Balart) for introducing the resolution.   Today, conflict, violence, and natural disasters have displaced more  than 70 million people around the world, the highest levels in history.  We see these traumas in Syria, in Venezuela, in sub-Saharan Africa, in  Burma and many other places.   These huge movements of vulnerable people and populations are not  just humanitarian crises, but also strategic challenges to the  stability of many critical regions.   The United States is and will continue to be a leader in confronting  this reality. We remain the largest single donor supporting the needs  of refugees and displaced persons around the world. But, as the need is  increasing, we must also push our partners and other responsible  nations to contribute more to these important efforts.   This resolution also, appropriately, recognizes the men and women who  risk their lives to provide lifesaving assistance and protection to  refugee populations. Without their bravery and dedication, none of this  work would be possible.   In closing, I want to urge all my colleagues to support this  important resolution.   Let me also say, on a point of personal privilege, I have enjoyed  this exchange, this debate today with my good friend from Michigan (Mr.  Levin), carrying on what I consider to be what the Foreign Affairs  Committee is most proud of, and that is we are the most bipartisan  committee in the House and, I would argue, in the Congress, and it is a  great tradition to carry forward. I look forward to working with Mr.  Levin in the future.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
