 Thank you, Mr. President. I am thankful for my colleague  from Pennsylvania, Senator Toomey, for his remarks and for his  leadership in getting us to this point tonight for this most historic  moment in the U.S. Senate.   I spent 28 years in the private sector before I came back to  Washington, DC. In fact, the last election I won before I won election  to serve in Congress was student body president in my high school.   I spent many years working in businesses, growing businesses,  creating jobs, sending a lot of money to Washington, DC, in taxes. You  are not going to find a single Republican here who says taxes are bad.  What we are saying here is that we are an overtaxed Nation.   In fact, if I were to ask you where are the most affluent counties in  the United States, where are they, you might guess, well, Beverly  Hills, perhaps Silicon Valley, New York City. The answer is, the most  affluent counties in America are suburbs of Washington, DC.   The American people have watched this city increase in power,  increase in wealth, and I think this city has forgotten something; that  the dollars that are sent here by hard-working Americans do not belong  to the government, they belong to the American people. It is their  money.   I will tell you what. I don't think we realize how much taxes we pay.  We are focused right now on Federal income taxes, Federal corporate  taxes. However, imagine you wake up in the morning--if you are like me,  my cell phone is now my alarm clock--and you grab your cell phone. You  reach for it. The first thing you do is maybe look at what inbound  emails you have, maybe you look at the Twitter feed, but you realize,  as you are grabbing the cell phone, on average, a U.S. wireless  consumer pays about 17 percent--of that bill you pay for your cell  phone, there are Federal, State, and local taxes for that cell phone.  That is how the day starts.   So then I go, and I get dressed. I think about how much sales tax was  paid, which most States have, for the clothes that you are wearing.  Well, then you might leave your home, walk across your driveway to get  in an automobile, perhaps, and you realize you are paying significant  property tax on that property you own--if you are a homeowner--and you  get in your automobile. Oh, by the way, you have paid a significant tax  on that car too. You have paid a sales tax, most likely. You may be  paying hundreds of dollars a year to put license plates on it. Then you  want to drive on to work, and you might want to stop at that coffee  shop. You might want to get that nice cup of coffee there to get you  going for the day. What do you do? Well, you pay a sales tax, most  likely, as you get your cup of coffee.   Perhaps on the way to work, you need to fill up your gas tank. Now,  in Montana, we drive pickups. I could tell you, when you fill up your  pickup, it costs you a chunk of change.   You are paying 18.4 cents per gallon just in federal taxes, and then  you pay your State taxes on top of that. That ranges from 12 cents a  gallon in Alaska to 58 cents a gallon in Pennsylvania, and then you go  to work.   I was just speaking with one of my young staffers here tonight. She  told me, when she got that first paycheck--I guess her first job out of  college--she called her dad, and she said: They have made a mistake.  They have screwed up my paycheck. And she talked him through the  difference between the gross pay and what you really put in the bank,  the dollars of your Federal, State, local taxes, Social Security,  Medicare.   Your day is finished. Perhaps you want to go home and grab something  to drink, whether it is a glass of wine, perhaps a beer, perhaps a  soda. Well, the government is there too. You have paid an excise tax  somewhere on those beverages. All I am saying here is it is time to  give some of that back. It is time to give some of that back to the  single mom in Kalispell, to give it back to that small business owner  in Helena, to give it back to the families, the businesses, working- class Montanans. You know what, they need a pay raise.   So how do we start that? How about right here with this bill tonight.  Let's lower tax rates on middle income Americans. Let's allow them to  keep more of their hard-earned dollars. How about we increase the  standard deduction? Let's take it from $12,000 to $24,000. How about we  eliminate the poverty tax? That is eliminating ObamaCare's poverty tax.  As Justice Roberts said, it is a tax. It has cost the American people  so far over $5 billion, 42 percent of those making less than $25,000 a  year, 82 percent make less than $50,000 a year. That is a poverty tax.  We are going to repeal that as part of this bill that we are going to  pass tonight.   Families need a break. How about we double the child tax credit? We  are parents of four. How about that single mom with two children? I  think she needs a break. Let's give working moms, working dads with a  couple of kids an extra couple thousand dollars to help make ends meet  and reduce the tax burden on small businesses--not corporations. We  will talk about that in a minute. That is important to do, but these  small businesses that are not corporations are paying as much as 40  percent of their income in Federal income taxes. We are going to take  that down to less than 30 percent.   What does that do? It creates jobs. It puts pressure on wages, higher  wages, because we need to direct these tax cuts to those who provide  jobs.   By the way, those smaller businesses, 55 percent of the private  sector jobs in this country are from smaller businesses. Two-thirds of  the new jobs created since the recession of 2007, 2008 are from these  smaller businesses. We are targeting significant tax relief for those  small businesses. Who are these? These are farmers. These are ranchers.  These are locally owned Montana businesses. It could be our community  bankers. It could be a baking company. It could be a construction  company. I grew up in a construction company. My mom and dad were the  CEO and the COO of the family business. In Montana, that is 68 percent  of the jobs in my State. They are getting significant tax relief.  Working with my colleagues, we have had some great conversations, and  we have provided some additional tax relief for those smaller  businesses.    We have a historic, once-in-a-generation opportunity today. This only  comes every 20 or 30 years. It goes back to 1986, 31 years ago--the  same year my wife and I were married. We need to put more money back  into the hands of American workers. Let's cut their taxes. Let's open  the doors for the creation of more high-paying jobs. We start that by  transferring the wealth of this city back to the families and  businesses that sent us here in the first place and that keep our  country moving forward.   We have been hearing a lot of things about this bill. The Washington  Post even claimed four Pinocchios on some of these claims that somehow  this plan will raise taxes for most working-class families. Look at the  facts. That is not true.   Let me conclude by saying this, quoting a President:         It is a paradoxical truth that tax rates are too high today       and tax revenues are too low and the soundest way to raise       revenues in the long term is to cut the rates now. The       experience of a number of European countries and Japan have       borne this out. The purpose of cutting taxes now is not to       incur a budget deficit, but to achieve a more prosperous,       expanding economy which can bring a budget surplus.    That was John F. Kennedy in December of 1962.   Let's not miss this opportunity that we have now.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there now be  [[Page S7685]]  30 minutes, equally divided, for debate only, with no amendments or  motions in order, and that the majority leader be recognized at the  conclusion of that time.
