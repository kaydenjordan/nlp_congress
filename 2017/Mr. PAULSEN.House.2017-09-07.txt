 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk as the  designee of the gentleman from New York (Mr. Donovan).   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 896, line 17, after the dollar amount, insert       ``(increased by $15,000,000)''.        Page 907, line 1, after the dollar amount, insert       ``(reduced by $15,000,000)''.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 500, the gentleman  from Minnesota (Mr. Paulsen) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Minnesota.    Mr. Chairman, first I would just like to thank  Subcommittee Chairman Rogers and Ranking Member Lowey, along with the  full committee and Chairman Frelinghuysen and their staff for their  willingness to help with this amendment, as well as for all the hard  work that they have done in putting together this important funding  bill.   I also want to recognize Congressman Donovan, who is not able to be  here today, but I offer this amendment along with him because it does  seek to increase funding for the U.S. African Development Foundation by  $15 million, bringing it up to the $30 million that it was awarded back  in fiscal year `17.   The U.S. African Development Foundation is an independent U.S.  government agency that excels at doing development differently. It uses  small grants to focus on ventures in the fields of food security,  healthcare, education, and technology. Our taxpayer money is maximized  to its full potential, as host African governments invest a share of  their own money in this grant program. These grant programs are leading  to self-sufficiency and entrepreneurship in countries that are plagued  by conflict across the world.   In fact, the Center for Global Development has ranked the USADF  second only to the Millennium Challenge Corporation on the maximizing  foreign efficiency scale.   Mr. Chairman, the U.S. African Development Foundation represents the  very best of modernized foreign assistance because they are so  innovative, and I am honored to support it. I hope the rest of my  colleagues will join me in supporting this amendment as well.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, let me start by acknowledging my colleagues,  Representatives Emmer and Nolan. I'm proud to call both of you my  friends, but I'm speaking tonight because I disagree with this  amendment.   We can be open to new types of mining in Minnesota when the necessary  environmental reviews are met, like in the case of Polymet, which I  support.   Taconite mining is part of Minnesota's DNA. However, the copper- nickel mining being proposed on the edge of the Boundary Waters Canoe  Area is not taconite mining, and has never been done before in  Minnesota. Earlier this year, the Trump administration said it would  allow the current environmental review process to proceed to  completion. I support that decision, and I oppose this amendment's  effort to defund an ongoing environmental review to protect one of  Minnesota's natural treasures. Indeed, it's one of our country's most  spectacular wilderness areas.   The Boundary Waters is Minnesota's Yellowstone. Hundreds of thousands  of Americans visit on fishing and canoe trips annually. Some of the  best memories of my life have taken place in the Boundary Waters, both  as a child and now as a parent with my daughters.   The public process that is underway after hundreds of thousands of  people weighed in with their comments, should not be ignored and tossed  aside. And, a science-based assessment of the best management practices  of this sensitive ecosystem should be adhered to. We owe it to future  generations to understand the impact copper-nickel mining poses to  Minnesota's most precious water and land before we put it at risk.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendments en bloc offered  by the gentleman from California (Mr. Calvert).   The en bloc amendments were agreed to.                    Amendment No. 8 Offered by Ms. McSally    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 8  printed in House Report 115-297.   Ms. McSALLY. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 15, line 13, after the first dollar amount, insert       ``(increased by $9,692,000)''.        Page 15, line 15, after the dollar amount, insert       ``(increased by $9,692,000)''.        Page 64, line 1, after the dollar amount, insert ``(reduced       by $12,078,000)''.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 504, the gentlewoman  from Arizona (Ms. McSally) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Arizona.   Ms. McSALLY. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in favor of my amendment to  the Make America Secure and Prosperous Appropriations Act.   This amendment would approve access to America's prized treasures by  increasing the National Park Service's Facility Maintenance and  Operations account by $9.7 million, bringing the funding amount up to  the fiscal year 2017 enacted level. In doing so, this amendment will  help address the longstanding deferred maintenance needs of the Park  Service.   Currently, the National Park Service has an $11.9 billion backlog,  which is a figure that has increased steadily since 2009. According to  the most recent NPS deferred maintenance report, the Yosemite National  Park, in Chairman Calvert's home State, has a backlog of $555 million.  Yellowstone has a backlog of $716 million across three States.  [[Page H7141]]  The Grand Canyon's backlog of $350 million makes up a large portion of  my home State's--Arizona--delayed and deferred projects. In fact,  Arizona has one of the largest backlogs of any State in the country:  $565 million.   This problem doesn't only impact the crown jewels of the park system.  In my district, maintenance projects require attention at the Saguaro  National Park of approximately $12.9 million, of which the Chiricahua  National Monument in Cochise County faces roughly $10.3 million in  needed restoration projects.   Mr. Chairman, this country and my State is home to some of the  world's most renowned landscapes and natural beauty. By providing this  modest funding increase to address some of the backlog across the  Nation, my amendment will ensure Americans have unimpaired access to  their national parks and that the enjoyment of these wonders is  available for future generations.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.   Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Minnesota is recognized for 5  minutes.   Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I must oppose this amendment that takes  more money away from an already starved Environmental Protection  Agency. The EPA's main operating account is already cut by $240  million.   The EPA plays a critical role in keeping Americans safe both during  natural disasters like Hurricane Harvey and on a day-to-day basis. I  know this because the EPA, right now, is cleaning up a toxic waste site  that has been recently discovered in my congressional district.   Unfortunately, the very air we breathe and the water we drink is  endangered by the funding and policy decisions that are made in this  bill, and their consequences will be negatively felt in communities  across this Nation.   Now, this amendment would increase funding for the National Park  Service, something I do support. I have just been to Glacier National  Park, where I saw their backlog, and I agree wholeheartedly that we  should be investing in our parks, but it cannot be done at the expense  of our public health.   Republicans have chosen to put forward an omnibus bill that leaves  nearly $5 billion of nondiscretionary funds on the table. So rather  than gutting the EPA farther, we should be using all the resources  available to us and working on a bipartisan budget agreement.   Mr. Chairman, I oppose this amendment, and I yield back the balance  of my time.
