 Mr. Speaker, today, finally, a congressional  resolution that will pay tribute to the Armenian, the Syrian, the  Greek, the Chaldean, and other lives lost, and the determination of  those who survive.   To many Americans of Armenian descent who continue to strengthen our  country today, we honor those contributions with an honest statement of  history, recognizing the massacre of 1.5 Armenians as the 20th  century's first genocide.   In the spirit of honoring these victims, I am proud to cosponsor H.  Res. 296, an official recognition of the Armenian genocide.    Mr. Speaker, I stand here today with the Michigan  delegation and my beloved members of the Congressional Black Caucus to  pay honor and tribute to the life of John Conyers. He passed away this  past weekend.   As we know, John Conyers was the dean of this Congress. He served 53  years. He served as chairman of the Committee on Oversight and  Government Reform as well as the Judiciary.   We stand here today to recognize his fight for civil rights, his  fight to have the Martin Luther King birthday celebration, his fight  against apartheid, his fight to ensure that we in this country never  lost sight of our criminal justice that is not equal, and his fight for  justice for all.   We often remember him walking around with his kind manner in this  House, and I ask at this time if we could have a moment of silence.   Would everyone please stand.                            ____________________
