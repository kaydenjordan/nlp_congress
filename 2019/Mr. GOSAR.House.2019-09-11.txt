 Mr. Chair, I thank my friend and Ranking Member Bishop for  yielding.   Mr. Chair, I rise in strong opposition to this misguided legislation.  This legislation will put the United States at a distinct disadvantage  with the rest of the world by taking some of our country's most  valuable energy deposits off-limits to exploration. By the way, these  are the people of the United States' resources.   Under the current administration, America is experiencing an energy  renaissance. By taking an all-of-the-above approach to energy policy,  this administration has kick-started unprecedented growth in our energy  production. For the first time since the 1950s, the United States will  become a net exporter of oil and natural gas, providing great benefits  for our economy and our national security. However, my colleagues on  the other side of the aisle want to make these successes short-term  phenomena.   By permanently putting both the Atlantic and Pacific Outer  Continental Shelves off-limits to oil and gas exploration, this bill  ties one hand behind our Nation's back. Instead of making potential  bountiful energy deposits off-limits to development, this Congress  should be interested in making sure that these deposits are responsibly  developed. Technological advancements in offshore energy development  have made it safer than ever before.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose this legislation.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I rise today to offer an amendment that changes  the title of this legislation to something more fitting, that being the  ``Russian Energy Reliance and United States Poverty Act.''   The consequences of this legislation becoming law would have  devastating, long-term impacts on the economic and national security of  the United States. Putting both the Atlantic and Pacific Outer  Continental Shelves permanently off-limits to oil and gas development  puts the United States at a distinct disadvantage to the rest of the  world.   We have already seen how policies from liberal States that are along  the same lines of this legislation have caused certain parts of the  country to become dependent upon Russian energy. New England, for  example, was forced to import Russian natural gas in the wintertime  because of the ludicrous decision by the State of New York not to allow  pipelines to be built through the State.   The legislation before us today would have similar consequences. As  existing oil and gas deposits begin to run dry, new deposits will need  to be extracted, many of which are located on the Pacific and Atlantic  Outer Continental Shelves.   Putting these deposits off-limits would cause us to go back to the  old days of the old normal that had become  [[Page H7617]]  commonplace under the previous administration. The old normal of  relying on foreign adversaries such as Russia to meet our energy needs  is preposterous.   The Members across the aisle may try to hide their intentions, but  they are becoming clearer every day. They want to dismantle our  domestic oil and gas industry, an industry that employs close to 10  million people and plays a critical role in our Nation's energy  security.   Mr. Chair, I ask my colleagues to support this amendment so that the  American people are aware of the true ramifications of this misguided  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I find it interesting that we are even debating  this because, if it was such a poor decision, maybe the Rules Committee  should not have made it in order. So, there is compliance from the  other side.   When we start looking at this aspect, we have to be truthful to the  American people. The American people see the jargon that we actually  come up with in this body, and they want to have a straight shot-- common sense. This is exactly what it should be titled because we are  taking inventory off that belonged to the American people.   Yes, I am one of those who believes in all-of-the-above energy  policies. What we have to tell them and explain to them is that there  is a difference between baseload power and intermittent power.   Renewables do not have baseline power. To have a reliable electric  grid that everybody depends upon, we have to have both. Green energy  does not produce that application of baseload power, unless we are  talking about hydro, and that we don't even consider a green energy  anymore, from the other side.   I think we need to be clear to the American people where these jobs  are. They are good-paying jobs, $90,000 and above with benefits.   When we take away these types of reserves, it really is victimizing  the American people. That is not something I want to do. I want to make  sure that they are empowered.   These resources belong to the American people, and there is no reason  why we shouldn't be able to use them and extract them diligently and  cleanly.   Mr. Chair, I ask everybody to vote for this, to be clear to the  American public what this stands for, and I yield back the balance of  my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Utah for  yielding.   Part of this body's responsibility is the public charge of looking at  the resources of the American people. These resources do not belong to  a single State, whether it be South Carolina, California, New Jersey,  Wyoming or anything else. These are the public charge of the American  people to this body of Congress, and part of the public charge is to  understand what type of resources and the value those resources have to  that public charge in regard to the people of this country.   So doing our due diligence, it is a mandatory aspect that we  undertake this charge to understand what that responsibility is to the  American people. In some of the next amendments, you will actually see  some of that public charge in that regard.    This is an undertaking that is specifically null and void based upon  what we owe the American people for the due diligence of this body in  regard to the ownership of which they have of the Outer Continental  Shelf. The magnitude is of inconsequential application. I ask everybody  to vote against this amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer an amendment that  allows the section 2 moratorium in this bill to go into effect when the  Department of the Interior, in consultation with the Department of  Labor, certifies that the offshore energy moratorium in the bill will  not kill a substantial number of minority and women jobs.   Under the current administration, unemployment has reached record  lows. In August, the national unemployment rate sat at 3.7 percent,  with the unemployment rate for African American workers sitting at 5.5  percent, breaking the previous record of 5.9 percent which was set in  May of 2018 under the same administration.   According to a recent jobs report from The Washington Post--hardly a  bastion of conservative credentialing--nearly 90 percent of the jobs  added under this administration have gone to minority communities. This  is astounding. This can be attributed to the first time a majority of  new hires are people between the ages of 25 and 54, and they are from  the minority communities.   According to statistics published by the American Petroleum  Institute, minorities will comprise one-third of the total workforce in  the oil and gas sector by 2030. Women already comprise more than 15  percent of the oil and gas workforce. These are good-paying jobs,  paying $90,000, that hardworking families depend upon.   This legislation puts these employment opportunities at risk by  putting off limits potentially viable and valuable offshore energy  opportunities in the eastern Gulf of Mexico that are the property of  the American people.   For the first time since the 1950s, the United States will soon be a  net exporter of oil and natural gas, something that at one time was  unthinkable. America's energy renaissance has boosted the economies of  previously left-behind towns throughout the country and turned them  into vibrant communities.   Mr. Chairman, this commonsense amendment protects minority and women  jobs and puts the interests of the American workforce first and  foremost. It is very clear-cut, something that the American people can  fully understand.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I thought I heard that this has nothing to do  with the bill. If that is the case, I take umbrage with that, and maybe  we ought to take it up with the Parliamentarian. The majority actually  put this in order, so I think it does pertain to this bill.   I also heard that we can't have our cake and eat it too, that it is  all about visitation and enjoying the outdoors. How does that work for  Colorado? How does that work for Wyoming? How does that work for  Arizona? We actually have our cake and can eat it too.   Once again, I remind everybody that these are the property of the  American people, not of individual States.   I get it. You are closest to this, so you are implicated in some way  or form. But I also want to remind you that, particularly in the  Pacific, natural slicks of oil exist naturally. It is something that  nature actually takes care of. With that aspect, it is very important.   The power of a job is very, very important. It empowers people. It  doesn't victimize them. It is very important that we are astute as to  where we are putting people to work.   By the way, if we don't have good jobs, how can we travel to go visit  these wonderful sites, enjoy a boat ride going out and fishing in those  areas?   When you start to look at some of our plentiful playgrounds of these  areas, look no further than Alaska, one of the most plentiful,  bountiful areas for fish and wildlife. People come from  [[Page H7622]]  around the world to see that, yet they have their cake and eat it too.   Once again, I want to make sure that people are empowered with these  good-paying jobs, particularly those of minority, those of gender.  These are important applications that facilitate upward mobility of  people.   This is a very timely amendment, something that is vastly overdue. We  need to consider the consequences when we do actions that are  consequential.   Mr. Chair, this is a very timely amendment. I ask everybody to vote  for this amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Bishop),  ranking member, for some time to speak in opposition to this bill.   Madam Chair, like the previous legislation, this bill represents a  step backwards in ensuring American energy security, but making certain  sections of the eastern Gulf of Mexico permanently off limits to oil  and gas development, this legislation once again ties one hand behind  our Nation's back.   As chairman of the Congressional Western Caucus and the ranking  member of the House Committee on Natural Resources Subcommittee on  Energy and Mineral Resources, I have a unique insight into many of  America's energy issues.   Many on the Western Caucus and Republican members on the Committee on  Natural Resources have a different vision for America, a vision that  doesn't pick winners and losers and includes a true all-of-the-above  energy strategy that embraces wind, solar, nuclear, hydropower, coal,  oil, and natural gas. Our vision encourages innovation and less  burdensome mandates. We know responsible energy production and  protecting our environment go hand in hand.   The offshore coalition, a group of at least 17 members, including the  U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the Laborers' International Union of North  America, sent a letter opposing H.R. 205, H.R. 1941, and H.R. 1146. In  the coalition's letter, they state: ``For more than seven decades,  energy development in the Gulf of Mexico has worked collaboratively  alongside tourism, fishing, and Defense Department training activities.  But H.R. 205 would permanently extend the eastern Gulf of Mexico  moratorium on oil and natural gas activities.   ``We rely on American-made energy to power our daily lives,  communities, and to grow a prosperous future. Americans deserve clean,  safe, reliable, abundant, and affordable energy so that our families,  communities, and businesses can all share the opportunities American  energy creates.   ``Our country cannot afford to block access to new energy supplies  and risk losing our energy advantage. That's why we ask you to oppose  legislation being considered by the U.S. House of Representatives this  week that would slow scientific surveys and prevent access to new  sources of American offshore energy in the Outer Continental Shelf.''   Our previous speaker actually alluded to this very aspect. It takes  10 years to go from inquiry to actual production. I couldn't agree more  with the sentiments expressed by this broad coalition, by previous  Members here on this side of the aisle that have opposed it, and I urge  Members to oppose H.R. 205.    Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, I ask unanimous consent that my amendment be  modified in the form I have placed at the desk.    Madam Chair, I rise today to offer an amendment that  allows the section 2 moratorium in this bill to go into effect when the  Department of the Interior, in consultation with the Department of  Labor, certifies that the offshore energy moratorium in the bill will  not kill a substantial number of minority and women jobs.   We heard arguments from the Democratic Members on the other side of  the aisle against a similar amendment, that this amendment doesn't  matter and is meaningless. How callous that response.   I tell opponents of this amendment to tell that single mother working  to put food on the table for her two children that her job doesn't  matter. How about the minority family who just moved into a new  neighborhood so their kids could go to better schools? Tell those  hardworking, minority parents that those jobs don't matter either.   Under the current administration, unemployment has reached record  lows. In August, the national unemployment rate sat at 3.7 percent,  with the unemployment rate for African American workers sitting at 5.5  percent, breaking the previous record of 5.9 percent set in May 2018.   According to a recent report by The Washington Post--once again, the  bastion of conservative reporting--nearly 90 percent of the jobs added  under this administration has gone to minority communities. This can be  attributed to, for the first time, a majority of new hires are people  between the ages of 25 to 54 and are from minority communities.   According to statistics published by the American Petroleum  Institute, minorities will comprise one-third of the total workforce in  the oil and gas sector by 2030. Women already comprise more than 15  percent of the oil and gas workforce.   These are good-paying jobs, paying $90,000, that hardworking families  depend upon. This legislation puts these employment opportunities at  risk by permanently putting off-limits potentially viable and valuable  offshore energy opportunities in the eastern Gulf of Mexico.   For the first time since the 1950s, the United States will soon be a  net exporter of oil and natural gas, something that was once  unthinkable.   America's energy renaissance has boosted the economies of previously  left-behind towns throughout the country and turned them into vibrant  communities.   Madam Chair, this is a commonsense amendment that protects minority  and women jobs and puts the interests of the American workforce first.  I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, if that supposition that has been proposed is  actually true, then an easy certification by the Secretary of the  Interior is in the works that there is no denominational change in  regards to those jobs, in regards to the oil and gas industry with this  permanent moratorium. So, once again, it gets us back to that permanent  moratorium in section 2 does place those at risk.   Again, I ask my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to think of  that single mother who is working to put food on the table for her two  children. Tell her that her job doesn't matter.   Again, think of the minority family that just moved into a new  neighborhood so their kids could go to better schools. Tell those  working minorities, those parents that their jobs don't matter.   Think of the statistics that we repeatedly looked at from, no less,  The Washington Post. These are real jobs. They are helping real people.  They are part of a real economy, an economy that needs all of the  above.   Once again, we can have tourism, we can have clean energy production  and protect the environment, and we can have the good-paying jobs that  are empowering women and minorities.   I urge my colleagues to adopt this amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.   The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--ayes 182,  noes 251, not voting 5, as follows:                               [Roll No. 520]                                 AYES--182       Aderholt      Allen      Amodei      Armstrong      Arrington      Babin      Bacon      Baird      Balderson      Banks      Barr      Bergman      Biggs      Bishop (UT)      Bost      Brady      Brooks (AL)      Brooks (IN)      Buck      Bucshon      Budd      Burchett      Burgess      Byrne      Calvert      Carter (GA)      Carter (TX)      Chabot      Cheney      Cline      Cloud      Cole      Collins (GA)      Collins (NY)      Comer      Conaway      Cook      Crawford      Crenshaw      Curtis      Davidson (OH)      Davis, Rodney      DesJarlais      Duffy      Duncan      Dunn      Emmer      Estes      Ferguson      Fleischmann      Flores      Fortenberry      Foxx (NC)      Fulcher      Gallagher      Gianforte      Gibbs      Gohmert      Gonzalez (OH)      Gonzalez-Colon (PR)      Gooden      Gosar      Granger      Graves (GA)      Graves (LA)      Graves (MO)      Green (TN)      Griffith      Grothman      Guest      Guthrie      Hagedorn      Harris      Hartzler      Hern, Kevin      Herrera Beutler      Hice (GA)      Higgins (LA)      Hill (AR)      Holding      Hollingsworth      Hudson      Huizenga      Hunter      Hurd (TX)      Johnson (LA)      Johnson (OH)      Jordan      Joyce (OH)      Joyce (PA)      Keller      Kelly (MS)      Kelly (PA)      King (IA)      Kustoff (TN)      LaHood      LaMalfa      Lamborn      Latta      Lesko      Long      Loudermilk      Lucas      Luetkemeyer      Marchant      Marshall      Massie      McCarthy      McCaul      McClintock      McHenry      McKinley      Meadows      Meuser      Miller      Mitchell      Moolenaar      Mooney (WV)      Mullin      Newhouse      Norman      Nunes      Olson      Palazzo      Palmer      Pence      Perry      Posey      Ratcliffe      Reed      Reschenthaler      Rice (SC)      Riggleman      Roby      Rodgers (WA)      Roe, David P.
