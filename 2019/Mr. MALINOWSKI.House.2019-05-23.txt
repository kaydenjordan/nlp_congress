 Madam Speaker, I rise today to express my strong  support for the bipartisan SECURE Act. This bill will enable hundreds  of thousands of working and middle-class Americans to retire with the  dignity they deserve.   According to the AARP, 72 percent of New Jersey's workers say they  are anxious about having enough money to live comfortably through  retirement, and 86 percent of workers without access to a retirement  savings account would take advantage of one if available.   Madam Speaker, 1.7 million people in New Jersey work for employers  that do not provide access to a retirement plan. So this year, our  State passed a law requiring businesses with 25 or more employees to  participate in a retirement savings program. The SECURE Act will make  it much easier for small- and medium-sized businesses in New Jersey to  meet this requirement by allowing them to pool together to create  multi-employer plans. It also expands access to retirement accounts for  home healthcare workers, a rapidly growing sector of our economy.   Passing this bill today will go a long way toward helping Americans  retire with peace of mind. I am grateful for the bipartisan support,  and I urge my colleagues to back the bill.
