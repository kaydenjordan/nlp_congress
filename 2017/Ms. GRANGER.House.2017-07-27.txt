 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the further consideration of H.R. 3219, and that  I may include tabular material on the same.    Mr. Chairman, pursuant to section 3 of House Resolution  478, as the designee of the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr.  Frelinghuysen), I offer amendments en bloc.    Mr. Chairman, the amendments included in the en bloc  were made in order by the rule for consideration of division A of H.R.  3219 and have been agreed to by both sides.   Mr. Chairman, I support the amendment and urge its adoption, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Will the gentleman yield?    Mr. Chairman, I am prepared to accept the amendment.                                time  1445     Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the gentleman raising this  issue.   I am supportive of efforts to ensure that the Department of Defense  takes  [[Page H6498]]  responsibility for any potential contamination issues. That is why this  bill provides more than $1 billion for environmental restoration  accounts, nearly $48 million more than fiscal year 2017.   The bill includes an increase of $10 million specifically to support  water contamination efforts. In addition, the committee provided an  additional $57 million for those efforts in the fiscal year 2017  supplemental appropriations.   The committee has already provided a generous amount of funding to  address water contamination, and the Department of Defense has assured  me that they are addressing each side on a priority basis.   The amendment offered by the gentleman provides additional funding  that the Department may not be able to execute, and the funding comes  at the expense of the warfighter readiness account. Therefore, I must  oppose the amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, I share many of the gentleman's concerns, and  I appreciate him raising this issue. I support environmental  remediation efforts that ensure that drinking water is safe in  communities across the Nation. That is why this bill includes $1  billion for environmental restoration.   The amount represents $48 million more than the fiscal year 2017  level and includes $10 million above the request to specifically  address PFC contamination. In addition, we include an additional $57  million for drinking water cleanup in the fiscal year 2017 supplemental  appropriations.   This committee has included significant funding to address drinking  water contamination issues, and I am concerned that the Department will  not be able to execute the additional $60 million offered by this  amendment; therefore, I oppose the amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Will the gentleman yield?    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for his amendment.  The amendment proposes to add funding back to the JLTV program, cutting  the House defense bill due to a lack of information provided by the  Army budget justification.   The cut to the JLTV program reflects the committee's concern with the  Army's failure to provide the full budget justification information for  an $804 million program. Failure to provide this information makes it  impossible for the committee to exercise its fiscal oversight  responsibilities.   However, the JLTV program is important to the warfighter and is  executing well. I do not oppose this amendment.    Mr. Chair, will the gentleman yield?    Mr. Chair, the committee has no objection. The  amendment's funding for major test facilities is critical to ensuring  our military retains its competitive lead over our competitors. We are  prepared to accept the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the gentlewoman's concern to  provide adequate funding for this very important research, and we have  spoken about it. I am a strong supporter of funding for research in  this area, and that is why the bill already provides $125 million  toward grants for PTSD and traumatic brain injury research, including  CTE, which has previously received millions of dollars in research  grants under this program.   A previous amendment would create a new research program, focused  solely on CTE research. And since CTE research is already eligible  under the PTSD-TBI research program, it is much more appropriate to add  funding to the PTSD-TBI program, rather than create a new research  program. Therefore, I oppose the amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr.  Visclosky).    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for his remarks, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, these important revisions have been  included in several appropriations bills for several years running.  They represent a strong and enduring consensus in Congress that  Guantanamo should remain open and that detainees should not be  transferred to the United States for any reason.   Striking these provisions would have unknown consequences for U.S.  communities. It is impossible to know how many detainees might be  brought here, where they might be held, and the impacts on communities  and facilities holding them. It is also impossible to know what the  potential costs could be.   Putting detainees in U.S. prisons, as the administration originally  proposed, would be disruptive and, potentially, disastrous. Former FBI  Director Mueller has stated: ``To transfer detainees to local jails  could affect or infect other prisoners or have the capability of  affecting events outside the prison system.''   The idea of bringing detainees for trials in the U.S. quickly  collapsed as local jurisdictions voiced their strong opposition.   As everyone here is aware, several detainees who have been released  from Guantanamo have gone back to the fight and killed and wounded  Americans. The threat is real, and Guantanamo is already equipped to  handle the detention and military trial of these individuals, as  appropriate.   Any proposal that results in these detainees being sent to the United  States, for any reason, is simply the wrong policy.   I, therefore, oppose the amendment, and I urge my colleagues to vote  against this amendment.  [[Page H6502]]    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Will the gentleman yield?    Mr. Chairman, I join Mr. Franks in his remarks, and I  urge rejection of this amendment.    Will the gentleman yield?    I want to thank the gentleman for his valuable  contributions to the Defense Subcommittee. I join him in opposition to  this amendment that would limit the Defense Department's flexibility to  achieve efficiency and save taxpayer dollars.   I urge rejection of the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, the gentleman proposes an amendment that cuts  all funding for the introduction of U.S. Armed Forces in the  hostilities in Yemen. U.S. Forces need the flexibility to enter any  theater where terrorists target the United States. Just 2 months ago,  American Special Operations Forces conducted a ground raid against al- Qaida's Yemen branch, killing seven suspected militants.   We consulted leadership at the Department of Defense regarding this  amendment. The Department recommends a more thorough legal review of  the implications of this amendment.   Further, the Joint Staff asserts that a U.S. provision of limited  support to the Saudi-led coalition might be construed in this context  as participation in civil war, in which case, removal of such support  could have a damaging effect on the U.S. relationship with Saudi Arabia  and create further implications for regional security.   With Special Operations fighting terrorism around the globe to  protect our safety, does Congress want to show its lack of support?   This amendment is poorly timed and overly restrictive and has many  unforeseen complications. Therefore, the committee strongly opposes  this amendment.    I yield to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Visclosky),  the ranking member.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I urge opposition to the amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
