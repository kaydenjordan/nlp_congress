 Madam Speaker, the crisis on our southern border continues  to worsen with each passing day.   Just last month, Customs and Border Protection released their latest  figures that showed immigrant encounters at the southern border have  increased 61 percent over the last year to 164,973.   That is more than double the population of Cookeville, Crossville,  and Lebanon, Tennessee, combined.   President Biden and his administration have caused this crisis and  should be held responsible. On his first day in office, he halted  construction on the southern border wall. A month later he signed  multiple executive orders rescinding President Trump's immigration  policies. In June of last year, he ended the remain in Mexico policy.  Now, the Biden administration has announced they are ending the Title  42 policy that allows for quick expulsion of illegal immigrants.   Rescinding Title 42 will encourage another surge of illegal  immigrants at our southern border and put even more strain on Customs  and Border Protection having trouble keeping up already with the record  levels of illegal immigrant encounters.                            ____________________
