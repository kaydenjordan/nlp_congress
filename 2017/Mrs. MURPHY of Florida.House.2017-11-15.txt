 Mr. Speaker, in a nationwide competition,  Rollins College achieved one of the highest student voter turnout rates  in the 2016 Presidential election.   I want to recognize the hardworking students and faculty at the  Rollins Democracy Project for this accomplishment, which reflects the  school's commitment to preparing the next generation of engaged  citizens and global leaders.   As Justice Brandeis once observed, the only title in our democracy  superior to that of President is the title of citizen.   Our democracy withers when our citizens are disengaged from and  cynical about the political process. However, it is strongest when our  citizens are engaged and informed. Our democracy works best when our  citizens use their voice and their vote to hold elected leaders  accountable. It thrives when our citizens understand that, while the  right to vote is sacred, it is only powerful if it is exercised.   Mr. Speaker, that is why what this school accomplished is so  important and why I am so proud to represent Rollins College in  Congress.                            ____________________
