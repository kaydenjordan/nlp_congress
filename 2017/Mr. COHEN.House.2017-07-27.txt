 Mr. Speaker, yesterday, the Judiciary Committee brought  before the House a motion of inquiry that was introduced to seek  answers to some of the issues concerning the firing of James Comey and  Attorney General Jeff Sessions' role therein.   Instead of passing that and dealing with issues that are fundamental  to democracy and the respect our citizens may or may not have for its  government, the Republicans put a substitute amendment in, raising all  kinds of questions about Hillary Clinton.   They did everything but yell: ``Lock her up.''   It was a disgusting display of the majority taking advantage of the  minority, squelching our voice, and taking the subject away from what  is a serious issue concerning obstruction of justice and the potential  obstruction of justice that could come about if there is an attempt to  fire Mr. Mueller.   Instead, they concentrated on old harangues about Hillary Clinton. It  was not a good day for democracy.   We need to be aware of the fact that our democracy is in jeopardy,  and we need to be alert at every moment and try to find every answer.                            ____________________
