 Mr. President, flags in Mississippi are flying at  half-staff as my State mourns the loss of hometown heroes. The  Mississippi Highway Patrol Honor Guard stands vigil over three fallen  comrades, who swore to protect and serve their communities.   Mississippi law enforcement lost three officers in 2 days.   Early Saturday morning in Brookhaven, Officer James Kevin White of  Sontag and Corporal Walter Zachery Marshall Moak of Brookhaven gave  their lives in the line of duty.   On Sunday, off-duty Mississippi Highway Patrol Trooper Kenneth  Joshlin ``Josh'' Smith of Walnut was fatally shot near the Tippah and  Alcorn county line.   James was 35. Zach was 31. Josh was 32. They leave behind children,  wives, parents, and siblings, but they will be remembered not only by  their families, but by grateful communities. I know this because I live  in Brookhaven. These men protected my family and my neighbors, and I am  so thankful for their service.   Local media in Brookhaven and Corinth have published tributes to  these men, their service, and those they have left behind.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a September 29, 2018,  article from Brookhaven Daily Leader, titled, ``Officers Remembered as  Men of Service,'' be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                   Officers Remembered as Men of Service                             (By Adam Northam)         James Kevin White wasn't about to give up the fight.        He was serving with the Mississippi National Guard in Iraq       when his convoy rolled over a roadside bomb, flinging       shrapnel into his knee and tearing at his face. The wounds       were serious, and the Army gave Lincoln County's White a       chance to go home.        ``He said, `No,'' said White's sister, Lisa White of       Vicksburg. ``He was still able to walk and fight, and that's       what he was gonna do. He wasn't going to give up, or take an       easy way out. He stayed, throughout his tour.''        White, 35, came home from the war and went straight into       law enforcement, and he served the community in that role for       the rest of his life, until his death in the line of duty in       Brookhaven Saturday morning. He'd been in the Guard since he       was 17, following in the footsteps of his grandfather, the       late J.C. White Jr., a military veteran, and serving the law       was just the next step.        ``He just wanted things to be right. He wanted to make a       difference,'' his sister said. ``He lived and breathed law       enforcement--he'd have given me a ticket for going 5 miles       over the speed limit I wasn't safe. Nobody was.''        White got into law enforcement through communications,       working as a dispatcher for the Mississippi Highway Patrol.       He went to the academy, but the knee injury from Iraq forced       him to drop out. He started a family--his boys, 8-year-old       J.C. and 7-year-old Lee, go to school at Enterprise       Attendance Center, their father's alma mater--and put law       enforcement on hold as long as he could.        But service brought him back. He worked as a deputy for the       Lawrence County Sheriff's Office from 2016-2018.        ``He was a good officer, and he loved law enforcement,''       said Lawrence County Sheriff Lessie Butler. He remembers       White's attention to detail. ``His uniform had to be just       about perfect,'' he said.        Cpl. Brandon Fortenberry with the Mississippi Highway       Patrol knew White about 10 years, and the two talked often       when both were out on the patrol, even when they were no       longer working in the same agency.        ``He was always a go-getter. He was not one to turn back,       he always had a leader's mindset,'' Fortenberry said. ``He       was always the one I could trust to come back me up on those       late-night shifts. I could depend on him being there for       me.''        White's sister said he loved his boys, loved her own       children. His passing has left an emptiness in the hearts of       his family, who are coming together from across the South to       mourn him.        ``I don't know how I feel,'' she said. ``I don't know what       I think. I just don't know.''        The other Brookhaven officer lost Saturday was also raised       with a heart of service.        ``When Zach was growing up, we told him, `Whatever you want       to do--do whatever makes you happy,' '' said Janie Stogner,       owner of Janie's Pastry Shop. ``We told him, `That's what you       go for.' ''        What made Lincoln County's Zach Moak, 31, happy was       service.        So, he went for it.        Stogner's nephew became a law enforcement officer, serving       as a reserve deputy  [[Page S6493]]       with the Lincoln County Sheriff's Department, a part-time       policeman with the Wesson Police Department and finally going       full time with the Brookhaven Police Department. He was a       servant of the law, and a servant of men, and he was carrying       out that service when he died in the line of duty shortly       before 5 a.m. Saturday.        ``He's died a hero, trying to protect and take care of our       town, and people need to know that,'' Stogner said. ``He put       everybody first--everybody came before him. He never done for       himself. We've lost somebody real special.''        Moak was a 2006 graduate of Enterprise Attendance Center, a       capable football player who helped the Yellow Jackets make       the playoffs. Former principal Shannon Eubanks said his       entire class was full of service-minded youth.        ``One of those graduates is in the U.S. Marines, several       became teachers, others were in nursing--Zach was in a close-      knit group in a service class,'' he said. ``He was a very       likable guy, just a good guy--a quiet kid, didn't cause any       problems. He's going to be greatly missed by the community.''        Lincoln County Sheriff Steve Rushing said Moak got his       start in law enforcement by going through the law enforcement       academy and serving in the reserve deputy program.        ``He was a super-nice guy who loved working in law       enforcement. Dedicated to his job,'' Rushing said. ``You       could always depend on him to work the details. He loved his       job.''        Moak moved on to Wesson, where his boss was chief Chad       O'Quinn.        ``We enjoyed him being a part of our family in Wesson,''       O'Quinn said. ``I was happy for him when he was able to       pursue a full-time career in law enforcement. He will be       dearly missed by us all.        Pike County Sheriff's Deputy Jason Blake went through       training with Moak, whom he regarded as a brother.        ``Best man I ever knew,'' Blake said. ``He treated       everybody with respect, no matter who you were or what your       background was. That didn't change him When we got into law       enforcement together, we both decided we'd give people the       chance to change. Whoever steps up on the BPD midnight shift       has some massive shoes to fill.''        Moak's father is Marshall Moak, and his mother is Vicki       Nations Moak, who runs the Enterprise Drive Inn. His brother,       Christopher Moak, lives in Natchez.        Vicki Moak said her son got started in law enforcement as       an auxiliary officer working security at football games. He       signed up for police academy and was accepted--before he told       his mother.        ``I think he thought I'd try to talk him out of it,'' she       said. ``I just said, `Is this where your heart is? You'll       have a lot coming at you, and I just want you to be       prepared.' He said, `I know, momma,' and he loved every       minute of it. When he was able to help someone, he felt good       about it.''        Vicki Moak, her face dried from a Saturday long with tears,       recalled her son's baptism.        ``I know where he's at right now, and that gives me       peace,'' she said.     Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent that  excerpts from an October 1, 2018, article from Corinth Today, titled,  ``Residents React to Hatchie Bottom Tragedy,'' pertaining to Patrolman  Josh Smith be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                   [From the Corinth Today, Oct. 1, 2018]                 Residents React to Hatchie Bottom Tragedy                             (By Josh Mitchell)         The circumstances that led to an off-duty Mississippi       Highway Patrol trooper being shot and killed remain unclear.        Josh Smith, 32, was pronounced deceased in Hatchie Bottom       near the Alcorn/Tippah County line at around 12:45 a.m.       Sunday.        Retired Mississippi Highway Patrolman Freddie Corbin said       ``all troopers are like family'' and that Smith was a ``good       person'' who would always help people.        Corbin added that Smith was a husband and father and loved       being part of the highway patrol.        Smith had recently had foot surgery and was assigned to       light duty helping out at the driver's license office in       Corinth, Corbin noted.        Smith worked the Tippah County area while Corbin was       assigned to Prentiss County, but both were part of the same       Troop F, based in New Albany. Corbin said some people joked       that they were the ``F Troop.''        Corbin also said Smith was part of the MHP SWAT team and       was a member of the motorcycle unit.        Corbin works security in the same place where Smith was       helping with the driver's license office. Smith had a quiet       demeanor, and Corbin said he saw him last Wednesday.        For the past two days all he has thought about is Smith       getting killed.        ``He was an outstanding guy,'' Corbin added.     Mr. President, hearts are broken in Mississippi as  families and friends mourn. Please keep these families and communities  in your prayers as they face the difficult times ahead. I hope they  will find comfort in knowing these fallen law enforcement officers will  be remembered with deep appreciation and gratitude.                            ____________________
