 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for  up to 20 minutes as in morning business.    Mr. President, I am thrilled and delighted to follow  my outstanding colleague from Maryland coming here to talk about  climate change. That is the topic that brings me to the floor today as  well. Those of us who are from coastal States not only have the  experience of worse flooding in our coastal communities and those  coastal communities getting new conversations with their municipal bond  folks about what the flooding risk means for their bond ratings, but we  are also looking at projections like Maryland is of what happens if we  don't act, and the very maps of our State will change.   When historians look back at why the United States failed so badly to  take on climate change, they will, of course, focus on the political  efforts of the world's largest oil companies: Exxon, Chevron, BP, and  Shell. They will note the obstructive role of leading trade  associations like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National  Association of Manufacturers, and the American Petroleum Institute.  They will chronicle the network of phony front groups set up by Big  Oil, Big Coal, and the Koch brothers to sow doubt of the science and  fear of climate action. Big Oil, the Kochs, the trade associations, the  front groups all will deserve plenty of blame. Their climate denial  apparatus and their capture of the modern Republican Party is a direct  and deliberate cause of America's failure.   There are other less heralded but equally bad actors. I come to the  floor today to discuss one of them. Future historians of ``anii  Trumpi,'' take note of Marathon Petroleum. Marathon Petroleum is the  largest oil refiner in the United States. It refines oil into gasoline,  other fuels, and lubricants. It owns pipelines and gas stations. Its  4,000 Speedway locations and almost 8,000 independent gas stations  selling Marathon-branded fuels reach across the country. It is No. 31  on the Fortune 500 list of U.S. companies, and it has almost $100  billion in annual revenue. This is a big company with a big stake in  blocking climate action.   What does Marathon want? Well, its annual report filed with the  Securities and Exchange Commission makes one thing very clear: Marathon  sees laws and regulations that reduce carbon pollution as a threat. One  threat Marathon specifically cites in its annual report is fuel economy  or CAFE standards. Why? Marathon's 2018 annual report reads: ``Higher  CAFE standards for cars and light trucks have the potential to reduce  demand for our transportation fuels.'' It is as simple as that. Fuel- efficient cars burn less gas, and that is bad for a big refiner.   Well, in 2012, automakers and the State of California and the  previous administration got together, and they agreed to significantly  better fuel economy standards. That was a good deal for almost  everyone. Consumers were estimated to save more than $1.7 trillion in  reduced fuel costs--up to $8,000 per vehicle for vehicles purchased in  2025. The air would be cleaner. Carbon emissions from cars and light  trucks would be cut in half by 2025, and automakers would have a  competitive spur to keep pace with new vehicle technologies being  developed in Europe and China--win, win, win, win.   Well, in 2017, these automakers came back into the Trump  administration and asked the Trump administration to revisit the fuel  economy standards. It looks, from everything I have seen, like the auto  industry primarily wanted technical changes to make the standards  easier to meet. I have found no evidence that the auto industry asked  the administration to totally freeze the standards or that they asked  the administration then to revoke California's authority to set its own  standards under the Clean Air Act.   When automakers asked the administration for these changes, someone  else was watching. The oil industry sensed opportunity. The standards  may have been good for consumers, the auto industry, States, our global  climate, but that $1.7 trillion in reduced fuel costs that consumers  would save would come directly out of oil industry revenues. So the oil  industry sprang into action to hijack the rulemaking process.   The oil industry demanded weakening of the standards to the max;  i.e., a freeze, and it even demanded revocation of California's  longstanding authority to set its own standards, leading more than a  dozen other States, including my home State of Rhode Island. We follow  the California standard. An administration marbled through with fossil  fuel lobbyists and attorneys heard the oil industry call. It must have  been a strange experience for the automakers. One minute they are  asking for technical changes to a regulation they had agreed to; the  next minute the whole process has been run off with by a completely  other industry.   Marathon was the ring leader. I obtained an electronic draft of a  letter to the Deputy Administrator of the National Highway Traffic  Safety Administration urging her to weaken the fuel economy standards.  The metadata of the letter was still in the letter because I got it  electronically. According to the metadata in this document, it was  written by a Marathon Petroleum inhouse lobbyist. Marathon then shopped  this letter around to Members of the House of Representatives to  convince them to send letters backing the weakened standards that they  wanted.   We got those House letters, and we ran them through plagiarism  software against the Marathon lobbyists' draft. Here is what we got.  When we compared the Marathon letter with the letter sent by Members of  Pennsylvania's congressional delegation, it was an 80-percent match.  The red here is all the language that is identical. Members from  Indiana and West Virginia sent similar letters also with text lifted  directly from the Marathon lobbyists' draft. If you want to give this  political stunt a name, you could call it a Pruitt, after Scott Pruitt,  who distinguished himself for the Trump EPA Administrator's position by  copying a Devon Energy text onto his own official letterhead as  attorney general of his State and sending it on as if it were his  letter.   Back to Marathon. Pulling a Pruitt with these Congressmen was not  enough. We know from Marathon's own reports that it directly lobbied on  the standards, and we know that its trade association, the American  Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers, AFPM,  [[Page S6292]]  also lobbied on the standards. We know AFPM also launched a campaign on  social media urging people to support a freeze.   Marathon is a member of a front group that is called the American  Legislative Exchange Council, also known as ALEC. This front group  pushes the agenda of the Koch brothers' apparatus in State  legislatures. It is the tool for the Koch brothers to try to work their  will in State legislatures. ALEC passed a resolution in favor of  weakening the standards and revoking California's State authority. We  know that senior executives from Marathon met personally with EPA  leadership and with senior officials in the White House to push for  weakening the standards and revoking California's authority.   There is a lot we don't know. We don't know which front groups  Marathon and other oil companies fund because neither of them disclose  their donations or their donors. We don't know how many other groups  were deployed in this effort. We don't know the extent to which  Marathon coordinated its campaign with the trade association and the  front groups, so we can't assess whether this lobbying effort violated  the front groups' 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status. We don't know what role  Marathon or its front groups had in the mysterious antitrust letter  that came popping out of DOJ shortly after the automakers negotiated  separately with California.   When the automakers realized that their negotiations--the process  they were involved with--had been hijacked by Marathon and that they  were just passengers on the Marathon train at this point, they bailed.  When they knew the conversation was bogus, they bailed. They negotiated  directly with California, and they came up with their own deal with  California. That, obviously, really ticked off the oil guys who thought  they had this thing all scoped. Apparently, it even ticked off the  President--all the way up to President Trump.   The next thing you know comes this truly bizarre letter out of DOJ  that appears to ignore basic tenets of antitrust law, like when you are  negotiating with a State government, it is not an antitrust violation.  It appears also to violate DOJ's own very elaborate antitrust  investigation procedures.   So who pulled those strings? We don't know. More broadly, if Marathon  and other fossil fuel companies are purposefully paying a web of phony  front groups and trade associations to spread deliberate, known  disinformation about climate change in order to obstruct climate action  in Congress, does that not warrant congressional investigation? Might  it not, in fact, be fraud? It was fraud when the tobacco industry did  it.   Over the past 2 weeks, two different subcommittees of the House  Committee on Oversight and Reform held hearings that examined how the  fossil fuel industry deploys front groups and trade associations to  spread disinformation about climate change and block legislative  action.   Yesterday the Senate Democrats' Special Committee on the Climate  Crisis held our hearing on how dark money front groups hide the  industry's role in climate denial and legislative obstruction. Fat  chance we will have Senate committees investigate this masquerade in a  Chamber under Republican control, but for our friends in the House, the  time is ripe for congressional oversight. Follow the money and the  facts wherever they lead. Let the subpoenas fly.   Congressmen Henry Waxman led a successful investigation of lies and  deceit from a corrupting industry, Big Tobacco, and that precedent  served our country well. It served the American public well. It ended  up likely saving lives.    So we go back to Marathon again. Marathon's shareholders are  interesting, too, in all of this.   Last month, 200 major investors who had $6.5 trillion in assets under  management, sent a letter to 47 U.S. companies, including Marathon,  urging that the companies' lobbying align with the Paris Agreement's  goal of global average temperature increase below 2 degrees Celsius and  warning the companies that lobbying against that goal is an investment  risk.   The letter went to Marathon, but, interestingly, none of Marathon's  biggest investors--BlackRock, Vanguard, State Street, and J.P. Morgan  Asset Management--signed the letter. Collectively, these four investors  own, roughly, 25 percent of Marathon. BlackRock lists climate risk as  one of its engagement priorities in 2019, so it says. BlackRock  published a report this year that by 2060, 58 percent of U.S. metro  areas will see annual average climate-related losses of at least 1  percent of GDP, with some projected to lose a staggering 15 percent of  GDP.   JPMorgan's CEO, Jamie Dimon, has said: ``Business must play a  leadership role in creating solutions that protect the environment and  grow the economy.''   So it was interesting yesterday, in our Senate select committee  hearing, to have a witness put up this slide. This slide shows the  positions on climate change, regulation, and the legislation of a  number of companies. It is a spectrum. Green is supporting climate  regulation and legislation. Opposition is red.   We were talking about the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which has been  identified as one of the two worst climate obstructors in America as a  trade association. The U.S. Chamber and the National Association of  Manufacturers take the prize. We were looking at how strange that is  because their memberships don't have the positions they take. So we are  going to continue to explore why it is that the board members of the  National Association of Manufacturers and the board members of the U.S.  Chamber of Commerce appear to have let their organizations be run away  with by the fossil fuel industry as well.   Here is what was notable. On this graph, this is where the U.S.  Chamber of Commerce is--one of the worst climate obstructors. Yet look  who is worse. In fact, look at who is the worst of all of them-- Marathon. What do you know? You have these four investors who own 25  percent of this company that is on the worst side of this spectrum.  They claim to care about solving the climate problem. Yet they are 25- percent owners in the most opposed of all of these entities to the  solution to the climate crisis they claim to seek.   They have to get their act together. It is not fair to be JPMorgan  CEO Jamie Dimon and say that business must play a leadership role in  creating solutions that protect the environment and grow the economy  and then to be part of the 25-percent largest shareholders of the  company that is the worst of this.   You have to line this up, guys. You can't say one thing to the public  and then do the opposite through the companies you own.   The stakes here are high. There are credible warnings of a carbon  asset bubble and of crashes in coastal property values, but BlackRock  hasn't introduced a single climate-related shareholder resolution since  2001. In 2018, BlackRock and Vanguard--two of these big Marathon  owners--voted in favor of only 10 and 12 percent of climate-related  shareholder resolutions. They say they are good at this--BlackRock 10  percent, Vanguard 12 percent. The other ones, they didn't support. In  2017, at Marathon--the worst--BlackRock voted against a shareholder  proposal for Marathon to test its business operations against the 2- degree Celsius threshold that BlackRock claimed to target and support.  By the way, if BlackRock had voted its shares for this proposal, it  would have passed.   Just this month, Marathon finally published a report that examines  its own prospects in a carbon-contained world. In one scenario, demand  for petroleum-based liquids plummets 26 percent by 2040. With the  demand for vehicle fuels--Marathon's primary market--it falls even more  steeply. If Marathon estimates the market for its main product could  shrink by one-third or more, first, you can understand why it got in  there to manipulate the auto fuel efficiency standard process. You can  also understand why it is that economists and sovereign banks are  issuing these warnings about a carbon bubble.   We will get serious about climate change. We must. We have no choice.  The costs of inaction are, as Donald Trump once said, catastrophic.   Eventually, all of the fossil fuel money and bullying in the world  will not stave off action in the face of mounting climate calamities.  This  [[Page S6293]]  should be obvious to everyone and certainly to sophisticated investors  with supposedly good climate policies like BlackRock and JPMorgan. So  why aren't they pushing Marathon to adapt to a low-carbon economy? Why  are they happy to own 25 percent of that--of the worst? That is what  they want to own?   It doesn't have to be this way. Look at DSM, a Dutch multinational,  with roughly $10 billion in revenues and over 23,000 employees around  the world, including many here in the United States. DSM began as a  coal mining company over a century ago. Its leaders realized coal  mining in the Netherlands would someday end, so they reinvented the  company. When the last mine closed in the 1970s, DSM had diversified.  It is, today, a vibrant producer of nutritional additives for food, of  pharmaceuticals, and of high-tech materials for electronics,  automobiles, and construction. By contrast, Murray Coal, which is an  American coal mining company that did not diversify, filed for  bankruptcy this week.   To the fossil fuel industry, I say that you ought to begin adapting  now. You can't ignore what is coming at you. You owe it to your  shareholders, and you owe it to your employees. By God, you owe it to  your children.   To BlackRock and the other big investors, this means you have to pay  attention too. You say you are for climate action. Show that you mean  it. Demand change at Marathon and at other fossil fuel companies that  you own. Start with mandating that these companies disclose their  climate obstruction funding. There is no excuse for that to be secret.   If they will not do it, Congress, let's investigate. We have slept  through this mess long enough--in a state of induced narcolepsy. We  have sleepwalked for far too long. It is time we woke up.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I rise today to remember our colleague  and friend, Kay Hagan.   The daughter of a World War II veteran, with many other members of  our Armed Forces in her family, Kay made service to others a  cornerstone of her life. Indeed, she wove that commitment through her  extraordinary career in business and public office.   There was Kay's devotion to her community and family. She served as a  church elder and Sunday school teacher at her Presbyterian  congregation. Even while rising through the ranks to become an  executive at the North Carolina National Bank, she was active in local  politics, running county operations for two Gubernatorial campaigns.  And, in the midst of it all, she and her husband Chip made it to the  Girl Scout meetings and school events for their three children.   There was Kay's outstanding career in North Carolina State politics.  For a decade, she served in the North Carolina Senate. She earned the  gavel on the senate budget committee. She championed financial literacy  in elementary and secondary education. Her success landed her on North  Carolina's most effective lawmakers list three times.   Then there was Kay's service in this body. She championed fair pay  for women, expanding access to healthcare, improving public education,  and nurturing small businesses, which she recognized as the lifeblood  of North Carolina's economy.   In the Senate, she honored her family's long record of military  service as a member of the Armed Services Committee. She chaired the  vitally important Emerging Threats and Capabilities Subcommittee, which  confronts issues such as terrorism, weapons of mass destruction, and  drug trafficking. She fought to ensure that funding battles in  Washington never impede veterans' access to healthcare. She traveled  abroad to Iraq, Afghanistan, and other military installations around  the world to visit North Carolina troops.   To Chip, Jeanette, Tilden, and Carrie, I am sorry for your loss. Kay  left us too soon. She was a kind and gracious colleague and a good  friend. She was a servant for good.   In the words of John Ellerton's Hymn, read at President Franklin D.  Roosevelt's funeral:       Now the laborer's task is o'er;      Now the battle day is past . . .      Father, in Thy gracious keeping      Leave we now thy servant sleeping.    Rest in peace, Senator Hagan.                            ____________________
