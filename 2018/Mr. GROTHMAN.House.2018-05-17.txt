 Mr. Chairman, I thank again the gentleman from  California for bringing forth this amendment and the gentleman from  Texas for all of the work that he did on the bill.   I think sometimes, rather than have hearings, you find out a lot more  about these Federal programs and particularly the SNAP program if you  talk to the local clerks at the convenience stores and the grocery  stores and the income maintenance workers in the counties or the people  who manage the low-income housing to find out what really is going on  here.   I will bring to light one in particular of the four provisions in the  amendment: the idea that participants in training programs have to go  through E-Verify.   It has been said that you have to be a citizen to get SNAP anyway. I  would suggest talking to some of the income maintenance workers or some  of the people who talk to some of the people who use the SNAP program,  and I think they will tell you that, whatever the official Federal law  is, SNAP is routinely used by people who are not here legally.   I think by requiring E-Verify for the training programs, we begin to  go through the process of making sure that people who are in this  country illegally are not taking advantage of taxpayer-funded programs.                                time  1630    I really wish we had more information on this topic, but, again, it  is my belief that the average clerk in an average convenience store  knows a lot more about the SNAP program than most Ph.D.s in sociology.
