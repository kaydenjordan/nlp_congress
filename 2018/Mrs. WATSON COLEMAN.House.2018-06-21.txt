 Mr. Speaker, a few days ago, at the Trenton Art  All Night Festival, a fight between two individuals resulted in a mass  shooting; 17 people shot, at least one critically injured. Fortunately,  the only casualty--fatality, I should say--was one of the shooters.   Even so, nearly 20 people shot at a community festival dedicated to  breathing new life into the city and bringing the community together  around something that is positive deserves our attention.   Unfortunately, we have a bad habit of assigning sympathy and coverage  only to certain kinds of shootings. In fact, it is safe to say that  there are some who believe that there are communities in which gun  violence will always be an unavoidable norm. That is false. That is a  horrible and destructive stereotype that ignores the underpinning of  our conversation about guns.   From access to excessively destructive accessories, guns are the  problem.   NRA advocates would argue that in Parkland the shooter got his gun  legally. But should an 18-year-old be able to buy a gun, especially  when that gun is never going to be used for sport?   Those same advocates would argue that most shootings in urban areas  occur with illegally obtained weapons and that no regulation would  prevent them. But because we refuse to require registries, we don't  know where these guns come from. Perhaps if we did, perhaps if we knew  who the first buyer was and which States those illegal weapons came  from, they wouldn't end up in the wrong hands.   Mr. Speaker, our country's gun problem isn't a single-sided one. It  is multifaceted and will require more than just one angle to solve.   Fortunately, from members of the Gun Violence Prevention Task Force  alone, there are more than 70 proposals that seek to address this  singular and deadly crisis. I am responsible for two of them: The STOP  Online Ammunition Sales Act of 2017 to flag for law enforcement large  bullet and ammunition purchases that suggest the kind of stockpiling  that precedes an attack; and the Handgun Licensing and Registration  bill, which would create the kind of registry that might help us keep  more weapons out of the wrong hands.   Earlier this week, I wrote a letter to you, Mr. Speaker, asking for  consideration of any one of these 70 bills in honor of the victims of  Sunday's shooting. I have yet to receive a response to my question, and  with the paralyzing fear that seems to grip my Republican colleagues  whenever we mention guns, I don't have high hopes that I will get one.   But I do know that the longer we continue to ignore this problem, the  more people will be hurt and the more lives will be lost.   At work, at school, at the grocery store, at the playground, in the  homes with violent partners, by accident during play dates, at the  hands of those suffering from mental illness, with or without law  enforcement being present, whether or not someone in the audience or  classroom is armed, guns have always been the problem. We need to  accept that so that we can get to work on it and move on it.   I continue to pray for the health and recovery of those who were  injured in Trenton, as well in other places, just as I will continue to  work on this issue.                            ____________________
