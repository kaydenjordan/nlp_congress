 Mr. Speaker, we must reform our Nation's welfare  programs.   President Ronald Reagan once remarked: ``The Federal Government  declared war on poverty, and poverty won.'' Unfortunately, his  assessment remains all too accurate to this day. Over the past five  decades, the United States Government has spent more than $22 trillion  on welfare, only to see the poverty rate remain unchanged.   Mr. Speaker, to solve this problem, we must first properly diagnose  the cause. Too often, Washington's prescribed cure is yet another  government program or increased spending on existing programs. However,  we already have 13 Federal agencies running more than 80 Federal  programs that provide food, housing, healthcare, job training,  education, energy assistance, and cash to low-income Americans. And we  should not gauge the success of our war on poverty by how much is  spent, but on how many people are actually able to get out of poverty.  That is the point.   The root cause of the failed ``war on poverty'' is that the structure  of our current welfare system entrenches a culture of dependency rather  than promoting a path to self-sufficiency.   Overwhelming evidence supports what should be a commonsense  conclusion: that there is a direct correlation between work and  poverty. For example, before Congress reformed the Temporary Assistance  to Needy Families program to incorporate a strict work requirement,  there were 4.9 million families on the rolls of this program. Two  decades later, thanks to these workfare reforms, we have seen 3.3  million families come off of the welfare rolls. Now, that is a success.   In my home State of North Carolina, reforms to unemployment insurance  benefits led an increase in both employment and labor force  participation. Later research has found that Congress' decision in 2013  to not extend Federal unemployment benefits resulted in 1.8 million new  jobs nationwide the following year.   Furthermore, in 2014, when Maine began enforcing strict work  requirements for able-bodied adults without dependents receiving food  stamps, their caseload decreased by 80 percent within months. This  requirement was paired with substantial job search assistance and job  training opportunities.   Mr. Speaker, we should apply the lessons of these success stories to  all government welfare programs, particularly food stamps and housing.  It is imperative that welfare recipients understand that the government  is not offering a one-way handout, but rather, a two-way deal. We are  willing to help you, but only if you are willing to help yourself. And  with the American economy growing, thanks to tax reform, opportunities  are available.   Mr. Speaker, job openings recently hit a record-high of 6.6 million  across the country, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. By  incorporating education and training, benefit time limits, and strong  work requirements, we can move millions of Americans from welfare to  work.   In addition to fiscal benefits, engaging in workfare increases self- sufficiency, encourages community engagement, and offers recipients a  sense of purpose and dignity.   We have a unique opportunity with this year's farm bill, Mr. Speaker,  to enact such reforms, and I encourage my colleagues to not be afraid  to seize on this chance and promote work over welfare.                            ____________________
