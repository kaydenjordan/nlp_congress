 Mr. Speaker, it has been nearly 10  years since the Great Recession officially began, when our economy  slumped and unemployment climbed to levels not witnessed since the  early 1980s, but last month Congress paved the way to create a tax  system that is fair, simpler, and one that establishes an environment  where our country can unleash our full potential.   Too many Americans are living paycheck to paycheck and have been for  too long. Stagnant wages, growing debt, and the inability to save have  plagued so many. That is why our tax overhaul is so important. This  truly is a once-in-a-generation opportunity that we could not afford to  pass up.   The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will touch every household in the Nation  and every corner of our economy. As soon as February, Americans will  see more money in their paychecks. When it comes time to file their  2018 taxes, our tax system will be so simple that 9 out of 10 Americans  will be able to file on a postcard. The standard deduction will be  doubled for individuals and joint filers. Middle class families will  also have a significant increase to the child tax credit to help  parents with the costs of raising children.   And, Mr. Speaker, for those pursuing opportunity through education,  America's students, the graduate tuition voucher exemption and student  loan interest deduction remain in our tax reform package. I, and many  of my colleagues, urged the conference committee to keep these  provisions intact.   Our Tax Code should provide incentives for greater opportunity. For  many, this is realized through higher education. The student loan  interest deduction helps make higher education more affordable, and  based on the most recent yearly data available, 12 million taxpayers  benefited from that deduction.   I advocated keeping this provision as well as the graduate tuition  voucher exemption and other higher education tax credits as a part of  the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act because they truly do make a difference in  the lives of so many Americans. It makes financing an education  possible for many low- and middle-income individuals.   In addition to education, another great cornerstone of the American  Dream is homeownership, and, proudly, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will  continue to provide tax relief to current and aspiring homeowners  alike.   Mr. Speaker, there are many accomplishments in this historic tax  overhaul, including lowering the corporate tax rate, which will put our  job creators on a level playing field with their global competitors.  This has already led to increased bonuses and pay raises for millions  of workers. Quite simply, this bill provides the kind of tax relief  that Americans deserve.   We challenged the status quo and the special interests who said it  couldn't be done, and we did it. And the American people won.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  congratulate the landscaping students at the Central Pennsylvania  Institute of Science and Technology for their fourth consecutive first- place win at the Pennsylvania Farm Show.   CPI students again took home the top prize this year in the  agricultural education landscape exhibits. In total, eight schools  entered this competition at the Farm Show, which is the Nation's  largest indoor agricultural event.   Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the following students who are a part of  the winning team: Charlee Marshall, Alexis Witherite, Landon Wagner,  Jarod Williams, Robert Ficarro, and Calen McCool.   The students have learned from CPI's horticulture and landscaping  instructor Joe Luther. Just a couple of weeks ago, Mr. Luther was named  the National Career and Technical Education Teacher of the Year.   Mr. Speaker, as co-chair of the Congressional Career and Technical  Education Caucus, I am most proud of these CPI students and Mr. Luther  for being four-time first-place champions at the Pennsylvania Farm  Show.   I congratulate them, and I know that they will continue this fine  tradition of being the team to beat at the Pennsylvania Farm Show.                            ____________________
