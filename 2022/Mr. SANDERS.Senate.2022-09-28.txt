 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Committee on Foreign Relations be discharged from further consideration  and the Senate now proceed to S. Res. 753.    I know of no further debate on the resolution.    I ask unanimous consent that the preamble be agreed to  and that the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the  table.    Madam President, I have risen today to ask unanimous  consent for S. Res. 753, expressing the sense of the Senate on the  upcoming election in Brazil.   This Sunday, October 2, Brazil will hold its Presidential election.  According to many polls, it appears that the two major candidates are  President Jair Bolsonaro and former President Lula da Silva. If no  candidate receives over 50 percent of the vote, there will be a runoff  election between the top two candidates on October 30.   Madam President, over the past several months, Brazilians from all  sectors of society have publicly expressed serious concern about  ongoing efforts to undermine democracy in their country, including  close to 1 million Brazilians who signed an open letter released on  July 26, defending the democratic institutions of Brazil and the rule  of law.   And there is a very good reason why these people in Brazil signed  that letter. And that is that the current President, and candidate for  reelection, Mr. Bolsonaro, has made some very provocative statements  which suggest that he might not accept the election results if he  loses. In other words, he might attempt to destroy Brazilian democracy  and remain in power no matter what the people of Brazil determine in a  free, fair, and democratic election.   And let me just quote some of what Mr. Bolsonaro has been saying over  the last several years. Back in September 2018, before he won his  election, Bolsonaro stated:         I will not accept an election result that is not my own       victory.    On September 7, 2021, as reported by the Financial Times, Mr.  Bolsonaro stated:         There are those who think they can take me from the       presidency with the mark of a pen. Well, I say to everyone I       have only three possible fates: arrest, death or victory. And       tell the bastards I'll never be arrested. Only God can take       me from the presidency.    According to Human Rights Watch, previously, President Bolsonaro had  claimed, without providing any evidence, that the last two Presidential  elections were fraudulent, including his own election, in which he  claimed he got more votes than the final tally showed.   But it is not just Bolsonaro's words that should be of concern to  those of us who believe in democracy. According to a recent survey by  the Federal University of the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil is facing  a 335-percent increase in violence directed against political leaders  in 2022 relative to 2019.   Last month, a Workers' Party official was shot dead by a Bolsonaro  supporter. Yesterday, Reuters reported that the Federal Police guarding  former President Lula da Silva, who is the current frontrunner to  unseat Bolsonaro, sent a classified memo to senior colleagues across  Brazil calling for backup in order to protect Lula from possible  assassination attempts.   It is clearly not the business of the United States to determine who  the next President of Brazil is or to get involved in Brazil's  Presidential elections in any way. That is a decision to be made solely  by the people of Brazil through a free and fair election. But it is the  business of the United States to make clear to the people of Brazil  that our government will not recognize or support a government that  comes to power through a military coup or the undermining of a  democratic election.   In that regard, I have asked to receive unanimous consent today for a  resolution that I introduced with Senator Tim Kaine, the chair of the  Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere. That  resolution is also cosponsored by Senators Durbin, Leahy, Merkley,  Blumenthal, and Warren.   I would also like to thank Senator Menendez, the chair of the Senate  Foreign Relations Committee, for allowing this resolution to come to  the floor.   This resolution is very simple and straightforward. It does not take  sides in Brazil's elections. All it does is express the sense of the  U.S. Senate that the U.S. Government should make unequivocally clear  that the continuing relationship of the United States and Brazil  depends upon the commitment of the Government of Brazil to democracy  and human rights.   It urges the Biden administration to make clear that the United  States will not support any government that comes to power in Brazil  through undemocratic means and to ensure that U.S. security assistance  to Brazil remains compliant with our laws related to the peaceful and  democratic transition of power. This includes longstanding legal  restrictions on the provision of security assistance in the event of a  military coup.   In my view, it is imperative that the U.S. Senate make it clear  through this resolution that we support democracy in Brazil. It would  be unacceptable for the United States to recognize a government that  came to power undemocratically, and it would send a horrific message to  the entire world if we did that.   It is important for the people of Brazil to know we are on their  side, on the side of democracy. This resolution sent that message. And  I thank my colleagues for supporting it.   With that, I yield the floor.  [[Page S5141]]
