 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to remember the life of Melissa  Ramirez. Melissa attended the Route 91 festival in Las Vegas on October  1.   Melissa loved her family more than anything in the world. She always  made sure to take trips home over the weekends while she was studying  at California State University to get her bachelor's degree in business  administration.   After she graduated from college in 2014, Melissa began working as a  member specialist for an auto insurer, where she continued to work  until her life tragically ended at the Route 91 festival.   Melissa loved country music, but loved the Philadelphia Eagles more.  She enjoyed watching sporting events and supporting each of her  favorite teams.   Melissa was known for being a hard worker, deeply loving her family,  and making sure to always enjoy life.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to extend my condolences to Melissa  Ramirez' family and friends. Please note that the city of Las Vegas,  the State of Nevada, and the whole country grieve with you.                            ____________________
