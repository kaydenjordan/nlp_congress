 Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate the life of Dr.  Mattelia Bennett Grays.   I wear white today, having just come from Houston and celebrating her  life as the International 18th president of Alpha Kappa Alpha and a  major leader in The Links organization; what a remarkable woman, a  woman of her era, 91 years old; graduated from Dillard, the University  of Michigan, and Pacific University with a doctorate degree, a strong  and vivacious woman, elegant but, as well, determined to teach children  a better way.   A pioneering civil rights leader who, in fact, provided Alpha Kappa  Alpha chartered groups on schools that were majority not integrated but  majority Anglo, if you will, institutions that were not historically  Black colleges. But she was strong and wanted to present a wonderful  opportunity for young women, wanted them to have the same kind of  leadership that she did.  [[Page H8492]]    She was the daughter of a preacher and a wonderful mother that  invested in her the love of faith in God; and she was a person who  benefited so many young people in her era and in her time.   Yes, this fierce lover of life, strong, determined leader, has now  taken her wings, and I was pleased to be at her homegoing service to be  able to honor her daughter Karen, her brother, Cornel, and Joan, her  sister, grandson, Kristopher, his wife, and their children, and all her  other relatives.   I was delighted that the mayor of the city of Houston named this day,  November 14, 2022, as Dr. Mattelia Grays Day. I am here to honor her on  the floor of the House. May she rest in peace. May her spirit continue  to lift us up as we celebrate our 18th international president, Dr.  Grays, as she rests in peace and goes home to join her honey-do, her  husband.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor and praise Dr. Mattelia Bennett Grays  for a life well lived--where she was dedicated to public service  through education and was a member of the renowned Alpha Kappa Alpha  (AKA) Sorority Incorporated.   Dr. Mattelia Bennett Grays was a remarkable woman, a mother, a  community leader, and a woman of God who passed away this month at the  age of 91.   Dr. Bennett Grays was the 18th International President of Alpha Kappa  Alpha (AKA) Sorority Incorporated serving from 1970 to 1974.   Dr. Mattelia Bennett Grays was born on July 26, 1931, in Houston,  Texas, to the Reverend Abel B. Bennett and Mrs. Delcia McNeal Bennett.   During her formative years, Dr. Mattelia Bennett Grays and her family  attended Pleasant Hill Baptist Church until her father built from the  ground up a small church, St. John Missionary Baptist Church, in  Chappell Hill, Texas.   Dr. Mattelia Bennett Grays attended schools in the Houston  Independent School District and graduated in 1948 as salutatorian of  her graduating class at Booker T. Washington High School. She was  blessed to have earned and received a full-ride scholarship to attend  Dillard University in New Orleans, Louisiana, where she thrived and  excelled in her studies.   Dr, Mattelia Bennett Grays pledged and was initiated into Beta  Upsilon Chapter of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Incorporated. She  received her B.A. degree from Dillard University in 1952 and was  married to Horace Wesley Grays, Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity,  Incorporated that same year. A beautiful daughter, Karen Grays-Gray was  born to this wonderful couple.   Dr. Mattelia Bennett Grays received her M.A. degree with honors in  special education from the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor,  Michigan. She later received her Doctorate in educational  administration from Pacific University in Sacramento, California, in  1985. She returned to Houston to teach in the Houston Independent  School District. After several years with HISD, she began working  summers with the University of Houston as a supervisor for laboratory  experiences for teachers of culturally deprived children.   Upon graduation from the University of Michigan, Dr. Grays  transferred her sorority membership to Alpha Kappa Omega Chapter in  Houston, where she served as chapter president and South Central  Regional Director. She was the youngest person ever elected as  International President of the sorority in 1968 and was installed at  the sorority's biennial national convention in 1970.   A little-known fact is Dr. Grays, during the Civil Rights era, was  instrumental and the driving force in chartering 14 undergraduate  chapters of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Incorporated on predominantly  white universities. During her term as Supreme Basileus, she chartered  a total of 56 undergraduate chapters at predominantly white  universities.   Dr. Mattelia Bennett Grays was preceded in death by her parents; her  husband, Horace Grays, sisters, Barbara Jefferson, Willie Mae Sanford,  and brother Randolph McBride.   Dr. Mattelia Bennett Grays leaves to honor her legacy her loving  daughter, Karen Grays-Gray (Benjamin Gray, son-in-law), her siblings,  Cornel Joseph Jefferson, Sr., Joan Bennett McBride, a grandson,  Kristopher John Howard (Jennifer Howard, granddaughter-in-law), and  great-grandchildren, Karolina Austen Howard, and Kristopher John  Howard, Jr., and a host of cousins, nephews, and niece and friends.   Her work and deeds are most deserving of the respect, admiration, and  commendation of the United States Congress.                            ____________________
