 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, it is one of my favorite times during  the week, when I get to come to the Senate floor--I know it is the  pages' favorite time--to talk a little bit about Alaska and talk about  my State and present what we weekly call the ``Alaskan of the Week.''   It is the opportunity to talk about someone in the community who has  done something great for their community, for the State, maybe for  America, and I would like to recognize this great variety of wonderful  Alaskans, great Americans, whom we have in my State and talk about  them.   By the way, I always like to give a little update on what is going on  in Alaska and to talk to people who are in the Gallery and who are  watching on TV and encourage them--now is the time to plan your next  trip to Alaska if you are going to come next summer. But, also, you  should know that winter, which is coming--it has pretty much come to  Alaska--is a great time to visit too. It is a winter wonderland. You  can ski, snowboard, and at end of the day, sit back and drink something  warm and watch the northern lights dance in the sky. You can't do that  in many States in our great Nation. So come on up for the trip of a  lifetime. We want you to come whether it is summer, winter, fall,  spring; it doesn't matter. You will not be disappointed if you come  visit us in the great State of Alaska.   I am going to break the rules a little bit on the Alaskan of the Week  because I usually recognize one, but today I am going to recognize four  extraordinary Alaskans. They are four teachers in my State who are the  recent recipients of the Presidential Award for Excellence in  Mathematics and Science Teaching. Joshua Hall is a math teacher at  Dimond High School in Anchorage and the chair of the math program  there. Jennifer Childress is also a teacher at Dimond, teaching science  and engineering courses. She currently teaches 11th and 12th grade  physics and Advanced Placement physics. Dawn Wilcox teaches second  grade at Campbell Elementary School in Anchorage, and Angie Wright  teaches 4th and 5th grade math at Auke Bay Elementary in Juneau, AK.   We are very, very proud of them. This is a great achievement for all  four of these wonderful teachers.   This award is the highest honor bestowed by the U.S. Government  specifically for K-12 science, technology, engineering, mathematics,  and computer science teaching--something we need more of, not just in  Alaska but in America. And we need great teachers who can do this, and  that is what this award recognizes.   As any State has--Alaska, North Dakota--we have thousands of teachers  in my State who do such great work day in and day out to make sure our  next generation is not only educated on the facts but who also  understand, in the words of the great leader Nelson Mandela,  ``Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the  world.'' Nelson Mandela said that.   These four teachers have been working hard every day for years so  that their students will go out and do just that--change the world;  make Alaska, America, the world a better place.   They, as well as our teachers all across the country, all across  Alaska, certainly have one of the most important and most difficult  jobs, so we salute all of them, but I want to salute these four  teachers in a little bit more detail. They have chosen not only to  master these science, engineering, physics subjects, but to teach it to  the next generation.   Despite a slight improvement in the STEM skills of Americans over the  last 20 years, it is widely recognized that the United States is still  being outpaced by countries all over the world in these critical  subject matters.   Now, more than ever, our country desperately needs skilled Americans,  skilled professionals, who can innovate for our Nation, who can improve  our Nation's infrastructure, advance our healthcare system, build the  tools that defend our country, and ensure our Nation's prosperity and a  strong economy. We need STEM education.   There is so much to say about all four of these teachers, but let me  give you a brief example of how they are teaching the youth of Alaska  in these critical areas.   Mr. Hall is a math teacher at Dimond High School who, by the way, has  former students and fans in my office. This is a bit of a theme. A lot  of these teachers have taught a lot of my staff right now, including  Jesse here. Mr. Hall has been an educator for more than 20 years. He  has been teaching math for the past 14 years at Dimond High, and as the  department chair, he decided that the school needed an event where math  students could show and take pride in the skills they are learning.   He worked with another math teacher to design and organize a  schoolwide math competition. They just had their fourth annual event,  and 175 students participated. The audience cheered; students were  excited. It was a huge deal. Studying math is really cool. It is great.  Gosh, there were 175 students. So that is Mr. Hall.   Mrs. Childress is also at Dimond High and also has a big fan base in  my office of former students, including Jesse, I believe. She has  taught for over 20 years, 14 of which have been teaching science and  engineering courses at Dimond.   She helped found the Engineering Academy at Dimond, and she and  another teacher developed and ran a program called Smart Girls Rock!  Smart Girls Rock! exposes freshman and sophomore girls to female  engineers from Anchorage and encourages young women to pursue STEM  careers. As a father of three daughters, I know just how important it  is to do that.   Here is a fun fact: Mrs. Childress and Mr. Hall have been married for  23 years, which makes this award all the more special for both of them.  I would call them a true power couple in Alaska STEM education.   Miss Wilcox, a teacher from Campbell Elementary, has had a 20-year  career and has been teaching at Campbell for the past 3 years. Working  with her colleagues, she created a STEM school at Campbell--the first  STEM elementary school in Anchorage.   Again, these are innovators. You can tell these teachers are  innovators.   Also, as a project for the Iditarod Teacher in Every Classroom, which  is a science program based on our famous sled dog race, the Iditarod,  she worked with another colleague to get their classroom to adopt and  improve a local park.   Miss Wilcox's second graders appeared before the school board, the  community council, and the parks commission to advocate for their idea.  So not only are they learning STEM, but they are learning civics. For  their efforts, they were awarded a $20,000 Anchorage Parks Foundation  matching grant, and the park now has outdoor learning labs, paths,  signs, and is a joy to visit. So all of you visitors who are going to  come to Alaska have to make sure you check out this great new  innovation in our parks.   Finally, let me talk about Ms. Wright. Ms. Wright has been an  educator for over 16 years. She began her career teaching in rural  Alaska, which I view as the heart and soul of our State. For the last 7  years she taught at Auke Bay in Juneau, where she was born and raised.  [[Page S6443]]    She is passionate about incorporating place-based knowledge into the  classroom. She says that every year her students participate in place- based learning. They pick berries, a traditional part of the Alaska  Native subsistence lifestyle, in order to gather the data and more  detailed information about our incredible environments throughout the  State.   ``Students in my classroom learn a lot of Alaskan Native languages  and participate in a Tlingit dance group, performing around southeast  Alaska.'' She also takes her fourth and fifth grade students on a field  trip to the muskeg ecosystem to learn how animals adapt to survive in  different environments.   ``Teaching in Alaska is a gift and taking advantage of it is  something I value very much,'' Ms. Wright said. It was, in fact, Mr.  President, a sentiment expressed by all four of these teachers who won  this very prestigious award.   Henry Adams once wrote, ``A teacher affects eternity; he or she can  never tell where their influence actually stops.'' Think about that. A  teacher impacts eternity.   The influence that these teachers have over the lives of so many  young Alaskans will really never stop. As I mentioned, many staff  members of my office are direct recipients of this influence, which  will continue help to grow the next generation of leaders, of workers,  of thinkers, of doers, and I am sure the next generation of teachers,  through their example. I see students who, in turn, will continue to  make our State and our country the great places that they are. We  cannot thank these teachers enough for what they have done.   So I want to congratulate Mr. Hall, Ms. Childress, Ms. Wilcox, and  Ms. Wright for all they have done for this great award, for all they  continue to do, for your dedication to your profession, for your  passion for math and science, and for your commitment to Alaska's next  generation.   And, of course, I want to congratulate them on being this week's  Alaskans of the Week.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.
