 Mr. Speaker, Kansas voters sent me to fix health care.  Doing nothing is not an option. I cannot sit here idly while the ACA  destroys and bankrupts America's healthcare system.   This bill eliminates nearly a trillion dollars of taxes. This bill  eliminates funding for Planned Parenthood. This bill will save many  hospitals in Kansas from closing by increasing funding for Medicare  patients. This bill allots $100 billion for high-risk pools. This bill  specifies another $15 billion specifically for maternity coverage,  which is near and dear to my heart; newborn care; mental health care;  and substance abuse disorders.   Mr. Speaker, this is the best bill that we can get through this  process. I am excited to be part of it. This is the first chapter of a  new book, with many more chapters to come. We will fix health care.
