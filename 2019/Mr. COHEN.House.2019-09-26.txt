 Mr. Speaker, a whistleblower brought a complaint to the  DNI, who sent it to the inspector general--  [[Page H7998]]  that they found to be a credible person and a credible complaint  threatening the security of our country--that a phone conversation had  taken place between our President and the President of Ukraine  suggesting that he should, the President of Ukraine, go into a criminal  investigation that would affect the election of 2020, and conditioned  it through actions on military aid to Ukraine.   This is suborning the Constitution and threatening our national  security.   Mr. Speaker, I commend Speaker Pelosi for calling for an impeachment  inquiry. It is the right time. It is the right issue. This is an  egregious subversion of our Constitution.   Long may the United States survive and live as a true democracy.                            ____________________
