 Madam Speaker, early next week, America marks the dark  anniversary of the United States Supreme Court's decision of Roe v.  Wade.   Since that date, over 60 million babies have been aborted. Those  babies had no voice to defend themselves.   The tide is turning, though. Thanks to President Trump and a pro-life  Congress the last 2 years, we have continued to take a stand for life  in legislation, through executive action, and in the courts. There is  much to do to make sure that every baby is protected under our law yet.   I am especially grateful that Arizona was recently recognized as the  most protective of life in the United States. Thank you to all the  officials and advocates who work tirelessly to make this happen.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank Representative Mitchell. I am  grateful for this opportunity to highlight National School Choice Week,  which will be next week, January 20 through 26.   Like many in Congress, I believe the path to success for our Nation's  youth is through quality education. The best way to provide quality is  to create competition in the education marketplace.  [[Page H667]]    For decades, students and families had few options when they went to  choose education for their children. Today, there is a flourishing  education marketplace. Some States have erased school district lines,  directly creating choice within their traditional public school  systems. Many others have embraced charter schools and duel-enrollment  programs, and still others have provided educational savings accounts  for parents and allowed voucher programs to assist families with  offsetting the cost of private school tuition.   Educational options should meet the variety of unique needs of  students. I am glad to see leaders across the country understand those  needs and promote policies that provide an abundance of options.   Nearly 30 years ago, my wife and I studied the options available to  us as parents as we went to educate our children in Arizona. At that  time, there were very few options. I took the required general  certification test that allowed us to home educate our oldest children.                                time  1845    As our family and children grew, so did educational choice in  Arizona. Our children are each unique individuals with varying talents,  abilities, and interests. Homeschooling worked for some of our  children, charter schools for others, and, even within the charter  schools, different charter schools worked for different children. But  each of our children received a quality education that allowed them to  flourish and which prepared them for life.   Four of our children have graduated from college, the fifth has  attended college, and our youngest is in her freshman year of college.  My wife and I are pleased with their successes and are deeply  appreciative of Arizona's liberal school choice policies that allow  every child an opportunity to thrive and grow in a school that is the  best fit for them.   Today, in Arizona, there are more than 550 charter schools, with  186,000 students enrolled in the 2016-2017 school year. That is an  increase of 6,000 students, or almost 6 percent over the previous  school year, and makes up about 17 percent of all of Arizona's public  school students.   But school choice doesn't stop with charter schools in Arizona. We  also offer scholarships funded by State tax credits to help make  private schools more affordable, as well as education savings accounts  that help more than 5,400 students and their families choose the  educational option that is best for them.   I firmly believe parents and students should be in the driver's seat  when determining which educational path best fits their needs. They can  only do this if local, State, and Federal leaders continue to reduce  involvement in education decisionmaking.   Again, I thank Representative Mitchell and the leaders here today and  those who are working for school choice across this country, those who  are fighting for policies that benefit students and their families.   Today's youth will be our future leaders in this great Nation, and  even in the world. It is, thusly, imperative that we provide them with  the highest quality education to ensure they have the foundation  necessary to become the leaders we need.
