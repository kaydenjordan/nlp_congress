 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Sweet Cheeks  Diaper Bank for opening their newest warehouse location in Lower Price  Hill.   Since they opened their doors in 2015, these wonderful people have  been a lifeline for women and children in the greater Cincinnati and  northern Kentucky area.   Over the span of 4 years, they have donated over a million diapers  that have, without doubt, changed the quality of life for so many  infants.   Last month alone, Sweet Cheeks distributed over 135,000 diapers  through 43 community partners. They also delivered health aid kits to  women and schoolgirls who otherwise couldn't afford them.   This tremendous organization gives back so much to our community and,  most importantly, gives so many women and children in my district a  sense of dignity.   Mr. Speaker, I want to congratulate Sweet Cheeks Diaper Bank on their  newest warehouse location in Lower Price Hill and sincerely thank them  for all they do for women and children in the greater Cincinnati area.                            ____________________
