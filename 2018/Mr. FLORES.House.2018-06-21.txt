 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor Penny Celeste  Forrest of Waco, Texas, who passed away on June 15, 2018.   Penny was born in 1948 in Dallas, Texas. She was educated at East  Texas State University, now known as Texas A&M University-Commerce;  Baylor University; the University of Texas at Arlington; McLennan  Community College; Texas State Technology College; and Texas Woman's  University.   Penny was very active in our Waco community. She served on various  boards, associations, and commissions, including the following:  president of the Central Texas Museum District, vice president of the  Austin Avenue Neighborhood Association, chair of the Boy Scouts Award  Committee, chair of the Waco-McLennan County Library Commission, the  McLennan County Historical Commission, the Texas State Technical  College board of regents, the city of Waco Parks and Recreation  Advisory Commission, the city of Waco Convention and Visitors Bureau  Advisory Board, and the city of Waco Buildings and  Standards Commission.  [[Page H5366]]    For the past 8 years, Penny has been an integral member of my team  that serves the 17th Congressional District of Texas. She was one of  the first three hires I made when I assumed office in 2011.   Since then, she worked in our Waco office as our office manager and  our caseworker. She loved her job, and she especially loved being able  to serve others.   Penny was also in charge of handling the Military Service Academy  nominations for our office. Each year, she would compile all of the  applications and coordinate with our service academy board to interview  applicants. She took great pride in being able to help young men and  women get accepted into our Nation's service academies.   In addition to her official duties, she also served as the matriarch  of our Waco office team. She befriended and mentored everyone with whom  she worked. She especially enjoyed working with all of our interns, and  she would advise them during their time in our office.   There is no doubt that some of the wisdom that she shared with them  has helped shape their lives and their careers.   Penny was an exceptional and devoted person who will be greatly  missed by all those lives she touched.   The thing that I know that she loved more than serving others was  loving her husband, Jerry, and her children. For as long as I can  remember, Jerry and Penny would have lunch together every day in our  office. They truly enjoyed each other's company. Their love and  dedication to each other was remarkable and something to be modeled by  all of us.   A little over a year ago, we buried my father-in-law. During the  graveside service, the pastor said something that I will always  remember. He said, When we leave this Earth, we should all aspire to  leave behind three things: a good name, a good family, and a forwarding  address.   Penny Forrest left behind all three of those things, and in  particular, she left a forwarding address. Because of her Christian  faith and her belief in Jesus Christ as her Lord and savior, she is  celebrating with him in heaven. Her actions serve as a great example  for all of us here still on Earth.   She and Jerry loved to go on cruises, and she is on the ultimate  cruise right now.   Madam Speaker, Penny's life was defined by her selfless service to  those around her. She worked tirelessly to better our community. She  has certainly left an enduring impression on her central Texas  community and the 17th Congressional District.   She will be forever remembered as a selfless servant, a wife, a  mother, a grandmother, and a dear friend.   My wife, Gina, and I, along with the entire Texas 17 Congressional  Team, offer our deepest and heartfelt condolences to the Forrest  family.   We also lift up the family and friends of Penny in our prayers.   I have requested that a United States flag be flown over the Capitol  to honor the life and legacy of Penny Forrest.   As I close today, I urge all Americans to continue praying for our  country, for our military men and women who serve us, and for our first  responders who keep us safe at home.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 6136, the  Border Security and Immigration Reform Act, and I thank Chairman  Goodlatte for allowing me to spend time talking about this from a  personal perspective.   I represent the 17th District of Texas, which has a number of  colleges, universities, and institutions of higher education that are  home to hundreds of Dreamers who are studying to improve their lives. I  believe that we should give them a path to come out of the shadows by  providing them with an earned path to legal status.   These Dreamers were brought here by their parents as children and,  for most, America is the only home they know.   Further, they did not commit the crime to enter the country  illegally, and to characterize an earned path to legal status as  amnesty is an offense to their character and to the hard work this body  has done to try to come to a consensus.   This bill is also important because it will ensure that children who  are apprehended at the border will not be separated from their parents  and/or legal guardian while in DHS custody.   Look, we all know that enforcing the law is important, both for the  integrity of our immigration system and out of respect to the thousands  of law-abiding immigrants who come to this country legally every year,  many of whom reside in my district.   The President was right to issue an executive order to stop the  separation of children from their parents. As I have said before, only  Congress can enact a permanent solution that amends current law, which  has flaws and loopholes, and overturns current legal precedent set by  the courts.   This bill includes four pillars which were previously agreed on by  Democrats and Republicans and the White House a few months ago. It  deals with border security; it comes up with a solution for the  Dreamers; it gets rid of a visa lottery, which has not been helpful for  merit-based immigration in this country; and it reforms chain migration  so that we can bring in the immigrants that we need who will be an  integral part of the economy on day one.    In closing, Madam Speaker, I will note that we cannot move forward  without enacting strong border security reforms, and I am pleased that  the solutions for our Dreamers that this bill puts forward are coupled  with funding to strengthen border security. We can't have one without  the other.   Robust border security includes a border wall, where feasible. Robust  border security can only be achieved through an integrated system of  border technology, personnel, and the modernization of our ports of  entry. This bill rightly authorizes all of those components and funds  those components.   I urge a ``yes'' vote from all of our colleagues on this bill.  [[Page H5485]]
