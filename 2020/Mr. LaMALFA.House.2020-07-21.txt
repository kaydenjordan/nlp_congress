 Mr. Speaker, this week we celebrate the 50th anniversary  of the National Interagency Fire Center.   Established in Boise, Idaho, in 1970, the NIFC supports the Federal  emergency response for wildland firefighting across the country. Eight  different agencies look to the NIFC for direction and coordination on  how to best respond to wildland fires.   This year's fire season is already underway. I have two in my  northern California district, at least, and it will be very active. The  NIFC will play a critical role in supporting and coordinating these  fire operations across the West.   The NIFC proves that our emergency response efforts are stronger when  agencies work together, and I thank the workers who help support our  Nation's firefighters.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the NIFC for 50 years of service to our Nation's  wildlands, firefighters, and for public safety.                            ____________________
