 Mr. Speaker, our country is blessed with abundant  natural resources that are the envy of the world. The governance of  those resources is the responsibility of all of us to make our outdoor  spaces manageable and accessible for enjoyment of all.   I am pleased to highlight the Hells Canyon Recreation Collaborative  in my home State of Idaho. This collaborative was formed in December  2016 after a fee for boaters was proposed on the Snake River through  Hells Canyon. Rafters, jet boaters, aviators, motorized recreation  users, and others came together for its formation. As a 501(c)(3), they  identified and raised separate resources so access could be maintained  without a user fee increase.  [[Page H8827]]    Additionally, the collaborative was able to build boat rigs, complete  the building of administrative and recreation facilities for the Forest  Service and an airstrip for aviators, as well as provide road  maintenance for administrative sites.   I am so proud to highlight the men and women who stepped up and made  a difference for the benefit of all in the Hells Canyon river area. I  look forward to hearing about more good work from them.                            ____________________
