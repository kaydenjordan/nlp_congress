 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the life of the  great Providence Journal columnist, Bill Reynolds.   Ask any Rhode Islander and they will tell you that Bill Reynolds was  an institution of Rhode Island sports and journalism whose column was  read by thousands across the State.   It was a tradition, a must-read, and families across Rhode Island,  including mine, started their Saturday by reading his column, ``For  What It's Worth,'' which included his latest not only on sports, but  also pop culture, politics, movies, and more.   He was a columnist at the Journal for almost 40 years, a New York  Times best-selling author, and a Hall of Fame Brown University  basketball player, who still played pickup games well into his 60s, and  was known for his jump shot, which earned him the nickname ``Shooter.''   Bill was one of the best sportswriters in Rhode Island history, who  mentored an entire generation of aspiring writers and athletes. There  will never be another like him. May he rest in peace.       Celebrating Rhode Island Special Olympic Athlete, Brian Johnson     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the  achievements of Rhode Island's Special Olympic athlete, Brian Johnson  of East Greenwich.   Brian made Rhode Island proud by bringing home the gold for bocce at  the Special Olympics World Games in Berlin last month.   He and his teammate, David Young, defeated the team from Paraguay 10- 3 to win the unified doubles gold. To top it off, Brian also won the  silver medal in the singles division.   Brian has competed in the Special Olympics for 14 years,  participating in track and field, basketball, bocce, bowling, cycling,  flag football, and volleyball. He has been an advocate for inclusion  and has shared the impact of his Special Olympics experiences with  students at his school.   Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Brian for his incredible accomplishment.  He has done himself and all of Rhode Island proud.                 Celebrating Jonathan Stone on his retirement    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate Jonathan Stone, who recently  retired as executive director of Save the Bay Rhode Island after 14  years of service.   Founded in 1970, Save the Bay is Rhode Island's leading organization  for advocacy, education, and policy to safeguard the Narragansett Bay  and its tributaries.   Jonathan led vital work to restore Rhode Island's coastlines and  waterways, protect marine life, help our State adapt to climate change,  and delivered major legislative victories for environmental  conservation.   He championed the Cesspool Phaseout law of 2015 to remove sewage from  public waterways and the creation of the Ocean State Climate Adaptation  and Resilience fund to protect vulnerable infrastructure and coastal  areas from sea level rise in extreme weather.   At the same time, Jonathan strengthened Save the Bay's environmental  education programs, which have introduced hundreds of thousands of  students to the bay, and launched construction of a new exploration  center and aquarium, which will open this fall.   Rhode Islanders are indebted to Jonathan for his commitment to our  State and the waterways that make it so special, but we must remember,  as Jonathan Stone reminded us when he announced his retirement, that  the saving of Narragansett Bay is not complete.   Mr. Speaker, I look forward to doing my part in Congress and using  Jon Stone's leadership as an example.                            ____________________
