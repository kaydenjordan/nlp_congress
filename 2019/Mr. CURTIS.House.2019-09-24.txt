 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of Clean Energy  Week, an opportunity to celebrate bipartisan support for a wide variety  of clean energy sources strengthening America's national security while  also preserving our environment for future generations.   Environmental stewardship doesn't have to mean making economic  sacrifices. Clean energy solutions and jobs are the future for the  United States, with clean energy powering more homes and businesses  than ever before.   The environment is, and should be, a bipartisan issue. That is why,  this week, I am proud, with my friend Congressman Lowenthal from  California, to offer a resolution in support of congressionally  supporting the designation of Clean Energy Week.   I am proud that our effort has already gathered dozens of our  colleagues, bipartisan, on both sides of the aisle. This goes to show  that we can work across the aisle to be better stewards of this Earth.  I plan to continue pursuit of these positive bipartisan solutions in  the future.                            ____________________
