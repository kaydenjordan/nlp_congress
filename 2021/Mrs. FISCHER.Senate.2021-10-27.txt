 Mr. President, I rise to discuss where things stand  after 9 months under President Biden.   To start, American citizens are still left behind enemy lines in  Afghanistan, even though the President said in August that he would get  every single American home safe before pulling out our troops.   And the numbers are much worse than the administration has led us to  believe. As of this week, the State Department is in touch with more  than 400 Americans who are still in Afghanistan. About half of those-- at least 196 American citizens--want to leave, but they have been  unable to do so.   Leaving even one American citizen who wants to come home at the mercy  of the Taliban is a failure in leadership. It should never have been an  option. But it has been 2 months, and there are still 196 Americans in  Afghanistan who want out. That is unconscionable.   President Biden should have done what was needed to bring every last  American home, like he promised he would do in August. That is his No.  1 responsibility as President, to ensure the safety of the American  people.   But maybe we shouldn't be surprised, since he hasn't been able to  secure our own border. In fact, he doesn't even try to secure our  southern border.   Customs and Border Protection reported recently that they apprehended  more than 1.7 million migrants attempting to cross our southern border  illegally over the span of just 12 months. That is the highest total  ever recorded in a single fiscal year. And if border agents encountered  1.7 illegal migrants, imagine how many were able to cross into our  country undetected.   CBP encountered nearly 200,000 illegal migrants last month alone,  meaning that apprehensions were up by more than 230 percent in  September 2021 compared to September of 2020.   If you want to know why we have this crisis at the border, ask the  migrants themselves. Many have been very honest about why they risk  their lives to travel thousands of miles to the United States. If you  ask them why--ask them why they are here--their answer is simple: The  President promised to let us in.   We are a nation of immigrants, but we cannot have effective legal  immigration if illegal immigration is spiraling out of control.   Illegal immigration means cutting in front of millions of people who  have been waiting years to come to the United States the right way. Our  message as a nation needs to be that if you want to come here, you have  to follow our laws. You cannot just walk across the border.    President Obama said it well a few weeks ago in an interview on ABC  News. He said:         And we see tragedy and hardship and families that are       desperately trying to get here so that their kids are safe,       and they're in some cases fleeing violence or catastrophe. At       the same time, we're a nation state. We have borders. The       idea that we can just have open borders is something that . .       . as a practical matter, is unsustainable.    Well, ABC cut that portion of the interview out. I suppose they can't  allow a former President of the United States to disagree with the  radical leftwing of their party.   This is all taking place against the backdrop of the highest  inflation rate in decades and massive supply chain issues that threaten  to cripple our recovering economy. The White House insists these  problems are only going to affect the upper class--they are high-class  problems. Press Secretary Jen Psaki said the other day that our supply  chain issues are nothing more than ``the tragedy of the treadmill  that's delayed.'' What an out-of-touch thing to say. She must be  talking about her friends and neighbors here in DC because I don't know  many Nebraskans who are spending thousands of dollars on in-home  treadmills.   Rising costs and shortages are hurting everyone--most of all, the  tens of millions of Americans who are living paycheck to paycheck. The  President's shameless ``buy now, pay later'' policies are forcing hard- working Americans to pay an extra dollar for a gallon of gas while they  watch the real value of their retirement accounts slump.   They might not live in Washington or New York or San Francisco, but  these are real people. They are small business owners who are wondering  if they will be able to get the supplies that they need to meet  historic demand this holiday season. They are millions of hard-working  Americans who rely on propane to heat their homes who are worried about  getting priced out of a warm house this winter. They are families who  don't know if they will be able to put food on the table for their  kids.   Anyone who thinks most people's first concern is whether the newest  Peloton is going to arrive on time, they have no idea what working  Americans do to get by every single day.   What has the response to these unprecedented problems been in the  media? The Washington Post said it is ``time for some new, more  realistic expectations.'' I think people will find that ``lower your  expectations'' is not a very optimistic and it is not a very inspiring  slogan for the party in power.   And as dangerous as this wave of inflation is, it is really not like  nobody saw it coming. Larry Summers, the liberal economist who directed  the National Economic Council under President Obama, has been sounding  the alarm for months. He is not the only one. Dozens of leading experts  have warned against borrowing trillions of dollars to expand the reach  of government when inflation is already running rampant.   But, earlier this year, Democrats in Congress spent nearly $2  trillion on an entirely partisan basis under the pretense that it was  necessary to fight the pandemic. So what is the fix? What is the fix?  How is President Biden going to pull America back from the brink of  stagflation?   Well, he wants to spend even more of the American people's hard- earned money. The President said in August that the massive,  multitrillion-dollar spending spree he wants this Chamber to approve  ``won't increase inflation. It will take the pressure off of  inflation.''   Well, he leaves how that might happen to our imagination. In reality,  trying to spend our way out of inflation is like trying to put a fire  out with lighter fluid; it is absolutely delusional.  [[Page S7413]]    We cannot just keep spending more and more, not when, as the senior  Senator from West Virginia said recently, ``[m]illions of jobs are  open, supply chains are strained, and unavoidable inflation taxes are  draining workers' hard-earned wages as the price of gasoline and  groceries continues to climb.''   Out-of-control spending is how we got here in the first place, and  the longer we keep at it, the worse it is going to get. Some Democrats  are fond of saying that this bill will cost zero dollars because, well,  it might be paid for through new taxes. The truth is that their plan  would create trillions of dollars in new entitlements, and even if they  do find a way to pay for it, which I doubt, that doesn't mean it is  free. That money has to come from somewhere, and the Joint Committee on  Taxation has shown that two-thirds of Democrats' proposed new tax  burdens--they would fall on the lower and the middle class of this  country.   I wish I could say the outrageous pricetag is the only thing wrong  with the Democrats' tax-and-spend boondoggle, but what is actually in  their plan might even be more irresponsible. It would allow the IRS to  snoop on Americans' bank accounts if their inflows and their outflows  exceed $10,000 per year.   Now, that is a lot of money, but let's put it in perspective. Federal  agents would get to see your house and car payments, how much you spend  on groceries and gas, heating bills, school costs for your kids, and  everything else that you spend in a year just to get by. So spending  over $10,000 a year on these essentials that are in our lives, they  would let the IRS be in just about every American's bank account.   Democrats' plan would also expand green energy tax credits for  wealthy Americans so they can buy expensive electric vehicles they can  already afford. A millionaire can buy the most expensive new Tesla for  $150,000, and under what the senior Senator from Oregon has proposed,  they will be able to claim a tax credit worth $12,500. Nebraska  taxpayers don't need to be subsidizing new electric cars for rich  Americans.   And maybe worst of all, the House plan does not include the Hyde  amendment, which Republicans and Democrats have agreed on for decades.  If the radical left succeeds in taking that out, taxpayers will be  required to pay for abortions for the first time in more than 40 years.    The American people have been watching this country bounce from  crisis to crisis to crisis, and after so many disasters in a row, one  poll shows that President Biden's approval rating is down to just 37  percent. Barely a third of Americans approve of the job this President  is doing, and a majority say this administration is not competent.   That should tell President Biden that his agenda isn't as popular in  the rest of America as it is in the beltway bubble. But, instead, the  President is forging ahead with more Federal Government controls.   There is now even talk of a Federal vaccine mandate. The government  is going to twist an obscure labor law beyond recognition to force  Americans to take that vaccine.   I believe in the vaccines. I believe they are safe and effective and  we should be encouraging people to choose to get vaccinated, but the  government--the government--simply has no business requiring Americans  to do it. Under the President's new Executive order, businesses with  more than 100 employees are being forced to comply with the vaccine  mandate or submit employees to weekly testing; otherwise, they will  risk losing crucial employees.   I recently signed on to a letter led by the junior Senator from  Alaska that urges the President to reconsider. There is absolutely no  precedent in American history for a Federal vaccine requirement, and  President Biden will be on entirely new legal ground if he moves ahead  with this.   One of the most unsettling things I have seen from this  administration wasn't something that they said or did; it was something  that they left unsaid. When Jen Psaki broke the news that the Federal  Government was going to try to force through this mandate, she smiled.  In response to a reporter who asked if the President had the power to  enforce vaccination for private employees--not Federal contractors,  private employees--she said, ``Yes. Stay tuned.'' And then she grinned.   Without saying anything, she showed that the Biden administration is  relishing this chance to push the limits of Executive power. When you  take that together with the incompetence that has been on display since  January, from the Afghanistan debacle to the crisis at our southern  border, to our administration's complete disregard for how inflation is  devastating hard-working families and the poor in our country, I think  you start to get a good idea of what the Biden administration is all  about.   They are going to trample on the Constitution to advance a radical  left agenda that is truly unprecedented in American history, and they  don't care how many disasters they continue to create.   Thank you.   Madam President, I would ask consent that the 5:15 vote occur  immediately.
