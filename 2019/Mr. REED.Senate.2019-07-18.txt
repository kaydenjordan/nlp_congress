 Mr. President, today I am reintroducing the State Flood  Mitigation Revolving Fund Act of 2019 along with Senators Kennedy and  Menendez.   The purpose of our bill is to reduce flood risk and the costs  associated with flooding by establishing a State revolving loan program  to fund mitigation projects for property owners and communities that  participate in the National Flood Insurance Program. By funding  projects that reduce risk, such as home elevations, flood proofing,  acquisitions, and environmental restoration, the bill also provides an  avenue to help middle-income and low-income property owners reduce  their flood insurance premiums. It is a proposal that has been endorsed  by over 200 local and national organizations, including the Pew  Charitable Trusts, Association of State Floodplain Managers, National  Association of Mutual Insurance Companies, the Property Casualty  Insurance Association of America, the Nature Conservancy, the Union of  Concerned Scientists, the U.S. Resiliency Council, and others.   Flooding is the most costly hazard facing American property owners.  With increasing frequency we see news stories of catastrophic flooding  in communities across the Nation. According to the Pew Charitable  Trusts, seven out of ten Presidential Disaster Declarations in the last  ten years have involved flooding, and data from the National Oceanic  and Atmospheric Administration show that there were 27 flooding  disasters or hurricanes in the last decade that each caused more than  $1 billion in damage.   But the increase in major flooding disasters has also been  accompanied by increases in nuisance, urban, and high tide flooding  events, which don't trigger the full complement of Federal disaster  assistance but are devastating to every homeowner and community that is  affected.   Experts agree that the best way to reduce the cost of flooding is to  engage in proactive, not reactive, flood mitigation. The National  Institute of Building Sciences' 2018 Natural Hazard Mitigation Saves  study found that every Federal dollar spent on up-front mitigation  provides $6 in national benefits, and investments in flood mitigation  yield $7 in benefits per dollar spent. This is the kind of saving the  State Flood Mitigation Revolving Fund Act seeks to promote and  leverage.   Modeled on the successful Clean Water and Drinking Water State  Revolving Funds, this bill creates a straightforward and easily  accessible program through which States can offer low-interest loans to  property owners and communities who want to mitigate their flood risk.  By creating a revolving fund, the bill will allow States to design and  more efficiently implement their own flood mitigation strategies  provided that such strategies help achieve Federal objectives such as  reducing disaster payments.   Within this construct, the bill gives States the flexibility to  undertake flood mitigation projects expeditiously. The bill requires  States to provide matching funds and gives them the ability to further  leverage Federal dollars, as many already do under the drinking water  and clean water SRF programs.   Additionally, the bill ensures mitigation assistance is focused on  where the flood risk is greatest and where people are most vulnerable.  The bill requires states to prioritize mitigation assistance for low- income homeowners and geographic areas, pre-FIRM buildings, and severe  repetitive loss and repetitive loss buildings. Finally, it gives states  the option of providing additional subsidization for low-income  property-owners and communities that simply do not have the wherewithal  to assume additional debt.   Mr. President, as we talk about appropriate investments in  infrastructure, mitigation is one place where we  [[Page S4954]]  should be investing. I invite the rest of our colleagues to join me,  Senator Kennedy, and Senator Menendez in supporting this bipartisan  legislation.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I am reintroducing the State Flood  Mitigation Revolving Fund Act of 2019 along with Senators Kennedy and  Menendez.
