 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the late Vincent  Pantozzi of Jersey City, New Jersey, on the occasion of the 100th  anniversary of the end of World War I, which was Sunday.   Just 2 months after the United States entered World War I, and only 5  years after Mr. Pantozzi immigrated to the United States, he enlisted  in the Army. Sergeant Pantozzi served in many pivotal battles in  France. He was shot in the knee on June 15, 1918, and then gassed 8  days later.   Sergeant Pantozzi spent 3 weeks in a field hospital, recovered, and  returned to his post.   He was awarded the Purple Heart and many other commendations for his  service.   In 1919, Sergeant Pantozzi was honorably discharged from the United  States Army. The next day, he became a U.S. citizen.   Mr. Pantozzi passed away on October 7, 1976, at the age of 82.   I ask my colleagues to join me in honor of Sergeant Vincent Pantozzi  of Jersey City, New Jersey, an exceptionally dedicated man whose  service to our country deserves this recognition.                            ____________________
