 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the CARES Act.   COVID-19, otherwise known as the coronavirus, has seriously impacted  our country, both medically and economically. During this unprecedented  time, it is imperative that we not only take proper precautions, but  react in an effective manner.   This bill is not perfect. It has a very large price tag. However, a  crisis of this magnitude requires Congress to act swiftly and  decisively. This bill represents a bipartisan compromise that can make  this happen.   We have single household incomes, seniors on fixed incomes, and small  business owners who need relief right now. My constituency is still  rebuilding after Hurricane Michael, and I intend to do whatever it  takes to get them the help they need right away.   This is an excellent opportunity for us all to come together and  support our constituents. Please join me in supporting this stimulus  package.
