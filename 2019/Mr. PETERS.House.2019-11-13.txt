 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 100th  anniversary of the Fleet Readiness Center Southwest at Naval Air  Station North Island in Coronado, the birthplace of naval aviation  maintenance.   In 1912, the entire Navy aviation squad consisted of four officers  and three planes, which called North Island home. As more planes  routinely landed at sea, it became necessary for the Navy to have an  official aviation maintenance facility.   Shortly after the U.S. Government obtained the island in 1917, it  established the Overhaul and Repair Department, the first maintenance  repair and overhaul facility in the Department of Defense.   Now designated as the Fleet Readiness Center Southwest, the goals are  the same: to produce quality equipment and provide support to our  Nation's aviation war fighters through the overhaul, repair, and  modification of the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps frontline aircraft.   Encompassing 358 acres and over 80 buildings, the Fleet Readiness  Center is one of the largest aerospace employers in San Diego County,  employing approximately 3,500 civilians and 900 military personnel.   Please join me in honoring one of the best facilities in the U.S.  Navy, the Fleet Readiness Center Southwest at Naval Air Station North  Island, on its 100th anniversary.                            ____________________
