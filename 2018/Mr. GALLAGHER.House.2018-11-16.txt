 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my colleague  from Wisconsin, Representative Sean Duffy, and his bill, the Manage Our  Wolves Act. This piece of legislation is critically important to my  district and its farmers.   You see, farming is the lifeblood of northeast Wisconsin. Not only do  our agricultural products support thousands of local jobs, they also  feed millions of mouths across the world. This is why so many of my  constituents are concerned by the threat of the gray wolf population to  our farms. Already, the gray wolf's predatory behavior has cost  Wisconsin farmers millions of dollars in damage.   This is why we must pass the Manage Our Wolves Act to delist the gray  wolf from the Endangered Species Act and return control of population  back to the States where it belongs. By doing so, farmers will finally  be able to focus on actual farming, instead of having to spend extra  time and money on keeping their livestock out of danger.   I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting this important  piece of legislation. Our farmers are depending on it.                                time  1000
