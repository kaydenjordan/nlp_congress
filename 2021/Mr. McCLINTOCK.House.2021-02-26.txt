 Mr. Speaker, to my fellow Americans, all of this free  money is coming out of your future earnings.   Divided by U.S. households, $1.9 trillion comes to roughly $15,000  for an average family. You will pay that back through your future taxes  and inflation and through higher prices and lower wages as businesses  pass along their taxes.   You won't see it all directly, but you will feel it. It is the car  you won't be able to afford someday soon or the home you won't be able  to qualify for.
