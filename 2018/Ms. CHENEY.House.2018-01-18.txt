 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 694 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 694         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 4712) to       amend title 18, United States Code, to prohibit a health care       practitioner from failing to exercise the proper degree of       care in the case of a child who survives an abortion or       attempted abortion. All points of order against consideration       of the bill are waived. The bill shall be considered as read.       All points of order against provisions in the bill are       waived. The previous question shall be considered as ordered       on the bill and on any amendment thereto to final passage       without intervening motion except: (1) one hour of debate       equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking       minority member of the Committee on the Judiciary; and (2)       one motion to recommit.        Sec. 2.  On any legislative day during the period from       January 22, 2018, through January 26, 2018--         (a) the Journal of the proceedings of the previous day       shall be considered as approved; and        (b) the Chair may at any time declare the House adjourned       to meet at a date and time, within the limits of clause 4,       section 5, article I of the Constitution, to be announced by       the Chair in declaring the adjournment.        Sec. 3.  The Speaker may appoint Members to perform the       duties of the Chair for the duration of the period addressed       by section 2 of this resolution as though under clause 8(a)       of rule I.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from Wyoming is recognized  for 1 hour.    Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr.  McGovern), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume.  During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the  purpose of debate only.                                time  1230                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr.  McGovern), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume.  During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the  purpose of debate only.                                time  1230                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentlewoman from Wyoming?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of House Resolution 694, which  provides a closed rule for consideration of H.R. 4712, the Born-Alive  Abortion Survivors Protection Act. This important bill ensures medical  care and legal protection for abortion survivors, protects their  mothers from prosecution, and holds abortion providers accountable.   Mr. Speaker, this bill is not duplicative as some have suggested. It  simply augments current law: the Born-Alive Infants Act and the Partial  Birth Abortion Ban Act, which the House passed in 2002 and 2003,  respectively, with very strong bipartisan support.   Current law includes, in the Federal definition of a person, infants  who are born alive no matter the method of birth or the stage of their  development. Current law, Mr. Speaker, also provides criminal penalties  for physicians who provide partial-birth abortions.   What current law does not provide, however, is enforceable protection  for those children who are born alive after a failed abortion attempt  and denied care, nor does it provide criminal penalties, Mr. Speaker,  for those who perform or knowingly ignore these actions.   Mr. Speaker, there are horrific stories of children born alive during  abortions and are either gruesomely left for dead or deliberately  killed once born. Even more, the abortion industry is fully aware of  the risk of a child being born alive during an abortion, especially if  the abortion occurs once the child is gestationally 18 to 20 weeks old  or more, the age at which we know a child is able to survive if given  the proper neonatal care.   Take the story, Mr. Speaker, of Gianna Jessen, an abortion survivor  who testified before the House Judiciary Committee in 2015. She said:  ``Instead of dying, after 18 hours of being burned in my mother's womb,  I was delivered alive in an abortion clinic in Los Angeles on April 6,  1977. My medical records state: `Born alive during saline abortion' at  6 a.m.   ``Thankfully, the abortionist was not at work yet. Had he been there,  he would have ended my life with strangulation, suffocation, or leaving  me there to die. Instead, a nurse called an ambulance, and I was rushed  to a hospital. Doctors did not expect me to live.   ``I did. I was later diagnosed with cerebral palsy, which was caused  by a lack of oxygen to my brain while I was surviving the abortion. I  was never supposed to hold my head up or walk. I do.''   She concluded: ``If abortion is about women's rights, then what were  mine?''   Some abortion providers, Mr. Speaker, are unwilling to respect the  Born-Alive Infants Protection Act, such as Priscilla Smith, who  testified at a House Judiciary Committee hearing in 2015, saying that  she didn't believe it would be a violation of the previous Born-Alive  Infants Protection Act if a baby were killed outside the womb as long  as the baby wasn't ``viable.''   Ms. Smith went on to assert some fetuses are never viable. She made  these claims notwithstanding the fact, Mr. Speaker, that viability is  not a factor, even under existing law, in determining whether an infant  deserves protection under the law. The law protects infants born alive  at any stage of development; and, therefore these abortion survivors  are entitled to the same degree of care that would be received by any  other babies of their age.   The bill we are debating today, Mr. Speaker, would impose enforceable  criminal penalties for clinics that do not treat survivors with proper  medical care. There is, sadly, evidence that clinics fail to provide  this care.   Deborah Edge, a former abortion clinic employee, wrote an op-ed about  her experience. She said: ``I was the doctor's right-hand person in the  operating room, and just like those employees of Dr. Gosnell''--who we  know was  [[Page H495]]  one of the most horrific abortionists to date, guilty of first degree  murder in the cases of at least three babies--``I saw the abortionist  puncture the soft spot in the baby's head or snip its neck if it was  delivered alive.''   The abortion providers, Mr. Speaker, who neglect to provide  appropriate professional care to these babies, or worse, who kill them  once they are born, must be held accountable.   Finally, I believe it is very important to note, to counter some of  the things you will hear from the other side of the aisle, that this  bill provides crucial protections for women. This bill protects women  who seek abortions by prohibiting them from being prosecuted under the  law.   H.R. 4712 also empowers women. It allows them to sue abortionists who  don't provide protection for aborted babies who are born alive. This is  very important, Mr. Speaker. Take the case of a woman named Angela who  went to a clinic in Orlando, Florida, when she was 23 weeks pregnant.   Angela received pills to begin contractions to induce an abortion.  After an hour of labor, Mr. Speaker, Angela delivered her baby, alive,  into a toilet. Angela had her friend call 911 to request help to save  her baby, but when the paramedics arrived on the scene, clinic staff  reportedly turned them away. The fire department's incident report said  they had no contact with the patient.   After the death of her son, Rowan, Angela wrote the following: ``The  very moment I saw my son was alive, nothing else in the whole world  mattered but Rowan's safety . . . Only one thing mattered to me:  getting Rowan help. I begged repeatedly.''   Tragically, the abortion clinic not only refused but also,  apparently, sabotaged Angela's call for help.   The bill that we are debating today, Mr. Speaker, would give women  like Angela the ability to sue abortionists who do not comply with the  law's requirements to give medical attention to children born alive  like baby Rowan.   Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I urge support for this rule to allow  consideration of H.R. 4712, and I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman from  Wyoming (Ms. Cheney) for the customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself  such time as I may consume.   (Mr. McGOVERN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, today we will consider the 61st closed  rule of the Congress, part of a disturbing and familiar pattern.  Republicans are running this House with no regular order, no hearings  on legislation, and one closed rule after another. Speaker Ryan and  House Republicans recently set a record as presiding over the most  closed session of Congress in history, and now they are adding to it.   With no transparency and their continued effort to silence any debate  or dissent, this House Chamber feels more like the Russian house rather  than the people's House. Now, I know Donald Trump is enthralled with  authoritarian rulers and authoritarian rule, but that doesn't mean you  guys have to follow suit.   Today's rule provides for the consideration of H.R. 4712, yet another  partisan and extreme Republican bill that is completely unnecessary and  aimed solely at pleasing the majority's rightwing base. The simple  truth is that this bill is filled with inflammatory language  intentionally designed to politicize women's access to healthcare. It  is clearly about nothing more than advancing an agenda to take away  access to safe and legal abortion.   With this bill, House Republicans are meddling in the decisions that  should be left up to doctors and patients. That is not our job. What we  are doing today is not about serious legislating. If it were, the  majority would have gone through regular order. This bill is nothing  more than a very cynical effort to give Republican Members of Congress  something to point to when they join the anti-choice march in  Washington this week. Republicans are recklessly playing politics with  women's health, and they should be ashamed.   My Republican colleagues claim that this bill is just a reinstatement  of the current born-alive law. First, if that were true, then this bill  would be redundant and unnecessary; and, second, Democrats would  support it. When the original law came to the House floor in 2002, it  was passed by a voice vote. We all agreed. But this bill is not a  reinstatement.   This bill takes the current, functional law and adds a radical  inclusion of criminal penalties for doctors if they violate the  unreasonable requirements of this legislation.   Under current law, when a child is born alive, including during an  abortion procedure, the healthcare provider is required to care for  this newborn and apply a standard level of care given to any and every  child. However, this bill takes the law a step further and requires  that the doctor immediately transport this child to a hospital, without  exception, whether it is safe for the child or not, or face criminal  punishment--up to 5 years in jail.   This bill could create a chilling effect and limit access to safe,  legal abortion for women since physicians may fear prosecution.  Patients need and deserve access to compassionate and appropriate  medical care. This bill is, quite frankly, unconscionable.   Mr. Speaker, there are times when immediately transporting a newborn  to a hospital that may be miles or even hours away may result in grave  harm to that infant. Such decisions must be left to the professional  judgment of doctors and clinicians.   Doctors and clinicians oppose this law because it prevents them from  giving the best care to their patients. The American College of  Obstetricians and Gynecologists strongly oppose this legislation,  calling it a ``gross interference in the practice of medicine.''   Current law is working and should not be radically changed for a  partisan talking point. Right now there are a number of truly critical  issues that we ought to be considering on this floor, not a sound bite  for an anti-choice rally coming up in the next couple of days.   A clear majority of Americans, I should point out to my colleagues,  seven out of ten, say they believe a woman should have the right to a  safe, legal abortion according to a Quinnipiac University poll. By  stark contrast, fewer than three in ten Americans--that is 29 percent-- approve of the job Republicans are doing in Congress. Maybe the  majority ought to get the hint. People don't like what you are doing.  This should be a wake-up call to Republicans to end their partisan  crusades and start doing their jobs. It is time to focus on the real  pressing issues we face.   The Children's Health Insurance Program, CHIP, which nearly 2 million  kids and their families rely on, has been in limbo for months as States  are beginning to run out of money. Now Republicans are pushing a  continuing resolution that fails to permanently extend CHIP.  Permanently extending CHIP would not only give these kids and their  families the certainty they need when it comes to their healthcare, but  the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office says that it would also  save $6 billion. I thought the majority were the party of fiscal  responsibility. Do the right thing and save $6 billion. But Republicans  would rather kick the can down the road once again.   The authorizations for Community Health Center funds and the  Maternal, Infant, and Childhood Home Visitation programs will remain  expired. That is not even included in this partisan CR that we are  going to see a little bit later today.   Each and every day, 122 DREAMers are losing their protected status  and ability to work in this country, and my Republican friends don't  seem at all bothered by that.   People who are first responders, saving lives, people who serve in  our military and people who work in our companies who are such great  members of our community are treated like this in such a rotten way,  and yet more inaction.   The administration just stripped 200,000 Salvadorans legally residing  in the United States of their protected status, people who are obeying  our laws and who are working here legally.                                time  1245    They did this while admonishing Congress to provide these same people  with an enduring lawful immigration status; and yet, we have a Congress  that is so dysfunctional, they can't even agree on what to have for  lunch,  [[Page H496]]  never mind move anything forward that is positive with regard to  protecting these important members of our community.   The debt limit needs to be raised to ensure the U.S. is able to pay  its bills. Communities are urgently in need of resources to fight the  opioid epidemic that is killing 91 Americans a day.   They are tired of your press releases. They want the funding to be  able to respond to the crisis in their communities; yet, nothing in  this CR, no urgency here in Congress.   More needs to be done to help repair damage left by devastating  wildfires and hurricanes that have ravaged this country. I just came  back from a trip to Puerto Rico. The place is still in great disrepair,  and our initial response to that hurricane was disgraceful. We have a  special obligation to these people, our fellow citizens, to better  respond; yet, there is no urgency here.   Most importantly, where is the budget agreement that sets the caps  for fiscal year 2018? House and Senate appropriators can't even begin  negotiations on an omnibus funding bill until they know the top-line  numbers.   That means that this will not be the last short-term continuing  resolution that we see before this House. Until there is an agreement  on the budget caps, we will continue to see the Republican majority  keep kicking the can down the road. We will see CR No. 5 in mid- February and maybe CR No. 6 shortly thereafter.   When will the Republicans finally stop negotiating with themselves  and instead reach out to Democrats and work in a bipartisan way and  actually get the job done that we were sent here to do by our  constituents?   We are just hours away from another Republican shutdown, and instead  of working on a bipartisan agreement, we are here discussing this  inflammatory bill that will impose criminal penalties on doctors and  allow Congress to intrude on medical care decisions.   When are we going to put the radical rhetoric aside and do our jobs  and tackle the real issues that the Americans sent us here to tackle?   Here is kind of the icing on the cake. This government shutdown is  looming. We are going to run out of money on Friday. All hell is going  to break loose if we can't come to some sort of agreement. You would  think we would be working together to get this done as quickly as  possible.   But then we are told we are going to consider the continuing  resolution rule after this and then we are going to debate it, but we  are not going to vote on it until later night, after 7, maybe even  later.   Why, people might ask, are we delaying action on a bill that decides  whether we keep the government open?   Oh, we just found out President Trump is doing a political rally with  Republican Members of Congress in Pennsylvania.   So the political rally is more important than the well-being of the  American people?   What are you guys thinking?   Shame on you. This is a moment of urgency and instead of doing  political sound bite legislation and instead of doing political rallies  in Pennsylvania for an election that doesn't happen until March,  Members of Congress ought to be here, working to keep the government  running, to come to some sort of accommodation on the DREAMers, to make  sure community health centers are funded, to make sure our veterans get  the funding and the healthcare they need.   What you are doing is atrocious. If the American people could sue you  for political malpractice, you would be in deep trouble.   I urge my colleagues to oppose this rule, to oppose this bill that  would severely undermine women's access to essential services like  abortion, and I urge my colleagues to cancel the political rally and  get back to work.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to direct their remarks  to the Chair and not engage in personalities toward the President.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I compliment my colleague on the other side of the  aisle, Mr. McGovern. We have the opportunity, Mr. Speaker, to spend a  number of hours together up in the Rules Committee. It is always great  to manage debates with Mr. McGovern on the other side of the aisle  because you are left with, number one, no doubt about where he stands.  But number two, a target-rich environment as well, Mr. Speaker.   I would just say a couple of things. First of all, casting aspersions  on this bill when my colleagues say this bill is nothing more than a  political stunt or a political sound bite or a partisan talking point,  I can't imagine, Mr. Speaker, that they really believe that describing  legislation--they may disagree with the legislation--but for us to have  to be on the floor of this body talking about babies who are born alive  and who are killed at the hands of abortionists is far more than a  political sound bite.   I think Mr. McGovern, my colleague, was saying that we ought to be  ashamed of ourselves. I would just say, Mr. Speaker, that is rhetoric  that we don't need and rhetoric that is absolutely inaccurate in terms  of describing the important efforts that we have underway here.    I also would hope, Mr. Speaker, that our colleagues in the other  body, in particular, the Democrats in the other body--Mr. Schumer and  the others over there--were watching Mr. McGovern just now. If the  issue really is, Let's get to work and let's get a deal done, that deal  is in their hands.   Mr. McGovern well knows that you have got to get 60 votes in the  United States Senate to get a deal. We are in the position today where,  of the long list of items Mr. McGovern mentioned, I would say he failed  to mention the single most important obligation we have, which is to  ensure that we get resources to our military.   The reality of the situation we are facing today, at a moment when  our Nation faces grave threats, at a moment where we are having  servicemen and -women killed in training accidents--more killed in  training accidents in the last year than were killed in combat in the  last year--we in this body have failed to do our duty.   The reality of this, for people to understand, is that the Democrats  in the United States Senate are holding funding for defense hostage  because they want amnesty for illegal immigrants. That, Mr. Speaker, is  something that I think is absolutely indefensible.   So I hope that Mr. McGovern's colleagues in the Senate were watching  him, were listening to the concern he has about the sense of urgency  with moving forward.   Frankly, Mr. Speaker, we could have a deal today, if the Democrats  would stop holding spending hostage, stop holding the resources our  military needs hostage in order to grant amnesty for illegal  immigrants.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Tennessee  (Mrs. Blackburn), my friend and colleague and the sponsor of this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from Tennessee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from Tennessee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from Tennessee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New  Jersey (Mr. Smith), one of the strongest, most honorable and admirable  defenders of life in this body, my friend.   Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, doctors, today, routinely diagnose and treat a myriad of  illnesses and diseases suffered by societies' littlest patients--unborn  babies  [[Page H498]]  and newborns--significantly enhancing both the children's health and  longevity.   Abortionists, on the other hand, take a different approach. They  dismember and chemically kill unborn children for profit. For decades,  babies have survived later term abortions. As far back as 37 years ago,  a Philadelphia Inquirer story called baby survival ``the dreaded  complication.''   Dr. Willard Cates of the Center for Disease Control said live births  ``are little known because organized medicine, from fear of public  clamor and legal action, treats them more as an embarrassment to be  hushed up than a problem to be solved. It is like turning yourself in  to the IRS for an audit. What is there to gain? The tendency is not to  report because there are only negative incentives.''   Of course, the tendency is not to report.   When an undercover investigator asked another abortion provider from  Planned Parenthood about the procedure for checking for signs of life  in a baby born after an attempted abortion, the abortionist responded  by saying: ``I mean, the key is, you need to pay attention to who is in  the room. . . . `'   Philadelphia abortionist Kermit Gosnell had a lot of people in the  room, but nobody was reporting, as he killed and snipped the spinal  cords of hundreds of born babies to ensure that they didn't survive.   All is not well in the abortion clinics either, in terms of their own  personnel. The National Public Radio, NPR, did an incisive story  featuring former Planned Parenthood Director Abby Huffman, who is now  Johnson, who is now pro-life, and her outreach to clinical workers  encouraging them to quit their jobs inside the abortion clinics.   Heard on ``All Things Considered,'' Annette Lancaster, a former  manager of Planned Parenthood in North Carolina, said her abortion work  made her feel ``dark and morbid.'' Annette said she was troubled by the  way she and other workers referred to fetal remains. She said: ``I just  now started being able to use my deep freezer in my home by going  through therapy, because we used to call the freezer the `nursery.'''  That is to say for the dead babies.   The National Abortion Federation, in their textbook for abortionists,  says:   ``Providers should consider the possibility of a live-born fetus,  particularly if fetal death is not induced prior to the procedure and  the gestational age is 18 to 20 weeks or more.''   ``Besides the emotional and ethical difficulties for patients, their  partners, and staff, a delivery with signs of life may have legal  implications.''   The problem with existing law, Mr. Speaker, is enforcement--the lack  of legal implications.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from New Jersey.   Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Marsha Blackburn's bill, the Born-Alive  Abortion Survivors Protection Act, requires, under penalty of law, that  appropriate healthcare to be given to any child who survives an  attempted abortion, not looking the other way, as has been done for  decades--Gosnell probably being the most egregious example.   The law prescribes that:   ``Any healthcare practitioner present at the time the child is born  shall exercise the same degree of professional skill, care, and  diligence to preserve the life and health of the child as a reasonably  diligent and conscientious healthcare practitioner would render to any  other child born alive at the same gestational age; following the  exercise of skill, care, and diligence . . . ensure that the child born  alive is immediately transported to a hospital.''   The bill also establishes strong criminal penalties for practitioners  who violate this requirement; establishes a civil right of action for  the mother of the child, to enforce the law; and the mother of the  child born alive may not be prosecuted under this law.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, we are, again, at a very urgent moment here for our  country. We have a lot to do, and we ought to be working in a  bipartisan way to keep the government open. That ought to be  everybody's priority. Quite frankly, we ought to be focused on that  more than on a bill that is a sound bite that is going nowhere.   In fact, this bill was so important to my Republican friends that it  never had a hearing or it never went through a markup. It just  miraculously appeared at the last minute in advance of this anti-choice  rally coming up.   But with all that is going on right now, I mean, with the threat of a  shutdown, I am looking at Donald Trump's tweet:   ``Will be going to Pennsylvania today in order to give my total  support to Rick Saccone, running for Congress in a special election  (March 13). Rick is a great guy.''   That is where the President's head is today. And he is taking a bunch  of Republicans with him. Rather than negotiating a bipartisan deal that  will help keep the government running, that will help the DREAMers,  that will help our kids, that will help community health centers, that  will help our hospitals, and that will help our veterans, the focus is  on a political rally in Pennsylvania. This is unbelievable. Cancel the  rally--you have until March 13--and, instead, focus on the people's  business.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Colorado (Ms.  DeGette), the co-chair of the Pro-Choice Caucus.   Ms. DeGETTE. Mr. Speaker, this bill imposes dangerous new standards  of care on doctors under threat of criminal penalties, including up to  5 years in jail. It is just another attempt by the majority to  interfere with the medical judgment of doctors and other trained  healthcare professionals, and it is, frankly, another example of why it  is such a very, very bad idea for Congress to be legislating medical  standards.   H.R. 4712 is also a solution in search of a problem. There is simply  no evidence that current law is insufficient to protect infants.   It should go without saying that it has always been illegal to kill  newborns. It is a complete distortion of the truth to say anything  otherwise.   In 2002, as my colleagues have said, Congress reaffirmed that infants  are entitled to appropriate medical care under a law that passed on a  bipartisan basis. I voted for it. That law left medical judgment where  it should be: in the hands of doctors, instead of politicians.   Today, the only example that we have heard from the other side of a  horror that they are talking about was Dr. Kermit Gosnell, and it was a  horror.   And guess what?   He was prosecuted under current law.   And guess what?   He is spending the rest of his life in prison, which is where he  should be.   Sadly, the true intent of this bill is to intimidate and shame  doctors out of providing comprehensive reproductive healthcare to  patients.   The extreme and vague requirements of this bill, coupled with its  stiff criminal and civil penalties, are only meant to have a chilling  effect on providers, which will reduce access to safe and legal  abortion.   Do you know what? I have been saying this every time we have one of  these bills on the floor--the bills that are solutions in search of  problems. Here is what I have to say, Mr. Speaker, to my colleagues on  the other side of the aisle: If they truly want to reduce abortion in  this country, work with us on providing family planning and long-acting  birth control to everybody.    Abortion is at the lowest rate in history in this country, and the  reason is because States, like my State of Colorado, are providing  birth control to prevent unwanted pregnancies. We can do this on a  bipartisan basis, but, instead, my colleagues choose not to, and I  think that is a shame for every single woman and family in this  country.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I understand why my colleague on the other side of the  aisle doesn't want the President to be traveling to Pennsylvania. He  doesn't want him to be traveling, I am sure, to any battleground  States. It didn't work out very well for his party in 2016, when the  President, very effectively, did just that all over the country.   I would also say that it is brave for my colleague to read a tweet of  the President here on the House floor. I think the last time that the  two of us were here together, we discussed the fact that it was a tweet  from the President that scared his leadership away  [[Page H499]]  from a crucial meeting at the White House to negotiate the budget cap  deal, to negotiate exactly the deal that he is now so anxious to get  done.   I can assure you, Mr. Speaker, that work is underway. I can assure  you that we could have a deal right now today if--and I will repeat it  once again. I know my colleague is going to say that the Republicans  control the Senate. But he knows, and I know, Mr. Speaker, that the  rules of the Senate require 60 votes to get something done. That means  today that if Chuck Schumer and the Democrats in the Senate are  unwilling to agree to the cap deal, they are unwilling to provide the  resources that we need to fund the military, the resources to make sure  our men and women in uniform can defend the Nation, because they are  holding out, and they are holding that hostage over amnesty. We could  get it done today if they would be willing simply to come to the table  and compromise and stop holding our troops hostage.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from West Virginia  (Mr. Mooney).   Mr. MOONEY of West Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for  bringing this important bill to the floor.   We have heard it mentioned that, in 2002, in a bipartisan way, we  already have law that a baby born alive, at any stage of gestation, any  weeks of life, born alive, it is already illegal to kill the baby, and  that was a bipartisan bill; so I can understand why my friends on the  other side of the aisle want to keep changing the subject. Every vote  today should be for this bill.   We have already agreed that you have to save the lives of these  children. The problem is that we don't have strong enforcement  mechanisms. This bill provides enforcement mechanisms. This bill  specifies any medical care. This should be a unanimous vote.   That is what we need to talk about here today--in fact, life begins  at conception--to have laws that protect babies born alive. Now,  remember, these are babies who are born alive. There have been  questions about whether or not it happens.   Melissa Ohden, who testified in the Judiciary Committee a couple of  years ago, was a baby born alive. She started her own network, the  Abortion Survivors Network, where she has had contact with 203 other  abortion survivors.   Sometimes when they go in to start the abortion, they start the  treatments, the dilation, and the chemical treatments, the baby comes  out alive. I know people listening to this here today might believe  that this is a horror story and that this doesn't happen. It happens in  America.   We need to fight this, make it illegal, and pass this bill, so that  those babies are given the same protection as any other child who is  alive. This is a no-brainer. The only shame today is that when this  vote is cast later, if there are not 435 ``yes'' votes on that board  today, that should be the shame of this situation. These are live  babies. This is a no-brainer bill.   I am proud to represent the State of West Virginia, where respect for  human life is cherished. Every Member of this body should respect human  life. If it is already law, you should have no problem voting for it.  That is all the more reason to support the bill before us today.   The voters of this country have elected us to do the job of the pro- life majority. It is time we pass bills like this, and more bills like  this, so that we can show people we care about the unborn children.                                time  1315    Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Let me respond to the gentlewoman from Wyoming because I just want to  make sure I am clear here.   There are less than 35 hours left before the government shuts down. I  think that is a pretty big deal that should concern Republicans and  Democrats.   I want to be clear. I don't care if the President goes to  Pennsylvania. He can fly on his nice jet, enjoy lifestyles of the rich  and famous or whatever he does, and go anywhere he wants in this  country. I don't care where he travels to.   What we object to is the fact that this House is going to recess  during this critical time so that he can bring along a whole bunch of  Republican Members of Congress to be part of a political event at this  crucial moment when the government is about to shut down. I find that  astonishing.   The gentlewoman talks about how we owe it to the men and women in  uniform to make sure we support our military. Do you think our men and  women in uniform want us to take a break right now so that Republican  Members can join the President on his fancy jet and go to Pennsylvania  for a political rally? Is that where the priorities of this Republican  majority really are?   I guess it is a habit. The last time we almost had a shutdown, in  December, the Republicans took a break so that they could go to the  White House for a party to celebrate their tax bill.   I am sorry. I know a lot of Republicans in my district and across the  country who I don't think prioritize parties and political rallies over  us doing our business. Either postpone the political rally or have the  President go without Members of Congress. But the idea to recess until  after 7 at this crucial moment when so much is in the balance I find  just unbelievably beyond the pale.   Mr. Speaker, for months the majority has been holding the healthcare  of 9 million children and over 9 million individuals, including seniors  and pregnant women, hostage while they passed tax breaks for  millionaires and billionaires. Well, time is up. With each day that we  fail to act, our constituents face uncertain times. It is wrong.   Mr. Speaker, even President Trump says he agrees that we need to act  on CHIP. Just this morning he tweeted: ``CHIP should be part of a long- term solution, not a 30-day or a short-term extension.''   Well, here is the chance to stop playing politics with CHIP--and  community health centers as well--and do just that. If we defeat the  previous question, I will offer an amendment to the rule to bring up  Representative McEachin's bill, H.R. 4820, the Advancing Seniors and  Kids Act.   This bill would restore certainty and stability to so many of our  vulnerable citizens by responsibly addressing critical healthcare  priorities. It permanently reauthorizes CHIP; it reauthorizes community  health centers for 2 years; and it includes other vital healthcare  programs that provide relief to pregnant women, seniors, and many more.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Massachusetts?   There was no objection.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. McEachin) to discuss our proposal.   Mr. McEACHIN. Mr. Speaker, my Advancing Seniors and Kids Act would  permanently reauthorize CHIP, fund community health centers, prevent  damaging cuts to our safety net hospitals, and make other changes that  protect the health of children, seniors, and our most vulnerable  friends and neighbors.   For months, Congress has failed to act on these issues, and the  result has been completely avoidable pain and suffering. Right now,  Americans wake up every day and worry: How much longer will my child,  my family members have healthcare?   Mr. Speaker, we can take that fear away right now. Extending CHIP and  funding community health centers, these are commonsense policies with  bipartisan support. We should have passed clean extensions a long time  ago, but we can make amends right now.   We know that healthcare coverage saves lives. We know that CHIP  covers almost 9 million children. It is critically important that we do  the right thing. If we let CHIP lapse, if we do not protect hospitals  and community centers, there will be horrible consequences for families  across this country.   Today more Americans have coverage than ever before. Medical  bankruptcies are a lot less common than they were in the past. We are  making progress.   I am urging my colleagues to build on that progress and not to  abandon it.  [[Page H500]]  A solution is right here in front of us. I urge all of my colleagues to  vote ``no'' on the previous question and join me in supporting quality  and affordable healthcare for all Americans.    Mr. Speaker, if my colleague from Massachusetts is so  concerned about the government shutdown, about children's health, about  providing relief for healthcare, then I assume that he will be voting  ``yes'' for the CR that comes to the floor later today, which, in fact,  does extend CHIP, which, in fact, does help to provide relief from the  terrible medical device tax, and which will keep the government open. I  think that, if he wants to make sure that his objectives are met, there  is a simple solution to do that.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr.  Lamborn).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. LaMalfa).   Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, we are hearing a lot about how we can't do  two things at once around here. We have 435 Members of the House of  Representatives. We have multiple committees. There are negotiations  going on in other rooms right now, but there is no time to do this  important piece of legislation to stop infanticide in this country. It  is like, wow, can Members of Congress not walk and chew gum at the same  time?   I would invite my Democratic colleagues: Here, try some gum. We need  to do this.   This empowers nurses. This empowers those assistants who see  something that is terribly wrong with an abortion that went wrong and  they have a chance. Instead, they have to clandestinely sneak out that  surviving baby and take them somewhere else because they can't get the  care they need; they might get in trouble from their boss.   What kind of country is that? Why is this even a debate in a  civilized country in 2018 that you wouldn't do everything you can,  after the already difficult or bad decision on an abortion, that a baby  who survived, that we are not going to do everything we can to swoop it  away and help it survive? What are we talking about here? This is  unbelievable to me.   Mr. Speaker, we need to pass this legislation and empower those  nurses, empower those assistants who see what is wrong and allow them  to do the right thing.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Iowa  (Mr. King).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Iowa  (Mr. King).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Louisiana (Mr. Johnson).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Louisiana (Mr. Johnson).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Washington (Mr. Newhouse), my colleague on the Rules Committee.                                time  1330     Mr. Speaker, could I inquire how much time is left on  each side?   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from Wyoming has 4 minutes  remaining. The gentleman from Massachusetts has 3 minutes remaining.    Mr. Speaker, is the gentleman prepared to close?   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, as long as the gentlewoman doesn't have  any other speakers, I am prepared to close.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time to close.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, first of all, I want to say to all of my colleagues,  Democrats and Republicans, that this process is lousy. This is yet  another closed rule. The bill before us didn't even go through  committee. There was not a hearing. There was not a markup. It just  miraculously appeared right before an anti-choice rally, and here it  is, take it or leave it. That is not the way this place is supposed to  be run.   At some point, no matter what your ideology is, no matter what you  believe about some of these issues, you have to be for a more open  process, a more deliberative process. This diminishes the House of  Representatives. This is not what the people, I don't care what the  political party or ideology may be, want from their Congress. They want  a more open and transparent process.   Mr. Speaker, this bill before us, as I said before, is a sound bite.  It is going nowhere, but it has been introduced, and we are going to be  voting on it purely for political purposes.   Mr. Speaker, this morning, the majority whip announced: ``Upon  conclusion of debate on H.R. 195''--that is the CR--``the House will  recess until 7 p.m.''   Recess? I mean, recess? With all that is at stake, we are going to  recess?   This isn't a time for recess or a political rally.   Shame on Republicans who are delaying action in this House on moving  the process forward on a continuing resolution, to try to buy some time  to make it better, hopefully, so that it can earn bipartisan support.  Shame on them for going to a political rally instead of staying here  and doing their job.   This is the time to responsibly fund government. Those of us on the  Democratic side have a lot of issues with what the House leadership is  ramming through in terms of a CR. We were not part of that discussion.  We were not asked what our values are and what we think is important.  This is purely a product that the Republicans negotiated with  Republicans.   My hope is that we have time to make it better, but when you recess  until 7, not to make it better, not to negotiate, but so that  Republicans can go to a political rally, shame on you for doing that  with all that is at stake.   Our soldiers don't want us to recess. Those who depend on community  health centers don't want us to recess. Our veterans don't want us to  recess. Yet everybody's perfectly fine on the other side of the aisle  with taking a break; no big deal; no rush, nothing, as we get closer  and closer to this crisis.   At some point we need responsible leadership in this House, and that  begins with a return to regular order, a more open and transparent  process, a respect for the views of the minority, and it means  prioritizing the business of the American people.   I will say funding the government is more important than a political  rally in Pennsylvania.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I agree with my colleague on the other side of the aisle, my  colleague from Massachusetts. There is shameful action underway in this  Congress, and that shameful action is the fact that, I will say once  again, we are in a situation where our men and women in uniform have  not received the appropriations that they need to do the job that we  are asking them to do. And the reason they haven't--we have passed an  authorization bill through this body; we have passed an appropriations  bill through this body, but the Democrats in the Senate are refusing to  act. The Democrats in the Senate who hold the key to getting 60 votes  in the United States Senate are refusing to act. The reason they are  refusing to act, Mr. Speaker, is because they want amnesty for illegal  immigrants, and they are holding hostage the extent to which we are  able to provide resources to fund our men and women in uniform.   Mr. Speaker, there is a tremendous amount of urgency on both sides of  the aisle. I respect my colleague from Massachusetts and I respect his  frustration, but I do not respect, Mr. Speaker, the extent to which he  is accusing us of shameful behavior.   We are on this floor today talking about a bill that will protect  babies who are born alive after abortions. The shameful behavior is  that, on the other side of the aisle, they want to talk politics, they  want to talk posturing, they want to talk process. They don't want to  talk about babies who are born alive after abortion. I know why they  don't want to talk about it, because it is uncomfortable. They would  rather ignore that it is actually happening, but we can't ignore it.    Mr. Speaker, we have an obligation in this body to ensure that we  provide protection and care for those who cannot, for the most  vulnerable among us. Mr. Speaker, it is a moral obligation to ensure  the protection of every baby born alive.  [[Page H503]]    I am proud to be here today on behalf of the rule, Mr. Speaker, and I  urge adoption of both the rule and the underlying bill, H.R. 4712, so  we can continue to do what is right, what is morally required of us,  and that is to protect and nurture and make sure we have provided  safeguards for the unborn and for those who are born alive after  abortion.   The material previously referred to by Mr. McGovern is as follows:            An Amendment to H. Res. 694 Offered by Mr. McGovern         At the end of the resolution, add the following new       sections:        Sec. 4. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the       Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare       the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on       the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R.       4820) to extend funding for certain public health programs,       and for other purposes. The first reading of the bill shall       be dispensed with. All points of order against consideration       of the bill are waived. General debate shall be confined to       the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally divided among       and controlled by the respective chairs and ranking minority       members of the Committee on Ways and Means and the Committee       on Energy and Commerce. After general debate the bill shall       be considered for amendment under the five-minute rule. All       points of order against provisions in the bill are waived. At       the conclusion of consideration of the bill for amendment the       Committee shall rise and report the bill to the House with       such amendments as may have been adopted. The previous       question shall be considered as ordered on the bill and       amendments thereto to final passage without intervening       motion except one motion to recommit with or without       instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and reports       that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then on the       next legislative day the House shall, immediately after the       third daily order of business under clause 1 of rule XIV,       resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further       consideration of the bill.        Sec. 5. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 4820.                                   ____           The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a       vote about what the House should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to       a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to       yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first       recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no       substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''       But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the       Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in       the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,       page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous       question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally       not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member       controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the       motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the       time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering       the previous question. That Member, because he then controls       the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for       the purpose of amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on       Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further       debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:       ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a       resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control       shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous       question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who       controls the time for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools for those who oppose the Republican       majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the       opportunity to offer an alternative plan.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous  question.   The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that  the ayes appeared to have it.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further  proceedings on this question will be postponed.                            ____________________
