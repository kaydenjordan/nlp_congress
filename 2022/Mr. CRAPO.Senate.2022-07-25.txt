 Mr. President, I honor Jared Don Ricker, of  Caldwell, ID, who passed away unexpectedly on June 12, 2022, at the far  too young age of 42. He is deeply missed by his family and many friends  and remembered as a wonderful man, great father, kind listener, and fun  companion.   I came to know of Jared through two of his three brothers, Bryan and  Cameron, who have both served as members of my staff. Bryan represented  me as a regional director for southwest Idaho. Cameron is chief clerk  of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, a  position he served in when I was chairman of the committee. I extend my  deep condolences to Jared's many loved ones, who include his wife  Brianna Lynn and four children: Jackson Don, Brice Laney, Campbell Zoe,  and Collins Bree. My prayers for God's comfort are also with Jared's  parents, Don and Peggy, as they mourn the loss of their son, Jared's  other brother, Chase, and Jared's many other family members and  friends.   Jared, who was born on February 8, 1980, and graduated from Nampa  High School, was a fellow Eagle Scout. He shared this proud achievement  with his son, Jackson. Jared also served a mission for the Church of  Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Columbus, OH. After returning from  his mission, he met and married the love of his life Bri, and they made  a beautiful family together. He earned his associate degree in  multimedia and worked with his employer of 15 years, Iliad Media Group,  as the IT director and supporting engineer.   Jared shared his love and laughs generously with his family, friends,  coworkers, and all those who were blessed to be a part of his life. He  was a fun-loving and deeply caring father, husband, son, brother,  uncle, son-in-law, brother-in-law, and friend. He loved his children  dearly, their passions and talents, and he loved serving others,  sharing the gospel and making connections. His obituary movingly notes,  ``He showed his love by filling your soul and your belly . . . Jared  almost always had a smile on his face. Everyone was a friend to him. He  left anyone he met a better person.'' Those who knew him recall his  kindness, generosity, and humor. Jared is remembered as a great  listener with a heart of gold.   We are so fortunate to have had Jared's light glow so brightly in our  world. My heart goes out to all those who loved him, as we honor his  life, mourn his loss, and cherish his loving memory.                            ____________________
