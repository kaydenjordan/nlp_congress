 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the subject of my Special Order.    Madam Speaker, our Nation is gripped by mounting  crises, spurred by the failed policies of the Biden administration and  congressional Democrats.   While Americans are hurting from the rising prices caused by  inflation, a porous and open border, and a supply chain that is hurting  every part of the American economy, it is critical that we remember and  refocus on the fundamental values that have made our country great,  starting with the right to life.   For me, this is an incredibly personal issue, like it is for millions  of Americans with deeply held beliefs and personal experiences. I,  myself, have shared my story on this very floor, that I shouldn't even  be standing here, that my mother was urged to abort me. I was not  wanted. I was unexpected and I was given very little chance to survive.  And yet, here I am. Again, this speaks to the miracle of life.   We have the opportunity, brought on by the Dobbs v. Jackson case  presented before the Supreme Court to chart a new course for our Nation  so that every unborn child has the right to life and the opportunity  that it holds while living in America.   Roe v. Wade has cost the lives of millions of American children, but  what we have is the remarkable opportunity to make it right today.  Today is the turning point.   Madam Speaker, I am proud to join dozens of my Republican colleagues  to voice our support and stand for those most vulnerable, the unborn.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr.  Fortenberry), my colleague, a pro-life champion.    Madam Speaker, I thank my good friend and colleague. We  do have an important opportunity here, and I am so pleased to have such  an overwhelming number of colleagues here today to talk about and share  their journey and their support on this issue.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Oklahoma (Mrs. Bice),  my friend and colleague, to talk about another pressing issue that has  impacted American families across the country.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Oklahoma,  my good friend. I thank her for talking about an issue that impacts  everyday Americans, but also an issue that has absolutely hit the homes  of every American, and particularly those that are working class.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Tennessee (Mrs.  Harshbarger).    Madam Speaker, I thank my friend and colleague from the  great State of Tennessee.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.  Meuser), as he is going to talk about another issue that is front and  center today that is really hitting the pocketbooks of everyday  Americans.    Madam Speaker, it is almost like my colleague makes too  much sense when it comes to the issue of energy production and  protecting our critical domestic energy supply.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Florida ( Madam Speaker, I thank my friend and colleague from the  Sunshine State. These are incredibly important points about the  economy. We are seeing over and over, example after example the  failures of this administration and how it is impacting working-class  families.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Van  Drew), my friend and colleague.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New Jersey.  Again, he hits on points that just make too much sense. We know that  the so-called Build Back Better bill does nothing more than build the  bureaucracy, the same bureaucracy that is strangling everyday Americans  and keeping them from prosperity.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Sessions), my  friend and colleague.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for sharing his  deeply personal experience, that means the world. I know that  constituents and Americans hear your message and respect and appreciate  it.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Rose), my  friend and colleague. I believe we share a common county in Putnam  County. We both get the privilege of representing a wonderful county  called Putnam County, even though they are in two different States.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Tennessee for  his remarks.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from the great State of  Tennessee (Mr. Burchett), who is my good friend and colleague.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Tennessee for  his remarks. They are very important points that he made, and I  encourage everyone to watch his speech repeatedly on YouTube once they  post it.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith),  who is my friend and fellow cochair of  [[Page H6842]]  the Pro-Life Caucus. Representative Smith is a true pro-life champion.    Madam Speaker, I thank my friend and colleague from the  great State of New Jersey for his beautiful comments.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from West Virginia (Mr.  McKinley).    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from the great  State of West Virginia for his words.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from the great State of  Illinois (Mrs. Miller).    Madam Speaker, I thank my friend and colleague from  Illinois for her comments.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.  Keller).    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his remarks  and for continuing to be a champion for pro-life and the unborn.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Carter).    Madam Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman from  Georgia's remarks.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Bilirakis),  who is my friend and colleague, to talk about how he is a champion for  life and why it is so important.    Madam Speaker, I thank my fellow Floridian and champion  for life, Representative Bilirakis.   I yield to the gentleman from the great State of Texas (Mr. Pfluger),  my friend and champion for life.    Madam Speaker, I thank my friend and colleague from the  great State of Texas for his comments.   I yield to the gentlewoman from Indiana (Mrs. Walorski), one of my  favorite Hoosiers.    Amen. I thank my friend and colleague from Indiana for  her comments.   At this time, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Babin), my  friend, colleague, and champion for life.    Madam Speaker, I thank my friend and colleague from  Texas for participating.   At this time, I yield to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Good), my  friend, colleague, and fellow champion for life.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Virginia for  his passion and testimony. It is truly moving.   I yield to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Cline), my friend and  colleague.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for all the work  that he has done to protect life.   At this time, I yield to the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. Feenstra), a  true champion for life.    Madam Speaker, I thank my friend and colleague from the  great State of Iowa for his comments.   I can't tell you how encouraging it is to hear so many of my  colleagues fight and stand for life, but I can say with certainty that  there is probably no one who has fought harder than Representative  Hartzler for not just life but our values. I can't thank the  gentlewoman enough for her work.   I yield to the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. Hartzler).    Madam Speaker, I thank my dear friend and colleague so  much. I am so proud of the work that she has done to advance not just  our pro-life cause, but also American values. I thank the gentlewoman  for her tireless work.   At this time, I yield to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Grothman),  my friend, colleague, and another pro-life champion, even though he is,  affectionately, my favorite cheesehead.    Madam Speaker, I thank my friend and colleague from the  great State of Wisconsin for those words.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Weber), a  pro-life champion and voice for the unborn.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas for his  powerful remarks.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Clyde), my  good friend and fellow champion for life.    Madam Speaker, I thank my friend and colleague from the  great State of Georgia.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Crawford),  another pro-life champion, an incredible Member of Congress, and a  friend.    Madam Speaker, I thank my friend and colleague for his  remarks.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gohmert), a  friend, colleague, and a long-time pro-life champion.    Madam Speaker, I thank my great friend and colleague  from Texas. I appreciate his continued work and efforts on this very  important issue.   Madam Speaker, I think it is very fitting that as we close out  tonight's Special Order that started with the youngest Republican woman  in Congress, that we end with the youngest Republican man. Our  generation continues to fight for the pro-life movement, and we believe  that we will be the generation that ends abortion.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr.  Cawthorn), my friend and colleague.    Madam Speaker, I thank my friend and colleague from the  great State of North Carolina. I am proud to be a representative  alongside him as the pro-life generation.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
