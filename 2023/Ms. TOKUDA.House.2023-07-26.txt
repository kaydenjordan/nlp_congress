 Mr. Speaker, since my first day in Congress, access to  quality, affordable healthcare and mental health services has been  among my top priorities.   I represent one of the most rural and remote districts in the  country. I have seen and heard firsthand the devastating consequences  of inadequate access to care.   On Molokai, a constituent shared with me the weight and pain she felt  over the loss of her daughter. The treatment and end-of-life care her  daughter needed wasn't available on island, so she was forced to leave  her children and family behind and tragically passed away without them  by her side.   On Lana'i, a kupuna sat me down and said: ``I love living here . . .  but it is a difficult place to be born and to die.'' If you need  obstetric care, assisted living, or end-of-life care, you have to board  a plane, most often alone.   In Wai'anae, a close friend and community leader held up a CDC report  in his hand and expressed his anger and frustration that the life  expectancy of residents living on the rural west side of O'ahu was a  decade less than those living in downtown Honolulu.   In the small, close-knit community of Kauai, too many people have a  family member or friend who took their own life. With limited access to  mental health professionals and services, our Garden Isle has  historically struggled with high rates of suicide and suicide attempts.   In Kona, on the Big Island of Hawaii, a woman cried as she told me  that her sister died because she couldn't get the emergency care she  needed in time. She then asked me if I knew what the golden hour was,  that critical window of time between emergency medical care and a  medical trauma happening.   I told her I did. My mother missed hers. She was in a car accident,  and the hospital in our community didn't have the appropriate trauma  services to deal with her injuries, so she was taken to the next town,  where she passed away shortly after getting to the ER.   For many of my constituents, they are just one diagnosis away from a  major illness and the impossible financial and family decisions that  will come with it. Yet, they live in geographically isolated areas-- their homes, where they continue to be denied their right to  healthcare.   While Hawaii's geography and demographic makeup are, in fact, unique,  these barriers to healthcare are similarly felt elsewhere across the  country.   More than 60 million Americans, one-fifth of the United States  population, live in rural areas. Compared with their urban  counterparts, rural Americans are generally older and have less  resources and poorer healthcare conditions.   While they may require more medical attention and care, rural  Americans often have more limited access to care as a result of  physician shortages, lack of reliable transportation options,  insufficient health insurance coverage, and increased exposure to  environmental and occupational hazards.   These disparities in healthcare access highlight the need for greater  attention and resources aimed at improving healthcare and outcomes in  rural and remote communities.   That is why I am proud to co-lead the Bipartisan Rural Health Caucus.  Together with the gentlewoman from Tennessee (Mrs. Harshbarger), we  have revived this bipartisan coalition to ensure every American, no  matter their ZIP Code or circumstances, has access to the care that  could literally save their lives.    When it comes to my hope for rural healthcare, it comes down to the  four As.   Accessibility: The distance a patient must travel by car, plane, or  ferry to receive medical services;   Affordability: The cost for a patient to get the care they need;   Acceptability: The extent to which a patient receives culturally and  linguistically appropriate services in healthcare; and   Availability: The extent to which providers have the requisite  resources, such as personnel and technology, to meet the individual  needs of patients.   In a time of such deep divisions in our country and Congress, we must  find ways to come together to recognize the urgent needs of our  constituents and do better for all of our people.   The Bipartisan Rural Health Caucus will look beyond the partisan  gridlock of Washington to tackle the rural healthcare crisis in the  United States.   From the pristine, sandy beaches of Hawaii to the Great Smoky  Mountains of Tennessee, rural Americans are asking Congress to step up  and take meaningful action to save their hospitals and clinics, address  health inequities, strengthen their healthcare workforce pipeline,  ensure fair and adequate reimbursement for providers, and reduce  healthcare costs.   For the health and well-being of all of our people, I invite my  colleagues to join us in this movement to enhance access and delivery  of healthcare and mental health services for rural and remote  communities throughout our country.                            ____________________
