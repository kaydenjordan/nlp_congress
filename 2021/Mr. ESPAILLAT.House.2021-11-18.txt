 Madam Speaker, I rise today to commend my colleagues  for acting to tackle the climate crisis. Under President Biden's  leadership, we are celebrating America's efforts to combat our world's  largest existential threat: global warming.   Last week, Speaker Pelosi led a diverse group of House Democrats to  Glasgow, Scotland. I was part of that group, the COP 26 conference, and  our message was clear. The U.S. is proud to be back in the Paris  Agreement and will continue to demonstrate our commitment to reach net- zero emissions.   Our commitment was met by action, not only with the agreements that  were struck during the conference, but also the sound policies included  in the Build Back Better Act. The framework's $555 billion investment  represents the largest single investment in our clean energy economy in  history. This includes buildings, transportation, industry,  electricity, agriculture, and climate-smart practices across lands and  waters.   As an environmental justice policy, the Justice40 acknowledges  decades of environmental burdens on Black, Brown, and indigenous  communities. Upholding this policy is vital to guarantee that  communities that have weathered the costs of climate change finally  receive commonsense human rights.   Let's build back better. Let's build back green.                            ____________________
