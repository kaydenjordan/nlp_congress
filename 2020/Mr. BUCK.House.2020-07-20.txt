 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of amendment No. 58  to the National Defense Authorization Act and to alert America to a  serious national security threat.   The Chinese Communist Party is using TikTok to collect massive  amounts of data from American citizens and our government that could be  used in a cyberattack against our Republic.   We must take action to protect our Nation and stop the Chinese  Communist Party's efforts to undermine our national security. That  starts by passing my commonsense amendment to ban TikTok on all  government-issued technology devices. The clock is ticking.   Madam Speaker, I urge adoption of the amendment.
