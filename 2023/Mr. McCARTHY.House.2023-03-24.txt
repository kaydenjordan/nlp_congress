 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5, the  Parents Bill of Rights Act. House Republicans made a commitment to  America that we would bring up the Parents Bill of Rights Act. Today,  we are keeping that promise.   The numbers speak for themselves. In the 1 month since the Parents  Bill of Rights Act was introduced, thousands of parents have signed on  to it. This massive surge of support proves that parents want more of a  say in their children's education. President Biden's Secretary of  Education recently said parents are missing in action. He is just  wrong.   Parents are more motivated than ever, and they want us to take  action. The bill before us today is about every mom, every dad, and,  most importantly, every student in America.   We believe parents should be able to know what your children are  learning, how your tax dollars are being spent, and whether your child  is safe in school. That is exactly what the Parents Bill of Rights Act  does.   When we introduced the Parents Bill of Rights Act, we numbered it  H.R. 5. There is an important reason why. That is the age that children  start kindergarten.   Also, this bill protects five important parental rights.   One, the right to know what is being taught in schools and to see the  reading materials. No one is arguing that parents should dictate what  is being taught, but parents should be able to see their school's  curriculum publicly, know what books are in the library, and get timely  notice about any plans to eliminate gifted and talented programs.   Two, the right to be heard. We saw Biden's Justice Department lash  out at concerned parents and label them domestic terrorists. Parents  should be allowed to address school board meetings, have their First  Amendment rights respected, and have a say in their children's  education.   Third, the right to see a school's budget and how your tax dollars  are being spent.   Four, the right to protect your children's privacy. Parents should be  able to control how any third party uses their children's personal  data.   Fifth, the right to be updated on any violent activity at school. If  there is violence at school, parents deserve to know.    Mr. Speaker, it doesn't matter the color of your skin, the ZIP Code  you live in, or the wealth you have. Once you are a parent, you will  give your life for your child.   You have a right to get basic information about your children's  education, and with the Parents Bill of Rights Act, you will have that.   The Parents Bill of Rights Act is an important step toward protecting  children and dramatically strengthening the rights of parents.   Mr. Speaker, in America, education is the great equalizer. Every  child deserves a great education. We know that if parents are  empowered, students will succeed.   For that reason, I urge all of my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R.  5, the Parents Bill of Rights Act.                            ____________________
