 Senator, if confirmed, I will certainly be very       vigilant.         The individuals with whom I work in the       department will ensure that federal moneys are used properly       and appropriately.         I want to make sure we don't have problems with       that as well. If confirmed, I will work diligently to ensure       that we are addressing any of those issues.         Senator, I will commit to ensuring that       institutions which receive federal funds are actually serving       their students well.         We will certainly review that rule.        Again, this goes back to somebody who is kind of walking       into a hearing saying: Look, I got the vote. I don't have to       learn about public education. I don't have to listen to       Democrats' concerns. I don't have to listen to teachers'       concerns or students' concerns or the concerns of experts in       education. I don't have to learn about higher education,       which is, by money spent, about three-quarters of the U.S.       Department of Education.         And see that it is actually achieving what the       intentions are.         Senator, thank you for that question. I agree       with you that sexual assault in any form or in any place is a       problem.         Senator, I know that there's a lot of       conflicting ideas and opinions around that guidance, and if       confirmed I would work with you.    And so on.   My concerns about Mrs. DeVos go to policy, to preparation, but most  of all to a basic understanding of what public education is about. It  goes to a basic commitment to the mission of public education.   Every Senator's office has phones ringing off the hook with people  telling us that Mrs. DeVos is not the right choice. So, to my  Republican colleagues, you don't have to take my word for it; you don't  have to take the word of the other 49 Senators who know that Mrs. DeVos  will not be the leader of the Department of Education that we all need.  You only have to take the word of the people in your own State and the  groups whom we look to and trust when it comes to our country's  education system. These are the people whom we are here to serve. They  are the parents, the grandparents, the teachers, the faculty, the  school board members, and the students who count on us to make the  right decision.   We may not agree on who would make the perfect Secretary of  Education, but we can agree that people across the country are speaking  out against Mrs. DeVos, and it is up to us to listen. I will be voting  no on her nomination, and I ask Republicans to follow the advice of  their constituents and join me.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
