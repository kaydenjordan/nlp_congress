 Madam Speaker, when I was 18 years old, I joined the  United States Navy and took the oath to support and defend the  Constitution for the first time. I took that oath again earlier this  year as a Member of Congress; and every day I work hard to live by that  oath and give the 39th District the representation it deserves.   I have always maintained that impeachment is a serious undertaking  and must be done with incredible care. When the unprecedented  allegations against the President and his interactions with Ukraine  were first reported, I felt that it was Congress' duty to investigate  and find out the truth.   Now the facts are before Congress and the American people. The  President betrayed his oath to support and defend the Constitution by  attempting to undermine the integrity of our election for his own  personal benefit. He asked a foreign government to investigate a  political rival and endangered our national security by withholding  military aid to an ally.   For me, it is not about personal politics or party affiliation. It is  about upholding my oath to put our country and our Constitution first  and protect our national security. This is why I will vote to move  forward with the impeachment of the President. I hope all my colleagues  will join me in recognizing this grave threat and stand up to this  administration in defense of our country and our Constitution.
