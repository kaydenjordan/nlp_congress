 DAVIS of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong  support of passage of H.R. 5665, and commend its sponsor,  Representative Omar, and my colleague from Illinois, Representative  Schakowsky, for its introduction.   I was taught early in life to accentuate the positive, eliminate the  negative, and don't mess around with Mister-In-Between.   This resolution reaffirms many of the principles in practice that we  have been taught and learned that religion is sacrosanct, that religion  is sacred, and every person deserves to have their religious thoughts,  ideas, and ideology protected.   I urge support and passage of this legislation.
