 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to Congressman  John Lewis on the 56th anniversary of the Bloody Sunday March.   Congressman Lewis spent more than 30 years in Congress, marched with  Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and fought for racial equality across the  country during his storied and historic life. The civil rights icon  died on July 17, 2020, after a tragic fight with cancer.   It was a devastating loss for me and our entire country. Congressman  Lewis was such a great fighter for the right thing in our nation. With  his passing, I lost one of my fathers on the floor of the House. He was  a colleague of my father, Congressman Donald M. Payne, Sr. and one of  the men who inspired me to run for office. I was in awe of how he could  convey such power and strength with a gentle demeanor. His passion and  love for his country and people brought out a ferociousness in such a  mild-mannered man. He didn't just speak for civil rights, he stood up  against abuse and suffered for it to make this country better for all  Americans.   I learned so much from him and his leadership was evident in hundreds  of actions in and out of the U.S. House of Representatives. One of my  greatest honors happened when we held a `sit-in' on the floor of the  House in 2016 to try and get a vote on gun control legislation after 49  people died during a shooting at a nightclub in Orlando, FL. It was his  drive and dedication that inspired me and so many of my colleagues to  join him that day. There were so many situations like that I could  mention. Congressman Lewis always said it was important to `get into  good trouble' and those words have inspired me to this day. He was a  hero, a mentor, a leader, and a great, great friend.                            ____________________
