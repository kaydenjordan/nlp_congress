 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Louisiana for  doing this and for yielding and for all of his good work.   Madam Speaker, I rise today, a week before one of America's oldest,  most deeply rooted holidays, ashamed of what this administration is  doing to our great United States of America. American families look  forward to a Thanksgiving feast where they are finally able to see  distant relatives, reflect on their lives and, of course, share  [[Page H6352]]  a table covered in food made from old family recipes.    Yet, this year, families aren't thinking about that. They are not  thinking about what they will cook, but rather, how they will afford a  Thanksgiving meal. Turkey prices are up 18 percent. Pumpkin pie is up  17 percent. Carrots, strangely enough, up 50 percent. Some families  might not even have to worry about these rising food costs because they  might not be able to travel to see their families due to soaring gas  prices. A gallon of gas is up 61 percent, on average. If they are able  to travel despite the price increases, they may enter a frigid home, as  the cost to heat our homes has increased by 54 percent.   The root cause of these price increases is no big secret to anyone.  They are the direct result of failed Biden policies. Policies that have  led to rampant inflation, a crippled supply chain, and labor shortages  on a scale that we never would have ever imagined.   Despite recent comments made by this administration and the media,  inflation is a bad, bad thing. Buying a home? More expensive. Building  a home? More expensive. Renting an apartment? More expensive. Gas,  groceries, turkeys, and presents, more expensive. This is the Biden  Thanksgiving tax.   Americans deserve a joyous Thanksgiving after the suffering our  Nation has endured over the past 2 years. And this administration is on  track to be known as the grinch who not only stole Christmas, but the  grinch that stole Thanksgiving as well.
