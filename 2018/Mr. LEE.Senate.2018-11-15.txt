 Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to honor the  extraordinary life and service of Utah Army National Guard MAJ Brent  Taylor. Major Taylor gave the ultimate sacrifice on November 3, 2018,  while deployed to Afghanistan. He is survived by his wife Jennie and  his seven children Megan, Lincoln, Alex, Jacob, Ellie, Jonathan, and  Caroline, to whom he was a devoted husband and father.   Major Taylor's record of service demonstrates his willingness to go  above and beyond the call of duty to both his country and the State of  Utah. He joined the Utah Army National Guard in 2003 and received a  commission as a second lieutenant from the Brigham Young University  Reserve Officer Training Corps in 2006. He distinguished himself in  multiple specialties with the Utah National Guard, including  intelligence and military police.   Major Taylor was continuously ready to take up the call to arms and  deployed four times on missions to Iraq and Afghanistan. He held a  variety of roles, including platoon leader, combat adviser, and chief  of staff to the Special Operations Advisory Group. Throughout his tours  of service, Major Taylor received several awards for his courage,  sacrifice, and leadership; he received a Bronze Star in honor of his  ability to calmly and safely lead his men through miles of treacherous  territory and a Purple Heart for wounds received during an IED attack  on his vehicle.   His love of his State and his country was also evident beyond the  uniform. Major Taylor gave his time and energy to his community,  serving tirelessly as a member of the North Ogden City Council from  2010-2013 and as mayor of North Ogden after being elected in 2013. He  was a known to be a hands-on leader, attentive to and beloved by his  community.   Last Christmas morning, when snow had fallen all night, Brent was  with his city employees plowing roads, so that other families could  safely celebrate together and these friends could get home to theirs.  He stood as an example to me by continually representing how to best  serve your fellow man. For him, service was the best way to show  discipleship to God.   After being reelected in 2017, he took a leave of absence from the  mayor's office in 2018 and headed back to the battlefield, deploying to  Afghanistan. When he announced his leave of absence to the people of  North Ogden City before departing for Afghanistan, Major Taylor told  them that he felt called to serve his country there and that ``service  is what leadership is all about.'' At that time, I presented a flag to  Major Taylor and expressed my gratitude for ``Utahns who carry our flag  into harm's way for the cause of freedom.'' I pray it was a reminder to  him of the love and support our State has for him. I am confident that  he stood as an example of the best our flag represents every day of his  deployment.   Following Major Taylor's tragic passing, Major Abdul Rahmani, an  Afghani pilot with whom he worked, sent a letter to Major Taylor's wife  describing the great impact of his life; in his words, he was a  ``loving, caring, and compassionate man whose life was not just  meaningful, it was inspirational . . . he died on our soil but he died  for the success of freedom and democracy in both of our countries.''  Not only that, but Major Taylor exemplified to him the importance of  family: ``Your husband taught me to love my wife  [[Page S7045]]  Hamida as an equal and to treat my children as treasured gifts, to be a  better father, to be a better husband, and to be a better man.''   While meeting with Jennie and their children this last week, I was  deeply moved to hear story after story about this great Utahn. These  stories held consistent themes of family, faith, patriotism, and  service. His legacy will continue to bless countless people and will  continue to encourage and inspire me.   To honor his life and memory, a group of friends, law enforcement  officials, and volunteers gathered to carry an American flag to display  in Coldwater Canyon on Veterans Day. Members of the North Ogden  community and Utahns across the State have all come together to  commemorate his life, as is only fitting.   Major Taylor's life will be remembered as an embodiment of courage,  sacrifice, and service and love of God, family, and country. It is my  privilege to honor him today and to call him friend.   Thank you.                            ____________________
