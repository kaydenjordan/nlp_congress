 Mr. Speaker, I rise today, just days after the 22nd  anniversary of September 11, 2001, to recognize and remember former  chief, Ronald Nurnberger, Sr.   He was a member of the Island Park Fire Department, the same  department that I serve, for over 40 years. He joined the department in  1977 and served as chief of department from 2001 to 2002.   Just hours after the attacks on our great Nation on September 11,  Chief Ronald Nurnberger led a delegation from the Island Park Fire  Department to Ground Zero, where he served and  [[Page H4305]]  dug on that pile looking for survivors in the days that followed the  attack.   Less than a year ago, he was diagnosed with 9/11-related cancer, and  just hours before September 11, 2023, Ex-Chief Nurnberger passed away  from cancer he developed from operating on the pile on September 11.   He is another example as to why Members of this body and our  colleagues on the other side of the Capitol must continue to fight for  funding. There is no reason why 22 years later we still have survivors  walking the Halls of Congress each and every year asking for money to  support the issues that they are facing with health.   Ex-Chief Nurnberger leaves behind a loving wife, Sherrill; his  children, who are also now part of the fire service, Ronald Jr.,  Brandon, Karlton, Collin, Stephen, and John-Paul; and, of course,  grandchildren, Jameson, Lucas, Cody, Blakely, Brooke, and Noah.   Ex-Chief Nurnberger served the Island Park Fire Department and the  village of Island Park for over 40 years, and I was lucky enough to  call him a friend for the last 26 years.   Again, I rise today to remember and reflect upon a life gone too  soon, another victim of the attacks on this great Nation on September  11, 2001. Ex-chief Nurnberger has answered his final alarm, and I pray  that he rests easy.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, due to unforeseen circumstances, I was  unable to participate in voting.
