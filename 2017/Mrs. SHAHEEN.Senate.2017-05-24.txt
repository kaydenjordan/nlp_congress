 Mr. President, I am deeply concerned by warnings from  leading health insurance companies and State insurance commissioners  that the Trump administration is now deliberately undermining the  Affordable Care Act, leaving insurance plans no choice but to sharply  raise premiums or exit the marketplaces.   I understand--I think we all do--that the Affordable Care Act  continues to experience stresses and that it needs to be strengthened.  There is no doubt about that. I have been saying from the beginning  that we need to correct what is not working, that we need to keep what  is working, and that we need to work together to change it. Yet, in  2016, there were abundant signs that the law was working and that  insurance markets were stabilizing.   For instance, in my State of New Hampshire, health insurance premium  increases last year averaged just 2 percent. That is the lowest annual  increase in history. Today, it is a very different picture. Because of  the efforts of the Trump administration to undermine the Affordable  Care Act, insurance companies in New Hampshire and across the country  face widespread uncertainty. Many of them are deciding that they have  no choice but to protect themselves by drastically increasing premiums.   This week, there was a report in the New Hampshire Union Leader,  which is our State's largest newspaper, that premiums in New Hampshire  could increase by as much as 44 percent. Now, President Trump says that  the Affordable Care Act is ``exploding,'' but let's be clear. If  ObamaCare is exploding, as President Trump says, it is because this  administration lit the fuse and has been working aggressively to  undermine the law.   We can see on this poster what is being reported in other parts of  the country. In the LA Times, we see that health insurers and State  officials say that Trump is undermining ObamaCare and pushing up rates  and that health insurers plan big ObamaCare rate hikes, and they blame  Trump.   Perhaps the greatest damage has been done by the administration's  refusal to commit to funding cost-sharing subsidies, which are the  Federal subsidies that help millions of people pay for coverage. To  protect themselves, many insurance companies are preparing two sets of  premiums for next year--one premium level if the administration agrees  to fund the cost-sharing subsidies and a second, dramatically higher  premium level if the administration says no to cost-sharing subsidies.   More broadly, the administration's mixed signals and erratic  management of the Affordable Care Act are causing uncertainty in the  marketplace. Paul Markovich, the CEO of Blue Shield of  [[Page S3125]]  California, has said that health plans are being forced to raise  premiums to compensate for all of the turmoil.   It gets worse.   Last week, the Los Angeles Times reported that Seema Verma, the  Administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services,  shocked a meeting of insurance industry executives by threatening to  cut off funding for cost-sharing reductions unless insurers agreed to  support the House Republicans' bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act-- the bill that was passed several weeks ago.   Washington State Insurance Commissioner Mike Kreidler criticized the  administration's actions as playing Russian roulette with Americans'  health insurance coverage. He said: ``This has real impact on people's  lives.''   One insurance company executive said this about the administration's  actions: ``There's a sense that there are no hands on the wheel, and  they are just letting the bus careen down the road.''   Physicians and other healthcare professionals live by a time-honored  pledge to do no harm, but the Trump administration is pursuing a course  that will do tremendous harm to millions of Americans who have gained  health coverage for the first time because of the Affordable Care Act.  Unless and until Congress repeals the Affordable Care Act, it is the  law of the land, and this administration has a responsibility to  administer this law with fairness, with rigor, and with competence. The  administration certainly does not have the right to take active steps  to undermine or even sabotage the law or to threaten insurance  companies with such steps if they do not support the repeal of  ObamaCare.   It is time for the administration to reconsider its approach to  healthcare reform. To date, regrettably, the administration's approach  has been highly partisan, with no outreach to Democrats. Instead of a  ``do no harm'' approach, instead of taking steps to fill President  Trump's pledge that we are going to have insurance for everybody--and  he came through New Hampshire on multiple occasions during his primary  campaign and during the general election campaign. What he said about  health insurance was that we were going to make sure that everybody has  it; we are going to make sure that they pay less and that they get  quality coverage. The administration now seems determined to take  health coverage away from tens of millions of Americans.   The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the House Republicans'  bill--the first one--to repeal the Affordable Care Act would take  coverage away from 24 million Americans. Yesterday, the administration  proposed a budget that would cut Medicaid by as much as $1.3 trillion  over the next decade. That would end coverage for millions of low- income Americans, people with disabilities, and so many of our elderly  in nursing homes. In New Hampshire, where we are really on the  frontlines of the heroin and opioid epidemic, it would end treatment  for many people who are getting treatment for their substance use  disorders because of the expansion of Medicaid.   When we think about the people who would be hurt by this, it is  unconscionable to hear Office of Management and Budget Director Mick  Mulvaney say: ``There is a certain philosophy wrapped up in the budget,  and that is that we are no longer going to measure compassion by the  number of programs or the number of people on those programs.'' I  disagree with that view. By deliberately taking healthcare coverage  from 24 million Americans, it shows the lack of compassion of this  administration.   This is not about numbers. He is right about that. This should not be  about numbers. This should be about people, about their families, and  about what these proposals will do to everyday Americans who will no  longer have access to affordable health coverage. Whether they have  preexisting conditions or whether they need to get treatment for  cancer, for substance use disorders, or for whatever their healthcare  needs are, under this proposal, they are not going to be able to afford  it. Millions of Americans will not be able to afford it.   I think there is a better way forward. Instead of tearing down the  Affordable Care Act and taking health coverage away from people, we  should be building on the gains and on the achievements of healthcare  reform.   On that score, I want to share an extraordinary letter to the editor  that was written by Carol Gulla, of Newmarket, NH.   I am reading her letter:         I was in good health; why bother with a physical?        That was my mentality for years before the Affordable Care       Act (aka Obamacare). I work for a small nonprofit business,       so we don't qualify for group health insurance plans. An       annual physical wasn't included in the high premium, high       deductible plans that were available to me on the individual       health insurance market so they were often a luxury. But it       was OK; I felt great! Why bother with doctors?        Because of the Affordable Care Act, last June I went for a       routine physical. During [the exam] a lump was discovered in       my breast. Ten days later, breast cancer was diagnosed. . . .       Fast forward to today. I've just completed my final       chemotherapy treatment and my prognosis is very positive.       That physical saved my life.        Let me restate that--Obamacare saved my life.        That crucial physical in June would not have happened had       it not been an essential preventive service included in all       health plans under the ACA. While not perfect, my insurance       through the ACA is far better than anything available to me       as an individual in the past.    Ms. Gulla's letter continues:         Up until this point I have been pretty quiet about my       diagnosis simply because I didn't want cancer to be the main       topic of every conversation I had. But, with the Republican       majority in Washington, including Secretary of Health & Human       Services Tom Price, promising to repeal the ACA, being quiet       is no longer an option. I am being asked to entrust my health       and well-being to hollow promises of it will ``be replaced by       something better; it will be great.'' Forgive me if I'm       skeptical!        This is my life we're talking about! Do not tell me to be       patient. Do not tell me to ``wait and see.'' Either outline a       . . . plan for improving the Affordable Care Act, or leave my       health insurance alone!    She signs it with her name, Carol Gulla, of Newmarket, NH.   I think we need to listen to Carol and to so many other people like  her all across America.   Instead of allowing this administration to undermine and even  sabotage the Affordable Care Act, we in the Senate need to work  together, Democrats and Republicans, to strengthen the parts of the  Affordable Care Act that are working in the real world, including  Medicaid expansion, and to fix what is not working. According to  multiple recent polls that I have seen on this issue, this is what the  great majority of Americans want us to do. It is time for us to listen  to the American people.   The Affordable Care Act has had a profoundly positive impact all  across America, but it needs commonsense repairs and it needs  strengthening. Mend it, don't end it, and certainly don't sabotage it.  This should be a bipartisan focus in the Senate. I intend to do  everything I can to encourage such a bipartisan effort. I know my  colleagues on both sides of the aisle would be willing to do this  important work if they understood how much the American people want to  see us do this.   We know that the Affordable Care Act has had positive impacts in each  of our States, including giving people peace of mind, knowing they  can't be denied coverage based on preexisting conditions. So let's work  together. Let's ensure that the Affordable Care Act works even better  in the future for all Americans.   Thank you, Mr. President.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.    Mr. President, will my colleague yield for a question?    Mr. President, will my colleague yield for a question?    Mr. President, will my colleague yield for a question?    Mr. President, will my colleague yield for a question?    Mr. President, will my colleague yield for a question?    Mr. President, will my colleague yield for a question?    Those numbers came out while I was speaking on the  floor, because I was talking about the first House-passed bill to  repeal the Affordable Care Act. What the Senator from Illinois is  telling me is that the numbers for the bill they passed to fix the  first bill they couldn't pass are just as bad and in some ways even  worse than the original bill.    Well, that was going to be my followup question. In New  Hampshire, we have the second highest percentage of overdose deaths in  the country. We lose more people in New Hampshire to deaths from  overdoses of opioids and fentanyl and heroin than we do to car  accidents. And an overwhelming percentage of people--over 90 percent-- are getting treatment for their substance abuse disorders through the  expansion of Medicaid, which has been a bipartisan program in New  Hampshire that has covered about 60,000 people, many of whom are  getting treatment for substance abuse disorders.    So what the Senator from Illinois is telling me, from the CBO, is  that based on the plan that passed the House that Republicans have  supported, those people who are getting their treatment--lifesaving  treatment for mental health issues and substance abuse disorders--they  are going to be kicked off of their plan, and they are not going to  have any other option for getting that care.    Mr. President, if my colleague will yield once more,  last year we passed the 21st Century Cures Act, which appropriated $1  billion--$500 million this year and $500 million next year--to address  the heroin and opioid epidemic we are having, and in the recent passage  of the omnibus bill, we got $700-plus million to help us fight this  epidemic. So on the one hand, we are putting money in to address it,  and on the other hand, we are taking away the treatment people need by  passing a healthcare bill that is going to throw people off their  treatment and give them no other option to address their substance use  disorders.    If I could just add one more group of folks who are  going to be affected by this bill that passed the House several weeks  ago. That is our veterans. We have millions of veterans in this country  who get their healthcare through Medicaid. We have asked these folks to  put their lives on the line for this country, and now we are talking  about taking away the healthcare they depend on.   I was at one of our community mental health centers in New Hampshire  last week and met with a number of veterans who get their care through  the expansion of Medicaid. They talked about what it means to be able  to get care, to be able to go into that community mental health center  and work with the veterans outreach coordinator who works with  veterans, trying to make sure they get the help they need. If this bill  goes forward, PTSD, which affects so many veterans, would be considered  a preexisting condition and they wouldn't be able to get health  insurance going forward.   This is bill is nothing but mean-spirited. As the Senator said, all  of the efforts to save money in the bill are so money can be used to  give huge tax breaks to the wealthiest among us. I don't think that is  what Americans want. As the Senator says, we need to work with our  colleagues. We need to get a good bill that improves the Affordable  Care Act, fixes what is not working, and makes it better.    Actually, the New Hampshire Hospital Association also  opposes the bill for the very same reason. We have hospitals at risk if  this bill is passed.    There will be. If I could ask one final question  because not only is this effort in the Senate happening behind closed  doors, but initially it excluded women.   Women are more than 50 percent of this country. We have particular  needs when it comes to healthcare. Fortunately, the essential health  benefits part of the Affordable Care Act provide requirements for  preventive health for women, for mammograms. They cover maternity  benefits when you have a baby. They are talking about writing this  legislation without taking into consideration the women in the Senate,  the women in the country, and what we need to do to make sure we have  access to healthcare. That is just unconscionable, added to the fact  that it is all being done behind closed doors.     Absolutely. They want to take us back to that.
