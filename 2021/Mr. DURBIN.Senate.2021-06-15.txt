 I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Booker)  and the Senator from Michigan (Mr. Peters) are necessarily absent.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, last Friday, the New York Times reported  that during the Trump administration, the Justice Department issued  subpoenas involving Members of Congress, their staff, and family  members, even a minor family member. It is highly unusual for the  Justice Department to investigate Members of Congress. The reason it is  unusual is clear: Our Founders created three separate branches of the  Federal Government with a separation of powers so that each branch  could serve as a check and balance on the other and no branch would  have too much power.   When the Justice Department investigates a Member of Congress,  typically, it is for corruption charges. That is understandable, but  that is not what happened here. This was an investigation into a leak  of information. And the use of subpoenas to investigate Members of  Congress is extremely strange territory.   These concerns are heightened when the President has publicly  attacked those same Members of Congress. That is what former President  Trump did when he repeatedly and without any evidence accused  Representative Adam Schiff about leaking information about Russian  election interference.   These reports and the reports that journalists and even Trump's own  White House Counsel were included in the Justice Department's so-called  leak investigation raise serious questions about the Justice Department  and its former leaders.   The Senate Judiciary Committee has a constitutional responsibility to  oversee the Department of Justice on behalf of the American people, so  yesterday our committee sent a letter to Attorney General Merrick  Garland asking for more information. But yesterday Senator McConnell,  the Republican minority leader in the Senate, came to the floor and  warned us off. He warned the Judiciary Committee against exercising our  statutory oversight responsibility because it could become ``a partisan  circus.'' This came on the heels of Senator McConnell's personal veto  of a bipartisan Commission to investigate the deadly January 6 mob  attack on the U.S. Capitol. But now the minority leader is warning us  against even looking into the targeting of Trump's perceived political  enemies by the Justice Department. The minority leader claimed that the  Senate does not need to look into this matter because--get this--the  Department of Justice inspector general has already announced he would  investigate. That is a pretty decent argument if you have no memory  whatsoever.   For over 13 months during the last Congress, under a Republican  majority, the Senate Judiciary Committee conducted an extensive  oversight investigation into the FBI's opening of the Crossfire  Hurricane investigation even though the Department of Justice inspector  general had already investigated it. The Department of Justice  inspector general had already completed a 19-month investigation of so- called Crossfire Hurricane involving over 100 witnesses and reviewing  over a million documents.   That wasn't good enough for the Republican majority. They persisted  in conducting a committee investigation nevertheless even though the  inspector general's investigation concluded that Crossfire Hurricane  had a proper basis  [[Page S4529]]  and that anti-Trump bias did not affect the FBI's work on Crossfire  Hurricane. Those are the very issues the Republican majority reexamined  in their own investigation. In that instance, the Department of Justice  inspector general satisfied all the criteria of an inspection, an  investigation, and yet the Republicans rejected it and proceeded  forward.   In this case, the Republican leader in the Senate is arguing that the  work of the inspector general should be enough--quite a difference.   Throughout the course of that investigation, the Senate Judiciary  Committee held extensive hearings, but it wasn't enough.   The Republican-led Senate Judiciary Committee was so focused on  investigating a conspiracy theory about Obama that they didn't hold a  single hearing on the Trump administration's Department of Justice in 4  years. If they had, maybe they would have discovered this latest  revelation rather than the New York Times.   Senator McConnell did not warn the Judiciary Committee that the DOJ  inspector general's investigation was sufficient or that its  investigation into Crossfire Hurricane would become a partisan circus.  He saw it completely differently in those days.   Importantly, it seems the minority leader does not speak for his  entire caucus. Yesterday the minority whip said: ``Obviously this  warrants further review and investigation,'' and he ``assume[s] the  committee will work through that.'' I hope that other Republican  Members of the Chamber join the minority whip to call for further  investigation. Congress's place in our constitutional order is too  important to simply look the other way.                            ____________________     Madam President, it was 9 years ago today, after a year  or more of writing letters to my friend and colleague President Obama,  that he finally agreed to an Executive order known as DACA. DACA took  the heart of the DREAM Act, which I introduced 20 years ago, and made  an Executive order. He said to those who were brought to this country  as children, infants, who really had nothing to do with the family  decision on coming to America: We are going to give you a chance, since  you grew up undocumented, to be a part of this Nation. So every 2  years, you can apply for renewable status, be protected from  deportation, and be allowed to legally work. We will do a criminal  investigation, national security investigation, and if we believe that  you are no threat to this country, we will give you 2 years to prove  yourself.   More than 800,000 young people stepped forward and made a life in  America and did extraordinary things for this country. They proved  that, given a chance to be part of America's future, they would make it  a better nation. Two of them testified today. One of them is a doctor  from the city of Chicago. I am so proud of him, Dr. Bernal Mejia. He  was born in Mexico and grew up in Memphis, TN. He struggled, scrapped,  clawed his way into an amazing undergraduate institution, graduated  summa cum laude, and hoped that one day he would have a chance to go to  medical school.   Before DACA, that was a dream that was way too distant. Then came  DACA. He looked around to see if any medical schools in the United  States would let someone who was protected by DACA apply for medical  school. It turned out there was one. I am proud to say it was Loyola  University in Chicago, the Stritch School of Medicine. They didn't  create a new category of students; they just said: We will let you  compete. If you are good enough, we will admit you as a student.   Over 30 DACA students became medical students at Loyola. Dr. Mejia  was one. He is now about to finish, in a few weeks, the third year of  his residency in emergency medicine. He has spent the last year and a  half, as you can imagine, in emergency rooms saving the lives of so  many people, particularly victims of COVID-19.   How many times has each of us thanked the healthcare heroes, and how  many times have we thought that one of them might have been an  undocumented doctor whose future and fate are still so uncertain in  America? That is the case today because the DREAM Act has not become  the law of the land.   So we had a hearing and discussed his situation and the bill that was  sent to us by the House. I believe there is some bipartisan sentiment  in favor of that, and I am trying to work to develop that into  legislation that will finally give to Dr. Mejia and so many others  across this country the future in America which they have all prayed  for. They have worked hard to earn it. They deserve it.   I am glad, at this hearing today, the doctor came and told this  story. It is an inspiration to me and all who believe in this country  that we should have justice when it comes to immigration.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
