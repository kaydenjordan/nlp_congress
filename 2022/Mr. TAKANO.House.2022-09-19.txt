 Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 7698) to designate the outpatient clinic of the Department  of Veterans Affairs in Ventura, California, as the ``Captain Rosemary  Bryant Mariner Outpatient Clinic''.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 7698         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) As of January 2021, of the 1,255 health care facilities       of the Department of Veterans Affairs, two are named after       women.        (2) Rosemary Ann Bryant was born on April 2, 1953, in       Harlingen, Texas, to Captain Cecil Bryant and Constance       Boylan Bryant, a World War II Navy nurse.        (3) Captain Mariner was the first woman to enroll in the       aeronautics program at Purdue University in 1971.        (4) Captain Mariner joined the Navy in 1973, and after       graduating from officer candidate school that year, she       became a member of the Navy's first flight-training class for       women.        (5) In 1974, Captain Mariner was one of six women to earn       her wings and in 1975 she became the first female Naval       aviator to fly a jet attack aircraft.        (6) In July 1990, Captain Mariner was named commander of       Navy ``Tactical Electronic Warfare Squadron 34'' at Naval Air       Station Point Mugu in Ventura County, California. The unit       was 30 percent female and made Captain Mariner the first       woman to command an operational air squadron, even though       women were still barred from flying combat missions.        (7) Captain Mariner became a passionate advocate for women       in the military, leading the Women Military Aviators and       working with Congress and the Department of Defense to lift       restrictions barring women from flying in combat.        (8) Captain Mariner attended the National War College in       the District of Columbia, earning a master's degree in       national security strategy and served on the staff of the       Joint Chiefs at the Pentagon, and a professor of joint       military studies at the National War College.        (9) Captain Mariner retired from the Navy in 1997, and       moved to Tennessee with her husband Commander Tommy Mariner       and her daughter Emmalee.        (10) During her Naval career Captain Mariner logged 17       landings on aircraft carriers and more than 3500 flight hours       in 15 different aircraft.        (11) In retirement, Captain Mariner continued her service       in her community as a resident scholar in the University of       Tennessee's Center for the Study of War and Society, and       taught military history in UT's history department for 15       years.        (12) Captain Mariner passed away from ovarian cancer on       January 24, 2019, in Knoxville, Tennessee.        (13) In honor of Captain Mariner, the United States Navy       conducted its first all-female flyover at the funeral service       for Captain Mariner on Saturday, February 2, 2019, in       Maynardville, Tennessee.        (14) In July 2021, a panel of Ventura County members of the       Armed Forces, veterans, and military spouses recommended that       the Ventura Medical Center be named in honor of Captain       Rosemary Bryant  Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and to insert extraneous material on H.R. 7698.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise to honor the memory of Captain Rosemary Bryant  Mariner, a member of the Navy's first flight-training class for women,  the first woman to command a naval aviation squadron, and a lifelong  advocate for women's military service.   The bill before us, H.R. 7698, would appropriately name the VA  outpatient clinic in Ventura, California, the ``Captain Rosemary Bryant  Mariner Outpatient Clinic.''   I thank Representative Julia Brownley, chairwoman of the Veterans'  Affairs Committee's Women Veterans Task Force, for championing this  effort.   The VA has more than 1,200 healthcare facilities nationwide, yet as  of the beginning of this Congress, just two of these facilities bore  the names of women veterans. Representative Brownley's bill will begin  to correct this regretful disparity.   More than 2 million women veterans live in the United States today.  They serve across all military branches and divisions, and they are the  fastest growing group of veterans that utilize VA healthcare services.  So it is fitting that we honor a trailblazing woman like Captain  Mariner at one of these VA healthcare facilities.   Captain Mariner had service to this country in her veins. The  daughter of a World War II Navy nurse and Army pilot killed in a plane  crash when she was just 3 years old, Captain Mariner grew up watching  planes take off and land at the Miramar Naval Air Station in San Diego,  California.   Captain Mariner went on to become the first woman to enroll in the  aeronautics program at Purdue University in 1971, one of six initial  women to earn her wings as a U.S. naval aviator in 1974, and the first  woman aviator to fly a jet attack aircraft in 1975.   In 1990, Captain Mariner became commander of the Navy's tactical  warfare squadron at Naval Air Station Point Mugu in Ventura County.   She continued in public service following her 24-year military  career, teaching military history at the University of Tennessee for an  additional 15 years.   At Captain Mariner's funeral service in 2019, following a long battle  against ovarian cancer, the Navy conducted its first flyover featuring  all female pilots. This was, like the naming of the Ventura VA  outpatient clinic will be, a fitting tribute to a life of service to  this Nation.   H.R. 7698 has letters of support from the American Legion, Veterans  of Foreign Wars, and Disabled American Veterans.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record these three letters.                                                The American Legion,                                        Department of California,                                          Sanger, CA, April 6, 2022.      Rep. Julia Brownley,      Washington, DC.        Rep. Brownley: The American Legion Department of California       is proud to support the naming of the Ventura County       Department of Veterans Affairs Outpatient Clinic after       captain Rosemary Bryant Mariner.        Since its founding in 1919, the American Legion has served       veterans, service members, and communities throughout our       nation. Our commitment to serving all veterans has been one       of the main pillars outlining our purpose. As the United       State Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) continues to make       strides in the way it supports and cares for women veterans,       I believe by renaming VA facilities after brave female       veterans it is a great step towards recognizing the       contribution of this Nation's woman warriors.        On behalf of the 80,000+ American Legion members in       California we urge congress to take action to name this       facility to honor this woman veteran who embodies the true       essence of duty and service to our community, state, and       Nation.            Respectfully,                                            Autrey B. James Jr.,                                               Department Commander,                                               The American Legion,      Department of California.                                   ____                                         Veterans of Foreign Wars,                                    Elk Grove, CA, November 1, 2021.      Rep. Julia Brownley,      Washington DC.        Dear Rep. Brownley: On behalf of the sixty-four thousand       members of the Veterans of Foreign Wars Department of       California, I am writing to support naming the Ventura County       Department of Veterans Affairs Outpatient Clinic after       Captain Rosemary Bryant Mariner.        It is our privilege to help recognize and support the       contributions of women in military service, notably Capt.       Mariner, who we  [[Page H7941]]       believe embodies the requirements necessary to name a federal       building in her honor. The panel convened in the Ventura       County area consisting of members of the Armed Forces,       veterans, and military spouses recommended that the Ventura       Medical Center be named in honor of Captain Rosemary Bryant       Mariner and we agree that her military service and women       veterans' advocacy is notable for this prestigious honor.        The VFW is committed to improve VA medical centers services       for women veterans through legislative advocacy and fully       support your work on behalf of our nation's veterans.        Thank you for your time and consideration.            Sincerely,                                                    Dawn M. Napier,      State Commander.                                   ____                                                                DAV,                                        Department of California,                             Santa Fe Springs, CA, November 3, 2021.      To: The Chairs and Ranking Members of both the House and           Senate Veterans' Affairs Committees      Re Support Naming the Ventura VA Clinic after Captain           Rosemary Bryant Mariner        Dear Veterans' Affairs Committees Chairs and Ranking       Members: As Commander of the Department of California       Disabled American Veterans representing over 70,000 DAV Life       Members in the State of California and in recognition of our       fallen veterans and their survivors . . . as a department of       veterans--who advocate daily for the heroes that served this       nation; we sincerely urge you to support the bill created to       rename the Ventura VA Clinic in Ventura, California, after       the late Captain Rosemary Bryant Mariner.        Since the Revolutionary War, millions of women and       minorities have served in the Armed Forces of the United       States. They have served in every role, from infantry soldier       to cyber warfare engineer. Yet, as of January 2021, of the       1,255 VA healthcare facilities, only 13 have been dedicated       to honor the service of minority veterans, and only two       facilities have been named in honor of women veterans.        Rosemary Ann Bryant was born on April 2, 1953, in       Harlingen, Texas, to Captain Cecil Bryant and Constance       Boylan Bryant, a World War II Navy nurse. She was the first       woman to enroll in the aeronautics program at Purdue       University in 1971. She joined the Navy in 1973, and after       graduating from officer candidate school that year, she       became a member of the Navy's first flight-training class for       women. In 1974, she was one of six women to earn her wings,       and in 1975 she became the first female Naval Aviator to fly       a jet attack aircraft.        In July 1990, Captain Mariner was named commander of Navy       Tactical Electronic Warfare Squadron 34 at Naval Air Station       Point Mugu in Ventura County, California. The unit was 30       percent female and made Captain Mariner the first woman to       command an operational air squadron, even though women were       still barred from flying combat missions. Captain Mariner       became a passionate advocate for women in the military,       leading the Women Military Aviators and working with Congress       and the Defense Department to lift restrictions barring women       from flying in combat.        She attended the National War College in Washington, DC.,       earning a master's degree in national security strategy and       served on the staff of the Joint Chiefs at the Pentagon, and       a professor of joint military studies at the National War       College. Captain Mariner retired from the Navy in 1997 and       moved to Tennessee with her husband Commander Tommy Mariner       and her daughter Emmalee. During her Navy career, Captain       Mariner logged 17 landings on aircraft carriers and more than       3500 flight hours in 15 different aircraft. In retirement,       she continued her service in her community as a resident       scholar in the University of Tennessee's Center for the Study       of War and Society and taught military history in UT's       history department for 15 years.        Captain Mariner passed away from Ovarian Cancer on January       24, 2019, in Knoxville, Tennessee. In honor of Captain       Mariner, the United States Navy conducted its first all-      female flyover at the funeral service for Captain Mariner on       Saturday, February 2, 2019, in Maynardville, Tennessee. In       July 2021, a panel of Ventura County members of the Armed       Forces, veterans, and military spouses recommended that the       Ventura Medical Center be named in honor of Captain Rosemary       Bryant Mariner.        In a recent report, the VA Advisory Committee on Women       Veterans recommended inclusive naming of VA facilities ``to       demonstrate to women veterans that their service matters.''       While VA has concurred with the recommendation, it is the       responsibility of Congress to pass legislation to actually       name these facilities.        The Chairwoman of the Women Veterans Task Force has helped       identify disparities in access to care and benefits, and,       where necessary, introduced, advocated for, and passed       legislation that fixes those gaps. Naming new or undedicated       facilities for women veterans would be a symbolic step to       show our appreciation for the great courage, dedication, and       sacrifice that these veterans have demonstrated in defense of       our Nation.        Please join me in honoring the incredible life of Captain       Rosemary Bryant Mariner by co-sponsoring this bill and       signing onto the letter of support to the Senate Veterans'       Affairs Committee, a requirement to move the bill forward.        Thank you for your support of America's disabled veterans       and their survivors. If you have any concerns, please do not       hesitate to contact our Dept. of CA DAV Legislative Director       Gerald G. ``J.R.'' Wilson, Jr.             Sincerely,      Michael Kerr,        Commander.      Daniel Contreras,        DAV National 2nd Vice Commander, Adjutant/CEO.      Gerald G. Wilson, Jr.,        Legislative Director.    Madam Speaker, I wholeheartedly support this bill, I  encourage all of my colleagues to do the same, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I want to say I appreciate the ranking member's mentioning of his  daughter and the connection with today's action. I also extend my  pride, and I feel his pride. We also are thankful for his daughter's  service.   Madam Speaker, I yield 7 minutes to the gentlewoman from California  (Ms. Brownley), my good friend and the chairwoman of the Subcommittee  on Health. She is the author of H.R. 7698, a vital piece of  legislation.    Madam Speaker, I ask all of my colleagues to join me in  passing H.R. 7698, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 2771) to designate the community-based outpatient clinic of  the Department of Veterans Affairs in San Angelo, Texas, as the  ``Colonel Charles and JoAnne Powell Department of Veterans Affairs  Clinic''.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 2771         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. FINDINGS.          Congress finds the following:        (1) Colonel Charles Powell and his wife, Mrs. JoAnne       Powell, served the community of San Angelo, Texas, with       character and dignity.        (2) Colonel Powell served as the base commander of       Goodfellow Air Force Base from 1980 to 1984.        (3) When the Powells moved to San Angelo, Charles was       ordered to help Goodfellow avoid closure and the displacement       of many members of the Armed Forces from the community they       had grown to love.        (4) The impact of Charles' career can still be felt today       at Goodfellow Air Force Base, as it serves as a training       school for thousands of members from every Armed Force to       train in cryptology, intelligence, and firefighting.        (5) JoAnne assisted thousands of constituents in the       district offices of Representatives Tom Loeffler, Lamar       Smith, K. Michael Conaway, and August Pfluger.        (6) One of the several duties JoAnne spearheaded was the       annual process of nominations to the military service       academies, which was always a year-round process for her.        (7) With JoAnne's assistance, many of the young men and       women of the 11th congressional district of Texas went on to       serve the United States and attend one of the military       service academies.        (8) In addition, JoAnne was a fierce advocate of veterans       and helped thousands of individuals gain access to the       veterans benefits they rightfully earned.        (9) JoAnne's compassion and dedication helped make the       Concho Valley a better place.       SEC. 2. DESIGNATION OF COMMUNITY-BASED OUTPATIENT CLINIC OF                     DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS IN SAN ANGELO,                     TEXAS.         (a) Designation.--The community-based outpatient clinic of       the Department of Veterans Affairs in San Angelo, Texas,       shall after the date of the enactment of this Act be known       and designated as the ``Colonel Charles and JoAnne Powell       Department of Veterans Affairs Clinic'' or the ``Colonel       Charles and JoAnne Powell VA Clinic''.        (b) Reference.--Any reference in any law, regulation, map,       document, paper, or other record of the United States to the       community-based outpatient clinic referred to in subsection       (a) shall be considered to be a reference to the Colonel       Charles and JoAnne Powell Department of Veterans Affairs       Clinic.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and insert extraneous material on S. 2771.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise to recognize the lives of Colonel Charles and  JoAnne Powell, both of whom served the community of San Angelo, Texas,  and advocated for veterans for many years.  [[Page H7943]]    I thank Senator John Cornyn and the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Pfluger) for putting forward this legislation, which will rename the  San Antonio VA clinic in Colonel and Mrs. Powell's honor.   Colonel Powell served as base commander of Goodfellow Air Force Base  in San Angelo from 1980 to 1984. He was instrumental in helping to  avoid closure of the base, which today serves as a school for thousands  of servicemembers training to be cryptologists, intelligence officers,  and military firefighters.   Mrs. Powell also lived a life devoted to public service as district  manager to four separate Members of Congress. In this role, Mrs. Powell  encouraged many young men and women in the 11th Congressional District  of Texas to serve in the United States military and helped numerous  veterans access the VA benefits they rightfully earned.   S. 2771 and its companion bill, H.R. 4328, are cosponsored by nearly  40 Members of Congress, Democrat and Republican, and the legislation  has the support of The American Legion, Veterans of Foreign Wars, and  Disabled American Veterans.   Madam Speaker, I include letters of support from these Members and  organizations for the Record.                                  Congress of the United States,                                  Washington, DC, February 10, 2022.      Chairman Jon Tester,      Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs,      Washington, DC.      Chairman Mark Takano,      House Committee on Veterans' Affairs,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Jerry Moran,      Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Mike Bost,      House Committee on Veterans' Affairs,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Tester, Chairman Takano, Ranking Member       Moran, and Ranking Member Bost: We are writing to express our       support to name the Veterans Affairs community-based       outpatient clinic in San Angelo, Texas, the ``Colonel Charles       and JoAnne Powell VA Clinic''.        Colonel Charles Powell served 30 years in the U.S. Air       Force and was Commander of the 17th Training Wing at       Goodfellow Air Force Base from 1980 until retiring in 1984.       Only six months after his graduation from the U.S. Naval       Academy, he married JoAnne, who soon became a force of her       own in the military and veterans' communities. Together, they       settled in San Angelo for Charles's final assignment at       Goodfellow AFB. The two saved Goodfellow from closure and       helped the base become a technical training center.        During her husband's two deployments in Vietnam and during       his time at Goodfellow, JoAnne revived the Officer Wives Club       and started a Christmas Bazaar program that is ongoing today.       Additionally, she was an active volunteer for a program that       supported MIA and POW families, the Red Cross, and various       other charitable causes.        Beyond these acts of service, JoAnne spent 37 years as a       district staffer for four Members of Congress in the San       Angelo district. She is believed to have provided casework       assistance to thousands of service members and veterans and       helped hundreds of district students navigate service academy       selections and receive appointments. Although Charles passed       away on July 2, 2020, JoAnne upheld Charles' legacy by       staying active in the community, eventually being honored as       a Lifetime Hero in the community for her contributions to the       military community.        On March 24, 2021, JoAnne Powell passed away. Throughout       Charles' and JoAnne's life together, they embodied the true       meaning of selflessness, patience, and perseverance. The       countless hours the Powells dedicated to changing the lives       of their neighbors and being a light in their community have       left a lasting impact on West Texas. We would be grateful for       your support of this effort and hope that the Senate and the       House Committees on Veterans' Affairs will give it its prompt       consideration.

Re Endorsement of re-naming the name of the San Angelo VA           Clinic       Rep. August Pfluger,      Attn: Meredith Moore,      Washington, DC.        Dear Rep. Pfluger: As the State Commander of The American       Legion, Department of Texas, I write to you in support of re-      naming the San Angelo VA Clinic to the Colonel Charles and       JoAnne Powell VA Clinic.        The American Legion, the Nation's largest Veterans       organization, believes in memorializing and honoring our       Veterans, and we can see no better way to honor Colonel       Charles and JoAnne Powell for their dedicated service to the       Community, State, and Nation.        For God and Country,                                             James ``Bret'' Watson,      State Commander.                                   ____                                         Veterans of Foreign Wars,                                                      July 13, 2021.      Hon. Mark Takano,      Chairman, House Committee on Veterans Affairs, Washington,           DC.      Hon. Mike Bost,      Ranking Member, House Committee on Veterans Affairs,           Washington, DC.        Chairman Takano and Ranking Member Bost: On behalf of the       Texas Veterans of Foreign Wars, I am honored to extend my       support to U.S. Representative August Pfluger's H.R. 4328, to       rename the Department of Veterans Affairs Clinic in San       Angelo, Texas, to the ``Colonel Charles and JoAnne Powell VA       Clinic''.        The Powells were beloved figures in their adopted hometown       of San Angelo who devoted a lifetime serving their country       and community with honor and dedication. Our hope is       memorializing their names on a facility that continues to the       veterans they cared so much for, will inspire future       generations.            Sincerely,                                                      Norman Macey,                                                   State Commander.        Attest:                                                          Dan West,      State Adjutant/Quartermaster.                                   ____                                                                DAV,                                             Department of Texas,                                          Lufkin, TX, June 29, 2021.

Chairman Mark Takano and Ranking Member Mike Bost: On the       behalf of Disabled American Veterans, Department of Texas, I       am honored to extend my support to the efforts of Congressman       August Pfluger and the members of Congress from Texas to       rename The Department of Veterans Affairs outpatient clinic       in San Angelo, Texas, to the Colonel Charles and JoAnne       Powell VA Clinic''.        Colonel Powell was a graduate of the United States Naval       Academy and served a distinguished 30 year career in the Air       Force, including Commander of Goodfellow Air Base in San       Angelo, Texas.        Mrs. Colonel Powell was in the Air Force and was a       dedicated Military wife and force in her own right, active in       the Officers Wives Club for 30 years. She was a voice for       Veterans and served 37 years as District Manager to four       members of Congress.        The bill, Colonel Charles and JoAnne Powell VA Clinic,       would rename the VA Clinic in San Angelo, Texas, to Honor the       lives of these two individuals. The Powells were beloved       figures in their adopted hometown who spent their lifetime       serving their country and community with honor and       dedication.            Sincerely,                                                Teresa Johniken,                                                 Adjutant/Treasurer,                                           DAV Department of Texas.     Madam Speaker, I support naming VA's community-based  outpatient clinic in San Angelo, Texas, in Colonel Charles and Mrs.  JoAnne Powell's honor, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I am  prepared to close. I reserve the balance of my time.
