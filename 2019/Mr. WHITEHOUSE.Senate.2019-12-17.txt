 Mr. President, I thank Chairman Enzi. I am delighted  to join Senator Enzi on the floor today to talk about our bill. An  enormous amount of work has gone into preparing for it, including, I  want to say, more than a dozen hearings that Chairman Enzi led in the  Budget Committee to build the factual predicate for the work we were  doing.   I will, as the Chairman has mentioned, also drop a word of  appreciation to Chairman Womack and Chairman Lowey, who ran the Select  Committee on Budget and Appropriations Process Reform, which gave us a  chance to work through some more of these issues.   The fundamental problem we are trying to address is that, in the  Senate, no committee actually looks at the deficit, the debt, and the  borrowing in any kind of a comprehensive way. In theory, the Budget  Committee is supposed to, but in practice, the Budget Committee has  become two things: one, a vehicle for the majority to drive a political  budget limited to appropriated spending through, with no bipartisan  compromise. We have seen over and over how that has ended up. It has  never been of any use. Even if you get it done, you break through the  budget by getting to 60 votes, and we do most things around here by  getting to 60 votes. It is a fence that is basically a line painted on  the ground. It is a fence with no fence to it.   Moreover, we do reconciliation. That is usually a way to bust around  the budget. Both parties have used it. The Republicans have used it for  the so-called tax reform. We used it for one segment of the Affordable  Care Act. That is what the Budget Committee is boiled down to--a  partisan proposal on appropriations that means nothing and a vehicle  for getting around the 60-vote filibuster on a regular basis through  reconciliation. That is it. There is no serious look that is taken at  the debt or at the deficit.   What does this bill do? It does some things for which there is very  broad agreement. First of all, it was pretty much unanimous that the  way you look at debt is in terms of a debt-to-GDP ratio, and this takes  us down that path. Second, you have to do the arithmetic correct. You  don't get to a proper debt-to-GDP ratio unless you look at the things  that add up to the deficit, which are appropriated spending, healthcare  spending, revenues, and tax spending.   For one quick word on tax spending, for 2018 the latest report I saw  was that we spent $1.4 trillion going out the back door of the Tax  Code. That is more than we spend on Social Security. That is more than  we spend on Medicare and Medicaid combined. That is more than defense  and nondefense discretionary spending combined. You can't not look at  tax spending and still have your math right. We address those.   We provide a reasonable timeframe to get to a debt-to-GDP target and  some warnings about whether or not you are on that glide slope. There  was pretty much unanimous consent agreement among all of our witnesses  in the committee and in the select committee that that was the logical  way to address debt and deficit.   There are also some sidebar things that are important that we get rid  of here, such as, we move to biennial budgeting, which I think has  broad bipartisan support. We deal with what I call ``the bear trap in  the bedroom''--the debt ceiling--which is a very dangerous thing if you  should ever step on it and trigger it. To disarm that bear trap is very  valuable to our efforts, and we do that.   Vote-arama is one of the most undistinguished, useless, humiliating,  and embarrassing spectacles that the Senate presents. We solved, I  believe, vote-arama.  [[Page S7083]]    So that is a pretty good package of good, useful reforms to get going  in the right direction.   There is a very significant concern, mostly on my side of the aisle,  about the special reconciliation process. In this bill you alternate  between regular reconciliation and a special reconciliation process,  and then, in the next biennial cycle, back to regular reconciliation  and then special reconciliation. There is concern that the special  reconciliation process might be used to jam things we don't like  through--things like cuts to Medicare, things like very one-sided  spending cuts that don't address the problem of tax spending.   We need to work to solve that. I pledge to Chairman Enzi that I will  put my best efforts to try to come up with a way where we can get  through that problem and move on to passing this bill, which I think  will be very significant and very valuable once we iron out what I  think is probably, actually, the last real gasp that we have in terms  of objection to it.   I will also add that the bipartisan pathway that we have been working  on for when the two parties can come together and agree to those things  is in there. If we really want to do this in a bipartisan pathway, that  is in this bill. I appreciate very much that Chairman Enzi included  that in the bill. That provision passed the bicameral select committee  unanimously--Republicans, Democrats, House Members, Senators,  unanimously. That is a pretty good base to work off of.   I will close by quoting a phrase that I have heard usually from  business folks from time to time. That is that in business, ``debt  doesn't matter, until it does.'' But then it is the only thing that  matters. At the moment, with interest rates where they are and with the  world situation the way it is, one can make the case that debt doesn't  matter. But when the day comes that it does matter, when interest rates  pop up and the cost of servicing our debt begins to squeeze out other  priorities, it gets very hard to go back and try to solve that problem  then.   This is the kind of problem you have to head off in advance. So to  the extent we can solve in a sensible way dealing with our debt and  deficit during the calm period when debt doesn't matter, we will  position ourselves to avoid the calamity that can come when it is the  only thing that matters.   I pledge to use my best efforts to try to bring my side into  agreement on this bill and to try to find a measure that solves our  concern about what I think is really the only point of significant  disagreement in this bill, which is what is behind the special  reconciliation process, what mischief that might be got up to. I think  if we can defang this, we can move forward.   Again, much appreciation to Chairman Enzi for his extraordinary  leadership in the budget committee on this subject. I am determined to  try to get this done in this Congress while he is with us to see it  through.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, we are rapidly running out of time  to protect our future and that of our children and grandchildren from  worsening climate upheaval. America ought to be taking every measure  available to rein in greenhouse gas emissions from legislative action  to legal action, to diplomatic action, to regulatory action, which is  going to be a theme of this talk tonight. We are not doing those  things, and, frankly, it is because of corruption, plain and simple.   Regulatory action, that means enforcing the laws on the books. We  have a Clean Air Act that requires the Environmental Protection Agency  to stop dangerous pollutants from fouling our air. The EPA has found  that greenhouse gases are pollutants under the Clean Air Act, and the  Supreme Court has upheld that finding. That means we ought to be  regulating methane. Methane is among the most potent of greenhouse  gases. When released into the atmosphere, it traps about 30 times more  heat than its chemical cousin, carbon dioxide. Oil and gas extraction  releases massive methane pollution. In fact, a growing body of research  suggests methane pollution from natural gas extraction may completely  offset the climate gains of switching from coal to natural gas.   To fulfill its duties under the Clean Air Act, as a matter of law,  EPA needs to prevent methane pollution. It is the law; it is not  optional. But the corrupt Trump EPA won't fight methane pollution. This  corrupt EPA is run by the fossil fuel industry, which could not care  less about methane emissions.   Within weeks of Scott Pruitt taking control of the Agency, the  corrupted EPA withdrew its request that oil and gas companies even  report methane emissions. The industry knew a true report on methane  leakage would damage their case for natural gas as a less dangerous air  pollutant, so they went to a line of attack, taken directly from the  Big Tobacco playbook: Silence the science. The fewer facts the EPA has,  the less action it needs to take under law--the corrupt Trump EPA  deliberately made itself ignorant and stopped the reporting so it could  avoid its duty.   Step 2 came in March 2017 with the corrupt Trump effort to roll back  existing greenhouse gas regulations, including methane regulations.  Trump's Executive order reads like a fossil fuel lobbyist's dream,  probably because fossil fuel lobbyists wrote it. He called on the EPA  to ``review existing regulations that potentially burden the  development or use of domestically produced energy resources and  appropriately suspend, revise, or rescind those that unduly burden the  development of domestic energy resources.''   Regulations to limit methane pollution were among those that Trump's  Executive order singled out, saying, ``As soon as practical, suspend,  revise, or rescind [them].''   Step 3 was to write a do-nothing replacement. After lots of dawdling,  Trump's corrupt EPA decided to draft a fake rule, a rule they could  point to if challenged in court for doing nothing, but a rule that  would conveniently do nothing to limit methane emissions. The fake rule  exempts a huge chunk of oil and gas production from regulation, leaving  the industry with an effective blank check to pollute as much methane  as it likes.   As I speak, the corrupt Trump EPA is preparing to issue its final  rule, and the corrupted fossil fuel industry is poised to grab  everything it wanted. The final rule is one that industry stooges could  have written themselves because, well, it looks like they did write it  themselves. They bought that privilege the old-fashioned way, by buying  it.   Even before Trump took office, the fossil fuel industry began  showering him with money. Trump raised a record amount for his  inauguration--nearly doubling the previous record--and Hess, Chevron,  BP, Citgo, ExxonMobil, Consol Energy, Continental Resources, Murray  Energy, and Valero all made six- or seven-figure donations. The oil and  gas and mining sector was the second largest source of donations,  providing more than $10 million to Trump's inaugural committee. That  money still flows as the 2020 election ramps up.   Fossil fuel companies are among the largest donors to the political  group supporting Trump's reelection. A pipeline company is the largest  single donor to the Trump victory political action committee, more than  $700,000 as of this November. The oil, gas, and mining industries  account for more than $5 million to the Trump Victory PAC.   Fossil fuel executives are some of the largest individual donors to  the Trump Victory PAC. One executive alone gave $360,000. These known  donations likely represent the tip of a big dark iceberg. Dark-money  political organizations accept unlimited donations and provide no  disclosure, and Super PACs accept unlimited donations with little  disclosure. So the bottom line is we cannot tell exactly how much  fossil fuel money is flowing to groups supporting Trump, but it is a  lot. When you consider the $650 billion annual subsidiary the fossil  fuel polluters enjoy, they have every reason to buy control over  government from a corrupt Trump administration.   Money isn't the only way the fossil fuel industry exerts control.  Oklahoma oil king and Scott Pruitt patron Harold Hamm set up a Trump  leadership council to advise Trump. The fossil fuel industry was the  heart of the council, with coal giants Alliance Resource Partners and  Murray Energy, oil services company Baker Hughes, and natural gas  company Devon Energy all active members. Of course, there was the  National Association of Manufacturers, a trade association recently  identified as America's worst climate obstructer.   With all these obstructers and polluters on board, the fossil fuel  friendly  [[Page S7122]]  council fed Trump a steady diet of talking points about slashing  regulations and achieving ``complete American energy independence.''   These fossil fuel industry talking points became the Executive order  I mentioned earlier, an order to kill any environmental protection that  ``unduly burdens the development of domestic energy resources.'' Do you  want to know who the winners were from that Executive order? Check the  list of attendees at the signing ceremony: fossil fuel executives and  fossil fuel industry trade association executives, come to celebrate  the freedom to pollute that their influence and money had bought them.   Chevron has recently been identified as one of the companies that has  done the most to damage our oceans. They are one of the top ocean- wrecking companies on the planet. In February of 2017, Chevron wrote to  the corrupt Pruitt with a list of deregulatory proposals the company  wanted to see implemented at the EPA. Included was a request to  ``refocus methane regulations, particularly those that impact existing  sources, to encourage voluntary approaches.'' For sure, you can trust  one of the world's worst ocean polluters with voluntary approaches.   The corrupt Trump EPA was stocked with fossil fuel industry cronies  ready to implement whatever the industry wanted. Pruitt rose to  political power on a wave of fossil fuel money and demonstrated a  willingness to sell his office by putting fossil fuel industry asks  verbatim onto his official letterhead.   Andrew Wheeler, Pruitt's successor as Administrator, had been a  leading lobbyist for the coal industry. The head of the EPA Air Office,  Bill Wehrum, rose to prominence by helping build and run an array of  trade associations and front groups for--guess what--the fossil fuel  industry.   Beyond Pruitt and Wheeler and Wehrum, the EPA's political leadership  crawled with fossil fuel flunkies, like the one who left to set up the  fossil-fuel dark energy group Energy 45 to help promote fossil fuel  energy policies; or the lawyer-lobbyist for energy interests Dominion  Energy, Koch Industries, and TransCanada overseeing Air Office  compliance, of all things. It has been an infestation.   It is easy for the fossil fuel industry to spend big money to corrupt  the EPA because the corruption payback is so big; the dirty methane  work alone is estimated to save oil and gas companies hundreds of  millions of dollars.   Meanwhile, the American Petroleum Institute, the largest trade  association for the oil and gas industry, announced a new seven-figure  ad campaign called ``We're on it.'' ``We're on it.'' These ads--on the  Internet, TV, and billboards--they are all over the Washington, DC,  airport. They are designed to fool the public and to fool policymakers  that the oil industry is ``on its'' methane emissions problem. Of  course, they are not. Of course, they are lying. It is what they do.   Science tells us that methane emissions are far higher than the  estimates out of the corrupt Trump EPA. The investigative journalism  group Unearthed found that leading oil companies are emitting  unprecedented methane pollution. In just three producing basins, in  just 1 year, oil companies emitted methane equivalent to the annual  emissions of 10 coal-fired power plants or 8 million cars.   There is a recent New York Times article that you can link to showing  infrared imagery--it is really impressive to see, actually, if you  click through to it--infrared imagery of methane billowing out of what  they call super-emitter fossil fuel facilities.   A recent article described one methane blowout in Ohio leaking as  much ``methane than the entire oil and gas industries of many nations  do in a year.''   ``We are on it.'' Yeah, they are ``on it.'' What they are on is a  binge of lying about emissions, corrupting our politics, and blocking  climate action. These massive polluting industries have a long track  record of climate denial and deceit. It is how they roll.   A top climate obstructer, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, pays for a  phony study, claiming the Paris agreement would cost jobs and economic  growth, and Trump pulls out a pass. Oil companies lobby to gut auto  fuel efficiency standards, and Pruitt and Wheeler gut the standards.  The natural gas industry objects to rules limiting methane emission.  The corrupt Trump EPA rolls them back.   Just now, on the Senate floor, we are looking at a tax extenders  package that wipes out the tax extenders for solar going forward, wind  going forward. They gave us 1 year looking backwards. Great, thanks a  bunch. Electric vehicles, storage, and batteries, all of that had been  in a tentative agreement. The fossil fuel industry and the Trump  administration kiboshed all of it. ``On it,'' indeed.   Will Attorney General Barr look into any of this? Of course not. In  the corrupt Trump administration, fossil fuel money and influence puts  that industry above the law. They can pollute and corrupt more or less  at will. We cannot afford this self-dealing from polluters any longer.  This is flat-out wrong. Indeed, it is flat-out crooked. It is not only  time to wake up, Madam President, it is time to clean up. This behavior  is a disgrace.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
