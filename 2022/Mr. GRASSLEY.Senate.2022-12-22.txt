 Mr. President, I have historically supported disaster  assistance to farmers and others who experience losses due to no fault  of their own.   However, I had to vote no on Senator Scott's disaster relief  standalone amendment. As a lifelong family farmer and taxpayer  watchdog, I have fought for many years to close loopholes that have  allowed some farming operations to exploit Federal farm payments at  taxpayer expense.   Congress has been generous when it comes to supporting farmers.  Farmers have federally subsidized crop insurance, commodity payments,  and supplemental disaster payments. Farmers also had access to Market  Facilitation Program during the Trump administration and Coronavirus  Food Assistance payments in the past couple years.   The Scott amendment would remove any payment limit to the disaster  supplemental payments. This is a dangerous precedent to set. This  amendment would release the spigot of disaster payments to wealthy  farmers without regard to how much total assistance we are providing,  which could mean less funding for family farmers who really need the  help most.  [[Page S10081]]    I want a strong farm safety net program that helps farmers weather  downturns in the market and survive natural disasters, but I do not  want an unending stream of payments with no caps.   This amendment aims to help large farms get large bailouts while  small farmers are left behind. Instead of fundamentally changing market  dynamics, we should work together to make sure small and medium sized  farmers do not get left behind in farm payment programs. This is  especially true as we go into farm bill discussions in the next  Congress.                            ____________________
