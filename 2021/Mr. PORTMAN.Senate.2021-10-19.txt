 Madam President, I am here on the floor this evening to  talk about the troubling state of our economy today and what needs to  be done to get it back on track. The Labor Department reported last  week that the consumer price index, CPI, rose by 5.4 percent on an  annualized basis. That accounts for the largest year-to-year  inflationary increase in 13 years.   And we are feeling it. There is no question inflation is on the rise.  We are paying more for everything--from groceries, to buying furniture,  to cars, even pumpkins for Halloween. Yes, the U.S. Department of  Agriculture just told us that pumpkins, year to year, are going to see  an, on average, 15.7-percent increase in prices. So you might have to  get a little smaller pumpkin this year.   And, of course, we are paying more at the pump, on average, a  staggering 42-percent increase this year--42-percent increase. This is  both because of increased demand but also because there is less supply  as the new administration, the Biden administration, has put more  regulations or handcuffs on American energy production.   And don't forget the higher heating bills, about 25 percent higher  this year as compared to last year. Just as this cooler weather begins  to come in, we are all going to be paying more on our utility bills,  particularly for natural gas.   If all this isn't bad enough, workers' wages are not keeping up with  these price spikes. I love to see wages going  [[Page S7085]]  up, but honestly, if you look at the data, it says that since President  Biden took office, wages after inflation, adjusted for inflation, are  down almost 2 percent--1.9 percent lower.   Remember, before the pandemic started, in February of 2020, we had  the 19th straight month of wage increases of 3 percent or more on an  annualized basis, well above inflation. Now, we are seeing just the  opposite. This means a pay cut to the middle class.   The damaging effect of this hidden inflation is, in part, the result  of actions that were taken by the Biden administration and by Democrats  here in Congress to overheat the economy through unprecedented levels  of government spending.   What do I mean by that? Well, you will recall that economist and  former Secretary of the Treasury in the Clinton and Obama  administrations, Larry Summers, said earlier this year, as Democrats  were talking about this huge new spending bill that they ended up  passing without a single Republican input or vote in March, he said: If  you do this, it is going to cause inflation. He warned about it because  he had seen this movie before.   When you have got an economy that is already improving and you  overheat it with massive amounts of stimulus--remember, the $1.9  trillion that was spent in March was the highest level ever spent. It  was the biggest program ever passed by either House of Congress, $1.9  trillion. We forget how much money that is.   He recognized that this bill contained billions in stimulus money,  social service spending, the stimulus checks. And those were going to  fuel the demand side of the economy. And they did--not just the  stimulus checks but other things as well: COVID funds to all kinds of  institutions, a continuing generous unemployment supplement that paid  42 percent of American workers more to go on unemployment than to go  back to work.   All of this added up to a huge influx of social spending, government  spending--borrowed money but government spending--into the economy that  everyone who was looking at it objectively, I believe, knew was going  to be a problem.   Earlier this year, before the Democrats passed this $1.9 trillion  spending bill, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office here on  Capitol Hill told us that the economy was already recovering, and that  is what outside economists were saying as well. Everybody was looking  at the economy and saying, you know, in January, February, going into  March, the economy was improving nicely. In fact, the Congressional  Budget Office--again, nonpartisan group up here--said the economy is  going to get back to its prepandemic level by midyear, by June 30. And  it did.   The stimulus was really poorly timed. Instead of allowing the  recovery to continue steadily, it effectively poured fuel on an already  hot economy, which led to the surging inflation we are seeing now. The  White House likes to say that the inflation we are experiencing is  transitory. That is the word that they have been using; in other words,  it will pass--as Congress passes more legislation to fix the economy, I  suppose. Unfortunately, it has not been transitory.   And I haven't seen anybody who is looking at this objectively say  that it will be transitory. In fact, I saw an analysis today from an  outside group, a nonpartisan group, that said they are, unfortunately,  convinced that this high inflation is going to continue next year as  well. I hope that is not true, but that seems to be the consensus.  Economists across the spectrum, even the International Monetary Fund,  are now saying that rising inflation is dampening future economic  growth.   You would think all of this would cause a policy shift by the  administration, a pulling back on the stimulus, doing things to  actually help on the supply side of the economy. But rather than  changing course from the policies that contributed to this high  inflation and this demand-side stimulus, Democrats want to double down  with a $3.5-trillion-plus massive tax-and-spending spree that would  spend trillions to fund social programs, expand government  entitlements, and encourage more consumer demand, fueling more  inflation.    What makes this proposal even more concerning is Democrats want to  pay for it by hurting the economy more with big tax increases. Some say  it is the biggest tax increase in 50 years. Some say it is the largest  tax increase in history. It depends, I guess, where they end up. But we  know it will increase taxes on pretty much everybody.   The Joint Committee on Taxation has done an analysis and said, yes,  it is going to increase taxes on middle-income workers. Why? Because it  increases taxes on businesses and they say that about 70 percent of  that tax increase will be borne by workers. That is, again, the  nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation. So it is taxes not just on  businesses, large and small, but it is also on workers, on farmers, on  manufacturers.   This increased spending, combined with job-killing tax increases,  could lead to the kind of stagflation, low growth, high interest rates,  high inflation that we had back in the 1970s. We hoped never to see  that again; yet if we don't change course, we could be heading toward  that direction. It is the last thing our economy needs right now.   But surging consumer demand is not the only factor driving our  current inflation crisis. The other main culprit is that we are facing  a shortage of goods due to a global supply chain crisis. Almost anyone  you talk to will tell you they have had some kind of shipping delay due  to these supply chain issues. There are contractors you probably know  who can't get lumber, can't get steel to be able to finish a building,  a home.   There are plenty of parents out there right now waiting to get their  kid a gift for their birthday, only to find out that, no matter how  much they pay, it is going to arrive not for the birthday but maybe 2  or 3 months later.   These issues are clearly visible if you look at our seaports, which  are often the main connecter between our country and the main global  supply chain, consisting of manufacturers often in Asia, sometimes in  China. Just last week, there were about 60 or 70 ships in a holding  pattern near the ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles, CA. Think about  that: 60 or 70 huge container ships just in a holding pattern, not  being able to get in.   And even when the shipping containers are taken on shore, by the way,  there aren't enough trucks to pick them up. So the containers are  staying at the port. There aren't enough truck drivers because of the  labor shortage. By the way, that is driven in part by this increased  demand but in part by some of the rules and regulations around those  transportation logistics and truckers.   Between bottlenecks and backlogs at our ports and challenges in  transporting freight, there is real trouble for our supply chains just  as we come into the holiday season, which is typically, of course, when  people do most of their shopping. One reason for this global supply  chain crisis is the ripple effects of COVID-19. No question about that.  When factories shut down their operations to stem the flow of COVID  among their workers, assembly lines sometimes stopped working  altogether and created the shortage of goods and materials.   The companies that work in the shipping industry also were hit hard  by the pandemic and had some of their operations negatively impacted.  But then the pent-up demand for goods and services kicked in, and,  again, much more demand was created by the $1.9 trillion spending bill  in March of this year than would have been normal.   So, yeah, you had some of these factories shutting down; you had  essential workers still working; but you had less production and then  all of a sudden this big surge and, therefore, the bottleneck.   Some in the Biden administration have said that this inflation and  supply chain bottleneck is a problem for the rich. I don't see it that  way. If they think that, they ought to talk to the factory workers I  talked to in Ohio whose wages are being eaten up by inflation. I think  they should say that to the mother or father who is having to ask their  kid what gift they want for Christmas 2 or 3 months ahead of time. In  fact, it is too late already to get some gifts for Christmas even now.   A recent college graduate who is trying to fill her car up with gas  to get to work--tell it to her that this is a problem for the rich--a  42-percent increase in gas prices this year.  [[Page S7086]]    The supply chain is like any other chain. If you have one weak link,  it is enough to cause the whole thing to fall apart, and that is  exactly what has happened, and it is happening at the worst possible  time. Part of the near-term solution is to stop any new stimulus  spending. That is not what is needed right now in the economy. It is  just terrible timing.   And stop the new tax increases because that is also what we don't  need in our economy right now. We don't want to make America and  American workers less competitive; we want to do just the opposite.   And part of the long-term solution to prevent a similar crisis from  happening in the future is to shore up our supply chains. Instead of  being so reliant on manufacturers from places like China, bring the  manufacturing home; reshore it; invest more in production here in the  United States. In the process, create more domestic manufacturing and  transport jobs and greater supply chain security.   I think that is going to start happening. If you look at the cost to  bring a product from Asia to the United States now, it has skyrocketed.  That gives us a competitive advantage. The market is here. We ought to  bring the manufacturing here as well.   Another solution is to improve our Nation's infrastructure. Targeted  investments in increasing the capacity and operability of our ports,  our waterways, fixing our roads and bridges, improving our railways,  that all makes sense. For decades, we have neglected our infrastructure  needs. Every President, by the way, in modern times has said that.   You know, the society of engineers who look at our infrastructure  says that we have a grade of somewhere between D-plus and C-minus in  this country. We are falling behind other countries. Other countries  spend a lot more as a percent of their GDP on infrastructure. And it  has been recognized.   Really, every President since from Bill Clinton to Donald Trump has  said: Let's make a significant investment in infrastructure. Yet we  didn't do it. We neglected our infrastructure. We have neglected our  ports, and that is why they are so inefficient today in part and one  reason we are having to pay the price.   The good news is that right now there is a bipartisan infrastructure  package awaiting passage in the House of Representatives to address  this and other problems. It is called the Infrastructure Investment and  Jobs Act. This is the bill that passed the U.S. Senate here in August  with a 69-vote majority. That doesn't happen very often around here,  particularly with big, important legislation like that.   It was bipartisan from the start. It was passed with the support of  Republicans here in this Chamber, Democrats in this Chamber, and, most  importantly, the American people who think it is a really good idea.   Economists think it is a good idea, too, because it improves the  efficiency of our economy. Think about it. The bridge that is holding  up traffic right now in my hometown of Cincinnati, OH, every day--a  massive bridge where I-71 and 75 come together--it is a huge hit to our  economy. It is also a huge safety problem. Fixing that bridge has been  something people talked about for 30 years. It is time to do it, and we  will do it if we can get this infrastructure bill passed.   It will also create hundreds of thousands of good-paying jobs in  industries ranging from construction and plumbing to electrical  engineering and software development, with one recent study from the  Association of Equipment Manufacturers finding that the legislation  will create about a half a million jobs.   It will also help address issues at our ports by providing increased  funding for the Port Infrastructure Development Program, investments in  our freight system through rail and waterway and highway and air  freight investments. So it actually addresses a real problem we have  right now.   By the way, these investments are long-term investments. It won't be  a lot of money spent in the next year or so; it will be a lot of money,  though, spent over the next 5, 10, 15 years to improve this  infrastructure. And they will be long-term assets that will last for  decades. So it is a different kind of spending than the stimulus  spending.   All of this will help improve the movement of goods throughout our  country. That is why every business group in America is supporting this  legislation, not just the chamber of commerce but every group out  there--by the way, as well as all the agriculture groups. Over 30 ag  groups, including the American Farm Bureau, are supporting this  legislation. It is why a lot of the union members are supporting it  too. In fact, the AFL-CIO Building Trades Council is strongly in  support of this legislation because they know it is going to create  good-paying jobs, good benefits, allowing people to get out there and  build things.   Even more importantly, to me, given the recent economic news we have  seen, this proposal will not cause inflation to increase. Why? Because  it is spending on the supply side rather than the demand side of the  economy, as economists would say. Conservative economist Doug Holtz- Eakin, who is the former Director of the Congressional Budget Office,  now head of the American Action Forum, and Michael Strain, who is the  director of economic policy studies at the American Enterprise  Institute, also a conservative scholar, have said that our bipartisan  infrastructure package will slow down inflation. They said:         Improving roads, bridges, and ports would make it less       costly for businesses to operate, allowing them to increase       their output per hour and putting downward pressure on       consumer prices.    Again, this is long-term spending capital assets. It makes the  economy more efficient; therefore, more productive. That is  counterinflationary. So this is the right time to do this kind of  project.   To me, this bill makes all the sense in the world, given the trouble  and uncertain stage of our economy. It gets relief to our supply  chains. It makes long-term investments in hard assets that do boost our  productivity in this country. It has a counterinflationary effect on  the economy. So why hasn't it passed? What is the problem? Again, it  got 69 votes here in the U.S. Senate. Well, unfortunately, the answer  is politics. Democrats in the House of Representatives want to do  everything they can to tie their big $3.5 trillion-plus tax-and-spend  bill we talked about earlier to the infrastructure investment because  they know that is the only way their partisan bill is going to get the  votes needed to pass. So they held it hostage.   Hard-core progressives don't like the bipartisan infrastructure bill  because it doesn't have the tax increases; it doesn't haven't the Green  New Deal policies; it doesn't have all the new social spending programs  that are in this reconciliation bill that they really want.   But holding this investment in infrastructure hostage to this larger  tax-and-spend bill is just wrong. It is playing politics. And it is  playing politics with the American people.   It is also counter to the pledge that President Biden made to the  bipartisan group that negotiated this agreement and made to the  American people. President Biden supports this infrastructure  legislation. He said he didn't get everything he wanted. Nobody did.  But he supports it. He wants it to move forward. And he pledged to keep  it separate--separate--from the $3.5 trillion tax-and-spend bill, and  yet what you see in the House is just the opposite.   It is not fair to the American people. They deserve to have the  opportunity to have the infrastructure bill be voted on its own merits.  Let it rise or fall on its own merits. Don't tie it to something else.   House Speaker Nancy Pelosi promised it would come to the House floor  about 6 weeks ago. She promised that to the so-called Democrat  moderates in the House, and it didn't come to the floor. Then she  promised it would come to the floor 3 weeks ago. It didn't come to the  floor for a vote. Now she said, on October 2, that October 31 is the  date. That is Halloween. That is a Sunday. But that is fine. We can  vote on Sundays, even on Halloween. It is so important, we ought to do  it--and do it.   It is past time to take this bill to the floor of the House and let  it be judged on its own merits. If passed, it will strengthen our  economy over the long term and have a positive impact on the lives of  every single American. It is counterinflationary. It makes our economy  more efficient. It adds to,  [[Page S7087]]  again, the supply side, allowing us to see not just a short-term boost  but a longer term boost to our economy.   And wouldn't it be nice to pass something that makes sense around  here that is bipartisan? Instead of jamming Republicans and the country  with another reckless spending bill and raising taxes on this uncertain  economy, let's focus on the infrastructure bill that addresses real  problems we face today. We could use a sensible, bipartisan success  right now, all of us.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
