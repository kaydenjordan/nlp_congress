 Mr. Speaker, you know, if there is an issue that has the  opportunity to pull Congress together, it is the need to fix our  failing infrastructure. You all know the statistics, but suffice it to  say, if your child had the grade of our infrastructure, they would be  going to summer school this summer.   In my district in Colorado, it is the upgrades for Interstate 25  between Denver and Fort Collins for the tens of thousands of commuters  each day; it is the backup from skier traffic returning from the  mountains on Interstate 70, or our Northwest line commuter rail that is  35 years behind schedule.   Of course, there are people who came within a hair's breadth of  missing their flight because of interstate traffic. What is happening  to my district and my State is happening across the country.   But it is not just roads and bridges we need to fix. To connect and  improve our communities, the true definition of infrastructure includes  investments in broadband, 21st century infrastructure, clean water  systems, schools, public rail, pedestrian and bike paths, airports,  energy efficiency, storage, and transmission to make our country  stronger and reduce costs.   Now is the time to act on an infrastructure package that has true  investment. It can't just be toll roads or a giveaway to Wall Street. A  fully paid-for infrastructure package will be a boon for the country,  for our cities, for our towns, for our rural areas, and for the middle  class.   Infrastructure is a today problem that we can come together and  solve. We need to act now and make infrastructure a priority.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I  thank the gentleman for yielding me the customary 30 minutes.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the rule and the underlying  bill, H.R. 1039, but first and foremost, I want to make sure that we  recognize and honor the work and sacrifice that our police and first  responders do each and every day.   This week is National Police Week and, frankly, it is an opportunity  to honor every week, but in particular this week, those who run toward  the gunfire, those who run toward the building on fire every day.   In my own district in Colorado, I hear so many countless stories of  heroic acts and going above and beyond the call of duty by those on the  front lines of keeping us safe. In one example in Colorado, Officer  Ross Maynard responded to a domestic violence situation. The victim's  former boyfriend had broken a living room window in the middle of  January, leaving the victim and her young daughter exposed to our  record cold temperatures. Maynard went above and beyond his duty and  covered the window to keep out the elements. He vacuumed the shattered  glass from the floor when he found out the victim didn't have a vacuum  so that the child didn't receive cuts from the glass.   In example of heroism, dispatcher Sara Demgen calmly helped a man  deliver his son when his wife went into labor and they realized they  wouldn't be able to make it to the hospital.   It is individuals like these who we should celebrate and support  through our work here in Congress. Unfortunately, the legislation we  are considering today doesn't make anyone safer, and if we passed it,  it would bring about a constitutionally dubious process that could  interfere with the important work of law enforcement professionals.   Part of the reason this is problematic legislation is because the  process this legislation followed--like a lot of stuff that we have to  vote on--was not transparent and was not regular order. There was no  hearing on this bill. Even if we look back at last year's version of  the bill, there was no hearing on that one, either.   Then we look at the rule that we are debating now. Mr. Speaker, a  rule means what is the process for amending this bill. What we have  here is a shutting down of that process, where they didn't provide an  open rule. They allowed only one amendment as part of this bill that  had been offered. There was no opportunity on the floor, through what  is called an open rule, for Democrats or Republicans to offer good  ideas to improve this legislation.   Of the six amendments that were submitted that the Committee on Rules  considered yesterday, five of them were killed by the Committee on  Rules and not even allowed to be voted on or debated by the House of  Representatives. Now, the number of times I have had to come to this  floor and argue against a closed rule or a structured rule is  exhausting, and it is contrary to Speaker Ryan's promise that he made  for the world to hear that he would bring us back to regular order and  give everybody input on legislation that we consider in what is  supposed to be the people's House.   This rule, yet again, is not open. It rules five of the six  amendments out of order. The confidence and the trust in the House of  Representatives, it is hard to imagine how it could even sink much  lower, but it is restrictive processes and rules like this where  neither Republicans or Democrats are allowed to even offer amendments  or debate amendments to improve the legislation  [[Page H4327]]  that have led to the record level of distrust in this body.    In a moment, I will look forward to discussing the bill itself, but I  just wanted to take this occasion in particular to celebrate our law  enforcement professionals on National Police Week and every week.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, it seems that with each passing day, we learn  more about the tangled web of conflicts of interest and secret meetings  with Russians in and around the Trump campaign and Trump  administration. Last week, President Trump fired FBI Director James  Comey while he was overseeing the FBI's investigation into possible  collusion between Trump campaign officials and the Russian Government,  after reportedly asking Director Comey personally to drop the  investigation into former National Security Advisor Flynn's ties to  Russia. This week, we also learned that President Trump revealed highly  classified information provided by an ally to Russian officials.   Without President Trump's tax returns, we have no way of knowing if  he himself has financial ties or is financially beholden to Russia or  Russian interests, as news reports have suggested. The American people  deserve to know whether or not President Trump has conflicts of  interest, financial interests, or business dealings with Russia or  other foreign governments. It is imperative that we, as the people's  representatives, hold the executive branch fully accountable.   Mr. Speaker, when we defeat the previous question, I will offer an  amendment to the rule to bring up Representative Eshoo's bill, H.R.  305, which would require Presidents and major party nominees for the  Presidency to release their tax returns.   If the President truly has nothing to hide, including business  dealings or being economically beholden to Russia, he should freely  release his tax returns to reassure the American people that they can  have confidence that he is not acting out of conflict of interest but,  rather, in our interest as a nation.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Colorado?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, to discuss our important proposal, I yield 5  minutes to the distinguished gentlewoman from California (Ms. Eshoo).    Mr. Speaker, to discuss our important proposal, I yield 5  minutes to the distinguished gentlewoman from California (Ms. Eshoo).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Mrs. Demings), the former Orlando police chief, and my good  friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentlewoman.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   As the gentleman knows, we grant necessary waivers for amendments all  the time. It is a very routine thing. So to argue it is not germane,  the Rules Committee can grant the necessary waivers for any of these  amendments. And, frankly, these amendments are more germane to what the  American people care about than the underlying bill.    Mrs. Demings' amendment that states that the Director of the FBI may  only be removed for inefficiency or neglect of duty or misuse of  office, what could be more germane to the concerns of the American  people than that? All it would have taken was granting necessary  waivers, as the Rules Committee does regularly on a number of bills  when it suits their interests.   Another amendment from Representative Kennedy was rejected to  reinstate the authority to appoint independent counsel for purposes of  an independent investigation.   One from Representative Lawrence was rejected to reinstate the  authority for independent counsel.   Representative Lieu had an amendment to reinstate the authority for  independent counsel to investigate and was not allowed.   Representative Moulton had one.   So all of those amendments, even though they are more germane than  any of the other items of what the American people care about, were,  nevertheless, not granted the necessary waivers to be included in this  bill.   The bill we are considering under this bill is highly problematic.  It, frankly, serves to hurt the very people it purports to protect.   I know we all value the safety of our first responders and the safety  of our communities. This bill would hurt the relationship police have  with communities without any need. It is truly a solution in search of  a problem.   This legislation would give Federal probation officers authority to  arrest third parties, not the person that they are working with on  probation, the ability to arrest them without a warrant.   When referring to third parties, that means people who are not under  the authority of the police officer. It could mean a mother of someone  on probation, a roommate, somebody who shares a house, and somebody  doesn't want the probation officer to come into their room because the  probation officer doesn't have a warrant, even if the parolee is in a  different room.   We need to remember that an individual, of course, gives up some of  their rights, including their Fourth Amendment rights, as a condition  of probation. But not everybody who comes into contact with that person  also should be required to give up their Fourth Amendment rights. The  mother in this example has not given up those constitutional rights,  which read: ``The right of the people to be secure in their persons,  houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and  seizures, shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon  probable cause. . . .''   And simply being a roommate or a family member of somebody who is on  probation should not mean you lose your constitutional rights as an  American citizen.   If in this example the mother doesn't want the probation officer to  enter her room, she has that right, unlike the parolee. But this bill  would change the dynamics and allow the probation officer to say she  was interfering and arrest her, something that likely violates her  Fourth Amendment protections and would be overturned by the courts.   This would make family and friends of individuals entering probation  from prison scared of allowing the person on probation to live in their  homes. This could lead to increased recidivism and increased crime. It  will create a huge hindrance to the probation system and the goal of  successfully encouraging people to reenter society and avoid breaking  the law.   If people don't have a family member or friend to live with,  successful reentry becomes harder and almost impossible. We need to  remember that probation officers are part of the judicial branch, but  police are members of the executive branch. Not only does this  legislation complicate that, but it is a violation of separation of  powers.   When an individual is granted probation, as a condition of that  probation they give up certain rights, and that is understandable, and  under the authority and supervision of the judicial branch in doing so.  Third parties have not made that agreement with the judicial branch.  They are not their jurisdiction. They are not adjudicated by the  judicial branch. And probation officers should not have the authority  to arrest them without a warrant provided by an officer of the peace.   However, even if we don't care about the constitutional rights of  citizens, which I certainly hope we care about, we should care about  the fact that this bill would reduce the safety of our probation  officers. This legislation creates a very unsafe situation for our  probation officers who are not trained in law enforcement.   On average, a Federal probation officer completes six weeks of  training. That is compared to 21 weeks of training and 3 weeks of field  for a police officer. That is simply not the same level of training.   With the disparity, doesn't it make sense for probation officers to  use the assistance of police when they actually do need to arrest an  uncooperative third party or serve a warrant based on probable cause?   With additional police powers come more likelihood people could be  put in harm's way, and that is the opposite of what we want for someone  who doesn't have the proper training.   I also want to talk about why the bill is so bad. In many ways, I  asked myself the question: What problem are we trying to solve? Even if  we look at the associations that are pushing for this legislation, the  data just doesn't show that there is a need or that this would be a  productive step towards either keeping our communities safer--and this  bill would also put the lives of our probation officers at risk.   In a letter earlier this year, the Federal Law Enforcement Officers  Association stated that ``formal arrests by probation officers are  rare.'' And 2015 data shows that, of the 987 searches conducted, only  30 uncooperative third parties, and even less arrests.   With so few incidents, it is, frankly, better for probation officers  to call or use the assistance of well-trained police officers, if  needed. That is the answer.   The proponents of this bill claim they have brought the bill forward  at the request of our first responders. But the request was not even  close to unanimous.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter signed by officers,  chiefs of police, probation officers, and other first responders in  opposition to the bill.                                                       May 16, 2017.        Dear Member of Congress:  We are current or retired law       enforcement officers concerned about public safety,       constitutional policing practices, and building trust between       law enforcement and the communities we serve. In light of       Police Week, some Members of Congress have sponsored bills       that would increase incarceration rates, enhance penalties       for certain crimes, and, ultimately, weaken relationships       between communities and police departments.  [[Page H4329]]         The idea that ``law and order'' has declined in the       previous decade does a disservice to the law enforcement       officers who have taken oaths to protect and serve their       local communities. Those officers deserve programs and       policies that fund critical training, enhance important       policing skills that improve officer and public safety, and       offer technical assistance and operational support. We are       deeply troubled by recent legislative and executive actions       that support this divisive ``law and order'' rhetoric and       that chip away at our hard-fought efforts to sustain long-      term trust between our communities and law enforcement       agencies.        As officers who have handled high-profile incidents and       routine investigations, we know that keys to success are       strong leadership and morale, officer training and       accountability, and community trust and engagement. Below, we       offer several recommendations based upon these principles.        Programs that support mental health services for officers.       A number of law enforcement agencies are increasingly       recognizing the importance of regular mental health checks,       crisis hotlines, peer mentoring programs, and other mental       health services to alleviate the stress and trauma that       officers face.        Policies and programs for de-escalation and crisis       intervention training. As a result of such training, law       enforcement agencies learn to apply strategies that reduce       the likelihood of force-related incidents. De-escalation       training is essential to reducing the number of violent       confrontations between law enforcement and communities, as       well as increasing methods for age appropriate responses when       interacting with youth to improve their safety and well-being       in communities. These trainings promote best practices and,       as a result, reduce the risk of injury to police officers and       members of the community.        Policies that promote crisis intervention training       incorporating the services of mental health professionals.       Such professionals can assist officers in identifying and       responding to a person impacted by mental illness, an       intoxicating substance, or emotional distress. The public       safety benefits resulting from this training are well-      documented and broadly supported by policing and public       safety experts.        Programs that assist officers with understanding the       effects of systemic trauma and better deal with the aftermath       of trauma. Trauma sensitivity or trauma informed training can       help officers identify individuals showing signs of trauma       related behaviors, which may include: aggression; difficulty       processing information; impulsiveness; heightened fight,       flight, or freeze response; and hypersensitivity to noise or       physical contact. Training can help law enforcement avoid       interpreting such behaviors as requiring more aggression or       use of force and, instead, guide officers to respond in a       more informed and appropriate manner.        Policies and programs that incorporate implicit bias       training into police training at all levels. Implicit bias       training helps police officers mitigate racial bias during       community interactions, encourage respectful encounters, and       promote constitutional policing with the goal of building       trust with communities.        Programs that collect data on deaths and use-of-force       incidents by law enforcement. Specifically, we encourage you       to support the Federal Bureau of Investigation National Use-      of-Force Data Collection Program, which expands the Uniform       Crime Report Program to include use of force incidents by law       enforcement resulting in serious bodily injury. The Death in       Custody Reporting Act, which was signed into law in 2014,       must also be properly implemented.        Support the Collaborative Reform Initiative of the U.S.       Department of Justice's (DOJ) Office of Community Oriented       Policing Services. The Collaborative Reform Initiative is a       valuable program that offers technical assistance and       operational support to local police departments to improve       policing practices, transparency, professionalism,       accountability, community inclusion, and procedural fairness.       The Collaborative Reform Initiative enables police       departments--which participate on a voluntary basis--to       sustain longterm, significant reforms in a manner that       improves trust between police and communities and meets the       public safety goals of residents. The work of DOJ's Civil       Rights Division around policing must also be supported and       sustained.        During Police Week, we urge you to prioritize federal       programs, funding, and legislation that support the above       polices, rather than legislation that would undercut       partnerships with our local communities. We invite you to       reach out to us about the above priorities and ask that you       support legislation and funding that champion these important       issues.            Sincerely,        Hassan Aden, Police Chief (Ret.), Greenville (NC) Police       Department; Chief James Abbott, West Orange (NJ) Police       Department; Officer Nick Bucci (Ret.), New Jersey State       Police; Sheriff Jerry L.

Mr. Speaker, as they state, in part, in the letter: ``We  are deeply troubled by recent legislative and executive actions that  support this divisive `law and order' rhetoric and that chip away at  our hard-fought efforts to sustain long-term trust between our  communities and law enforcement agencies.''   This letter is signed by many current and former police chiefs,  sheriffs, and other law enforcement officials.   In the letter that I included in the Record, which will now appear  for the world to see, law enforcement professionals say that instead of  pushing forward with this bill that we are being asked to consider  under a closed and restrictive rule, we should focus on mental health  and trauma services for officers to support them, programs and policies  for de-escalation and crises intervention training, better staffing for  our police agencies and probation officers, programs and policies that  incorporate implicit bias training into police training and probation  office training, and community-oriented policing. These are the types  of policies that Democrats, and myself, would love to put forward  during National Police Week to support our law enforcement  professionals and to keep our communities safe.   Why aren't we focusing on those kinds of ideas, rather than a  solution in search of a problem?   It is National Police Week, and we should be supporting legislation  that protects and supports our police, not create a greater schism  between our community and police through an unconstitutional bill that  puts the lives of our probation officers at risk, and will likely  increase recidivism among those on probation.                                time  1300    We can do better. That is why I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on  this rule and to vote ``no'' on the underlying legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further  proceedings on this question will be postponed.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.
