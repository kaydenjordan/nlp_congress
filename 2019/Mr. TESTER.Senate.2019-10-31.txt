 Madam President, I have a number of things I want to talk  about today. On Monday of this week, we lost a fine lady in Kay Hagan.  It is very difficult for me to put into words my admiration for the  Senator from North Carolina, but the fact is, Kay was the kind of  person who, the first time you met her, had the ability to calm the  situation down.   When she was running in 2008, I went to North Carolina, and she had  an event at a farm. I think it was a hog operation, if my memory serves  me correctly. I had a chance to meet her for the first time. She was  somebody who you knew, if she were able to get into this body, would be  successful.   Well, in 2008, she won that election. She came here, and she made a  difference. She made a difference for working families, small  businesses, and family farm agriculture.   I just want to express my condolences to her husband Chip, her kids  and grandkids, and let them know she was very loved by all in this  body.                                  Healthcare    Madam President, I also want to rise today and speak on behalf of the  thousands of Montanans who have preexisting conditions or struggle with  the cost of prescription drugs.   Even with the Affordable Care Act's protections, many of these folks  struggle to afford their medical bills, their copays at the pharmacy  counter and  [[Page S6318]]  the local doctors' offices. Instead of working to fix these problems,  this administration--the Trump administration--has issued a rule that  brings us back to the dark ages by letting insurance companies  discriminate against working families across Montana and this country.   The Affordable Care Act guaranteed health coverage for all Americans.  It required health insurance companies to issue policies to folks  regardless of whether they had preexisting conditions. The Trump  administration is chipping away at these laws, and they are tossing  these protections out the window so that big insurance can make big  bucks.   Health insurance companies across this country are flooding the  market with junk plans. They are called junk plans because they are  cheap insurance that are junk. When you think you have health insurance  and you get sick, it is not there.   Trust me, I know firsthand how this works. When I was 9 years old, I  lost three fingers in a meat grinder, and my folks thought they had  insurance. They didn't because they had bought a junk plan. They ended  up paying every dime for the surgeries related to my left hand out of  their pockets--money they didn't have.   These plans tell folks they have insurance, but, truthfully, they  don't. They have less coverage, and they don't even cover the most  essential health benefits.   Need prescription drugs? You can get them, but it's going to cost  you. Maternity care? Sorry, the plan doesn't cover that. Mental health?  You would not get that coverage in your wildest dreams. These insurers  will tell you that you are getting a great deal, but the truth of the  matter is your pocketbook is going to pay the price. God forbid if you  ever get in a situation where you need to use it.   What we see is insurance companies lining their pockets and selling  plans that do nothing. And the majority leader is working to make it  easier for them to do it, all by blocking reasonable, bipartisan bills  to improve the ACA and make healthcare more affordable to working  families and small businesses around this country.   The Senate was established by our Founders as the greatest  deliberative body in the world to be a check and balance on the Office  of the Presidency, the executive branch. That simply is not occurring  right now.   I mean take a look at the tariff situation. The President puts on  tariffs in a knee-jerk reaction, doesn't bring any of our allies along.  We are seeing small businesses and family farm agriculture literally  being put to the point of being put out of business, and this body lets  him do it. A couple of weeks ago, the President said: You know what, we  are pulling our troops out of northern Syria, and to hell with our  allies.   The Kurds, who have been fighting with us, fighting as partners for  the last 15 years, well, too bad. Done nothing. No checks and balances.   The President asked for other countries to come in and influence our  elections, and it seems like the Senate is just fine with that. The  greatest country in the world is going to let other countries determine  who is elected to our elected offices in this country, whether it be  the Presidency, the Senate, or any of us.   Now, we can't even pass a budget. We continue to kick the can down  the road. We do have a vote on the Defense bill, which by the way, this  body is going to allow the President, if the majority leader has his  way, to take any amount of money they want out of that Defense bill and  put it into a wall--a wall that costs $25 million to $35 million a  mile--and we are not even talking about expenses down the road for  upkeep.   So we just deal with continuing resolutions--more uncertainty, more  uncertainty for families, more uncertainty for business. So right now,  we are standing by letting funding for our schools, our roads, our  hospitals run out, leaving families across this country--especially in  rural America and States like Montana--without resources to be able to  do the job.   And that is exactly the case for community health centers in this  country. These facilities provide lifesaving care to nearly one-tenth  of people in Montana, running 65 healthcare clinics across our State.  They don't even know if they are going to have funding come November  21st when the continuing resolution we passed expires.   How can we expect these places to stay open, let alone recruit and  retain staff, when they don't even know if they are going to be around  in another month? What do I say to folks when their own community  health clinics like Hardin, or Libby, or Haver--these communities rely  on these health clinics to keep their communities healthy. And quite  frankly, because we can't sit down and negotiate and come up with long- term funding agreements, they potentially are going to be out of  business.   But the uncertainty for families doesn't start there. The number of  kids who don't have insurance has gone up since this administration  started its war on healthcare. Kids in Montana are getting the worst of  it. The number of kids in my State without insurance went up 25 percent  between 2016 and 2018.   Let me say that again. The number of kids in the State of Montana  without insurance went up 25 percent between 2016 and 2018. That is the  fifth highest percentage jump in the United States. There are places  worse. The kids being hit hardest are the kids that are in the most  vulnerable groups. They are in Indian Country, which continues to have  the highest uninsured rate in this country. These young folks are our  future leaders. They are our next generation. We are not doing our job.  We are failing them.   This coordinated sabotage of our healthcare system by this  administration and this body is unacceptable, and our children deserve  better. I am not going to sit here and tell you that the Affordable  Care Act was perfect. I said from day one that we needed to work  together to make improvements and build upon the successes that were in  that bill.   The ACA allowed States like Montana to pass Medicaid Expansion. That  insured more than 90,000 Montanans in the process and helped greatly  toward keeping our small hospitals open.   It helped millions of Montanans with preexisting conditions rest easy  at night knowing that they were not going to be kicked off their plans  because of that preexisting condition or hit an annual cap on care. All  of that is gone. Americans have spoken clearly. They want more access  to affordability, not less. When my colleagues on the other side of the  aisle attempted to repeal the ACA a couple of years ago, folks all  across this country stood up and said: No.   But here we are again, watching the majority and the Trump  administration pushing plans to rip away affordable health insurance  from hardworking Americans. I would encourage my colleagues to join  together in working and find a bipartisan solution to improve our  healthcare system. We need to reduce health insurance premiums and out- of-pocket costs. We need to crack down on skyrocketing prescription  drugs, and we need to expand insurance to more Americans. We need to  make sure that when people put their hard-earned money on the line to  buy an insurance policy, that it is not junk.                   Congratulating the Washington Nationals    Mr. President, now, on a lighter subject. Back in my early years on  the farm, I would come in on Wednesday night and there would be  baseball night in Canada. I got to watch the Montreal Expos for a  couple of decades play some pretty darned good baseball. They didn't  win, but they were very entertaining.   That franchise moved to Washington, DC, I think in 2006, the same  year I got elected to the United States Senate. So consequently, I got  to watch the Nats and be entertained by them again--occasionally, even  in person.   Last night, they did the impossible. After being 19 and 31, I believe  around the 23rd, 24th of May of this year, they ripped off a hundred  games and won the World Series. I just want to congratulate them on  that feat and look forward to a repeat next season.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.
