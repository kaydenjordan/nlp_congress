 Mr. President, first, I want to thank my colleagues for  coming down here and having this important discussion. I want to thank  my Democratic colleagues, for whom I have a lot of respect, for being  here and having this debate. I am sure it is not going to be the first  time that we are going to be doing this on the Green New Deal or other  elements of proposals coming from the House or the Senate. This is a  big issue happening in the House and what is going to happen over here  with some of our colleagues.   I think, in many ways, it is an issue that focuses on the future and  where the country is going. As the majority leader recently said in an  interview, ``I can pretty safely say this is the first time in my  political career that the essence of America is being debated . . . of  socialism and democratic capitalism.''   OK. Let's have that debate. We are having that debate. What is the  essence of America? I believe it is freedom and liberty. That is what  we are founded on, and that is what I think proposals like the Green  New Deal would undermine. To be clear, some people are joking about  it--like banning hamburgers or airplanes or returning to the horse and  buggy, but I actually think there are many people who are looking at  this very seriously, and so we should.   Some of these kinds of ideas can be funny until they are not funny.  What we are trying to do here is to talk about this proposal in a  serious manner. In my State, the great State of Alaska, this is a  deadly serious matter. There is so much that is in this idea, the Green  New Deal--government takeover, healthcare, free housing, and free food,  and the list goes on and on. The costs, as have been pointed out, are  very high.   Today what I want to do is to talk about one aspect that would be  particularly detrimental to my State and  [[Page S1688]]  to many other States--my colleagues from West Virginia and North Dakota  are here on the floor--and that is this proposal to ban hydrocarbons  produced in America within a decade. This is not a joke.   There are many Members in this body--some are on the floor right now,  and some are in the House--who think this is a serious proposal and  would like to do it. I want to talk about that. I want to stipulate  that I am certainly somebody who is in favor of ``all of the above''  energy. The fact that America is now producing more oil, more gas, and  more renewables than any other country in the world is good for all of  us, Democrats and Republicans.   My colleague from Rhode Island is here. He and I have worked on a  whole host of issues together involving oceans. I think the  technological advances with regard to hundreds of years of supplies of  natural gas with technology and with renewables provide huge  opportunities for Democrats and Republicans to work together to bring  down greenhouse gas emissions. This is enormous. We are just scratching  the surface.   I look forward to working with him and the Senator from Massachusetts  on these kinds of ideas because I think they are exciting, and I think,  when you are burning natural gas at very high temperatures, you almost  have very little greenhouse gas emissions. Combine that with technology  and renewables. We have hundreds of years of these supplies. It is a  great opportunity, and it is exciting. I want to work with them.   Let me get back to the proposal on the Green New Deal on natural  resources.   In my opinion, we do not spend enough time on this floor talking  about the positive societal benefits of natural resource development in  America--oil, gas, renewables, fisheries. These industries don't just  fuel our power generation and transportation and electricity for our  homes; these industries literally lift people out of poverty. They  lengthen life expectancy. They literally save lives. There is a strong  correlation between poverty, the lack of economic opportunity, and the  health of our citizens.   I am going to show a few charts here.   This correlation is strong in my State, particularly with our Alaska  Native population. In 1954, the Interior Department, with the help of  the University of Pittsburgh, conducted a study of the health of Alaska  Natives.   Here is a quote from 1954: ``The indigenous people of Native Alaska  are the victims of sickness, crippling conditions and premature death  to a degree exceeded in very few parts of the world.''   Some of the poorest people on the planet were my constituents in  Alaska--in America--in 1954. More than 10 years later, in 1969--just 50  years ago--the situation was still dire.   Here is what Emil Notti, the president of the Alaska Federation of  Natives, told Congress 50 years ago, in 1969:         The native people in rural Alaska live in the most       miserable homes in the United States. The life expectancy of       the average Native Alaskan is 34 years old compared to 69       years old for the rest of the country.    So what happened after that?   We had a big change. We are not there yet, but we had a big change,  and I want to explain. This was a chart that was studied just last year  in the Journal of Internal Medicine. It is a study that was published  in 2018 about the life expectancies of Americans.   Where you see blue and purple is where Americans' life expectancy  increased the most. The State with the greatest change in the entire  country was in my State. By the way, that is a pretty important  statistic--life expectancy. It doesn't get more important than that.  Are you living longer? Look what happened in Alaska. The North Slope of  Alaska, the Aleutian Islands chain, and the southeast all experienced  huge increases in life expectancy from these very low levels, some of  the lowest in the world.   Why did that happen?   On the North Slope of Alaska, this Congress passed the Trans-Alaska  Pipeline Authorization Act to develop Prudhoe Bay, to develop oil and  gas--some of the biggest fields in the world. At the same time, we also  had a very large zinc mine that came into production. Because of this  body's Magnuson-Stevens Act, we also had a huge increase in our  fisheries.   The bottom line is that natural resource development happened in  Alaska, in America, and people's lives increased. That is a remarkable  thing, and we don't talk about it enough. The average life expectancy  increase in Alaska was almost between 8 and 13 years. That is a measure  of success because we were developing our resources of oil and gas.  That is why I am taking this Green New Deal literally deadly seriously  because what we have done in our State and in our country by producing  resources is we have created the ability for people to actually live  longer, and I challenge my colleagues to come up with a better  statistic and a more important statistic than that.   I am going to end with a quote from a gentleman who came down here  and testified in front of the Senate, Matthew Rexford--a proud Alaska  Native leader from Kaktovik, AK, which is in the Arctic National  Wildlife Refuge. He testified that Congress should give his small  community the opportunity to develop the resources near his village. We  did that in 2017 after a 40-year debate.   He spoke firsthand about his knowledge as to what resource  development did for America, for Alaska, and for his community:         The oil and gas industry supports our communities by       providing jobs, business opportunities, infrastructure       investment. It has built our schools, hospitals. It has moved       our people from Third World living conditions to what we       expect in America. We refuse to go backward in time.    That is what he said. I believe the Green New Deal--certainly, its  ban on hydrocarbon production--would take us back in time. For the sake  of Matthew and all of these Alaskans who have done so well by  responsibly developing our resources, we are not going to allow that to  happen.   I yield the floor to my colleague from North Dakota.    I yield my time to the Senator from North Dakota.    Mr. President, I believe I still have the floor.    Mr. President, it is Alaskan of the Week time on the  Senate floor, my favorite time of the week to talk about someone who  has made a difference in my State. As you know, and as all the pages  know, I try to come down to the floor every week to talk about someone  who is in Alaska doing a great job for America, for their community,  for the State, and what I believe is the best State in the country. I  know we can all debate that.   Some of you might take issue a little bit with the characterization  of the best State, but we certainly have some bragging rights on some  elements that make us the most unique State in America. For example,  right now, the Iditarod, the Last Great Race, is underway, with 52  mushers and their dog teams--up to 14 dogs--barreling for well over 900  miles across the State of Alaska toward Nome in some of the most harsh,  difficult, and rugged terrain in the world. That is just one of the  many things that makes us unique. We have the Iditarod, the Northern  Lights that dance in the sky, communities that still hunt whales to  feed their villages, which they have been doing for centuries. We have  the most fish and the longest coastline. As a matter of fact, our  coastline is longer than the rest of the lower 48's coastline combined.  We have the tallest mountain in the world, and we have a mountain of a  Congressman named Don Young.   Usually, Alaskans of the Week are reserved for people who aren't so  visible, who aren't legends, who maybe are doing something in their  community that not a lot of people are noticing. Today, March 6, 2019,  I couldn't resist because Don Young, the Dean of the House, has  officially become the longest continuously serving Republican in the  Congress in U.S. history. Let me repeat that. Today, Don Young has  become the longest, continually serving Republican in the Congress-- Senate or House--in the history of the United States of America. He was  already here when every single Member of Congress was sworn in. Think  about that. For every Member who has been sworn in, in the Senate or in  the House, Don Young was here. In fact, according to Roll Call, there  are at least 75 Members of the House who were not even born when Don  Young came to Washington. That is an amazing achievement.   He has served Alaska and our country so well for 46 years that it was  only right to feature him as the Alaskan of the Week and to make a  special Alaskan of the Week poster with the young Don Young and  President Ford and many others and Don in uniform. We just love Don  Young in Alaska. Congrats to Don.   Where do we begin to talk about Congressman Young and the enormous  impact he has had on Alaska and America? Let me start in Central  California, where he was raised on a small ranch. He began the hard  work of ranching young. ``My dad was a good man,'' Don said, ``but he  believed that when you turned 7, you became a hired man.'' So he worked  sunup to sundown. It was hot, riddled with snakes, and poison ivy. When  he was still young, his dad read him the book ``The Call of the Wild''  by Jack London. Alaska sounded really good to Don Young. It was cold,  not hot, and there were lots of dogs. He loved dogs. There were no  snakes and no poison ivy.   After he got out of the Army in 1959, the year Alaska became a State,  he heeded the call of the wild and headed up the Alcan--much of it was  still unpaved--in a brandnew Plymouth Fury. Alaska would never be the  same.   He fought forest fires. He owned a skating rink for a short time, but  the BIA school needed a teacher in Fort Yukon, way up in the Interior  on the Yukon River--a place he still, to this day, calls home and has a  home there. In fact, he jokes that he is the only Congressman who uses  an outhouse when he goes home. Anyway, he went to coach and teach fifth  grade. He became a trapper, a gold miner, and a tugboat captain.  Eventually, he met Lou, his wife, who stayed by his side for 46 years  until she passed in 2009. Now he has found another partner in Ann.  Thank you, Ann, for continuing to share him with all of us.    Don, with Lou's prompting, caught the political bug. He served in the  State House in Alaska. He served in the State Senate in Alaska. He  learned some good lessons there; namely, that his time in the State  Senate taught him that he was more of a House guy, where bills move  fast, where elections are right around the corner no matter what, and  where the action is.   Along the way, they had two wonderful daughters, which to Don are  still  [[Page S1699]]  the most important things in his life. Then Lou talked him into running  for Congress, and with the help of people like my wife's grandmother  who was an avid Don Young supporter, he began to introduce himself to a  wider audience.   Due to a tragic airplane accident that took the life of then- Congressman Nick Begich, Don Young was appointed to his seat in 1973.  He won the next special election, and because he has been so effective  for our State--he passed more than 90 bills, mostly to help Alaska--and  because he knows so many of our fellow Alaskans by name because he is  fiercely loyal, and because he has helped hundreds of his fellow  Alaskans since 1973, he has been reelected every year since. I can't  count how many elections that is, but it is a lot.   He is consistently ranked among the Congress's most effective  legislators. He was just recently ranked the most effective legislator,  No. 1 in the House, by the nonpartisan group the Center for Effective  Lawmaking. Heck, even in his freshman year, Ralph Nader said he was the  most powerful Congressman in the Congress. I imagine that he came to  that conclusion with some trepidation.   You will not hear Don Young talk about these things because he  doesn't like to brag. He is a humble man, so let me do a little  bragging on his behalf. Nearly everything, and I mean everything, that  has advanced Alaska legislatively has Don Young's fingerprints on them,  from the Trans-Alaska Pipeline to the Ketchikan Shipyard, to the many  land exchanges--kind of like what we just did recently on the Senate  floor under Senator Murkowski's leadership--to the health clinics  dotting our State, to the state-of-the-art Alaska Native Medical Center  in Anchorage, Don Young has played a critical part in all of this.   He is tenacious. Just last Congress, Don Young in the House, and  Senator Murkowski and I in the Senate, finally, after 40 years, got  ANWR opened in terms of the ability for responsible resource  development in the 1002 area of our State.   One of his biggest victories was the role he played in the Magnuson- Stevens Act, which transformed the American fishing industry. Among  other things, the act created a 200-mile limit to keep foreign  fishermen from plundering our fish and to sustain our fisheries. It  wasn't easy to get that bill passed through Congress. Congressman Young  worked it on the House side, and Ted Stevens, of course, worked it in  the Senate.   After it passed the Congress, he still wasn't finished. President  Ford was considering vetoing this legislation. His Secretary of State,  Henry Kissinger, thought it would raise tensions with key allies,  especially Japan and Korea because they fished 3 miles right off the  shores of Alaska, and we pushed them out to 200 miles with this  legislation.   So on Air Force One in 1974, I believe, with a stopover at Alaska,  Don Young, the new Congressman, debated one of the smartest guys in  Washington, Henry Kissinger, in front of President Ford on whether the  Magnuson-Stevens Act, which would transform our fisheries, should be  vetoed. Kissinger argued it should; Don Young argued it should not.  Well, guess who won that debate on Air Force One. Legend has it that at  the end, Henry Kissinger and Don Young met for a martini after the  debate Don Young won. They are still good friends today. That is just  another example.   Don Young has been good friends with Presidents and has discussed the  issues of the day with some of the most important people in the world,  but through it all, he has never lost his fundamental goodness, sense  of fair play, honor, and his willingness to reach across the aisle to  help another Member.   He has never forgotten who he works for. He works for the people of  Alaska, and he has remained a man of the people since he was elected.  He has never, not for a second, lost his love for our great State. He  could have done anything, and he chose to stay, year after year, decade  after decade, to serve the people of our State and the people of  America. He recently said:         Every day I try to do something for somebody in some group.       And every day I try to learn something new. We all go into       the ground the same way. The only thing we can leave behind       [here on this Earth] are our accomplishments.    Well, he has notched numerous accomplishments, and he is far from  finished. If I had my guess, I would also say he is far from finished  with some of his famous theatrics too: brandishing walrus parts and  steel traps on the floor of the House, maybe an altercation or two with  colleagues that may or may not involve a sharp weapon, and campaign  commercials that border on the humorous. Don Young is not finished  speaking his mind and giving us Alaskans his heart.   It has been an honor to serve our great State next to this historic  figure. So Congressman Young, for your service, for your mentorship,  and friendship with me, thank you for all you have done for all of us  in Alaska and in America.   Congratulations on being the longest serving Republican in the  Congress in U.S. history today, and even more important, thank you and  congratulations on being our Alaskan of the Week.   I yield the floor.
