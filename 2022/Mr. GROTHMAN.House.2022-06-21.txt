 Mr. Speaker, this is directed to the press as much as  to the Chair and whoever is listening at home.   Everybody knows we have a lot of inflation. We are supposed to repeat  again and again that inflation was at 8.6 percent in May, which is the  highest it has been in 40 years. The press should report that there is  no way inflation is only 8.6 percent.   Housing is listed as going up 5.5 percent. Have you talked to any  landlords? Have you talked to any builders? There is a contorted way  that you arrive at that 5.5 percent. That number should be more like 15  to 20 to 25 percent.   Talk to some car dealers. See if they think the cost of used cars has  gone up only 16.1 percent in the last year. That number should be 30  percent.   We should not let the administration get away with such low numbers.  I call upon the American press to do a little bit of research for once  and tell us what the real cost of living has gone up in this country  over the last year. It is way more than 8.6 percent.                            ____________________
