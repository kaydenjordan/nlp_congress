 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 18, the No  Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act. This bill codifies the Hyde  amendment which ensures that taxpayer dollars aren't spent on  abortions.   For over 40 years, both Democrats and Republicans have understood the  value of this important protection which has saved more than 2.4  million lives. The right to life precedes all other rights and is  fundamental to everything I believe.   I urge my colleagues across the aisle to embrace life and support  H.R. 18. As President Biden said in 1994, ``Those of us who are opposed  to abortion should not be compelled to pay for them.''   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the Committees on Energy  and Commerce, Ways and Means, and the Judiciary be discharged from  further consideration of H.R. 18, and ask for its immediate  consideration in the House.
