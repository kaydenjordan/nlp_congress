 Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of this  bill.   We find ourselves in a strategic competition with an increasingly  assertive People's Republic of China. The PRC is  [[Page H819]]  trying to manipulate and alter the economic, political, and security  underpinnings of the American-led, rules-based international order, an  order that has brokered decades of peace, prosperity, and stability for  many.    As it has grown in wealth and power, we have seen the PRC bend  international rules and laws to meet its interests, bully nations over  maritime and border disputes, and grow more closed and authoritarian at  home.   Today, the PRC is systematically leveraging its growing military,  economic, and technological heft to compete with us globally. And that  is happening whether we like it or not.   We must reckon with this stark, new reality by positioning America to  win this competition, and H.R. 4521, the America COMPETES Act, does  just that. It powers the engine of the American economy through  investments in science, innovation, and technology. It raises the flag  of American diplomacy and leadership to reassure the world that America  is indeed back at the table, ready to counter China's efforts to  manipulate the international system and to strengthen our allies and  partnerships.   Centering diplomacy and bolstering America's global leadership and  engagement are the themes of my bill, the EAGLE Act, which serves as  the foreign affairs division of the America COMPETES Act.   The EAGLE Act bolsters our diplomacy bilaterally, at regional  organizations, and through groupings like the Quad to ensure that we  bring our partners and allies with us to prevent the PRC from  undermining global rules. It demonstrates that America is capable and  willing to tackle the world's biggest problems and marshal a response  to shared challenges like the current pandemic. And it ensures that the  United States will lead with its values and stand up for international  law and human rights.   In many respects, this legislation goes further than the Senate's  competition bill in terms of responding to the People's Republic of  China's human rights abuses. In addition to sanctions related to the  genocide in Xinjiang, the EAGLE Act contains refugee protections for  Uyghurs and Hong Kongers and also calls for a special envoy for  Xinjiang.   I can say with absolute confidence that when it comes to standing up  for our values, the America COMPETES Act is bold and principled.   Madam Speaker, I support this historic bill, and I urge my fellow  colleagues to do just the same.                                time  1630
