 Madam Speaker, I think a little honesty is in order  tonight. It is no secret that this so-called American Rescue Plan Act  has little to do with the hardships placed on Americans by COVID.   When 90 percent of a spending plan, rammed through on a sham of a  budget resolution, gets spent years down the road, with much of it  having little to do with the coronavirus, we should at least be honest  with our constituents. It is apparently Christmas again.   Here is an example. What does the multiemployer pension issue have to  do with the pandemic? Remember the failed joint select committee that  was supposed to solve that problem back in 2018? That was long before  COVID. But here we are, about to spend $85-plus billion on this  bailout. That is double the amount of money we give to the National  Institutes of Health. Look, before we ask future generations to float  us another $2 trillion to pay off these liberal promises, let's at  least have the integrity to admit that this really isn't about COVID.
