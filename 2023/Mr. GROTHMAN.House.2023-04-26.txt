 Mr. Speaker, I think it is important that everybody in  this Chamber, as well as everybody around America understands the  precarious situation we are in with regard to the debt of this country.   At the end of World War II, the debt was equal to about 100 percent  of GDP, but in World War II we knew we were going to stop making tanks,  stop making planes, stop making ships, and we were going to lay off a  lot of the military folks.   Then the debt dropped from 100 percent GDP down to 20 percent, went  up to 40 percent, and since the Great Recession, it shot up to near 100  percent again, near the all-time record.   The Biden administration has shown no ability to say ``no'' to  anybody. You look at the budget they have proposed. The Department of  the Interior, 9 percent increase; the Department of Commerce, 11  percent increase; the Department of Education, almost a 14 percent  increase. Wherever you look, they still have their foot on the gas.   America has got to realize for our children and grandchildren we have  got to now finally say ``no'' just a little bit.
