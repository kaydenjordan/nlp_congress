 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Montana  veterans who have served our country and continue their service in our  communities.   I recently asked Montanans to nominate a veteran for the 2017 Montana  Congressional Veteran Commendation, a tribute to recognize those who  have served honorably in uniform and in our communities. The response  from Montanans was overwhelming. Fourteen veterans are receiving the  2017 Montana Congressional Veteran Commendation:   Richard Allgood of Big Sky;   Gene Bell of Belgrade;   William Charles of De Borgia;   Richard Gale of Bozeman;   Gary Germundson of Scobey;   Theron Gertz of Butte;   Michael Lawson of Butte;   Phillip Lyons of Butte;   Daniel Ritter of Bozeman;  [[Page H9528]]    Frank Stoltz of Miles City;   Kevin Strickler of Belgrade;   Kyle Sukhbir of Livingston;   Loice Trotter of Libby;   Stanley Watson of Forsyth.   On behalf of all Montanans, I thank the recipients of the 2017  Montana Congressional Veteran Commendation for their sacrifices and  selfless service.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:        Page 4, strike lines 1 through 5 and insert the following:        ``(3) any supervisor or manager of an individual who is       required to complete a probationary period under this section       receives periodic notifications of the end date of such       period not later than 1 year, 6 months, 3 months, and 30 days       before such end date; and    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 635, the gentleman  from Montana (Mr. Gianforte) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Montana.           Modification to Amendment No. 3 Offered by Mr. Gianforte     Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to modify the  amendment in the form I have placed at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the modification.   The Clerk read as follows:         Page 5, strike lines 8 through 12 and insert the following:        ``(3) any supervisor or manager of an individual who is       required to complete a probationary period under this section       receives periodic notifications of the end date of such       period not later than 1 year, 6 months, 3 months, and 30 days       before such end date; and    Mr. GIANFORTE (during the reading). Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous  consent to dispense with the reading.   The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman  from Montana?   There was no objection.   The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the amendment is modified.   There was no objection.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   A longer probationary period for new Federal hires is important to  give supervisors the time they need to evaluate whether a new hire  should gain career employee status. But a longer probationary period  will not accomplish anything if supervisors don't use the extended time  properly.   Managers often don't know the end dates for probationary employees  under their supervision. Because probationary periods end  automatically, without action by a supervisor, an employee can be hired  without a complete assessment of whether the employee is qualified for  full Federal service.   A 2015 Government Accountability Office report recommended automated  systems to notify supervisors when the end of an individual's  probationary period is imminent.                                time  1600    Agencies have these systems. They just need to use them. My amendment  requires supervisors to be notified at a series of regular intervals in  advance of the expiration of a probationary period. The notifications  occur at 1 year, 6 months, 3 months, and 30 days before the scheduled  completion of a probationary period.   This notification will remind supervisors of their responsibilities  to observe employees and provide feedback throughout the probationary  period. It will also remind supervisors to decide whether the employee  is fit for Federal service.   Mr. Chairman, I urge Members to support this amendment, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I thank my friend from Virginia. I urge  adoption of this amendment and the underlying bill, and I yield back  the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment, as modified,  offered by the gentleman from Montana (Mr. Gianforte).   The amendment, as modified, was agreed to.                   Amendment No. 4 Offered by Mr. Connolly    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 4  printed in House Report 115-430.
