Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, the first step to achieving our goal of  overhauling our antiquated and uncompetitive Tax Code is passing a  fiscal year 2018 budget resolution, and we have made the first step in  that journey earlier today. No one should be confused about this. A  vote for the budget is a vote for tax reform. In converse, a vote  against the budget is a vote against tax reform.   I don't know anybody in America who thinks that our Tax Code is a  paragon of simplicity, efficiency, and virtue. To the contrary, I think  most Americans realize that our Tax Code is simply too complex and that  our Tax Code punishes taxpayers here at home by keeping overseas money  earned overseas, rather than being brought back home and being invested  in jobs and wages in America.   The budget resolution will steer our Nation into a safer and sounder  fiscal course through a combination of restraining spending, reducing  tax burdens, and strengthening our economy. Strengthening our economy  really needs to be the focus, like a laser, that we have on what we are  all about here--trying to get the economy to grow again faster.   We know that since the great recession of 2008, our economy has  experienced anemic economic growth. Last quarter we saw that our  economy, instead of growing at the annual rate of about 1.8 percent,  grew at 3.1 percent. Why is that important? Well, when the economy  grows faster, that means that people are finding more work to do and  they are paying their taxes to the Treasury. That eases the financial  burdens of the U.S. Government while allowing people to keep more of  what they earn in their pockets.   Here are some of the goals that we are attempting to accomplish by  the 10-year budget resolution. First of all, we want to try to restrain  Federal spending, parts of which go up at the rate of 5.5 percent or  more a year and is about 70 percent of what the government spends. I  know most people focus on the 30 percent that Congress appropriates,  but, really, that is not the biggest part of the problem. That 30  percent includes about $600-plus billion for defense spending alone.  But the 70 percent of the money that is spent on auto pilot through  mandatory spending programs grows at the rate of about 5.5 percent per  year. That is the reason why we are seeing huge annual deficits and  unsustainable debt. So restraining spending is an important goal of our  budget.   Reducing nondefense discretionary spending is also important. Part of  having a budget is establishing our priorities. That is what we do in  our household budgets. That is what we do in our individual budget.  That is what countries need to do in their budgets. We need to  determine what our No. 1 priority is.   Well, I happen to believe that the safety and security of the  American people is our No. 1 priority. That is why I believe defense  spending is so important. While there are other things we would like to  do, just like there are other things we would like to be able to buy as  an individual or as a household, sometimes you simply can't afford it,  recognizing the priorities that are important to you and to your  family. Defense spending is the No. 1 priority of the Federal  Government. Nobody else can do that. We can't do it as individuals. We  can't do it as States. That is why it needs to be our national  priority.   This budget also provides for the maximum level of defense funding  allowed under the law, while allowing for an adjustment if an agreement  on revised funding levels is reached. It provides a glidepath to an on- budget surplus, leaving aside Social Security entirely.   Most importantly, the budget will provide Congress with the roadmap  forward in the goal of being able to pass tax reform and ultimately  allowing middle-class Americans to keep more of their hard-earned pay.   Helping working families is one of the most important benefits of tax  reform, but it is not the only benefit. Equally important is enhancing  our Nation's competitiveness in a global economy and achieving growth  for our job creators.   We have a self-inflicted wound caused by our Tax Code when competing  with other countries around the world. We have the highest corporate  tax rate in the world. Why is that important? Why should we care what  corporations pay in taxes? Because that influences how much money is  paid to shareholders. It influences how much money can be paid in wages  to people employed by  [[Page S6431]]  businesses. What we have seen frankly is a negative incentive for  companies to move their businesses overseas.   About a week or so ago I remember reading an article--I think it was  in the Wall Street Journal--that said IBM now has more employees in  India than it has in the United States. I am sure that is caused by a  number of circumstances--perhaps access to the workforce, perhaps the  markets that are available to the company--but I have to believe that  at least some of that is caused by our Tax Code. It is cheaper, more  efficient, and more cost effective to develop those jobs and that  business overseas than it is here at home. Why in the world would we  want to sustain that status quo? That is one of the things we are  trying to do in our tax reform--enhancing our competitiveness and  achieving growth for our job creators right here in America.   It used to be that reducing the business tax was a bipartisan effort.  In 2011, when President Obama was President of the United States, he  gave a speech to a joint session of Congress where he called it a  national priority, recognizing that having the highest corporate rate  in the world moved business overseas and it hurt workers here in  America.   The Democratic leader, our friend and colleague from New York, has  previously advocated reducing that corporate tax rate because he  recognizes the benefits to workers and working families right here in  America. So, occasionally, we have to remind them, when they come out  and say harsh and frankly untrue things about what we are trying to do,  that they used to be for the very same things that we are now  advocating for today.    There are other significant pieces, too, such as those that affect  the people in my State and those who work in the energy sector. It is  no secret that Texas leads the Nation in energy production. I know  people think that it is only about oil and gas, but we are actually the  No. 1 electricity producer from wind energy in the country. So we  believe, literally, in an ``all of the above'' policy when it comes to  energy.   We know that some parts of the energy sector, particularly those  refiners in the oil and gas sector, spent the past month and a half  trying to recover from Hurricane Harvey, and at least 25 refineries  were closed temporarily because of the storm. Why should you or I care  about refineries that were closed because of the storm? Because all you  had to do after Hurricane Harvey hit Texas was to look at the price you  pay for gasoline. It has skyrocketed because of the closed refineries.  It actually benefits the entire Nation and consumers when energy prices  are low.   Operations have now resumed in some areas and, thankfully, some of  those higher prices at the pump have dropped, but the hurricane  underscored the need to ensure our energy sector's ongoing dynamism and  vitality. That is where tax reform can help as well.   One component of our proposal is a territorial tax system. Companies  such as Apple, IBM, ConocoPhillips, and ExxonMobil all have  headquarters in the United States, and they have earned money overseas.  One has to wonder: Why in the world wouldn't they want to bring that  back to the United States and invest it in businesses and paychecks  here in America? That is because under our current tax structure, they  have to pay taxes on the money they earn overseas, but if they want to  bring it back to the United States, they have to pay taxes again up to  a 35-percent corporate tax rate on the same money. So they make the  rational decision and keep the money overseas. They build their  businesses there and hire more workers abroad and not here at home. Why  in the world would we want to maintain that sort of self-destructive  status quo?   A new territorial tax system is going to be an important part of tax  reform, and it is not to help big businesses. It is to help workers who  are looking for work or people who are working who have had stagnant  wages and are looking for a little extra in their paycheck each month.  That is why it is so important.   In addition, we plan to help decrease the cost of investing in things  like new plants and equipment in America. Things like expensing rather  than depreciating over many years investment in new equipment and new  businesses are really important to encourage those businesses to  modernize their plants and, again, to hire more workers.   Tax reform represents an opportunity to cement America's position as  the world's largest energy producer, as well, rather than one of those  regulatory exercises that, unfortunately, happens far too often and  ends up increasing the cost of creating jobs in the energy sector. I  will continue to be an advocate for the countless number of Texans  whose livelihoods depend on this sector of our economy while it  continues to face challenges on a multitude of fronts.   Getting back to my point about the price of gasoline, if we drive a  car, we are all paying for gasoline. It just makes sense to do what we  can to help that price get lower, and we all benefit. One of those ways  we can do that is through regulatory reform and the second is through  tax reform.                                    NAFTA    Mr. President, I mentioned Hurricane Harvey earlier, but that is not  the only challenge. Another potential challenge, I should mention, is  NAFTA. This is the North American Free Trade Agreement, which is a 20- year-old trade agreement that includes Canada, Mexico, and the United  States. This is a topic I will have a chance to speak about further at  the Hoover Institution this afternoon.   As most of us know, the NAFTA negotiations are ongoing. President  Trump has said--at least his administration, Ambassador Lighthizer, and  the Commerce Secretary have said that their attitude toward  renegotiating NAFTA is first to do no harm. I really appreciate that  because NAFTA has been an important part of our trading relationships  with Mexico and Canada, and it supports about 14 million jobs in  commerce between our 3 countries in North America.   Since the administration announced its intent to revisit NAFTA, I  think it is important to revisit the critical role that NAFTA has  played in all North American energy markets, including electricity,  renewables, oil, and natural gas. As I wrote in a letter to Ambassador  Lighthizer this summer, each market is highly integrated with and  remains dependent on vital energy infrastructure and trade crossings  that border the United States, Canada, and Mexico.   Free trade and the free-trade agreements, such as NAFTA, allow the  United States to maximize the benefits of being the world's largest  energy producer. If you have been paying attention, you know that our  energy industry has undergone dramatic changes over the past two  decades. I remember when we were worried about having to import  liquefied natural gas from places around the world to our own shores  before the natural gas revolution took place here in America, thanks to  improvements in technology and drilling techniques.   Now we have such cheap and plentiful natural gas that we can export  that gas around the world. It is just not an economic boom. It is a way  for us to provide alternative energy resources to some of our friends  and allies around the world, particularly in Europe, where Mr. Putin  uses energy as a weapon, threatening to shut off energy supplies if  countries in his neighborhood don't cooperate.   So opening Mexico's energy market has positioned U.S. companies to  meet Mexico's needs for technical expertise and capital. As my friends  south of the border reminded me, they said the Eagle Ford shale, which  is one of the most plentiful sources of natural gas in the world,  doesn't stop at the Rio Grande. So as we provide additional technical  expertise and capital to Mexico, we can expect for them to experience  the sort of energy renaissance we ourselves have experienced in the  United States.   During the NAFTA negotiations, we should seek to promote North  American energy security by maintaining and protecting rules that  reduce or eliminate barriers to U.S. investment in Mexico and Canada.  Opportunities like this are why NAFTA could benefit from an update  rather than a repeal.   Former Secretary of State George Shultz reminded us yesterday in the  New York Times that NAFTA has helped a wide range of U.S. manufacturing  industries like auto, electronics, and aerospace become more  competitive relative to their foreign competitors. Secretary Shultz  also pointed out  [[Page S6432]]  how that increased competitiveness is fostered. It has resulted mainly  from the development throughout the last 24 years of strong vertical  supply chains that take advantage of economies of scale. Thanks to  NAFTA, economic production can take place wherever in North America it  is most efficient.   Let's remember all of this as negotiations continue. Let's seek to  preserve all of the good we have inherited from NAFTA and update all  that is outdated in NAFTA.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.
