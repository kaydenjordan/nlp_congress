 Madam Speaker, I want to read a letter that I got just 2  days ago. It is like a lot of letters I am getting today.         Billy, I am appealing to you as one of your trusted       constituents and fearful mother of two Active Duty Marines.       Is our government trying to force our courageous military       into submissive robots? The disgusting abuse of power is now       out of control when the government begins taking away our       God-given rights from loyal citizens and is seeking to take       away the very dignity of those who served beyond measure. My       son and daughter-in-law have served diligently and       effectively with pride and honor for 14 years. What can I do       to help this administration from taking our very hearts and       stomping on them? I believe with every ounce of me God is in       control here and we all know who will ultimately win this       battle. What can I do to help win this sooner than later.       Debi.    Madam Speaker, let me be clear. I have been vaccinated. I have had  three shots. I encourage everyone to talk to their doctor. And if it is  right for them, to take the vaccine. But ultimately, the vaccination  should be a choice that shouldn't be mandated by anyone.   I had a mother show me a picture of her daughter in her fatigues  looking at her newborn baby and telling me that a nursing mother is not  exempt from this.                            ____________________
