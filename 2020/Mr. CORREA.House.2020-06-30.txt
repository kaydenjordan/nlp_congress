 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize United Biologics  in Santa Ana, who stepped up during the pandemic to help our local  healthcare workers.   After I called on local manufacturers in my district to retool and  manufacture PPE, United Biologics' President, John Barnhill, stepped up  to the plate. The company designed a face shield, ordered supplies, and  even added more employees to their workforce to produce thousands of  face shields. Not only did this effort keep the company running and in  business, but John Barnhill decided to donate the PPE to the local  healthcare workers.   United Biologics shows what happens when we call on American  companies to do the right thing.                            ____________________
