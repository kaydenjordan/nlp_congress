 Mr. President, I rise today to once again open a small  portion of the Arctic coastal plain, in my home State of Alaska, to oil  and gas development. I am introducing the bill because, now more than  ever, new production in northern Alaska is vital not only to my state's  future, but also to our Nation's energy and economic security.   It has been known for more than nearly 4 decades that the 1.5 million  acres of the Arctic coastal plain that lie inside the northern one- eleventh of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge are the most  prospective lands in North America for a major conventional oil and gas  discovery. The U.S. Geological Survey continues to estimate that this  part of the coastal plain--which represents just 3 percent of the  coastal plain in all of northern Alaska--has a mean likelihood of  containing 10.4 billion barrels of oil and 8.6 trillion cubic feet of  natural gas, as well as a reasonable chance of economically producing  16 billion barrels of oil. Even the relatively recent major finds in  North Dakota's Bakken field and the recent estimates of shale oil in  Texas' Wolfcamp formation pale in comparison, as ANWR is likely to hold  over three times more conventional oil than any other onshore energy  deposit in North America.   In the 1990s, opponents dismissed ANWR's potential and argued that  the nearby National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska was forecast to contain  almost as much oil. However, early this decade the U.S. Geological  Survey significantly reduced its oil estimates in the 23 million acre  reserve. Instead of containing somewhere between the 6.7 to 15 billion  barrels as forecast in 2002, the USGS now forecasts a mean of 896  million barrels--a dramatic downward revision. While I still believe  oil production must be allowed to proceed in NPRA and that development  of satellite fields must be allowed to occur, the revised forecast  means that opening a small area on shore to the east on the coastal  plain, is now more vital than ever for America's economic and national  security interests.   That is especially the case given that President Obama late last year  closed almost all of Alaska's outer continental shelf oil and gas  deposits to future exploration and development. That makes production  of onshore deposits even more vital for Alaska's economic future, and  for the Nation's long-term energy security.   America once received more than 10 percent of its daily domestic oil  production from fields in Alaska. You heard correctly, production  already occurs in Arctic Alaska, and has for nearly 40 years. We have  successfully balanced resource development with environmental  protection. Alaskans have proven, over and over again, that those  endeavors are not mutually exclusive.   Today, however, we face a tipping point. Alaska's North Slope  production has declined for years and now accounts for just under 5  percent of the Nation's daily production. It is now forecast to decline  further to levels next decade that will threaten the continued  operation of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System. A closure of TAPS would  shut down all northern Alaska oil production. This would devastate  Alaska's economy, drag global oil prices even higher, and deepen our  energy dependence on unstable petrostates throughout the world,  especially once oil shale production peaks in the Lower 48 States.  [[Page S116]]    Anyone who takes the long view on energy policy recognizes that no  matter what energy policy our Nation pursues, we will use substantial  amounts of oil well into the future. The more of that oil we produce at  home, the better off our economy, our trade deficit, our employment  levels, and the world's environment will be. To help meet future demand  both here in America and throughout the rest of the world, and to help  avoid a tremendous price spike in the event of supply disruptions, we  need to take steps today to ensure new production is brought online, as  soon as possible.   ANWR development will provide huge benefits for the U.S. Treasury.  Let's examine this with some simple math. ANWR's mean estimate of over  10 billion barrels, at even today's $50 per barrel price, means that  there is half a trillion dollars worth of oil locked up beneath this  small area in northern Alaska--and even more when prices rebound. That  is half a trillion taxable dollars, and it is difficult to calculate or  even fathom the corporate and payoll taxes that this would generate for  our treasury. But we do know that there are hundreds of billions of  dollars in pure Federal royalties since my bill devotes 50 percent of  the value to a Federal share, rather than the 10 percent which current  law allows.   As our Nation grapples with a huge budget deficit, nearly $20  trillion in national debt, and a lack of capital to incentivize new  energy development, it is folly for America to further delay new  onshore oil development from Alaska. The question is no longer,  ``Should we drill in ANWR?'' Today, it has become, ``Can we afford not  to?''   I understand that no matter what happens, some will remain opposed to  development in this region. The outgoing administration has attempted  to not only prohibit oil and gas development onshore in the coastal  plain--proposing to forever lock the area up into formal wilderness-- but also has proposed to impede oil and even natural gas development  from vast portions of NPRA and from the offshore waters of the Beaufort  and Chukchi Seas. This mindset ignores Alaska's economic realities, it  ignores the Nation's looming energy challenges, and it ignores the fact  that Arctic oil production can proceed without any significant  environmental impact. Our development has coexisted productively with  polar bears, and will not harm the Porcupine caribou herd or any other  form of wildlife on the Arctic coast. The groups who oppose my  legislation seem totally oblivious to strides made in directional,  extended reach drilling, three- and four-dimensional seismic testing,  and new pipeline leak detection technology, all of which permit Alaskan  energy development to proceed safely without harm to wildlife or the  environment.   For all these reasons, I am reintroducing legislation to open the  coastal plain of ANWR to development. At the same time, I am again  focusing and narrowing that development so that just 2,000 acres of the  1.5 million acre coastal plain can be physically disturbed by roads,  pipelines, wells, buildings or other support facilities. At most, just  one-tenth of 1 percent of the refuge's coastal plain would be impacted.  For comparison's sake, 2,000 acres is roughly the size of National  Airport--compared to an area roughly three times the size of the state  of Maryland. It is hardly a blip on the map.   Limiting development to such a small area is important. It will help  guarantee--beyond any shadow of doubt--the preservation in a natural  state of more than sufficient habitat for caribou, muskoxen, polar  bear, and Arctic bird life. My legislation also includes stringent  environmental standards.   The bill, named the Alaska Oil and Gas Production Act, AOGPA, which  is being cosponsored by my colleague from Alaska, Senator Dan Sullivan,  also includes guaranteed finding to mitigate any impacts in the region,  and guarantees that the Federal Government will receive half of all  revenues generated.   For decades, Alaskans, whom polls show overwhelmingly support ANWR  development, have been asking permission to explore and develop oil in  the coastal plain. Finally, technology has advanced so that it is  possible to develop oil and gas from the coastal plain with little or  no impact on the area and its wildlife.   At this time of unsustainable debt, and an unstable global  environment, we need to pursue domestic development opportunities more  than ever. My ANWR bill offers us a chance to produce more of our own  energy, for the good of the American people, in an environmentally- friendly way. I hope this Congress, given the new administration that  will soon take office, will have the common sense to allow America to  help itself by developing ANWR's substantial resources. This is  critical to my state and the Nation as a whole. And with this in mind,  I will work to educate the members of this chamber about ANWR. I will  show why such development should occur, why it must occur, and how it  can benefit our Nation at a time when we need the domestic jobs and  energy security that ANWR will produce.                                  ______                                         By Mr. BOOKER (for himself, Ms. Warren, Mr. Schatz, Mr. Markey,          Mrs. Murray, Mr. Sanders, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Merkley, Ms. Hirono,          and Mr. Wyden):   S. 54.
