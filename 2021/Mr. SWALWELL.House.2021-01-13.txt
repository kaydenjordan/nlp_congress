 Madam Speaker, America has been attacked before, but  not like this. On January 6, Donald Trump incited thousands of  radicalized terrorists to attack the Capitol to stop a transition of  power. Let that sink in. Our President incited our citizens to attack  our Capitol. America was not attacked in the past tense. This President  has inspired future plots. America is still under attack, and that is  why Donald Trump must be impeached.   I have read that many of my GOP colleagues know what the President  did was wrong but are afraid for their lives if they cross the  President. I am sorry that they are living in fear, but now is the time  to summon their courage to guide them.   Madam Speaker, we have all seen the images of the courageous officers  who have risked their lives so that you could flee this floor and see  your families. That was almost a week ago right now.   Officers engaged in hand-to-hand combat for hours with these  terrorists. Capitol Police were spit on, beaten, stampeded, and one of  them lost his life.   Madam Speaker, I am not asking you to summon the courage that they  did; I am just asking you to do your job and hold this President  accountable.
