 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Walter Dukes and the  1953 National Invitational Tournament champion Seton Hall University  Pirates basketball team.   Walter Dukes was Seton Hall's 7-foot, African-American center. He was  the team's indisputable leader who pulled down 734 rebounds that year.  It was an NCAA record that still stands.   He and his team dealt with discrimination and violence for having a  Black player on the team, but they continued to win and beat St. John's  University, 58-46, to win the 1953 NIT title, which was the big  tournament at the time.   Dukes and his Seton Hall teammates are legends in New Jersey's  basketball lore. Their magical season shows us the importance of  character, faith, and success.   As a longtime Seton Hall fan, going to Seton Hall games for 55 years,  I am proud to highlight them on the floor today.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I begin by thanking Congresswoman Cherfilus- McCormick and Congressman Jackson for holding the CBC Special Order  hour on gun violence in America.   Last week, our Nation was shocked by the acts of horrific violence in  Allen, Texas, where eight souls were lost unnecessarily.   How many killings must we endure?   We are here tonight to send a message that we must keep guns out of  the hands of criminals and would-be terrorists, and we must expand  background checks for individuals looking to purchase guns. We must  pass some commonsense legislation that provides avenues to get guns off  of our streets.   Legislation like my Safer Neighborhoods Gun Buyback Act would utilize  Federal grants to get guns out of the hands of criminals. Programs like  it have been proven to work all over this Nation, from coast to coast.  We need to act on this bill and others like it to protect American  lives.   It is unacceptable that countless Americans continue to die  senselessly from gun violence and Congress stands idly by. They do  nothing.    I came up with a phrase back after Newtown. The NRA, which is really  who pushes this: The NRA stands for ``no Republican action.''   Here we are once again. Yes, we stood up for a moment of silence  tonight once again. Then once the gavel hit the rostrum, everybody  walked away and that was the end of that. My colleagues on the other  side feel good after that, after they stand up and acknowledge that.  But that is the extent of what they are willing to do, just stand up to  honor these people for a moment. That is all they can spare. That is  all they can give to the American people who are suffering, children  suffering.   This issue is so pervasive that it impacts us everywhere: movie  theaters, churches, schools, banks, post offices, businesses,  everywhere. That is an epidemic. COVID was everywhere. That was an  epidemic. This gun violence is everywhere. That is an epidemic.   But what do we do? Stand up, quiet for a moment, and then onto the  next thing.   I see it at home in New Jersey in my district, New Jersey's 10th  Congressional District. The 10th Congressional District, unfortunately,  has one-third of the State's total gun deaths in New Jersey. I know my  constituents know the destruction that gun violence inflicts. This is a  problem that will continue to grow without swift legislation and  action.   But my words are just going into the wind. My colleagues on the other  side don't hear this. The American people want real action on gun  violence. The NRA endorsed Republicans, which is practically the entire  party, and has offered no substantive legislation to keep our  communities safe from gun violence.   My colleagues are the majority now. Let's see what we implement. I  can answer that now: nothing.   So many of our constituents are haunted by the gun violence that is  taking their loved ones, and that is why Democrats are in favor of  stronger gun laws to keep these weapons out of dangerous hands.   We are not asking to take anybody's guns, but we can't have enough  mindset to say: Hey, there is a problem here? I don't know where my  colleagues on the other side are listening and getting this from.  Eighty-seven  [[Page H2164]]  percent of this country says that we need stricter gun laws, but you  don't hear them.   Too many lives have been stolen, too many children killed. Can't  Republicans feel the pain of the survivors of these victims' families?   The American people are calling for passage of meaningful legislation  to address gun violence. They are calling for action to stop mass  killings in this country. They are calling to stop the taking of  innocent children's lives in their schools.   I couldn't imagine sending my children to school these days and  wondering if they are going to make it home. I am sending them there to  be educated. I am not sending them there to do armed drills. What  happens if there is an active shooter? That is what they are learning?   I look at my colleagues across the aisle and ask: Is there nothing  that we can do together to stop this?   When children cannot go to school without fear of being shot, when  innocent Americans cannot go to a nightclub or a movie theater or  church without fear of being executed, then it is time for a new  approach. The Congressional Black Caucus, with our Democratic  colleagues, stands ready to deliver that approach.                                time  2100    Mr. Speaker, I want to read to you from a letter sent to me by a  student at Cranford High School in Cranford, New Jersey, named  Alessandra, who puts into words the thoughts of most Americans. She  wrote: ``Although the Second Amendment of the Constitution protects the  right to gun ownership, this does not mean that Congress cannot pass  more laws to restrict the kinds of firearms and people buying them. As  a high school student from Cranford High School, this issue affects me  daily as the number of school shootings increases.''   Mr. Speaker, I will close and say that we have a responsibility to  our constituents, like Alessandra. We have a responsibility to ensure  our Nation's laws keep us safe and to ensure that we hear their voices  and act on their behalf.   Mrs. CHERFILUS-McCORMICK. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman  from Ohio (Mrs. Beatty).
