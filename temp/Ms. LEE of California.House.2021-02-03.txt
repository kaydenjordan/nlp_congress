 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Yarmuth for his  leadership in putting forth this budget resolution.   COVID continues to ravage our communities. Black and Brown people  have been disproportionately impacted the hardest. Now that vaccines  are being distributed, the disparities in who has been vaccinated are  quite shocking.   On top of this health crisis is an economic crisis. Eight million  more families have fallen into poverty since May. Food banks have lines  around the block, and 12 million children are going hungry. Enhanced  unemployment insurance expires next month; small businesses are going  under; and our State and local governments are struggling to make  payroll for millions of essential workers.   Our constituents and communities can't wait. We have to go big, and  we have to move fast.   The relief package enabled by this budget resolution is the rescue  needed to keep people from falling off the cliff. It will also allow us  to address the glaring racial and ethnic disparities in our pandemic  response.   Let me tell you, I am one who believes we should provide ongoing  payments until the end of the pandemic. Through no fault of their own,  people's lives and livelihoods have been shattered, but we do provide  in this package and in this budget enhanced unemployment insurance and  direct payments.    We don't have the luxury of time, nor of nickeling-and-diming our  constituents. We must deliver for the American people a rescue package  that matches the scale and the scope of the pain in our country.   Remember, a budget is a moral document that reflects our values,  which, of course, means we must put people first, regardless of party  affiliation.
