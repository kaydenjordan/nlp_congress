 Mr. President, I rise today in support of Governor  Jennifer Granholm's nomination to be Secretary of the Department of  Energy.   I can think of no one better than Governor Granholm to lead the  Department of Energy during this critical and transformative period for  our country.   Governor Granholm has the experience to lead and oversee the 13,500  employees at the Energy Department. She served as the Governor of  Michigan from 2003 to 2011 and as Michigan's attorney general from 1998  to 2002.   During her tenure as Governor, she led Michigan through the  tumultuous years of the 2008 financial crisis and the resulting bailout  of the auto industry. She shepherded over a billion dollars in Federal  funding to her State to manufacture electric vehicles and batteries.  She diversified Michigan's energy portfolio and signed into law the  State's first renewable energy standard.   I won't hold against the Governor the fact that she is a graduate of  UC Berkeley--I am sure a Stanford Cardinal and a Golden Bear can still  find some common ground and I am sure it will help that she will bring  the innovative spirit of California along with her to her new role as  Secretary.   Following her tenure as Governor, Jennifer became a faculty member at  the UC Berkeley Goldman School of Public Policy. She has spent her  career, both inside and outside of public office, as a steadfast  advocate for clean energy. I have no doubt she will bring the same  passion if confirmed as Secretary.   With this appointment, Governor Granholm has gained the opportunity  to understand our unique national lab system, which is a critical  aspect of the Department of Energy. She was a project scientist at  Lawrence Berkeley National Lab, and I look forward to her getting to  know our 16 other National Labs. From basic science to nuclear safety,  these are gems of the Energy Department.   Finally, I would be remiss if I did not mention the trailblazing  nature of the Governor's career. She was Michigan's first female  attorney general; Michigan's first female Governor; and, if confirmed,  will be only the second woman to lead the Energy Department since its  formation in 1977. She has been and will continue to be a role model  for young women across this country.   The Governor does not have an easy task ahead of her, but I have full  confidence that she is up to the challenge. As chair of the  Appropriations Subcommittee on Energy and Water, I look forward to  working with her closely over the coming years to fund clean energy  programs, confront climate change, and fulfill the energy and water  infrastructure needs of California and our country.                            ____________________
