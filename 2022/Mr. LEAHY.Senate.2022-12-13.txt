 Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I will,  but let me explain why. The bill offered by my colleague on the other  side of the aisle is shortsighted and premature.   We have been working on this omnibus for months. I would have been  happy to, among the 50 or 60 Senators of both parties, if they had sat  down and talked to me about what might be in it. I would have been  happy to have heard from him, too, but I know he had other pressing  duties and didn't have time to.   But I am afraid it would unnecessarily punt our basic  responsibilities even further down the road. Vice Chairman Shelby,  Chair DeLauro, and I continue to trade offers and negotiate an omnibus  spending bill with the Democrats and Republicans who have worked with  us, and we believe we are close to a bipartisan, bicameral agreement.  Reaching this agreement now is important for Americans in every State  across the country.   I know in my State of Vermont, in my hometown--my farmhouse in  Middlesex, VT--it was 20 degrees. Next week, it is going to get colder.  With  [[Page S7125]]  the cost of natural gas and heating oil up more than 25 percent,  families across my State are sitting down at their kitchen tables  trying to figure out how they are going to afford to heat their homes  and feed their families. Groceries are up more than 10 percent. They  are making these decisions right now because they do not have the  luxury of simply kicking the can down the road. They need assistance  now, not months from now, if at all. They are not the ones who got the  benefit from the huge Trump tax cut which increased the deficit but  gave money to the highest level of income in our country.   Reaching this agreement now is important because in my home State,  opioid deaths are on pace to surpass last year's grim toll. I don't  think there is a Senator on this floor who hasn't seen opioid deaths go  up in their State. We have seen it throughout the country. And I am not  going to stand in the way of blocking money that might help bring those  opioid deaths down because Vermont is not alone in this fight against  this scourge. You cannot name a State in this country, if they are  honest, that is not facing this scourge. Communities across the country  host grieving families and people struggling with addiction who need  new resources now, not months from now, if at all. That is Republicans,  Democrats, Independents, everybody.   These communities are also pleading for resources to support State  and local law enforcement. Having spent 8 years in law enforcement, I  know what is needed. In fact, most of my friends on the other side of  the aisle claim to support law enforcement. Well, if they really mean  it, they should pass an omnibus agreement now, which would mean we  could get more than 1,500 more police officers on the streets and  provide law enforcement new and needed resources now, not months from  now, if at all.   Our Nation's veterans need us to act now. Everybody claims they are  in support of them--as I am, as our Presiding Officer is, as most  Senators are. If we do not do our jobs, the bipartisan PACT Act will go  underfunded and VA medical care will fall at least $7.5 billion short.  Our Nation's veterans deserve to have the promises we made them  fulfilled now, not months from now, if at all.   Victims of natural disasters like Hurricanes Ian and Fiona need us to  act now. A continuing resolution would delay aid to these communities  by at least 6 weeks.   Now, this week, the Senate will pass the NDAA. It will receive  bipartisan praise because of what it says for our armed services. Well,  I would remind my colleagues that the NDAA makes many promises, but  without an omnibus appropriations bill, it is a broken promise; $76  billion for national defense will be left on the Republican cutting  room floor--$76 billion for national defense will be left on the  Republican cutting room floor.   I could take up the entire day talking about why this short-term CR  is a dereliction of our sworn duty, a failure for the American people,  a temporary solution that promises to run headlong into even more  difficult problems.   But I will end by saying that Vice Chairman Shelby, Chair DeLauro,  and I are close to an agreement. The American people sent us here to do  our jobs, not kick the can down the road, not make statements on the  floor, but to do our work.   So for these reasons, I object.    Madam President, I have spent more than 30 years working  to build closer relations with Vietnam, a country where 58,220  Americans and an estimated 3 million Vietnamese died in a war that  never should have been fought. In 1975, as the newest member of the  Armed Services Committee, I voted to end funding for the war, a vote  that caused the largest newspaper in Vermont to predict that I would  never be reelected. The citizens of Vermont reelected me seven times,  and that vote is among the ones I am proudest of.   The war was a disaster for both countries, and for 20 years after the  war ended, the U.S. maintained a trade embargo against Vietnam which  only formally ended in 1994, shortly before diplomatic relations were  restored in 1995. That historic step toward reconciliation was due in  large part to the advocacy of two American veterans, Senators John  Kerry and John McCain, and the involvement of key Vietnamese diplomats  such as Prime Minister Phan Van Khai, Deputy Prime Minister Nguyen Co  Thach, and Nguyen Manh Cam.   Since the late 1980s, the Congress has approved funding for a number  of humanitarian programs in Vietnam to address the harmful legacies of  the war. We have provided many hundreds of millions of dollars to  locate and destroy landmines and other unexploded ordnance, to assist  people with severe physical and cognitive disabilities resulting from  UXO accidents and exposure to Agent Orange, to clean up former U.S. air  bases contaminated with dioxin, and to help Vietnam locate and identify  some of its hundreds of thousands of missing soldiers and civilians.  Each of these initiatives has been carried out in close cooperation  with the Government of Vietnam, including its Ministry of Defense. Next  year, we will embark on a unique project to create new exhibits at  Vietnam's War Remnants Museum, to tell the story of this postwar  cooperation.   These efforts have succeeded due to the vision and support of many  people, including Bobby Muller who founded Vietnam Veterans of America  Foundation--VVAF--and led the first group of American veterans back to  Vietnam in 1981, President George H. W. Bush, and Sr. Lt. General  Nguyen Chi Vinh. And they have opened the door to U.S.-Vietnam  cooperation in many other areas, including higher education, public  health, climate change, and regional security.   I mention this for context and to highlight the key role played by  one person who has remained out of the limelight. Thao Griffiths, a  Vietnamese woman originally from the small rural community of Ha Giang  in the isolated, ethnic minority region of Vietnam bordering China,  deserves special recognition.   Thao, a gifted student, was sent to school in Hanoi, graduated from  the Diplomatic Academy of Vietnam, became a Fulbright Scholar and  received her master's degree at American University in Washington, was  awarded an  [[Page S7131]]  Eisenhower Fellowship, and for 9 years served as the first Vietnamese  citizen and the first woman to direct VVAF's programs in Vietnam. I was  introduced to Thao by Bobby Muller 17 years ago, and since then, she  has become a trusted source of invaluable advice for me and my staff.  Even more than that, she is a friend to me and to my wife Marcelle, who  once had the exhilarating experience of riding around the city of Hanoi  on the back of Thao's motor scooter. Anyone familiar with Hanoi traffic  knows what that means.   It would not be an exaggeration to say that none of the war legacy  initiatives that have played such a central role in building a  comprehensive partnership between the U.S. and Vietnam would have  progressed as they have without Thao's constant encouragement and  thoughtful advice. Fluent in English and a networker extraordinaire  with unlimited positive energy, on a first name basis with many of  Vietnam's top civilian and military leaders, academics and artists, and  U.S. and foreign diplomats, Thao has helped build bridges between key  players in both governments in ways that I doubt anyone else could  have. For the past decade and a half, Thao has, more than anyone else,  helped to smooth the way for the leaders of both governments to keep  striving to deepen and expand our relations by overcoming distrust,  bureaucratic obstacles, and cultural differences. Her efforts have had  a profound and lasting impact on our relations, our mutual  understanding, and on the lives of the Vietnamese and American people.   This work has been among the things I am proudest of having had a  role in during my 48 years in the Senate. On behalf of myself and my  wife Marcelle, I want to express my deepest appreciation to Thao  Griffiths for her invaluable help in making it possible.                            ____________________     Madam President, in 1986, when much of Central America was  embroiled in armed conflicts in which hundreds of thousands of people,  overwhelmingly civilians, were killed, a group of parishioners from the  Franconia, NH, Congregational Church established Americans Caring  Teaching Sharing--ACTS. They traveled to Honduras to support peace and  justice through community development, beginning in the small  subsistence farming village of El Rosario in the highlands of  northwestern Honduras.   Since then, ACTS has become a nonprofit, nonsectarian organization  involving hundreds of volunteers who have contributed thousands of  hours to ACTS' mission of improving the lives of people in rural  Honduras through community projects focused on basic healthcare,  nutrition, sanitation, education, agriculture, and economic  diversification. ACTS is governed and sustained by volunteers. Teams  travel to Honduras several times a year, for a week or 2, to help move  the projects forward.   Over the years, the program has expanded to include about a dozen  communities surrounding El Rosario. ACTS has developed a close working  relationship with the villagers, who are the visionaries for progress.  The villagers set the priorities and perform much of the labor. ACTS  volunteers provide the technical skills, guidance, material resources,  and hands-on help. The result has been a successful example of  sustainable, community development in one of the most neglected,  impoverished parts of the country.   In addition to the Honduran communities in which ACTS supports  projects, it has developed partnerships and associations with many U.S.  and Honduran organizations, institutions of higher education, and  foundations.   I mention this to provide context and to highlight the extraordinary  dedication and leadership of Dean Seibert, long-time resident of  Norwich, VT, and professor emeritus at the Geisel School of Medicine,  who has been affiliated with ACTS for over 20 years and led the  organization for most of that time. He has visited El Rosario as team  leader over 30 times. This year alone Dean traveled there three times.  Some might find that remarkable, since Dean celebrated his 90th  birthday in August. To those who know Dean, it wasn't remarkable at  all. His enthusiasm and dedication are indefatigable.   Dean has long had an interest in community development and the  challenges of providing healthcare to people of different cultures and  traditions. He has worked with the Tohano O'odum, Navajo, Hopi, and  Pueblo tribes in the American southwest, and he provided care to flood  victims in the Mosquito Coast area of Honduras after Hurricane Mitch,  to war refugees in Albania, Kosovo, and Liberia, to earthquake  survivors in Pakistan and Haiti, and to flood victims following the  Indonesian tsunami and Hurricane Katrina in the U.S. He received the  Albany Medical College Alumni Humanitarian Award and the Geisel School  of Medicine John H. Lyons award for humanism in medicine.   If that weren't enough, in the past year, Dean has played a central  role in creating a new nonprofit, Honduran Tolupan Education Program-- Honduran TEP--devoted to building libraries and providing other basic  services in half a dozen marginalized Tolupan indigenous communities in  the mountainous province of Yoro. Honduran TEP is based on the  recognition that literacy and access to educational resources are  fundamental to enabling the Tolucan to develop their communities and  defend against corrupt entities that threaten their cultural survival.   In the Congress, we talk a lot about leadership, about what it means,  about its importance. We talk about how the Senate can and should be  the conscience of the Nation. When I think of Dean Seibert and what he  has done in his life, how he has used his medical training and  experience, combined with his commitment to social justice, for the  betterment of others born into extreme poverty or victims of tragic  losses, I can't think of a better example of leadership and conscience.   For much of Honduras' modern history, the U.S. has propped up  corrupt, abusive governments and provided their security forces with  training and equipment to support poorly conceived strategies to combat  drug trafficking and stop migration. The consequences for the Honduran  people and Honduras' democratic institutions have been devastating. For  the most part, it is not a history to be proud of.   But all Vermonters should be proud of Dean Seibert and ACTS' and  Honduran TEP's volunteers for showing a different face of America to  the people of Honduras--a face of generosity, compassion, opportunity,  and hope.                            ____________________     Madam President, in 1988, after speaking with Bobby  Muller, a Vietnam veteran who was wounded and later founded the Vietnam  Veterans of America Foundation--VVAF--to help alleviate the suffering  of Vietnamese and Cambodians who were badly injured in the war, I met  with President George H. W. Bush and Secretary of State James Baker at  the White House.   At the time, the United States and Vietnam did not have diplomatic  relations. Vietnam's economy had been devastated by the war, but the  U.S. had a trade embargo against the country which remained in effect  for another 15 years. There were many hundreds of thousands of  Vietnamese who had been severely disabled due to war injuries, with no  access to rehabilitation services. President Bush and Secretary Baker  and I agreed that it was in the interest of the United States to begin  reconciling with Vietnam by addressing some of the worst legacies of  the war and that the way to begin was to use what later became known as  the ``Leahy War Victims Fund,'' administered by the U.S. Agency for  International Development, to provide artificial limbs and wheelchairs  to victims of landmines and other unexploded ordnance--UXO.   That initiative, beginning in Vietnam, was expanded over the years to  many other countries whose people have been harmed by armed conflict,  and it continues to this day. One of the implementers of the Leahy War  Victims Fund in Vietnam, starting in the early 1990s, has been Vietnam  Assistance for the Handicapped--VNAH--whose founder and president, Ca  Van Tran, left Vietnam as a refugee in 1975 with hardly a penny to his  name. Over many years, through hard work and perseverance, Ca became a  successful businessman in the United States. After returning to Vietnam  and seeing  [[Page S7132]]  the ongoing suffering of people who had no access to prostheses or  wheelchairs, he founded VNAH. Since then, VNAH has carried out  successful projects in multiple provinces and was instrumental in  working with the Vietnamese authorities to write Vietnam's disabilities  law, the first of its kind in the country.   Ca became a good friend to me and my wife Marcelle and to my staff.  We have visited VNAH's projects in Vietnam, which now assist victims of  Agent Orange as well as injured survivors of UXO accidents. The  difference that Ca and VNAH's superb Vietnamese staff have made in the  lives of the severely disabled and their families cannot be adequately  described in words. People who lost one or both legs, who were crawling  on the ground for years, finally received an artificial limb or  wheelchair and their dignity restored. Parents, children, and siblings  with cognitive and physical disabilities so severe they cannot speak,  walk, sit up, feed, or clean themselves now have better care.   In recent years, Ca has had to cope with his own health challenges  due to separate motor vehicle accidents both of which were due entirely  to the negligence of other drivers. At one point, his own mobility was  limited to a wheelchair. Yet as soon as he was physically able and  Vietnam relaxed its COVID restrictions, Ca went back there to explore  ways to expand VNAH's activities.   Ca has been an inspiration to me and to countless others in this  country and in Vietnam. He overcame immense challenges as a refugee,  and when he was financially able, he devoted his life to helping others  far less fortunate. Although originally from the south, through sheer  perseverance and dedication to helping others, he overcame the  suspicions of the authorities in Hanoi. It is in no small measure  thanks to Ca Van Tran and VNAH that the Leahy War Victims Fund became  what it is today.   As I prepare to retire after 48 years in the Senate, I want other  Members of Congress to know about Ca Van Tran. He is an exceptional  example of the life-changing difference that one compassionate,  dedicated person has made to overcome some of the painful legacies of  the war in Vietnam.                            ____________________     Madam President, I rise today to celebrate the 90th  anniversary of World Learning, a nonprofit organization based in  Brattleboro, VT, that is dedicated to building stronger human  connections through people-to-people exchanges, international  education, and global development programs.   World Learning is more than Vermont's window to the world; it is its  door. Its history is deeply rooted in the Green Mountains of southern  Vermont. The organization is guided by our State's values of tolerance  and interest in the world, living a purposeful life through serving  others, and building communities by welcoming newcomers with empathy  and dignity.   I am proud that World Learning's impact extends well beyond Vermont.  World Learning through its School for International Training--SIT-- administers more than 90 development programs in over 30 countries,  teaching English to refugees, expanding STEM training opportunities,  and increasing job opportunities for young adults from all backgrounds.  World Learning's youth, academic, and professional exchanges bring over  2,000 emerging leaders annually to the U.S. from nearly 160 countries  for degree and nondegree programs and professional development and  networking opportunities. These programs build enduring ties between  future leaders and their U.S. host communities and place American  culture and values front and center.   In 1932, World Learning--at that time known as the Experiment in  International Living--established the first program in the country to  enable young Americans to study abroad and engage in intercultural  communication. Through the Experiment, students first lived in the  homes of families from the countries where they studied. The then- radical idea, of the ``home stay,'' as the Experiment's founder Dr.  Donald Watt put it, is how people would ``learn to live together by  living together.''   In the immediate aftermath of World War II, the Experiment sent young  Americans across the Atlantic to Western Europe as peacemakers to  assist in rebuilding war-ravaged communities across the continent.  These young Americans became our Nation's first generation engaged in  international community service and international volunteerism.   At the height of the Cold War, President John F. Kennedy asked young  Americans to serve their country in the Peace Corps and build human  connections and a greater understanding between nations and people. The  Experiment was the inspiration behind the vision of international  service by Kennedy and Sargent Shriver, the first Peace Corps Director.  Shriver was a participant in the Experiment, traveling to Germany and  Austria in 1934, and then leading other youth groups for the  organization in 1936 and 1939. In 1964, another prominent innovator,  Dr. John A. Wallace, founded SIT, an extension of the Experiment, and  directed SIT until 1978. Jack was a good friend whose leadership at SIT  built on the Experiment platform with programs that sent thousands of  young learners around the world. Over time, World Learning has helped  design and launch nearly 70 Peace Corps projects and train volunteers  for service in more than 30 countries.   The Experiment also rose to the challenge of supporting the U.S.  State Department in the largest refugee training and resettlement  program in history, assisting more than 250,000 South East Asian  refugees at processing centers in Thailand and Indonesia. They led  skills assessments, English language instruction, and cultural  orientation training. They demonstrated once again the organization's  steadfast commitment to building human connections, healthy  communities, and peace.   That commitment continues today, at World Learning's headquarters in  the town of Brattleboro, where they welcome refugees and support their  integration into communities around southern Vermont. As the first stop  in Vermont for newcomers from Afghanistan, Ukraine, and elsewhere,  World Learning brings together staff, faculty, alumni, and neighbors to  offer language, cultural orientation, and friendship in a program that  is a national model for effective refugee integration.   I have covered a lot of history in these remarks. That is to be  expected when one speaks about World Learning and its many  contributions over the past 90 years. This is a time when the world  needs what World Learning offers and does best. Many of the challenges  we face in my State of Vermont are the same challenges seen in towns  and provinces in countries around the world, such as climate change,  resettling refugees, combatting infectious diseases, protecting  democracy, and the list goes on.   I am just one of many Vermonters who takes immense pride in World  Learning's history of bringing people together to develop innovative  solutions to shared challenges and to recognize our common humanity. I  thank World Learning--its staff and faculty, alumni, and participants-- for their achievements and important ongoing efforts.                            ____________________
