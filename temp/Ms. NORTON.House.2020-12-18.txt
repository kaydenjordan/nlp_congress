 Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 3418) to amend the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and  Emergency Assistance Act to allow the Administrator of the Federal  Emergency Management Agency to provide capitalization grants to States  to establish revolving funds to provide hazard mitigation assistance to  reduce risks from disasters and natural hazards, and other related  environmental harm.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 3418         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Safeguarding Tomorrow       through Ongoing Risk Mitigation Act'' or the ``STORM Act''.       SEC. 2.

[[Page H7267]]      Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on S. 3418.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of S. 3418, the Safeguarding  Tomorrow through Ongoing Risk Mitigation Act, or STORM Act.   This bipartisan and bicameral bill introduced in the Senate by  Senators Gary Peters and Ron Johnson, and in the House by  Representatives Angie Craig, Rodney Davis, and Rick Crawford, would  amend the Stafford Act to provide another opening for local governments  to fund mitigation and resilience projects.   Modeled after the highly successful Drinking Water and Clean Water  State Revolving Funds managed by the Environmental Protection Agency,  this bill would allow States and Tribal governments to apply for  capitalization grants to establish revolving funds that would then be  used to fund a variety of infrastructure projects.                                time  1215    The Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure under both  Democratic and Republican majorities has examined the rising cost of  disasters and reforms necessary to address them.   Time and again, we have arrived at the similar conclusion:  Investments in mitigation have a quantifiable and significant return on  investment in reducing disaster response and recovery costs.   The current sources of Federal funding available for pre-disaster  mitigation are highly competitive and extremely limited due to the  backlog of worthwhile projects identified across the Nation.   The State revolving loan funds will be established by this litigation  and would allow States to offer low-interest loans to cities and  counties for projects to mitigate a wide variety of hazards.   Since 2000, there have only been 3 years during which we have seen  fewer than 100 Presidentially declared events under the Stafford Act,  and there is no indication that the frequency or severity of these  disasters is on the decline. The record-setting year we just endured  points to the contrary.   Madam Speaker, while future disasters will inevitably cause large- scale damage and require costly recoveries, by providing new  opportunities for investments in pre-disaster mitigation, this bill  encourages resilience at the community level and will contribute to a  considerable reduction in the cost of future recoveries.   Madam Speaker, I support S. 3418, and urge my colleagues to do the  same, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  the Virgin Islands (Ms. Plaskett), my friend.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, first of all, I appreciate the words of my colleague  on the other side of the aisle with respect to Ms. Plaskett's notion. I  don't know why the notion of pennywise and pound foolish--if that is  the reason why this bipartisan bill that was sent to the Senate was  sent back to us absent some Americans. I understand they will be  working to try to fix this, but we don't fix it when we allow disasters  to move forward in the part of our country where disasters are more  likely to affect. They are not most likely to take effect in places  like the District of Columbia where we just had a snowstorm and hardly  a little bit of snow. They are far more likely to take effect in Ms.  Plaskett's district in the Virgin Islands.   Madam Speaker, I pledge with my good friend on the other side, with  whom I have worked closely in the past, to do everything I can to make  sure that all of us, including all of our territories, not only Puerto  Rico, are included in this bill, as the House intended.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation,  notwithstanding the issues that both sides here in the House have with  it, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 979) to amend the Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act  of 2006 to incorporate the recommendations made by the Government  Accountability Office relating to advance contracts, and for other  purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:  [[Page H7269]]                                        S. 979         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Federal Advance Contracts       Enhancement Act'' or the ``FACE Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds that--        (1) the Post-Katrina Emergency Management and Reform Act of       2006 (Public Law 109-925; 120 Stat. 1394) required the       Federal Emergency Management Agency to establish advance       contracts, which are established prior to disasters and are       typically needed to quickly provide life-sustaining goods and       services in the immediate aftermath of a disaster;        (2) the catastrophic hurricanes and wildfires in the United       States in 2017 highlighted the importance of these advance       contracts in disaster response;        (3) in a report issued by the Government Accountability       Office entitled ``2017 Disaster Contracting: Action Needed to       Better Ensure More Effective Use and Management of Advance       Contracts'', the Government Accountability Office identified       a number of challenges with advance contracts and recommended       actions to improve management by the Federal Emergency       Management Agency of these contracts for future disasters;       and        (4) section 691 of the Post-Katrina Emergency Management       Reform Act of 2006 (6 U.S.C. 791) should be amended to       incorporate the recommendations made by the report described       in paragraph (3) to ensure more effective use and management       of advance contracts.       SEC. 3. FEDERAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY ADVANCE                     CONTRACTS.         (a) In General.--Section 691 of the Post-Katrina Emergency       Management Reform Act of 2006 (6 U.S.C. 791) is amended by       adding at the end the following:        ``(e) Updated Report.--Not later than 180 days after the       date of enactment of this subsection, the Administrator shall       submit to the appropriate committees of Congress an updated       report that contains--        ``(1) the information required in the initial report under       subparagraphs (A) and (B) of subsection (a)(1); and        ``(2) an updated strategy described in subsection (a)(1)(C)       that clearly defines--        ``(A) the objectives of advance contracts;        ``(B) how advance contracts contribute to disaster response       operations of the Agency;        ``(C) how to maximize the award of advance contracts to       small business concerns, as defined in section 3 of the Small       Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632); and        ``(D) whether and how advance contracts should be       prioritized in relation to new post-disaster contract awards.        ``(f) Additional Duties of the Administrator.--        ``(1) Head of contracting.--The Administrator shall ensure       that the head of contracting activity of the Agency--        ``(A) not later than 270 days after the date of enactment       of this subsection, updates the Disaster Contracting Desk       Guide of the Agency to provide specific guidance--        ``(i) on whether and under what circumstances contracting       officers should consider using existing advance contracts       entered into in accordance with this section prior to making       new post-disaster contract awards, and include this guidance       in existing semi-annual training given to contracting       officers; and        ``(ii) for contracting officers to perform outreach to       State and local governments on the potential benefits of       establishing their own pre-negotiated advance contracts;        ``(B) adheres to hard copy contract file management       requirements in effect to ensure that the files relating to       advance contracts entered into in accordance with this       section are complete and up to date, whether the files will       be transferred into the Electronic Contract Filing System of       the Agency or remain in hard copy format;        ``(C) notifies contracting officers of the 3-day time frame       requirement for entering completed award documentation into       the contract writing system of the Agency when executing       notice to proceed documentation;        ``(D) not later than 180 days after the date of enactment       of this subsection, revises the reporting methodology of the       Agency to ensure that all disaster contracts are included in       each quarterly report submitted to the appropriate       congressional committees under this section on disaster       contract actions;        ``(E) identifies a single centralized resource listing       advance contracts entered into under this section and ensures       that source is current and up to date and includes all       available advance contracts; and        ``(F) communicates complete and up-to-date information on       available advance contracts to State and local governments to       inform their advance contracting efforts.        ``(2) Master acquisition planning schedule.--Not later than       180 days after the date of enactment of this subsection, the       Administrator shall update and implement guidance for program       office and acquisition personnel of the Agency to--        ``(A) identify acquisition planning time frames and       considerations across the entire acquisition planning process       of the Agency; and        ``(B) clearly communicate the purpose and use of a master       acquisition planning schedule.''.        (b) Report.--The Administrator of the Federal Emergency       Management Agency shall regularly update the appropriate       committees of Congress (as defined in section 602 of the       Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006 (6       U.S.C. 701)) on the progress of the Federal Emergency       Management Agency in implementing the recommendations of the       Government Accountability Office in the report entitled       ``2017 Disaster Contracting: Action Needed to Better Ensure       More Effective Use and Management of Advance Contracts'', as       required under section 691 of the Post-Katrina Emergency       Management Reform Act of 2006 (6 U.S.C. 791), as amended by       subsection (a).     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on S. 979.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of S. 979, the Federal Advance  Contracts Enhancement Act. This bipartisan and bicameral bill  introduced in the Senate by Senators Rubio, Peters, Johnson, and  Tillis, and in the House by Representatives Bennie Thompson,   Donald  Payne, Jr.,   Mike Rogers, and Peter King addresses the findings of the  Government Accountability Office's report titled ``2017 Disaster  Contracting: Actions Needed to Better Ensure More Effective Use and  Management of Advance Contracts.''   In its report, GAO found several issues with the Federal Emergency  Management Agency's handling of advance contracts, including  limitations in the agency's use of some advance contracts,  Congressional committees being provided with incomplete information in  FEMA reports, and coordination with States and localities on the use of  advance contracts.                                time  1230    GAO made final recommendations, including that FEMA update its  strategy and guidance to clarify the use of advance contracts, improve  the timeliness of its acquisition planning activities, revise its  methodology for reporting disaster contracting actions to congressional  committees, and provide more consistent guidance and information to  contracting officers to coordinate with and encourage States and  localities to establish advance contracts.   FEMA concurred with all of GAO's recommendations.   Following Hurricane Katrina, Congress required FEMA to establish  advance contracts for goods and services to enable the Federal  Government to quickly mobilize resources to affected areas in the  aftermath of a disaster.   This bill allows FEMA to ensure more effective use and management of  its advance contracts process by incorporating GAO's recommendations to  ensure that Federal preparedness actions are coordinated to prevent  gaps in recovery efforts from occurring.   The bill also requires FEMA to regularly update the appropriate  committees of Congress on the progress of the agency's implementation  of these recommendations.   Given this year's unprecedented level of disaster activity, it is  critical that Congress enact these reforms ahead of the start of the  next disaster season in order to ensure that both FEMA and our States,  Tribes, territories, and localities are well-prepared and equipped for  future disasters.   Madam Speaker, I support S. 979, and I urge my colleagues to do the  same. I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, the gentleman has yielded, and I certainly  concur with him. I am very pleased that this bill comes out now, in the  season of climate change, where we have seen increased disasters in our  country.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 2730) to establish and ensure an inclusive and transparent  Drone Advisory Committee.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 2730         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Drone Advisory Committee for       the 21st Century Act''.       SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS.         It is the Sense of Congress that:        (1) Due to the ever-increasing use of Unmanned Aircraft       Systems in the agriculture, forestry, and rangeland sectors,       as well as the inherently different uses in less populated       parts of the nation, membership of the Drone Advisory       Committee established by the Federal Aviation Administration       should, to the extent practicable, include direct       representatives from county and tribal government,       agriculture, forestry, and rangeland interests.        (2) Full transparency in the work of the Drone Advisory       Committee is vital to ensuring the public can effectively       participate and contribute to the development of sound       Federal policies. The Administrator of the Federal Aviation       Administration should, to the maximum extent practicable,       ensure the work of the Drone Advisory Committee is shared       with and easily accessible to the public and shall ensure       transparency and openness in the manner in which the affairs       of the Committee are conducted.       SEC. 3. DRONE ADVISORY COMMITTEE MEMBERSHIP.         (1) In general.--The Federal Aviation Administration shall       take appropriate steps to encourage direct representation of       county and tribal governments as well as agriculture,       forestry, rangeland sectors, and other rural interests on the       Drone Advisory Committee.        (2) Public participation.--To the maximum extent       practicable, the Administrator shall include public       participation in the process of nominating individuals for       membership on the Committee.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on S. 2730.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of S. 2730, the Drone Advisory  Committee for the 21st Century Act, introduced by Senator Peters of  Michigan.   The number of unmanned aircraft systems, or drones, in the United  States airspace has grown exponentially in recent years. The growth is  expected to continue, as drones are deployed for more and more uses  each year. Drones have become important tools to assist with everything  from infrastructure inspection and lifesaving missions to delivering  medical supplies and prescriptions.   As the Federal Aviation Administration continues its efforts to  safely integrate drones into the National Airspace System, the work of  the Drone Advisory Committee, an FAA advisory committee that provides  the agency with advice and recommendations on key drone integration  issues, will continue to play an important role in such efforts.   The Drone Advisory Committee is currently comprised of executives  from a cross-section of interested stakeholders, including academia,  drone manufacturers and operators, aviation labor, and local  governments, among others. While drones are increasingly being used in  the agriculture, forestry, and rangeland sectors and by county and  Tribal governments, these stakeholders are not represented adequately  in the current committee makeup.   S. 2730 would, therefore, require the FAA to take appropriate steps  to encourage the direct representation of county and Tribal  governments, as well as agriculture, forestry, rangeland sectors, and  other rural interests, on the Drone Advisory Committee. The bill will  also require the FAA to include public participation in the process of  nominating individuals for advisory committee membership going forward.   The efforts outlined in S. 2730 will not only include transparency  and openness in how the Drone Advisory Committee's membership is  constructed, but they will also help ensure the insights of  stakeholders, with vast experience operating drones and perspectives  regarding their integration, are reflected in the advisory committee's  important work, ultimately informing future FAA decisionmaking.   Madam Speaker, I support this legislation, I urge my colleagues to do  the same, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.     Madam Speaker, as is often the case, it is difficult for  Congress to stay ahead of the technology that it must regulate.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and  I yield back the balance of my time.
