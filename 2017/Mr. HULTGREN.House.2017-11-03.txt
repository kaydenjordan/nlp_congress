 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule I, I demand a  vote on agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the Journal.    Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a  quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not  present.    Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate 50 years of community  service rendered by the United Way of Greater McHenry County.   Members of the community came together in the fall of 1966, with the  primary purpose of raising funds in order to help deserving  organizations achieve their goals.   In that first year alone, United Way raised more than $21,000. This  money went to funding organizations such as the Salvation Army and the  American Red Cross, which remain faithful partners today.   By 1977, the United Way's importance was rapidly increasing  throughout the community, as they created new partnerships with several  agencies.   In fact, the United Way of Greater McHenry County became the fastest  growing United Way of its size in the country. During their 25th  anniversary year, they delivered more than $1.1 million to local  organizations and have continued that record over the years.   I am grateful to celebrate this 50-year milestone with the people of  United Way of Greater McHenry County as they continue to help our  neighbors help each other.                            ____________________
