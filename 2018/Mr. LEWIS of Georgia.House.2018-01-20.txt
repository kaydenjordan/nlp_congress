 Mr. Speaker, I ask that the words of the  gentleman be taken down.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Alabama will be seated.   The Clerk will report the words.    Mr. Speaker, I realize that this is a very  difficult time for all of us, but we all need to be a little more human  and a little more patient.   Mr. Speaker, in order to have civility among all of us, I withdraw my  objection.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The demand has been withdrawn by the  gentleman from Georgia.   The gentleman from Alabama, who has 40 seconds remaining, is  recognized.
