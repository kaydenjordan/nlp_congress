 Mr. Speaker, the people of Iran are protesting the current  Iranian regime that has for decades suppressed the Iranian people and  denied them the freedoms that we as Americans hold near and dear. The  Iranian people are protesting to hold the Iranian Government  responsible for the history of brutality against its own citizens and  the world.   They are marching in the streets for the 1,500 Iranians killed by the  Islamic Revolutionary Guard in December of 2019. They are marching in  the streets for the deaths of 82 Iranians, 63 Canadians, 20 Ukrainians,  4 Afghans, 4 Britons, and 3 Germans when the Iranian military destroyed  the passenger plane upon which they were flying. They are marching in  the streets against years of brutality at the hands of the Supreme  Leader and the terrorist Iranian Revolutionary Guard.   Make no mistake, Mr. Speaker, these people are marching for their  freedom and the future of their country.   President Ronald Reagan in his farewell address to our Nation  described our country as a bright, shining city on a hill that served  as a beacon for freedom-loving people everywhere. As that beacon, we  must stand with the protesters who seek freedom from this brutal  regime.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, Jeremiah 1:5 states: ``Before I formed you in  the womb I knew you, before you were born I set you apart.''   In the 47 years that have passed since Roe v. Wade, over 45 million  Americans have tragically been robbed of their lives through abortion.  The fight to protect the lives of our unborn children, however, has  grown stronger since Roe v. Wade.   As we have developed a better understanding of the immense  consequences that abortion inflicts on the mother, our society, and,  most importantly, the child in the womb, individual States, including  my home State of Mississippi, have enacted more than 1,000 preventive  laws to protect the unborn.   As a pro-life Member I am proud to join the bipartisan group of  Representatives and Senators who have filed an amicus brief that  outlines the arguments of why Roe v. Wade should be overturned.   I am grateful for the tremendous leadership of President Trump and  his administration to ensure the Federal Government's regulatory  efforts to preserve life.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage every American to join the movement to  protect our unborn children and support efforts to defend the right to  life.                            ____________________
