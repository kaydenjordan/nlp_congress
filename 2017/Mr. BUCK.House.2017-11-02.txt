 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the topic of this Special Order.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Colorado?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the topic of this Special Order.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Colorado?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to recognize  several distinguished Members of the House for the next hour.   When our constituents show up on the first Tuesday in November to  exercise their right of self-governance, they carry with them the  dreams of a better Republic.  [[Page H8430]]    In 2016, the American people commissioned us with a task. They asked  us to fight for jobs. They asked us to fight to fix healthcare. They  asked us to roll back regulations. They asked us to secure the free  world. They asked us to secure our own borders.   The House of Representatives heard them. We have been busy developing  and passing legislation that meaningfully improves the lives of  Americans. I commend the Speaker and his leadership in moving these  bills through the House.   Unfortunately, much of the House's important work is stalled in the  U.S. Senate. It is time the Senate pass important legislation and  restore trust in our Republic, because before this week, the House had  sent 308 bills to the Senate that are still stalled in that Chamber.  This is more than any of the previous four Presidential administrations  had stalled at this same time in their first year.   For the record, the House of Representatives in the 115th Congress  has also passed more total bills than Houses in any of the last four  Presidential administrations at this point. We are at 394 total bills  passed.   The dreams of this great Republic cannot be realized by the House  alone. The Senate must hear the people and come together around the  often bipartisan measures we have been sending to them.   As a way of reminding the Senate, I would like to spend the next hour  recognizing Members to discuss some of the important bills passed by  the House of Representatives that now sit motionless in the U.S.  Senate.   I am thankful for my colleagues who are joining me this evening to  talk about the House's successful legislative efforts.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. King) to talk  about the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act, H.R. 3003.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Iowa for his  thoughts.   Mr. Speaker, when we learned that Planned Parenthood was selling the  tissue of unborn children, America was outraged. Since then, the House  has redoubled its effort to pass legislation to protect the unborn.   H.R. 7 and H.R. 36 are two important pro-life measures that have  passed the House.   H.R. 36, which would prevent the killing of unborn children who are  developed enough to feel pain, passed the House by 237 votes. This  legislation has been sitting in the Senate for 31 days.   H.R. 7, which prohibits taxpayer funding for abortion, passed the  House by 238 votes. This legislation has been sitting in the Senate for  283 days.   I would like to welcome my friend and colleague from Georgia,  Representative Jody Hice, to talk about these two important bills and  protecting unborn children. I yield to the gentleman from Georgia.   Mr. JODY B. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I sincerely appreciate the  gentleman's great leadership in this, and I am grateful to be able to  speak on this issue of life.   There have been, as mentioned a few moments ago, some 300, plus or  minus, bills sent to the Senate that we have labored here in the House  and worked through, negotiated, duked it out, so to speak, gotten ideas  on the table, worked it out, sent it over to the Senate, only to see  them sit there and do nothing.   Right in the midst of all of that, at the heart of it all, are a  couple of very important bills dealing with the issue of life, which is  important to all of us. I firmly believe, and I know my colleagues do  as well, that all human life at every stage of development is worthy of  protection. I am deeply honored and proud of the fact that this House  has passed a couple of extremely important bills in that regard.   As the gentleman from Colorado just mentioned, H.R. 7, No Taxpayer  Funding for Abortion, by our friend from New Jersey, Chris Smith, and  H.R. 36, the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, by Trent Franks  of Arizona,  [[Page H8431]]  are fantastic bills. One basically says that the American taxpayer  should not be footing the bill to end the life of unborn children. It  has been sitting for over 200 days in the Senate without even a debate.   The other says that, after 20 weeks, when an unborn child is capable  of feeling pain, we are not going abort that child in the midst of a  period of time where pain is absolutely scientifically proven to be  felt. Again, that bill is sitting across the way in the Senate Chamber,  and they have not done anything about it whatsoever.   These are important bills. These bills affect lives. Every day that  the Senate does nothing, lives are being lost.   The question is: Where is the Senate?   We all sit here and we wait and we wait and we wait. The time has  come that the Senate has to take ownership of what the American people  elected not only us, but the American people elected them to do, and  that is the job, the task, the platform that we all ran on, and at the  heart of that is the fight, the battle for life.   I am also proud of the fact that the House, in our appropriations  package, defunded Planned Parenthood. This is a promise that we made  the American people after the gruesome discovery of how Planned  Parenthood was selling baby body parts. Again, we just recognize that  life is a gift from God and it is precious and it is to be protected.  It is an inalienable right that we as Members of Congress have the  responsibility to defend those inalienable rights. Obviously, without  the right to life, there, likewise, is no right to liberty, and  certainly no right to the pursuit of happiness.   Again, the question is: Where is the Senate on these issues?   It is time that we join together. Again, I thank my friend for having  this Special Order and calling on the Senate to deal with this 60-vote  threshold that has become an enormous barrier, causing all of us to be  dysfunctional in that which the American people sent us here to do.   Our conservative principles, as well as our whole Nation, rests upon  us advancing these things that the American people sent us here to do,  and at the heart of that is to defend life. I just join in calling on  the Senate to deal with this 60-vote rule and move forward on the  agenda that we are here to do.   Again, I just thank the gentleman for his kindness in allowing me to  speak on this issue, which is important not only to me, but to all of  us; and for his leadership on joining us in having a united voice,  calling our colleagues down the hallway here to do the job that they  were called on to do.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Georgia for his  passionate defense of life.   Mr. Speaker, Americans should be able to go about their daily lives  without the fear of nuclear or radiological attack.   Representative Dan Donovan's Securing the Cities Act helps equip our  cities to deal with these dangerous weapons, providing training and  detection resources.   On January 31, the House agreed by voice vote to this commonsense  legislation. For some reason, the Senate has failed in the last 276  days to move this bill.   I am proud to have the bill's sponsor, as well as m friend and  colleague, Dan Donovan, here to share more about this important  legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New York, Mr. Donovan.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman, a fellow prosecutor and  a passionate advocate for these issues, for his remarks.   Mr. Speaker, in the summer of 2015, 32-year-old Kate Steinle was  gunned down by an illegal immigrant who had been deported five times  already.   Kate's Law, introduced by Chairman Bob Goodlatte, would enhance the  penalties on illegal immigrant felons who are deported and then  returned unlawfully to the United States.   This legislation passed the House with 257 votes, a bipartisan  coalition of Members who simply want to keep violent felons out of the  United States. This bill has been stuck in the Senate for 127 days.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend and colleague, Representative Andy  Biggs, to talk about H.R. 3004, Kate's Law, and the importance of  securing our Nation from violent illegal felons.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Arizona for his  insight, and I appreciate his comments here tonight.   Mr. Speaker, in 2010, President Obama and Congress passed the Dodd- Frank legislation that attempted to reform Wall Street and end the too- big-to-fail problem. But instead of fixing the financial industry,  Dodd-Frank was mainly served to excessively regulate local community  banks, making it harder for individuals on Main Street to gain access  to credit.   The Financial CHOICE Act, sponsored by Chairman Jeb Hensarling from  the Financial Services Committee, replaced Dodd-Frank with a system  that holds Wall Street accountable, while also making credit more  accessible for Main Street America. The bill passed the House with 233  votes. It has been stuck in the Senate for 148 days.   I yield to the gentleman from West Virginia (Mr. Mooney), my friend  and colleague, who sits on the Financial Services Committee, to talk  about H.R. 10, the Financial CHOICE Act.    Mr. MOONEY of West Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from  Colorado, Mr. Buck, for leading this Special Order effort and for  recognizing me to talk about this issue and the general problem in the  Senate today of having legislation considered, debated, and passed in a  way that we can go to conference committee.   As the gentleman mentioned, the Senate has already failed to act, and  is currently failing to act, as we stand here, on over 270 House-passed  bills. One of those bills is a really important one, very important to  the committee on which I serve.   I am proud to be on the Financial Services Committee. The tradition  of  [[Page H8433]]  that position was held by my predecessor, Shelley Moore Capito, who  served on that committee for 14 years. Ably led by Chairman Jeb  Hensarling from Texas, we work in a bipartisan fashion, as much as we  possibly can, to bring relief to the American people, give consumers  choices in banking products, and the ability to get a small loan or get  a mortgage for their house. We are doing very important work there.   So, as was mentioned, on June 8 of 2017, this year, here, the U.S.  House of Representatives, where I now stand, passed H.R. 10, the  Financial CHOICE Act, by a vote of 233-186. I was very proud to vote  for that legislation, as I know were a lot of my colleagues.   The Financial CHOICE Act, if you are not familiar with the bill,  after the financial crisis in 2007, Democrats held all the Chambers in  the House, the Senate, and the Presidency, and they passed sweeping  legislation that fundamentally changed the way our economy works for  the worse; much more interference in your lives in banking, and the  ability to make loans and consider requests for bank loans were done.   Basically, Dodd-Frank is to the financial services industry what  ObamaCare is to the healthcare industry. It is a government-knows- better, one-size-fits-all, federally mandated set of laws that have  hurt the very people they claim they want to help. It hurts the same  people they want to help. So we are repealing most of that, and we are  going to empower consumers, give you the choices back.   So we have passed this bill. Let me just give you one example of  something in the bill, to be specific. There was something that was  designated in the Dodd-Frank bill called too big to fail. You may  remember that term, ``too big to fail.''   That is a situation where Washington bureaucrats had decided that  certain banks--the theory is that they are so essential to the global  economy that failure would be catastrophic. So it takes the ability to  fail out of the banks' system, which then makes them act more risky.  Big does not necessarily refer to the size of the company, just what  the government decides is essential, too big to fail.   So the first bank that was too big to fail was Bear Stearns. In March  of 2008, the Federal Reserve lent $30 billion to JPMorgan Chase to buy  the failing investment bank. Bear was a small bank, but very well- known, and there was a worry that it would destroy confidence in other  banks. So your tax dollars were used to, essentially, bail out banks.   So this bill repeals the authority of the Financial Stability  Oversight Council to designate firms as systematically important  institutions. It prohibits the use of Exchange Stabilization Funds to  bail out banks. Most Americans I talk to don't think their taxpayer  dollars should be used to bail out banks, so this bill would stop that.   So we passed that bill. We sent it to the Senate. We didn't think the  Senate would pass the exact same bill, word for word, that the House  passed. We thought they would consider our bill, take the parts they  like, maybe change some parts, maybe add some parts, or move some  parts, pass a bill in the Senate, and then we would go to a conference  committee to reconcile the differences.   One of the biggest travesties I have seen around here of the  political process, Mr. Speaker, is the failure to have conference  committees in the Congress any longer. The House passes all these  bills, over 300 over there; 270 are waiting for the Senate to do  anything on. Anything. And we wait for the Senate to act so we can have  a conference committee and reconcile the differences.   It is important to understand that no one in the House is demanding  they get their way on every bill, every provision, all the time. We  simply want to have a product sent to the Senate, have the Senate do  their job, do their due diligence, pass legislation in whatever form  they can get out of the Senate, and have a chance to go to conference  committee, reconcile the differences.   There is some give-and-take there. They won't get everything they  want. We may not get everything we want. You can reconcile those  differences, and it has to go back and pass again.   Over the past 3 years, my third year in Congress now, I have taken to  reminding folks things they learned in fifth grade, in fifth grade  grade school, about how I am just a bill sitting on Capitol Hill, and  how it is supposed to go to one Chamber; then it is supposed to go to  the other, and they appoint a conference committee to reconcile the  differences.   Instead, as the previous speaker, Congressman Biggs from Arizona,  mentioned, the filibuster is abused. You have 48 Democrats in the  Senate who filibuster everything. Everything. And for some reason, my  colleagues on the majority side of the aisle, the Republicans, don't  put the bills on the floor to make the American people see them  filibuster, and obstruct, and shut down, avoid conference committees,  avoid passing anything in the Senate that would require action, and,  therefore, just stop anything from happening. It is a travesty of the  political process.   Neither Republican nor Democrats should stand for such an abusive  system in the Senate. So I think we should put the bills over there and  make them act. We have actually started passing pieces of the CHOICE  Act, one small bill at a time, in order to get other stuff over to the  Senate, in the hope that they will just do something, act on something.    But we shouldn't have to do that, frankly, Mr. Speaker, because the  Senate can simply pass any bill they want, or any Senate bills they  want, and then we can consider it in the House as well. We have led by  passing the CHOICE Act bill, which is the right thing to do.   You know, as disappointing as it was to see the U.S. Senate fail to  pass anything on healthcare, maybe the one silver lining was the  American people could finally see what happens if three Republicans  join with 48 Democrats to vote against the bill. We did not have the  votes to pass anything on healthcare, and the whole healthcare reform  plan died at that moment.   We are sitting here today with a failing healthcare system that is  going to continue to fail. ObamaCare is going to continue to fail. It  is not getting any better. It is getting worse.   Look, our bill wasn't perfect, Mr. Speaker, but at least we did  something in the House to address the problem. I am not saying this  bill is perfect, the CHOICE Act for financial services, but we are  doing something to address the problem that consumers are demanding,  where they can have more choice and more access to funds to buy a home  or start a small business. We are doing something about it, and the  Senate is doing nothing. They don't pass anything.   In fact, we have passed all 12 appropriations bills in this Chamber.  All 12 are sitting over there in the Senate, waiting for someone to  act.   I think the first thing they should do is bring up the military  funding bill. We are in November already. In December, next month,  funding runs out. We have passed our appropriations bills. The Senate  is doing nothing on appropriations bills.   They should bring that military bill to the floor of the Senate,  right now, and have a vote. It passed this Chamber with a strong,  bipartisan majority. Funding the military is not a partisan issue.  There are votes, I believe, in the Senate and the House to fund the  military.   But if the 48 Democrat Senators want to filibuster, abuse their  power, abuse this filibuster tradition, which was mentioned is not in  the Constitution, it is simply a courtesy extended to the minority  party; if they want to continue to abuse that power, the American  people should see them, ruthlessly, politically, try to shut down the  military, and then try to blame the President or blame the House when  they won't pass anything.   They should pass a military appropriations bill that helps fund our  troops. We will reconcile the differences and send it to the  President's desk. That, ladies and gentlemen, is how the process is  supposed to work. That is what kept our democratic republican form of  government, constitutional form of government, with democratic  elections, the rule of law, a republican constitution; that is what has  kept our country, to this point, functional and working well, having  that bipartisan, bicameral process.   What is currently happening is really a travesty to this process,  where it is being abused by the Senate. They have all these bills over  there. It is high time for them to take action, pass  [[Page H8434]]  something, pass the best product they can on this issue, and let's go  to conference committee and reconcile the differences.                                time  1900    Mr. Speaker, I urge the Senate to act as quickly as possible on the  CHOICE Act, on whatever provisions they want to. We are trying to  repeal the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Another part of that,  the fiduciary rule, has really hurt consumers. These are other parts of  the CHOICE Act that need action. The American people need and expect  relief.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from West Virginia for  his services on the Financial Services Committee, a demanding committee  and a committee that he has certainly shown his brilliance on. So we  appreciate his work very much.   Mr. Speaker, with rising premiums and sky-high deductibles, Americans  are hurting under ObamaCare. Republicans talk a lot about increasing  competition in the healthcare market, and this next bill actually makes  that talk a reality.   H.R. 372, the Competitive Health Insurance Reform Act restores  Federal antitrust laws to the health insurance industry, ensuring that  the market for health insurance remains competitive and affordable for  Americans.   On March 22, the House passed this legislation in an overwhelmingly  bipartisan fashion, and 416 Members voted for it. It is 226 days later,  and the Senate can still not move that legislation through its Chamber.   I yield to my friend and colleague, the gentleman from Arizona (Mr.  Gosar), to say a few words about this bill that he sponsored.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Arizona, especially  with his healthcare background. I know he has said on many occasions  that he is a dentist impersonating a Congressman. Right now I feel the  same way as a prosecutor impersonating a Congressman, and I appreciate  his friendship and great insight.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to now invite my friend and colleague,  Representative Ted Poe, to speak about the Email Privacy Act. This  legislation clears up a loophole in the Electronic Communications  Privacy Act, or ECPA, that allows the government, after a certain  amount of time, to search someone's email if it is held on a third- party server.   The ECPA was passed in 1986. For the past 30 years, our technology  has drastically advanced, but our electronic communications policy has  been stuck in the 1980s. The Email Privacy Act allows the law to catch  up with the tech. This bill simply requires the government to have a  warrant if they are going to search your email.   This legislation passed on voice vote. After 269 days, the bill still  sits in the Senate Judiciary Committee.   I yield to my friend and colleague, the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Poe), to speak about this important legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his hard work and  persistence on this very important issue.   Mr. Speaker, this year, the House completed all 12 appropriations  bills. It is the first time in decades that that has happened. I am  proud that our Chamber worked hard to return to a regular  appropriations process, and I can tell you that there were many late  nights spent looking through amendment after amendment both in the  Rules Committee hearing room and on the House floor. We thoughtfully  considered these bills and offered them for votes on the House floor.   But the Senate hasn't approved any of these 12 bills. Not one.  Republicans, month by month, crisis to crisis, were appropriating of  the Obama administration era. But now Republicans are in charge, and  without Senate action, we are staring down the barrel of another  omnibus or continuing resolution. This isn't fair to the American  public.   The Founders gave to Congress the power of the purse so that 435 men  and women in this Chamber and 100 men and women in the Senate Chamber  can spend weeks at a time thoughtfully discerning how to spend taxpayer  dollars. That is our job. The House has finished its work for this  year, and now we beg the Senate to finish theirs.   The House has done good work. We have listened to our constituents,  worked with our stakeholders, and met each other in the middle on many  bills. Now we are left just talking about these great bills because  they are all stuck in the Senate.   I want to take a minute in closing to remind the Senate why we are  here and why the voters offered the Republican Party control of both  Chambers and the House.   We are here because Americans want fewer regulations. We are here  because Americans want lower healthcare premiums and costs. We are here  because Americans want a stronger stance against the world's bullies.  We are here because Americans want a respect for the rule of law. We  are here because Americans want our veterans to have the best care. We  are here because Americans want better access to credit. They want to  protect unborn life. We are here because Americans expect us to improve  their lives, to work on meaningful legislation that limits government,  that stewards taxpayer dollars effectively, and that guards family  values.   Americans should know that the House of Representatives has heard  them. We have passed bills to address these concerns. Now we turn to  the Senate and ask them to do the same.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Lewis of Minnesota). All Members are  reminded to avoid engaging in personalities toward Members of the  Senate.                            ____________________
