 Mr. President. I agree with my colleague from Georgia  that we need to simplify our Tax Code. We need real tax reform. We have  seen a lot of junk built up in the Tax Code over many years, put there  by special interests that seek special deals for themselves--deals that  are not enjoyed by the American public. We should do tax reform.   What we should not do is increase our national debt and our national  deficits, and we all know that the budget plan that passed this  Senate--and just recently passed the House--has written right into it  an increase in the national debt of $1.5 trillion over the next 10  years. In other words, it is engineered right into that bill. So I hope  our colleagues who really do care about reducing our national debt will  make sure that, as we discuss this tax proposal, we do not increase our  national debt.   We should, of course, eliminate unnecessary and wasteful  expenditures, but we should not have a tax proposal that increases our  debt by $1.5 trillion and possibly more. As it appears now, that would  primarily be done to provide big tax breaks to very wealthy people and  big corporations, at the expense of everybody and everything else in  the country.   But we will have a fuller debate starting tomorrow when the House  Ways and Means Committee unveils its proposal.
