 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, there is one thing about us Americans that separates us  from the rest of the world: we have a Bill of Rights in this country,  and it includes the Seventh Amendment, and my colleague, Mr. McEachin,  just mentioned it, the Seventh Amendment: the right of trial by jury  shall be preserved. It is what makes us Americans.   And watch out. When you hear them attacking legal fees and lawyers  making money, that means they are attacking your rights. They are  trying to take them away.   For too long, big banks have gotten away with taking advantage of  their customers, from fake accounts to subprime mortgages. American  consumers have suffered a great deal of harm at the hands of Wall  Street, and now we have a rule that will help consumers fight back. It  is a rule from the Consumer Bureau that fixes a flaw in the judicial  system that keeps victims from accessing justice by banding together  with class actions.   Don't let them take your rights away. Let's fight this resolution.
