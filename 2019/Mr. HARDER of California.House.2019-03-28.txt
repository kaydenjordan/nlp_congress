 Madam Speaker, I rise today because it is  absolutely absurd that in the year 2019, women are still paid less than  men, 77 cents on the dollar compared to men, but it is even worse for  women of color. Latina women make only 53 cents on the dollar.   That is why I was so proud to support the Paycheck Fairness Act,  which included our amendment to specifically support women of color.   There are thousands of Latina women in my district who work hard day  in, day out, only to be paid half what their male counterparts get. It  hurts them, it hurts their families, and it hurts our Central Valley  community.   This is an equality issue, but it is also an economic issue. In fact,  almost a quarter of the families in the Central Valley have a woman as  their breadwinner.   It is 2019. It is time that women, especially Latina women, are not  left behind.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues in the Senate to take up this  bill and make sure we are lifting up everyone in our communities.                            ____________________
