 Mr. President, President Trump's nomination of Judge  Neil Gorsuch to be a member of the U.S. Supreme Court is being  considered this week in the Senate Judiciary Committee. Soon, the  nomination is likely to move to the floor for debate.   Some have suggested that instead of allowing a majority of Senators  to decide whether to approve the nomination of Judge Gorsuch, there  should be first a cloture vote to determine whether to cut off debate.  Cutting off debate requires the approval of 60 Senators, so if 41 of  the 46 Democratic Senators vote not to cut off debate, there would  never be an up-or-down majority vote to approve Judge Gorsuch. In other  words, the 41 Democratic Senators would have filibustered to death the  Gorsuch nomination.   Filibustering to death the Gorsuch nomination--or any Presidential  nomination, for that matter--flies in the face of 230 years of Senate  tradition. Throughout the Senate's history, approval of even the most  controversial Presidential nominations has required only a majority  vote. For example, in 1991 President George H.W. Bush nominated  Clarence Thomas to be an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court. The  debate was bitter. The Senate confirmed Judge Thomas narrowly, 52 to  48. Although the Senate rules allowed any Senator to try to filibuster  the nomination to death, none did. In fact, Senate rules have always  allowed Senators the option to filibuster to death a Presidential  nomination; yet it has almost never happened. According to the former  Senate Historian, with one possible exception, which I will mention in  a minute, the number of Supreme Court Justices in our country's history  who have been denied their seat by filibuster is zero. The number of  Cabinet members in our country's history who have been denied their  seats by filibuster is zero. The number of Federal district judges in  our country's history who have been denied their seats by filibuster is  zero. And until 2003, the number of Federal circuit judges in our  country's history who have been denied their seats by filibuster was  zero.   Senator Everett Dirksen did not filibuster President Lyndon Johnson's  Presidential nominations. Senator Robert Byrd did not filibuster  President Reagan's nominees. Senator Howard Baker did not filibuster  President Carter's nominees. Senator Bob Dole did not filibuster  President Clinton's nominees. During most of the 20th century, when one  party controlled the White House and the Senate 70 percent of the time,  the minority never filibustered to death a single Presidential nominee.   On the other hand, there have been plenty of filibusters on  legislation--so many that in 1917, the Senate adopted a cloture rule as  a way to end filibusters. The rule was amended in 1949, 1959, 1975,  1979, and 1986--always in response to filibusters on legislation, never  on nominations. It was the 1975 change that established the current  cloture standard of 60 votes to end debate except on amendments to the  standing rules of the Senate.    Filibustering a Presidential nomination has always been treated  differently than filibustering a legislative matter. The filibuster of  legislation is perhaps the Senate's most famous characteristic. It has  been called ``democracy's finest show, the right to talk your head  off.'' As the actor Jimmy Stewart said in the movie ``Mr. Smith Goes to  Washington,'' ``Wild horses aren't going to drag me off this floor  until those people have heard everything I've got to say, even if it  takes all winter.'' That was Jimmy Stewart in ``Mr. Smith Goes to  Washington.''   The late Senator Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia described the  importance of the legislative filibuster in a different way. He said in  his last speech:         Our Founding Fathers intended the Senate to be a continuing       body that allows for open and unlimited debate and the       protection of minority rights. Senators have understood this       since the Senate first convened.    In fact, the whole idea of the Senate is not to have majority rule on  legislation. Throughout Senate history, the purpose of the legislative  filibuster has been to force consensus on issues, to force there to be  a group of Senators on either side who have to respect one another's  views so they work together and produce 60 votes on important matters,  as we did on the 21st Century Cures bill and as we did on the bill  fixing No Child Left Behind.   Nominations have always been treated differently from legislation.  For example, under rule XIV, any Senator could bring legislation  directly to the calendar bypassing committees. There is no such power  for nominations. Senate rules allow debate and therefore the  possibility of filibuster on a motion to proceed to legislation. Debate  is not allowed on a motion to proceed to nominations.   In summary, while Senate rules have always allowed extended debate or  filibusters, the filibuster was never used to block a nomination until  recently. As I mentioned earlier, it was never used to block a Cabinet  nomination, never used to block a Federal district judge, and until  2003, never used to block a circuit judge, and never used to block a  Supreme Court Justice in the country's history, with one possible  exception. That was in 1968, when President Johnson sought to elevate  Associate Justice Abe Fortas to be Chief Justice. When it became clear  the Senate majority wouldn't agree, Johnson engineered a 45-to-43  cloture vote so forces could save face and appear to have won  something. Fortas then asked the President to withdraw the nomination.   Other than the Fortas nomination, the filibuster was never used to  block any judicial nomination until 2003 and 2004, when Democrats  decided to use the 60-vote cloture requirement to block 10 of President  George W. Bush's nominations. This unprecedented action produced a  threat by Republicans to change the Senate rules, to make it clear that  only a majority vote is required to approve a Presidential nomination.  There was a negotiation and eventually five of Bush's nominations were  approved, five were blocked and the rules were not changed. Then, in  2011 and 2013, Republicans returned the favor--as often happens around  here--by seeking to block 5 of President Obama's nominees for the  circuit court by insisting on a 60-vote cloture for  [[Page S1878]]  each. Republicans alleged that President Obama was trying to pack the  circuit court in the District of Columbia with three liberal judges.   To overcome Republican objections, Democrats invoked the so-called  nuclear option. They broke the Senate rules to change the Senate rules.  The new rule eliminated the possibility of 60-vote cloture motions for  all Presidential nominees except for the Supreme Court.   That is where we stand today. There have been other examples of  minority Senators filibustering nominations to death, all of them  during the last three administrations and all involving sub-Cabinet  nominations. Of course, there have been delays in considering  nominations. My own nomination in 1991 as U.S. Education Secretary was  delayed 51 days by Democratic Senators. Of course, I thought  unnecessarily.   President Reagan's nomination of Ed Meese as Attorney General of the  United States was delayed a year by a Democratic Senate. No one has  ever disputed our right in the Senate, regardless of who is in charge,  to use our constitutional duty of advice and consent to delay and  examine and sometimes cause nominations to be withdrawn or even to  defeat nominees by a majority vote.   As we approach a vote on Judge Gorsuch on the floor of the Senate, it  is useful to remember that the tradition of the United States Senate,  for 230 years, has been to treat legislative matters and nominations  differently. Filibuster to death legislation, yes. Filibuster to death  Presidential nominations? No. Should the Gorsuch nomination come to the  floor soon, as I believe it will, overwhelming Senate tradition  requires that whether to approve it should be decided by a majority  vote of Senators, and there should be no attempt by the minority to  filibuster the nomination to death.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Johnson). The Senator from New Jersey.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed  in the Record a copy of my remarks at the Senate Committee on Health,  Education, Labor, and Pensions earlier today.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:         2017 Food and Drug Administration User Fee Reauthorization         The Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and       Pensions will please come to order. We're holding a hearing       today on ``FDA User Fee Agreements: Improving Medical Product       Regulation and Innovation for Patients Part 1.''        Now, Senator Murray and I will each have an opening       statement, then we will introduce our panel of witnesses.       After our witness testimony, senators will have 5 minutes of       questions. The subject of today is the Food and Drug       Administration's medical device and drug user fees. It seems       like a long time ago, but it really wasn't that long ago,       that Congress passed the 21st Century Cures Act. 94 Senators       voted for it, President Obama and Vice President Biden were       strongly in support of it. So were Speaker Ryan and Mitch       McConnell, who called it ``the most important piece of       legislation in the last Congress.        It came through this committee and I thank the members of       the committee, especially for resolving our differences of       opinions and making it possible to reach a consensus. That       bill was about the moving medical products, drugs and devices       more rapidly, in a safe way, through the investment and the       regulatory process into the hands of patients and doctors       offices.        Today, we are talking about really implementing that great       goal, one that shows so much promise for virtually every       American. We're here to talk about how we continue the fund       the Food and Drug Administration, the agency responsible for       making sure the promising research supported by 21st Century       Cures actually reaches patients.        We will hear from witnesses from the agency itself to tell       us how the user fee agreements will improve the agency's       abilities to regulate medical products and promote       innovation. We will hear from patients, device manufacturers,       and brand and generic drug manufacturers in a second hearing,       which is tentatively scheduled for April 4.        I want to thank the witnesses for taking the time to       testify today. We respect the great amount of expertise and       service that you've given for our country. I want to thank       you also for moving so quickly to implement the 21st Century       Cures Act. I noticed specifically that the provision       involving regenerative medicine was published with about a       month after President Obama signed the law.        The first medical product user fee agreement was enacted in       1992. FDA worked with the drug manufacturers to hammer out an       agreement that the agency would collect user fees from drug       manufacturers in exchange for more timely, predictable       reviews. The agreement was a success--it decreased review       times and increased patient access to medicines.        Before September 30 of this year, 4 different user fee       agreements need to be reauthorized: The Prescription drug       user fee is the first one. Now it's common around here to       call it PDUFA, I'm not going to do it. I just can't stand       PDUFA, and MDUFA and GDUFA and the other UFA. So I'm going to       call them if you don't mind, the prescription drug user fee,       which accounted for over 70 percent of the brand drug review       budget in FY2015.        The second one is the Medical device user fee, which       accounted for 35 percent of the medical device review budget       in 2015.        The Generic drug user fee accounted for 70 percent of the       generic drug review budget. Biosimilar user fee accounted for       7 percent of the biosimilar review budget.                    Consequences of Failing to Reauthorize         So a lot of the money for the FDA comes from these       agreements with manufacturers of prescription drugs and       devices.        The authority for FDA to collect user fees for medical       product review will expire on September 30 of this year--six       months from now.        Now this is probably the most important part of what I have       to say this morning. If we do not move quickly to reauthorize       these agreements, the FDA will be forced to begin sending       layoff notices to more than 5,000 employees to notify them       that they may lose their jobs in 60 days--that's what they       have to do by law.        A delay in reauthorizing these agreements would delay the       reviews of drugs and devices submitted after April 1, only a       few days away.        For example, if we do not pass these reauthorizations into       law before the current agreements expire, an FDA reviewer who  [[Page S1887]]       gets started reviewing a cancer drug submitted to the agency       in April would be laid off on October 1, before the reviewer       is able to finish his or her work. The sooner we reauthorize       the agreements, the better--to give patients, reviewers, and       companies certainty.        In addition to harming patients and families that rely on       medical innovation, a delay in reauthorizing the user fees       would threaten biomedical industry jobs and America's global       leadership in biomedical innovation.                         Process for reauthorization         I am hopeful that this committee, and this Congress, can       work in a bipartisan manner to reauthorize the user fees       before the August recess.        Congress must pass legislation reauthorizing and updating       the fees to support the recommendations contained in what are       called ``commitment letters'' sent to Congress in January.        Now these commitment letters are part of the agreements       between FDA and industry--they establish the agency's       commitments, such as timelines for application review or to       put out guidances in exchange for the fees Congress       authorizes. The letters were transmitted to Congress in       January of this year.        So today's hearing is not the first time members of       Congress or the public is hearing about the recommendations       for reauthorization.        In Congress, while we were working on the 21st Century       Cures and after it was signed into law, the HELP Committee       had 15 bipartisan briefings, some of which were in       conjunction with the Energy and Commerce Committee in the       House of Representatives as well, so we could hear from FDA       and industry about the reauthorization. The first of those       briefings was back in late 2015.        Outside of Congress, the FDA posted meeting minutes after       every negotiation, and held public meetings to hear feedback.        So the content of the commitment letters, and the changes       to the fee authorizations, should not be new, or a surprise,       for any member of this committee.        After the April 4th hearing, I hope to move to mark-up the       legislation in committee as soon as possible.        This is the first time that the user fees have sunset in       the first year of a new administration, so we are starting       hearings a little later this year than we did in 2012.        In order to get this done on time, any additional policies       that Senators may want to attach need to be broadly       bipartisan, related to human medical products, and non-      controversial in order to avoid slowing the package down.               How reauthorization builds on 21st Century Cures         There are many improvements in the commitment letters and       fee structure in these reauthorizations to be excited about.        The prescription drug and medical device reauthorizations       include many provisions that build on the work of 21st       Century Cures, such as: involving patients in drug and       medical device development, dedicated staff to assist in the       development and review of rare disease drugs, improved       timelines, increased guidance for drug and device combination       products, and modernizing the clinical trial process.        There are important structural reforms. Each agreement       contains reporting measures built both by FDA and by       independent third parties, so we can see how the changes are       working. FDA is going to work to implement full time       reporting by 2022, so Congress, patients, and medical product       manufacturers will have a better picture about how resources       are being used at FDA and understand what is needed to do       what we ask.        The biosimilar and generic drug user fee agreement includes       additional staff and resources to approve more biosimilars       and more generic drugs, which provide more competition and       lower drug costs.        These are just a few of the highlights of the       reauthorization and commitment letters. It is a good       agreement for patients, and I look forward to working with       Senator Murray and all the members of the Committee to get it       done expeditiously.                            ____________________
