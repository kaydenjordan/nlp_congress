 Madam Speaker, I rise today to talk about the importance  of investing in our Nation's infrastructure. And, in particular, to fix  our broken and aging water delivery systems, not only in California but  throughout the country.   In California's San Joaquin Valley, the availability of a clean and  reliable water supply is absolutely essential for the foundation of our  economy. Farmers need water to feed the world, and life becomes  obviously very difficult if residents don't have a clean drinking water  supply.   The waterways that carry our water were built decades ago in  California and throughout the country.   Last week, I introduced legislation to fix two pieces of critical  water infrastructure, the Delta-Mendota Canal and the California  Aqueduct, that were built decades ago.   The Conveyance Capacity Correction Act will provide $400 million to  fund these needed projects. This legislation is just one of the many  tools we have that can fix the water system that we have; one of the  water tools in our water toolbox.   We need to invest in our water infrastructure now for the future  sustainability of our State and the livelihood of our residents.   Food is a national security item.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from California for  the good work that she does on behalf of her constituents, and I  appreciate the opportunity to make comments that are important  investments that we should be making in our infrastructure for all  Americans.   The President, when he ran for office, talked about his willingness  to invest in America's infrastructure. Sadly, we have seen little  follow-through on behalf of the administration to do just that.   America was built over decades and generations on Americans willing  to invest in our infrastructure. Clearly, today, we are living off the  investments our parents and grandparents made a generation or two ago.   In California, but throughout the country, that includes fixing our  aging water systems, our transportation systems, and investing in our  school sites. In my home in the San Joaquin Valley, the development of  water over the last 100 years has allowed deserts to bloom.   A reliable water supply is a foundation for any economy. Farmers need  water to feed the world. We say, ``where water flows, food grows,'' and  life becomes increasingly difficult when we have literally hundreds and  thousands of Californians and elsewhere around the country in which  communities that are small, that are not incorporated, cannot meet or  comply with clean drinking water standards either by the State or by  the Federal Government. That is just wrong.   The richest country in the world, and yet we have communities that  don't meet clean drinking water standards?   We know that many of these water systems were built decades ago.  California now has doubled its population. We need to invest.    Madam Speaker, this last week, I introduced legislation for critical  water infrastructure in parts of my district, the west side of the San  Joaquin Valley, the Delta-Mendota Canal that has lost 15 to 20 percent  of its capacity.   The California Aqueduct that not only brings water from the north to  the San Joaquin Valley but to Los Angeles as a critical supply of those  water needs for Los Angelenos, these canals supply water to tens of  millions of people, and also to the Santa Clara Valley Water, the home  of what? Silicon Valley.   The legislation that I introduced, the Conveyance Capacity Correction  Act, will provide $400 million to fund these needed repairs. This is  just one piece of legislation to address the many tools in our water  toolbox in California's aging water system, but we need to invest now  in our water infrastructure.   We also need to invest now in our transportation system. The roads  that were built in California and the highways, the inner city and  transit systems and our air transportation have really, post-World War  II, been the reason why California has become the Golden State. And we,  again, are living off those investments our parents made. We need to  make the same kinds of investments.   When the President talks about $1 trillion of investment across  America, that is wonderful, and our Committee on Transportation and  Infrastructure has sought where those needs should be felt. But to do  that, you have to put up real money to match local, State dollars with  Federal money.   We haven't really provided any new Federal sources of funding since  the 1990s; and it is absolutely essential if we are going to have this  sort of 21st century system of transportation that is intermodal, that  is interconnected, that will be provided for people for work, for  pleasure, and for a host of purposes to get from point A to point B, to  ensure that they can do it safely, in a way that makes the quality of  life absolutely better.   So those are the challenges we face. We are working to put an  infrastructure package together that will fund our roads and highways,  our transit systems, our inner-city rail systems that include high- speed rail.   We are building high-speed rail in California, and I have introduced  legislation that will provide money for fast  [[Page H1117]]  trains throughout the country, as well as in California. We are under  construction now.   But that is one part of an overall connected system that makes sure  that our air transportation, that our inner-city transportation and our  roads and highways are connected as we see in Europe and in other parts  of the world. That is the challenge.   Madam Speaker, I think, if we can come together in a bipartisan  fashion as we have done traditionally, we can overcome these challenges  and invest in ways that do what? Provide good-paying jobs; because when  you invest in the infrastructure--whether it is our water, our  transportation, our schools--we are investing in Americans, and those  create the good-paying jobs that raise all boats for working people.  And, really, that is what we are talking about here when we talk about  investing: investing for working people, for all Americans.   Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Orange County for all of  her good work.                             Freedom of Religion
