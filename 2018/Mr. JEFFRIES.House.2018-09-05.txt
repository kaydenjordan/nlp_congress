 Mr. Speaker, wages are down; gas prices are up; and the  culture of corruption here in Washington, D.C., is out of control. And  all the while, the 45th President of the United States of America  spends more time on the golf course than any other President in  American history.   Things are spiraling out of control. The stakes are incredibly high.  Notwithstanding that, the 115th Congress has been one of the most  unproductive Congresses in the history of the Nation.  [[Page H7831]]                                     time  1030    Democrats and Republicans have two competing visions for what we need  to do in order to make sure that every American can continue to  experience the American Dream.   Democrats, we want to move the country forward. Others want to turn  back the clock.   We are working hard to bring people together. Others are tearing us  apart.   We are fighting for working families and middle-class folks. Others  are fighting for the wealthy and the well off.   We believe in the public interest. Others are all about the special  interests.   Democrats are fighting for the people. Others are fighting for the  privileged few. We are fighting for working families, middle-class  folks, senior citizens, the poor, the sick, the afflicted, veterans,  people in rural America, urban America, suburban America.   Democrats are fighting for the people. But my colleagues on the other  side of the aisle, unfortunately, are fighting for millionaires,  billionaires, mega corporations, lobbyists, big donors, all to  subsidize the lifestyles of the rich and shameless.   Exhibit A is the Republican tax scam. That is their signature piece  of legislation. That is what they are talking to the American people  about.   You are proud of the fact that you passed a bill where 83 percent of  the benefits go to the wealthiest 1 percent in America, explodes the  debt by more than $1.5 trillion, then you want to come back to Congress  and lecture us about cutting Social Security and Medicare? Are you  kidding?   Our For the People agenda will focus on lowering healthcare costs,  strengthening the Affordable Care Act, protecting people with  preexisting conditions, more than 100 million Americans. They want to  take away that protection. We are working hard to dramatically lower  the cost of lifesaving prescription drugs. That is the Democratic For  the People agenda.   Wage stagnation is still a problem for the American people. The  productivity of the American worker over the last 40-plus years has  increased by more than 285 percent. During the same period of time,  wages have gone up by less than 10 percent.   The productivity gains of the American worker have not gone to the  American worker, they have gone to the privileged few. What do the  Republicans do about it? Pass a tax bill where 83 percent of the  benefits go to the wealthiest 1 percent.   We have a different idea for what should take place. We are fighting  for the people through increased pay anchored in a real infrastructure  plan that will fix our crumbling bridges, roads, tunnels, ports, mass- transportation system; not a fake plan, it is a real plan. We will  invest $1 trillion, create 16 million good-paying jobs, fight to make  sure that everyday Americans can provide a comfortable living for  themselves and for their families.   And, lastly, we are going to fight to clean up corruption here in  Washington, D.C.; not talk about it, actually get something done to  make sure that Washington works for the American people.   That is what you deserve. That is what Democrats are fighting hard to  deliver: lower healthcare costs, increased pay, clean up corruption to  make sure that Washington works for the people.                            ____________________
