 Mr. Speaker, there are some issues we debate here in the  House that, frankly, should not be a matter of question in anyone's  mind. One of those is whether or not a baby born and is outside of the  womb deserves protection.   Sometimes abortion attempts fail and babies are born alive: its heart  is beating, muscles moving, and lungs working. Tragically, some  abortion providers then kill these infants directly or through neglect  and exposure, and this is unconscionable.    The Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act says that a baby who  survives an abortion must be treated at a hospital with the same care  as a baby born alive naturally at the same state of pregnancy. The bill  includes criminal sanctions against any abortion provider who kills a  baby born alive.   Mr. Speaker, killing a baby outside of the womb is unquestionably the  taking of an innocent human life. I urge unanimous support of  Representative Blackburn's bill.
