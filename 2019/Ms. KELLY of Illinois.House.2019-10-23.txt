 Madam Speaker, I rise today to remember our  dear colleague, Congressman Elijah Cummings.   Throughout his life, he was a passionate and committed leader but  also someone who would stop to show compassion and kindness to  constituents, staff, and Members alike.   His life was defined, in his words, by ``pain, passion, and  purpose.'' At just 11 years old, he and his friends began working to  integrate a segregated swimming pool in South Baltimore.   He would go on to achieve many of the highest accolades in education,  earning 12 honorary doctorate degrees.   Before serving in the Halls of Congress, he served the people of  Maryland for 14 years in the general assembly, including breaking the  color barrier with his election to speaker pro tempore, the second  highest ranking office in the Maryland House of Delegates.   He would come to Congress in 1996. All of his contributions and  service to this Nation could never be summed up in a few seconds, but  it stands on its own. When the history books are written, I know his  name and legacy will be proudly enshrined within its pages.   His passing is a great loss to his family and friends, the city of  Baltimore, this institution, and our Nation.   I hope you are dancing with the angels. May you rest in peace, my  friend.                            ____________________
