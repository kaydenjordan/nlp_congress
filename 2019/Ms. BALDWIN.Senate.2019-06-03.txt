 Mr. President, today I rise to recognize the Milwaukee  Urban League on its 100th anniversary. It gives me great pleasure to  honor this remarkable organization and to commemorate this historic  milestone.   The Milwaukee Urban League was established in 1919 as an affiliate of  the National Urban League, which grew out of the national quest for  freedom and opportunity. During the emergence of the Milwaukee Urban  League, millions of African Americans were migrating from the South to  Northern States like Wisconsin in search of greater opportunity and a  better quality of life. The newcomers soon learned that they had not  escaped racial discrimination in jobs, education, and housing. By  teaching useful skills and offering an array of resources, the  Milwaukee Urban League sought to help African Americans through this  difficult transition to urban life and employment in a manufacturing  economy.  [[Page S3158]]    Throughout its early years, the Milwaukee Urban League was  instrumental in fighting for social justice and equal opportunity for  African Americans. The league became a strong and dedicated voice for  the poor and underserved by helping them obtain decent housing, acquire  workforce training and leadership skills, find health care, and ensure  their children had access to education and opportunity.   Over the past century, the Milwaukee Urban League has made tremendous  gains helping African Americans achieve their greatest potential. The  league has continued to promote self-sufficiency through a variety of  programs that teach professional skills. The Milwaukee Urban League has  also demonstrated an unprecedented commitment to education and youth  engagement. By supporting initiatives to improve the lives of those who  are often left behind, the Milwaukee Urban League has brought about  meaningful change in Wisconsin's largest city.   With the great challenges still facing the African-American community  today, Milwaukee continues to need the league's leadership, strength,  and resilience. Despite the organization's unflagging efforts, rising  tides have not raised all boats equally, and unacceptable disparities  continue to exist. Wages, educational outcomes, economic conditions,  neighborhood safety, and the opportunity to achieve the American dream  still depend to a large degree on a person's ZIP Code or the color of  his or her skin.   By working together, we can ensure that African Americans and all  community members are educated, employed, and empowered to succeed. The  league's persistent commitment to improving opportunities for those  trapped in poverty fosters hope for the next generation of leaders in  Milwaukee's communities of color.   As the Milwaukee Urban League both celebrates its accomplishments and  reflects on its future challenges, I will be forever grateful for the  league's achievements over the past century, and I look forward to its  continued success in the years to come.                            ____________________
