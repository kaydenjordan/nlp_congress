 Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate National  Infertility Awareness Week, which since 1989 has honored the people,  doctors, researchers, and others for their work in destigmatizing  infertility and raising awareness of the challenges many people face  when trying to start a family.   Creating life and starting and nurturing a family are, of course,  foundational experiences that bring challenges, rewards, and great joy.  For millions of people, however, infertility is a barrier to having  children, affecting approximately one in five Americans. Thanks to the  extraordinary efforts of doctors, scientists, and researchers though,  our country has made great strides in helping better understand  infertility and provide treatments and support for people who are  struggling to start a family. Tens of thousands of children were born  last year alone thanks to IVF. And organizations like Resolve: The  National Infertility Association have been instrumental in supporting  people who struggle with infertility, as well as raising awareness  about this critical issue. Unfortunately, many couples still face  financial and other barriers to using this procedure, and I urge my  colleagues to consider ways that we can make it easier and more  affordable for people to start a family in this way.   If we believe that everyone in our country counts and should be free  to reach their full potential, then we need to do more to ensure that  more Americans are able and free to start a family, so they too can  partake in one of life's most rewarding journeys.                            ____________________
