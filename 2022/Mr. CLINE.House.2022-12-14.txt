 Mr. Speaker, I rise today with sorrow to honor the life  and memory of the late Virginia delegate, Ronnie Campbell, who passed  away following a hard-fought battle with cancer.   Ronnie cared deeply for his community and for the Commonwealth and  devoted his life to serving others. He served in the Virginia House of  Delegates, and proudly represented all of the residents of the 24th  District.                                time  1100    He made a career in law enforcement, first as a State trooper with  the Virginia State Police in Northern Virginia and then as a  contractor, which gave him insight into the impact that government  regulations have on small businesses.   Ronnie was driven to serve both his Rockbridge community and his home  county of Augusta. He represented constituents as a member of the  Rockbridge County School Board and as a member of the Rockbridge County  Board of Supervisors.   Ronnie spent countless hours dedicated to public service, and he will  always be remembered as a stalwart conservative voice and strong  leader. Above all, he was a loyal friend and neighbor to all.   Our hearts and prayers are with Ronnie's wife, Ellen, and his five  children during this difficult time. May Ronnie's memory be eternal.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, enough is enough. Here in the waning days of  one-party control, Democrats are grasping at straws to push more of  their radical policy agenda on the American people. They are hoping the  lameduck House will help jam through a monstrous $1.7 trillion omnibus  down our throats before Christmas so incoming House Republicans can't  use the budget next year to impose fiscal responsibility and check  Biden's disastrous agenda.   Even though voters demanded change in November, House Republicans  have had no seat at the negotiating table. This one-week CR will  continue funding for President Biden's policies that have created  crisis after crisis.   Under his watch, the Nation is experiencing a historically bad crisis  at the southern border, a botched withdrawal from Afghanistan that cost  American lives and created tens of thousands of refugees, his quest to  provide abortion on demand, his illegal and regressive cancellation of  student loan debt, his anti-energy agenda, and an inflation crisis that  makes Americans poorer.   The American people cannot afford another Democrat-led spending  measure that would exacerbate inflation and continue to fund the very  agencies waging war on their freedoms.   Every Republican must reject this lameduck spending spree and let the  incoming Members of the new Republican majority, who will be  accountable to the voters, work to reach a more balanced agreement than  this liberal spending spree.   We must use every opportunity at our disposal, especially through the  constitutional power of the purse, to fight for the American people and  change the broken status quo in Washington. Republicans must stand  strong and oppose this last-ditch power play by Democrats.
