 Mr. Speaker, I thank very much my colleague from both the  Rules Committee and the Armed Services Committee, Mr. Byrne, for his  work on this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to support both of  these underlying bills, and I want to speak particularly about the  National Defense Authorization Act.   We are, today, living in a world where we face a more complex array  of threats than at any time in the last 70 years. The obligation that  we have to our men and women in uniform, to make sure that we provide  them with the resources that they need to defend this Nation, is a more  solemn obligation than any other we have.   There are many things that we were elected to do when we came to  Washington, and we have done many of those things in this Congress. We  have been a historically productive Congress in the months that we have  been here. We have passed repeal and replace of healthcare reform, we  have passed the repeal bill for Dodd-Frank, we have begun our important  work on immigration reform, and we have done tremendous work on  regulatory reform to lift the burden of the massive overreach of the  Obama years. But there is nothing that we do that is more important  than providing the resources for our men and women in uniform. This  bill is a very important first step in that direction.  [[Page H5450]]    I want to mention a couple of things that this bill does in  particular.   In the aftermath of the ICBM test, the first successful North Korean  ICBM test, one of the most important challenges we face as a nation is  ensuring that we have provided for the defense of this Nation with  respect to missile defense. This bill adds $2.5 billion above the  administration's request for missile defense. It focuses on including  additional interceptors for existing systems, as well as research for  new technologies.   Total missile defense is still below the funding levels during the  Bush administration. This bill is a very important first step, but, Mr.  Speaker, we have got to do much more.    We also, in this bill, begin the process of providing the necessary  additional resources and top line to begin to rebuild. We have not had  a defense budget, Mr. Speaker, since 2011 that was based upon the  Pentagon being able to assess the threats and telling us what we need  to do to be able to defend against those threats.   We have now, because we are living under the Budget Control Act, had  a Defense Department, instead, that has been obligated to fund at  levels that are arbitrary and to cut at levels that are arbitrary. No  nation can responsibly live under that system.   The next thing we have got to do is repeal the Budget Control Act. We  have got to recognize that we have a huge and growing debt crisis, a  huge fiscal crisis, but that crisis is not being driven by our defense  budget. The Budget Control Act has been ineffective at getting at what  we need to do in terms of reducing the debt. Instead, it has gutted our  defense.   We are in a world today where the North Koreans, the Iranians, the  Russians, the Chinese, ISIS, and al-Qaida are all continuing to make  strides against us, Mr. Speaker.   One of the things that I am often asked as a new Member of this body  is what has surprised me most in my time in Congress. I came to this  body, Mr. Speaker, as somebody who has spent a lot of time focused on  national security and defense issues, as someone who spent a large part  of her career really invested in and studying and learning these  issues, and I thought, Mr. Speaker, that I was relatively well informed  about these issues.   I have been stunned, Mr. Speaker, as a member of the House Armed  Services Committee, briefing after briefing after briefing, at the  extent to which we have fallen so far behind. And I think it is  critically important for my colleagues, Mr. Speaker, and for the  American people to understand the extent to which our adversaries are,  today, fielding and developing capabilities and systems against which  we cannot, may not be able to defend.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, I want to read something that Ronald Reagan  said back in 1982 on an issue when they were having similar issues and  debates and discussions about defense spending. He said: ``Now, I  realize that many well-meaning people deplore the expenditure of huge  sums of money for military purposes at a time of economic hardship.  Similar voices were heard in the 1930s, when economic conditions were  far worse than anything we're experiencing today. But the result of  heeding those voices then was a disastrous military imbalance that  tempted the forces of tyranny and evil and plunged the world into a  ruinous war. . . . We must never repeat that experience.''   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to remember that weakness is  provocative, that it is when we are strong that we are most able to  protect ourselves and to defend ourselves, and we must learn the  lessons of the past. Passing this rule and passing the underlying  legislation, this National Defense Authorization Act, is the first step  in that direction.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote in the affirmative and to  ensure that we do everything we can to defend our Nation and to make  sure that we defend freedom for the next generation.    Mr. Speaker, I was unavoidably detained recognizing the  Military Times Sailor of the Year from Gillette, Wyoming. Had I been  present, I would have voted ``nay'' on rollcall No. 350, ``nay'' on  rollcall No. 351, and ``yea'' on rollcall No. 352.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, it is surprising to sit here and hear  arguments that we have been hearing really for the last almost 70 years  now, the notion that the reason that our adversaries build nuclear  weapons is because we are building nuclear weapons, or the notion that  we all are building nuclear weapons for the same purposes.   The North Koreans are building nuclear weapons in order to threaten  us. They are building nuclear weapons, potentially, in order to hold us  hostage. They are building nuclear weapons against which we must deter.   The notion that if we advance our capabilities, the notion that if we  produce the LRSO we are going to be in a position where we are  encouraging the other side is just simply a flawed understanding. We  already have a situation where our adversaries are modernizing their  dual capable cruise missiles. They don't think these things are  destabilizing. We shouldn't argue that they are for us, as well.   In addition, the LRSO plays a hugely important deterrent role. It  imposes important and real costs on any potential adversary. It forces  them, in addition to modernizing their nuclear arsenals, to modernize  their air defense arsenals.   It is hugely important that we proceed. It is hugely important that  we modernize. I agree it is a very expensive undertaking, but I would  urge my colleagues to defeat this amendment and remember that the  single most expensive thing we can do would be to fail to defend  ourselves. The single most expensive thing we can do would be to  encourage an adversary to attack us because they think they can  overtake us or overcome our capabilities.   I think it is important that we not go down the path of unilateral  disarmament and that we do everything we can to continue to modernize  at a very rapid pace, to speed up the pace at which we are modernizing.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.
