 Mr. President, yesterday afternoon the House approved  the Omnibus appropriations bill that will fund the government through  September. The bill is the result of weeks and weeks of bipartisan,  bicameral negotiations, and the final product reflects the give-and- take of those negotiations. Again, I want to thank the majority leader  for all of his hard work and his desire to come to a good agreement, as  well as the House leaders and the leadership of the Appropriations  Committees. It has proved to many that Washington can work when we work  together.   In my view, this is a very good bill for the American people. Not  only does it explicitly preclude funding for an unnecessary and  ineffective border wall, it excludes over 160 poison pill riders, it  increases investments in programs that the middle class relies on, such  as medical research, education, and infrastructure.   The National Institutes of Health will get an additional $2 billion-- part of the Cancer Moonshot. Pell grants will be restored for over 1  million students. Infrastructure programs like CDBG and TIGER will get  an increase. Programs to combat the terrible scourge of opioid abuse  will receive an increase. Clean energy research will receive an  increase. Ninety-nine percent of the EPA's budget was protected.   In addition, there is a permanent extension of miners' health  benefits, thanks to the hard work of Joe Manchin and so many others;  funding to shore up Puerto Rico's Medicaid Program and a mechanism to  allow the island to restructure its debt; and funding to help States  like California, West Virginia, Louisiana, and North Carolina recover  from natural disasters. It  [[Page S2742]]  has a very good increase for NASA, which I will talk about at the end  of my remarks before my colleague from Florida speaks about the hard  and successful work he has done on the NASA budget.   Of course, the bill doesn't include all of the things we wanted. It  doesn't include all of the things our Republican colleagues wanted.  That is the nature of compromise. But at the end of the day, this is an  agreement which reflects our basic principles, and it is something both  Democrats and Republicans should support.   The bill shows how bipartisanship in Congress should work--both  parties negotiating in good faith in order to find consensus. It passed  in the House with an overwhelming bipartisan majority of 309 votes, and  I expect it will receive the Senate's approval later today.   More broadly, I hope this deal provides a blueprint for future budget  negotiations between our two parties here in Congress. If the four  corners--the Senate and House Democrats and Republicans--work as well  on the 2018 budget as we did on the 2017 budget, we will have a product  we can be proud of, with no worries about any kind of government  shutdown.                                  TrumpCare    Mr. President, on healthcare, as the House plans to vote on their new  vision and version of TrumpCare later today, I just want to remind the  American people of a few things.   We are now on the second major attempt to pass TrumpCare. While all  the focus in the media has been on the changes to the bill, we  shouldn't forget the bad things that stay in the underlying bill and  what they would mean for millions of Americans.   Under the new bill, as under the old, TrumpCare would mean that  premiums go up 20 percent in the first few years. Average costs go up  by over $1,500 a year on the middle class.   It would mean that if you are struggling to make it into the middle  class with an income, say, around $30,000 a year, your costs could go  up by $3 or $4,000.   It would mean insurers could charge older Americans five times or  more the amount charged to younger folks. Even the 1-to-5 ratio, as bad  as it was, as much as it raised the hackles of the members of the AARP  and senior citizens, the 54- through 64-year-olds throughout America-- this bill makes that worse.   It would devastate Medicaid, a program that covers 68 million  Americans. That would affect poor people in the inner cities, but it  would also affect people in nursing homes, and the young men and women  aged 45 to 50 who have parents in nursing homes are going to have to  face an awful choice--more money out of their pockets or their parents  having to find another place to live.   It would still mean, worst of all, that 24 million fewer Americans  will have health insurance.   All those things stay the same. This minor change made by the House  at the last minute doesn't change any of those things.   For the same reasons TrumpCare 1 only got the support of 17 percent  of the American people, TrumpCare 2 will probably have even less  support.   All the while, these cuts end up giving a massive tax break to the  wealthiest Americans--those making over $250,000 a year,  multimillionaires, billionaires. Even insurance executives who make  over $500,000 a year will get a tax break, while middle class and older  Americans get the short end of the stick. Here we are telling average  Americans they are going to get less coverage, they are going to pay  more, so we can give the multimillionaires a huge tax break. Who would  be for that?   As more and more Americans find out, the vote over there is going to  be much less popular even than it is today, and it is very unpopular  today, with only 17 percent of Americans liking the bill. It is hard to  get lower than that, but I think, as people learn more about this bill,  it will get even lower.   The House Republicans have added an amendment that makes the bill  even more cruel. It would allow States to opt out of the requirement to  cover folks with preexisting conditions for the services they need. God  forbid you have a preexisting condition and live in a State that  doesn't keep the requirement. Your only option might be a poorly  subsidized high-risk pool where you might be forced to wait in line for  virtually unaffordable coverage. Remember the death panels scare tactic  used against ObamaCare? They didn't actually exist in ObamaCare, but  they might in TrumpCare. These high-risk pools, with long lines and  unaffordable coverage, are the real death panels.   That same amendment means an insurance company can charge an older  American even more than five times the amount they are charged under  the base bill. It would take us back to the days when insurance  companies could price sick people out of insurance and drive older  Americans to bankruptcy by charging outlandish rates. That is what  House Republicans did with the bill to win more votes. It is  unfathomable.   We don't even know how large the negative impact of these changes  will be because we don't have a CBO score. Does anyone imagine this  amendment will result in even more Americans being insured? Does anyone  imagine it will provide better coverage for Americans with preexisting  conditions? I don't think so.   That explains why Republican colleagues in the House are rushing it  through with hardly any debate, no hearings, and no CBO score. They  don't want the American people to see this bill. The leaders of the  House were panicked that if they didn't pass the bill today, their  Members would go home for 2 weeks--they are on recess over in the  House--get beaten up by their constituents who hate this bill, and they  would back off.   Only 17 percent of Americans approved of TrumpCare. The rest of them  packed townhall meetings and public forums to demand that their House  Members reject it. They wrote and called, emailed, and contacted  Members on social media. Those were the voices of average Americans who  stopped the first TrumpCare proposal from even receiving a vote.   Now Republicans are trying to sneak through their second, even worse  version of TrumpCare without debate or any analysis of what it would  mean for our country. Maybe it raises costs on working Americans even  more. Maybe it doubles the amount of uninsured Americans. The House  won't know before voting on the bill.   I sincerely hope that if this bill passes--I pray it doesn't--the  Senate won't mimic the House and try to rush a bill through without  hearings or debate or analysis.   Mr. President, regardless of the process, TrumpCare is a  breathtakingly irresponsible piece of legislation that would endanger  the health of tens of millions of Americans and break the bank for  millions more. I don't know what my friends in the House would say to  their constituents if they vote for this bill.   What would you say to a 56-year-old in your district, who is already  struggling to balance the cost of medicine and rent and groceries, when  she has to pay more than five times as much in healthcare as someone  who is 35 and healthy?   What would you say to the mother in your district whose daughter has  cancer and who is worried that if she ever lapses in coverage, the  insurance company can raise the rates so high on her family that she  couldn't afford to get health insurance for her daughter and would have  to watch her suffer? The agony a parent would go through. What do you  say to that mother?   I don't know how any of my Republican colleagues here in the Senate  when we get this bill and now in the House can explain why they voted  to rip away people's healthcare.   If there were a Hippocratic Oath for Congress, ``Do no harm,''  TrumpCare would never come up for a vote. It harms the American people  in so many ways. It doesn't have to be this way. Republicans could drop  these efforts for repeal, drop these attempts that are undermining our  healthcare system and causing insurers to flee the marketplace, and  come work with Democrats on improving the healthcare system. Our door  is open.   So I would just make one final plea to my Republican friends in the  House. I know they rarely listen to Senate leaders, especially  Democratic ones, but this is an issue where so much is at stake that I  hope they forget party labels at the moment. I ask them to do what  representatives should do, something very simple: Think about your  [[Page S2743]]  constituents. Consult your conscience before you vote for this bill.   I believe if they truly do and consider what every independent expert  and medical association is saying about this bill and what it would  mean for our healthcare system, they will come to the right conclusion  and vote no today.   On one final issue, Mr. President, I see my friend from Florida about  to take the floor. I would like to yield to him for a moment, but  before I do, I would like to recognize his outstanding efforts in  securing additional funding in the appropriations bill for NASA.   NASA had actually been targeted for certain cuts by the Trump  administration in their budget that would nix the program to send a  mission to Europa, a Moon of Jupiter. Thanks to the advocacy of Senator  Nelson, NASA will get an overall increase of $368 million in the  appropriations bill--enough to fund that mission.   I know this issue is near and dear to Bill's heart. As a young  Congressman, he was the second sitting Member of Congress and the first  Member in the House to serve on a NASA mission, aboard the space  shuttle Columbia. He has a passion for and a deep knowledge of our  space program. There is no one in the Senate who has done more for it  than Bill Nelson. He has worked hard ever since he got to the Senate,  and he has had great success.   Once again, he has had a success here today. His constituents in  Florida and all Americans should be grateful that Bill is a real leader  on both of these issues in our caucus and in the whole Senate.   I yield to my friend, the Senator from Florida.    I announce that the Senator from Illinois (Mr. Durbin)  is necessarily absent.
