 Madam President, I call up my motion to instruct  conferees, which is at the desk.    Madam President, the United States is in a new cold war  with China, but Joe Biden doesn't seem to be up to the fight. China's  military is growing while ours is shrinking. The President's Defense  budget can't even  [[Page S2316]]  keep up with the Democrats' own rate of inflation. The President even  denies that China is waging a cold war against us.   And while we are shortchanging our own military against a dangerous  communist adversary, the Government wants to send $8 billion of your  money to a U.N. boondoggle called the Green Climate Fund.   If anyone should be paying for a Green Climate Fund, it should be the  Chinese communists, the world's worst polluters--not American  taxpayers.   My proposal is simple. Instead of giving that $8 billion to the  United Nations to waste on climate schemes and corruption, we should  send it to our troops and help rebuild our military.   The U.N. or the U.S. military? It is an easy choice. I urge my  colleagues to support the motion.
