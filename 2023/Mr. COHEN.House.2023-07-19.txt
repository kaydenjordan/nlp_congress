 Mr. Chair, firstly, I would like to go ahead and extend to  all the leadership that produced this bill my thanks: Chairman Sam  Graves, Ranking Member Larsen, and Subcommittee Chair Garret Graves,  our self-professed passenger.   This is an outstanding, bipartisan bill. It is what the American  public wants, what it needs, and we need to pass this.   If the House Committee on Transportation was a microcosm of Congress,  we would have the highest ratings Congress has ever seen. We worked  together on this bill.   As the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Aviation, I appreciate  the opportunity to work with this leadership team and the whole  committee and the staff to produce this bipartisan bill, which we hope  we can pass by the September deadline.   The legislation is vital in the continuity of the U.S. aviation  industry. It helps ensure aviation safety, infrastructure, and  workforce development programs remain top priorities at such a critical  juncture.   Our Nation is bound together by aviation, business and passenger, as  well. This legislation addresses several key priorities of mine:  improving airport infrastructure investments; enhancing aviation  safety; protecting consumers, especially those with disabilities;  addressing environmental resiliency; ensuring the safe operation and  integration of unmanned aircraft systems and advanced air mobility  aircraft; and improving the development of the U.S. aviation workforce,  especially in minority communities.                                time  1300    I am especially pleased to see several of my amendments included  herein. There is language to assist airports that faced financial  adversity due to reclassification from small to medium hubs, including  the Memphis International Airport.   There are provisions from the Safe Aviation Flight Enhancement Act  that was introduced with my friend from Tennessee (Mr. Burchett) to  address flight data recovery for aircraft used in extended overwater  operations and cockpit voice recorders.   There is language developed with Senator Blumenthal directing the FAA  to complete its rulemaking on a minimum seat size, as mandated by our  SEAT Act from the 2018 FAA reauthorization law.   There is language developed with Senator Lujan regarding aircraft  cabin temperature standards.   There are provisions from the Emergency Vacating of Aircraft Cabin  Act that was introduced with Senator Duckworth to improve Federal  evacuation standards.   The Mobility Aids on Board Improve Lives and Empower All Act that I  introduced with Representative Stauber and Senators Duckworth and Thune  would improve air travel for passengers with disabilities, notably  passengers who use wheelchairs and other mobility aids.   The Prioritizing Accountability and Accessibility for Aviation  Consumers Act that I introduced with Representative Fitzpatrick and  Senators Duckworth and Fischer is on disabilities, as well.   As you can see, I work with folks from both sides of the aisle and  both Houses. That is what we needed to do, and that is why this bill is  good and why it is going to pass.   Mr. Chair, the bill also addresses consumer concerns relating to  reimbursements when there are significant  [[Page H3712]]  delays or canceled flights, family seating, and airport infrastructure  resiliency as well as airline operational resiliency plans.   All of the above are steps in the right direction to not only protect  and accommodate passengers with equity in mind but also to ensure the  longevity of the U.S. aviation industry.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment filed by  Mr. Issa.    Mr. Chair, I oppose this amendment which would require the  FAA to make an independent assessment of each notice to air mission, or  NOTAM, request from a non-Federal entity.   Many NOTAMs are simply for general awareness, a temporary crane has  been erected in controlled airspace, or a runway at an airport with no  traffic control tower being repaved.   Some NOTAMs increase airspace awareness for pilots in the area  alerting them about drone operations or balloon flights--some of them  from China.   Some of them result in actual flight restrictions, like over sports  stadiums during NFL and MLB games or when a concert is going on.   Sometimes FAA requires an operator or an airport to file a NOTAM  prior operation in order to provide safety information for other  airspace users. These are submitted through a special controlled access  system.   NOTAMs are issued for all kinds of reasons. As we all know from the  NOTAM system outage earlier this year, there are many of them, which  can be a blessing, and it can be a curse.   For example, French Valley Airport, which is a small county-owned  public use general aviation airport in Riverside County, California,  currently has 80 active NOTAMs within a 10-mile radius. There are tens  of thousands of big, medium, and small airports and heliports all over  the country--consider the magnitude of bureaucracy this amendment  creates.   Requiring the FAA to independently verify every single NOTAM would  bring an already cumbersome system to a complete standstill.   NOTAMs keep pilots safe. This amendment would create an enormously  burdensome process to get NOTAMs issued.   Finally, this amendment will very likely conflict with  recommendations from the NOTAM working group created by the NOTAM  Improvement Act that this Congress passed 2 months ago.   Mr. Chair, I urge all Members to vote ``no,'' and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, may I inquire as to the time remaining.    Mr. Chair, I would just reiterate the fact that this will  add additional burdens to the FAA. They would have to independently  verify every single NOTAM. The FAA is already overburdened with work,  and  [[Page H3823]]  they need more and more folks there to make our civil aeronautics  system work properly.   The amendment would conflict with recommendations just passed a few  months ago by the NOTAM working group for improvement of that act, and  that was passed just 2 months ago. So I have to cite those same reasons  for opposing the amendment.   Mr. Chair, I continue to oppose the amendment, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, Mr. Issa is a worthy adversary, but it is  still 40-love.   Mr. Chair, I ask everybody to vote ``no,'' and I yield back the  balance of my time.                                time  1515     Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chair, this amendment would add animal feeding  operations and meat and food processing facilities to a growing list of  sites over which the FAA will restrict drone flights.   These restrictions that currently exist are intended to be used for  facilities where overhead drone activity would present a potential  public safety and security concern--critical infrastructures like  energy and oil facilities and State prisons.   There is no practical reason why animal agriculture facilities should  qualify for this kind of restriction, particularly when having that  restriction might endanger energy and oil facilities. These facilities  do not involve sensitive or potentially hazardous operations as energy  and oil facilities and State prisons do.   These restrictions already exist to ensure the safety of such  facilities, facility workers, and the public.   The designation is not intended to be used to inhibit First Amendment  rights, protect intellectual property, or help facilities avoid  accountability.   Allowing such exceptions is a slippery slope in restricting First  Amendment rights as the national airspace is public space.   This would delay FAA rulemaking to create these public safety  restrictions by several months or years, sacrificing public safety to  shield meat processing facilities and possibly endangering time that  could better be spent with energy and oil facilities and State prisons.   I urge Members to side with public safety, energy and oil facilities,  and  [[Page H3824]]  State prisons and vote ``no'' on this amendment.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I will close in reciting the previous argument  that this is not about protecting public safety and that First  Amendment rights would be violated.   I looked back to see my crowd here, to see how we would win this  voice vote, and it looks very daunting. I feel a little bit like Davy  Crockett at the Alamo. Nevertheless, I continue to voice my opposition,  and I ask my colleagues who are here to vote ``no.''   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to this  amendment offered by Representative Kean, not as an individual from  District 9 but as the ranking member of the Aviation Subcommittee being  given certain responsibilities for that position.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Since the beginning of the pandemic, we have seen a spike in the  number of  [[Page H3825]]  mass flight cancellations and significant delay events. Some of these  events were not completely attributable to the airlines.   The acceleration of the number of worker retirements during the  height of the pandemic affected every industry's workforce, and many of  the airlines were understandably not prepared for the massive increase  in air travel demand as the effects of the pandemic started to  dissipate.   This led to the rise in significant delays and cancellations that  have affected passengers over the last several years.   This also underscores the importance of the Department of  Transportation accurately reporting the on-time performance of flight  delays and cancellations so consumers will have a full and accurate  picture of what to expect when traveling.   Unfortunately, this amendment would restrict airline service quality  performance reporting by removing a host of critical reporting  elements.   For example, the amendment would remove airlines' requirements to  report delays due to vendor computer outages, including cybersecurity  attacks. I know I would like that to continue to be reported, and I  assume most of my colleagues would, as well.   This amendment would also remove airlines' requirements to report  delays due to crew availability related to hours flown, rest periods,  and on-duty times not caused by a carrier. This is something Federal  regulators need to understand in order to make effective policy.   Further, this amendment will move airlines' requirements to report  delays due to an unscheduled engineering or safety inspection. Again, I  want to know when this happens because this is potentially critical  information to inform an airline safety management system and can help  the FAA understand whether the safety management system is working  effectively.   The amendment would also remove the reporting of public health issues  so airlines wouldn't need to report delays due to the COVID-19 pandemic  or other pandemics in the future.   That kind of data helps both Congress and the public health officials  take measured and appropriate action to potentially help airlines in  times of financial need.   Accurate and comprehensive data is critical to helping this Congress  and the Department of Transportation make good policy and take  appropriate action.   It helps us to take informed steps to improve the passenger  experience, identify root causes for trends and delays, hold airlines  accountable for what is in their control, and target fixes elsewhere  for things outside of the airlines' control. This amendment would  significantly reduce the granularity of data collected.   While I am happy to work with Representative Kean to determine a fair  and reasonable way to report airline statistics regarding significant  delays and cancellations, I have to oppose this amendment.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I reiterate my opposition. I urge a ``no''  vote, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I oppose the amendment, which directs the  FAA to issue an interim final rule to allow restricted category  aircraft to be used to transport firefighters to and from wildfire  sites and other conforming changes.   While I support the intent of helping firefighters, this amendment is  not the way to do it. In fact, if we are talking about firefighters, a  firefighter lost his life in Memphis today fighting a fire. Several  were injured, and we hope they will recover quickly. It is a difficult  profession.   Restricted category aircraft are certified by the FAA for only very  specific types of missions. Many of them are aircraft specifically  built for military operations.   This amendment would create a shortcut for manufacturers interested  in selling aircraft. However, the aircraft are not certified to the  safety standards needed to carry passengers. This is an attempt by one  manufacturer to create a domestic market for its aircraft without going  through the FAA safety certification process. That is just not cricket.   Furthermore, interim final rules are only issued in situations where  a regulatory process or requirement is clearly and directly creating a  safety or security hazard.   There are multiple paths for this aircraft to be put to good use in  helping firefighters, and manufacturers should follow those processes.   Congress should not be writing safety loopholes for companies to sell  aircraft that potentially put our Nation's firefighters at risk. I  stand with our firefighters.   Mr. Chairman, I oppose the amendment and reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chair, let me put my colleague's mind at rest. I don't  intend to call for a roll call. I will oppose the amendment, but I do  not intend to call for a roll call.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, reform, not repeal is what we should be looking  for. Essential Air Service is a critical transportation lifeline for  many rural communities. It was put in place to guarantee small  communities maintain a minimum level of air service.   The most important State is Alaska, where the majority of surface  transportation is not passable year-round. Alaskans rely heavily on air  travel to stay connected. This would be an economic disaster for the  State. There are currently approximately 60 communities in Alaska  alone, and another 110 in the lower 48, that depend on service through  EAS.   As a friend of  Don Young, Mary Peltola, and the Alaskan people, I  ask Members to vote ``no'' and to continue EAS service to the people of  Alaska and others in rural areas that need it. I oppose the amendment.    Mr. Chair, I respectfully claim the time in opposition to  the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, this would require the FAA to submit a  report on flight records for the Secretary of Transportation for the  previous years. Obviously, as the gentlewoman indicated, it is about  Secretary Buttigieg who, I think, has done an outstanding job as our  Secretary.   This amendment provides no benefit to the FAA. They already know  where he has been going, and it would be a waste of the  administration's limited time and resources.   In fact, there is no reason to think that his flights haven't been  for reasons that benefit the United States and the Department of  Transportation.   Now, if the amendment was something about Senators leaving their  States during emergency climate events and going to Acapulco, or to  wherever it was in Mexico, I could agree to it, maybe. But that is not  what it is about.   There is no basis as to why this report should be needed. There are  many pressing issues the FAA should dedicate its attention toward in  this reauthorization, and the gentlewoman's amendment would detract  from those efforts.   To that end, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment which has  no basis in fact concerning anything Secretary Buttigieg may have done  in any way improper.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, it was Cancun I was trying to think of. So  if the amendment dealt with Cancun when Texas was having a climate  emergency, that is a different situation, and people might need to know  about that.   But Secretary Buttigieg, there is no reason to think he has done  anything wrong whatsoever, so there is no basis behind this amendment,  no fact basis. It is just conjuring up something, and that is why I  continue to oppose the amendment.   I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment because it would be a  waste of FAA time, and it is certainly something that is intended to  sully the name of our distinguished Secretary of Transportation who has  done an outstanding job.   I think the time that the airlines were closed down was because of  the modems. It didn't have anything to do with the Secretary of  Transportation, or even the FAA.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chairman, I claim time in opposition.    Mr. Chairman, I would say that this amendment which  prohibits funds from this Act being used to hire any diversity, equity,  and inclusion officials or conduct DEI training is unnecessary,  inappropriate, and failing our system.   It is interesting that it follows the amendment that would look into  and suggest that Secretary Buttigieg has done something wrong.   As our Nation works toward long-term economic recovery, it is  critical the educational and career opportunities in the aerospace  industry be available and accessible to all Americans. It doesn't say  that people who aren't the most qualified would get hired. DEI just  says people would get opportunities which they may not have had in the  past, and there might be systems in place that do not allow people who  are diverse, who need to be included, inclusive, and gives them an  opportunity and equitably get the job just because of their appearance.  It means that they don't get discriminated against.   The U.S. aerospace industry is taking initial steps to diversify its  workforce through the creation of flight training academies,  apprenticeships, and other career pathway programs, but more can be  done.   The underlying bill robustly invests in the FAA's aviation workforce  development programs to support the education and recruitment of  aviation jobs, including for communities underrepresented in the  aviation industry.   I represent the Ninth Congressional District in Tennessee, which is a  minority-majority district. A lot of minorities are not in aviation  jobs. They can perform those jobs and do great jobs, they just haven't  been given the opportunity over the years, and they need to have  opportunities to see that this is a place that they can look to to be a  pilot and to earn a good living and to have a good job. DEI programs  would help.   This amendment ties the hands of the FAA and its outgoing  educational, recruiting, and retention plans by prohibiting the hiring  of a DEI officer or conducting DEI training, regardless of whether the  FAA believes that this will result in the best possible results for the  aviation workforce.   Again, I oppose this amendment. I urge a ``no'' vote, and hope that  all Americans can have an opportunity to get good-paying jobs.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I would just continue to urge a ``no'' vote.  You don't have to be woke. You just don't have to be asleep.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.
