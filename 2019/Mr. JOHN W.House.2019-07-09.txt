 ROSE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R.  2409, the Expanding Access to Capital for Rural Job Creators Act. I  want to thank Representatives Axne and Mooney for their leadership on  this important issue as well as my colleagues, Representatives  Velazquez, Pappas, and Riggleman, for their original cosponsorship.   Small businesses are truly the heart of job growth in rural  communities. The vast majority of the 19 counties in Tennessee's Sixth  District are rural, with four being categorized as economically  distressed counties.   The workforces in these communities depend on the job opportunities  provided by entrepreneurs who build their businesses from the ground  up.   In my short time in office, I have visited small businesses in rural  communities of Tennessee's Sixth District. The men and women who run  and work for these rural small businesses are some of the hardest  working people I have ever met.   This bill is simple. It includes rural businesses in the mission of  the Office of the Advocate for Small Business Capital Formation. This  will allow rural small businesses to receive the capital formation  assistance they might need and will require the Securities and Exchange  Commission to consider any adverse effects regulations might have on  rural small businesses.                                time  1815    Rural small businesses are often overlooked by their capital  formation challenges, but their capital formation challenges deserve  the same attention as any other type of small business.
