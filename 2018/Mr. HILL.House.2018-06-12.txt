 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Dr. Sam Shultz for  his 40 years of service to Arkansas children at the Arkansas Children's  Hospital in Little Rock. As a former member of the Children's Hospital  Board of Directors, it is a special pleasure for me to recognize Dr.  Shultz for his recognition as a champion for Arkansas children.   He mentored and taught many of our pediatricians who are currently  practicing in Arkansas. Throughout his career, Dr. Shultz worked with  the Arkansas State Department of Health and the Department of  Pediatrics to hold clinics in rural areas of our State. These clinics  were primarily for children with health complications whose families  had trouble traveling to Little Rock.   He also assisted in writing various Arkansas public health  regulations, such as checking newborns for thyroid conditions and also  increasing the number of nurses in our schools.   After decades of service to our Nation's youth, Dr. Shultz retired  earlier this year. My congratulations on an incredible career, and best  wishes for his future pursuits.                   Recognizing the Service of Mr. Tom Foti     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the life of a man  who has had an indelible impact on conservation and preservation  throughout Arkansas, Mr. Tom Foti. Tom is retiring at the end of this  month, after serving as the Arkansas National Heritage Commission's  senior ecologist for over 2 decades.   Tom dedicated his life to answering the call to serve the outdoors.  From  [[Page H5027]]  publishing ``The Natural Divisions of Arkansas'' to giving numerous  educational programs for schools and the general public, he lived his  life to serve our Natural State.   In 1976, he became the director of Arkansas Ecology Center, the  organization he had volunteered for as a youth.   Tom's service to the State of Arkansas and to the environmental  conservation area will never be forgotten, and I join all Arkansans in  congratulating my friend Tom on a remarkable career and a well-deserved  retirement.              Mount Vernon-Enola High School Cybersecurity Team     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Mount Vernon- Enola High School cybersecurity team for their second place win in the  Air Force Association's National Youth Cyber Defense Competition.   I would also like to personally recognize Catherine Holland, who is  the STEM teacher, and introduced the program to the school.                                time  1215    The CyberPatriot National Youth Cyber Education Program was created  in 2009 by the Air Force Association, to motivate students toward  careers in cybersecurity. This is the first year the school has had a  team in the competition.   The team consisted of five students: Lincoln Collins, Ty Wilson,  Chandler Honeycutt, Gavin Harper, and Maddock Davis. The group was 1 of  5,584 teams that registered for the competition. The group showed  dedication to the competition by practicing in the afternoons and on  Saturdays.   I congratulate Mount Vernon-Enola High School's team and wish them  much continued success in the years to come, both in school and in  their future careers.               Recognizing the Accomplishments of Stacy McAdoo     Mr. Speaker, I rise today and recognize the accomplishments  of Stacy McAdoo, a speech communications teacher at Little Rock Central  High School.   Stacy was recently named the Little Rock School District 2018 Teacher  of the Year. In addition to teaching communications, Ms. McAdoo  coordinates the important college readiness program, designed to help  all students develop the skills they need to be successful in college.   As a result of her hard work, Stacy was also awarded the Marian G.  Lacey Educator of the Year Award, a top award within the Little Rock  School District.   Stacy McAdoo's commitment to education is one all Americans and  Arkansans can admire. I am proud to represent her and all of the  teachers of central Arkansas who are making a difference in the lives  of our young people.                            ____________________
