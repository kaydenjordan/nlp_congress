 Madam President, I come to the floor today in  solidarity with ethnic Armenians all over the world who have  experienced terrible losses in recent weeks. This is a tragic moment  for Armenians everywhere.   Words cannot describe the devastation inflicted on the region by  Azerbaijani President Aliyev with the full support of President Erdogan  of Turkey. Thousands of ethnic Armenian civilians and soldiers have  lost their lives due to Azerbaijan's aggression, with an unknown number  more injured. More than half of the population has been driven from  their longtime homes. Every day, more are forced to leave.   Every day, more are forced to leave. Azerbaijan's aggression has  created a massive humanitarian crisis that will require a significant  response, especially in light of the worsening pandemic. The  historically and religiously significant city of Shushi now sits in  Azerbaijani hands, and the security of many sacred Christian sites  falls to President Aliyev and his backer Erdogan. The world will be  watching if these holy sites are desecrated.   These are dark days, indeed, and it did not have to be this way.  American leadership could have averted much of this tragedy.  Unfortunately, after the conflict began in late September, the highest  ranking Trump administration officials decided to remain largely absent  and silent.   Certainly, other world leaders engaged. President Macron made calls  and actively tried to reduce tensions, as one would expect from one of  the leaders of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe  Minsk Group cochair country.   Unfortunately, others with less noble goals were also at the table.  President Erdogan fueled Azerbaijan's aggression, fanning the flames by  providing devastating drone technology and Syrian mercenaries.   President Putin and Foreign Minister Lavrov worked the phones from  the early days of the conflict. The result? Russia has a new foothold  in the southern Caucasus. Evidently, Russia was never fully committed  to the Minsk goals and now has what they wanted since the 1990s.   All of this happened while Donald Trump slept--yet another example of  diplomatic malpractice at the highest levels of an administration which  will, thankfully, conclude in January. President Trump's departure is  little solace for the ethnic Armenians who have been driven from their  homes and seen their livelihoods go up in flames.   So what is the region left with at the end of the day? The security  of the Armenian people, who have already suffered brutal violence at  the hands of  [[Page S7032]]  Presidents Aliyev and Erdogan, now rests with peacekeepers sent by  Vladimir Putin--a flawed agreement that does nothing about the jihadis  sent there by Turkey, who, if allowed to remain, could commit further  atrocities against Christian Armenians.   Without any commitments to the status of Artsakh, there is no  incentive for Azerbaijan to make peace with Armenia. Will we see  another case of ethnic cleansing in the future? Do we sit silent?   We now have a trio of authoritarians running the show in the southern  Caucasus. It should alarm anyone dedicated to a peaceful solution for  this long-outstanding conflict. It should alarm anyone dedicated to  democratic reform in the region. It should alarm anyone concerned about  basic human rights and respect for international law.   We in the United States should be concerned about national security  issues that would affect us in the Caucasus. So, my colleagues, we are  witnessing the return of great power politics in this critical region.  Yet the world's sole superpower is conspicuously absent. This needs to  change.   First and most urgently, the United States must lead a response to  the humanitarian needs created by this violence, particularly for the  tens of thousands of ethnic Armenians forcibly displaced from their  homes by the 6-week war.    Winter is fast approaching. The COVID-19 pandemic is raging. There is  no time to waste. Congress and the Trump administration must act  quickly to save these families. The United States must make a  substantial investment in humanitarian and development assistance,  along the lines of $100 million, to make a difference for those on the  ground. This includes funding for efforts to demine the affected area.   In April, I sent a letter cosigned by 30 other Senators calling for  the Senate to appropriate $1.5 million in fiscal year 2021 funds for  demining, robust funding for rehabilitation services in Nagorno- Karabakh, and money for an independent assessment of remaining mine  contamination to help inform future efforts.   Given the widespread use by Azerbaijan of cluster munitions, rockets,  and other such weapons in this conflict, I again urge this body to  include those provisions in the final appropriations bill.   Second, the United States must immediately--immediately--suspend the  provision of defense articles to Turkey and Azerbaijan. We cannot and  must not enable any future atrocities by either of those authoritarian  countries.   Either we had a tremendous intelligence failure or the State  Department lied when it issued the waiver to section 907 of the FREEDOM  Support Act. Either way, we should be gravely concerned about reports  that Azerbaijan has utilized U.S.-origin defense equipment in this  conflict.   The administration must fully investigate these reports and respond  appropriately to any violations of U.S. law. Indeed, Canada suspended  arms sales to Turkey in response to the conflict for this very reason,  and I applaud Prime Minister Trudeau for doing so.   The United States must do the same and work diplomatically to  encourage others to join us in common cause.   To that end, I have introduced two resolutions that will require the  State Department to report on human rights abuses by Azerbaijan and  Turkey and on the role that U.S. security assistance and arms transfers  may be playing in those abuses. I urge my colleagues to support those  resolutions.   Third, the administration must follow the law. It should not waive  section 907 of the FREEDOM Support Act, which states that Azerbaijan  should ``cease all blockades and other offensive uses of force''  against Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh as a condition to receive U.S.  assistance.   The facts tell us that the Government of Azerbaijan has done the  exact opposite. America has no business rewarding this kind of  aggressive behavior.   I call on the administration to terminate the waiver of section 907.  Congress can also address this injustice in the fiscal year 2021  appropriations bill by stripping the existing waiver authority so that  this security relationship stops. It needs to stop, once and for all.   In addition, at my request, the Government Accountability Office is  currently reviewing the impact of U.S. security assistance to  Azerbaijan, which has skyrocketed under the Trump administration. The  Pentagon alone has provided more than $120 million in equipment to the  Aliyev regime in recent years. This is simply unacceptable and must  change. The GAO review will shed light on the impact of the repeated  waivers of section 907 of the FREEDOM Support Act.   Fourth and finally, Turkey's aggression in this conflict must be  addressed. President Erdogan clearly aspires to be a modern-day Ottoman  Sultan, putting down stakes in Libya, in Syria, across the Eastern  Mediterranean, and now in the southern Caucasus.   Under Erdogan, Turkey has engaged in unbridled aggression outside of  its borders, in violation of NATO's founding principles and  international norms.   Here is what we know: This Turkey is proving to be an unreliable ally  in NATO. It is not a democracy, and it is not a responsible actor on  the world stage.   The aggression unfolding in Azerbaijan should make crystal clear what  we have long known: Erdogan is, without a doubt, trying to claim the  title of most destructive actor in the region today. Without a strong  response, he will continue these advances and aggression.   I urge the incoming Biden administration to stop him, and Congress  has a role to play as well. We must finally sanction Turkey for its  purchase of the S-400 from Russia, which is a clear violation of the  CAATSA law.   I expect that the fiscal year 2021 NDAA will take this long overdue  step and result in S-400 sanctions on Turkey.   I would also urge the incoming Biden administration to reassert  American leadership in the region. The United States must join with  Europe in solidarity against Turkey's violations of the sovereignty of  Greece and Cyprus, which destabilize the Eastern Mediterranean region.   Sanctions against those conducting illegal exploration activities on  behalf of Turkey would be a strong show of support for our European  allies, not to mention for the rule of law. Indeed, I have every  confidence that President-Elect Biden and his team will live up to  America's responsibilities on the world stage by actually engaging on  all of these issues.   And though the OSCE Minsk Group process appears to be on life  support, we can and must reinvigorate it with senior-level engagement.  We must send a clear message to Ankara, Baku, and Moscow that violence  as a means to solve the conflict will not succeed and pressure on  Armenia from its eastern and western borders will not be tolerated.   I would like to close with this. Above the road between Yerevan and  Stepanakert lies the ancient monastery of Dadivank. Father Hovhannes, a  priest at the monastery, has vowed to stay even though the area has  fallen under Azerbaijani control. His neighbors have mostly fled, on  their way to Yerevan, displaced by weeks of horrific fighting.   The courage of Father Hovhannes is hard for most of us to understand,  to even comprehend. It comes from a place of deep connection to the  land, deep connection to one's culture, and deep connection to one's  faith. The world will be watching as to what happens to Father  Hovhannes and the ancient monastery of Dadivank.   A neighbor of Father Hovhannes who also committed to stay in the area  said:         We are here to stay until the end. This is our God. It's       our church. Our cross bears a heavy weight. We are here to       carry that weight.    Throughout this war, Armenians across the region have carried that  weight under relentless assault from Azerbaijan and Turkey. The Trump  administration let them down.   The horror of recent weeks will be very difficult to undo, but we  must start the work. Yes, we must start the work. By taking the steps I  have described here tonight, we can begin a new chapter of U.S. policy  in the region and right past wrongs. And I am committed, as I have  always been, alongside the Armenian-American community in New Jersey  and across our country, to see this just work through to the end.  [[Page S7033]]    With that, I yield the floor.
