 Madam President, it is little wonder that the Senator  from Kentucky is praising the Supreme Court. More than any other Member  of the U.S. Senate, he has been instrumental in choosing the members of  this Court and has gone to lengths unseen in the history of the U.S.  Senate to reach that goal.   Remember Merrick Garland, the nominee of President Barack Obama, whom  this Senate leader, the Senator from Kentucky, refused to meet with or  even consider for his nomination for almost a year? That is right--he  kept a vacancy on the Supreme Court for more than 8 months so that he  could perhaps see his prayers answered and a Republican President be  elected.   Well, it happened. Donald Trump won. Merrick Garland had no chance to  even be considered. Barack Obama was denied the authority given to him  as President during his last year of his term, and the Senator from  Kentucky waited patiently until he could bring to the Court Justice  Gorsuch, a conservative to his liking.   That wasn't the end of his effort to make the Supreme Court what he  wanted it to be. At the end of the Trump term, there was another  vacancy on the Court with the death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and at that  point, the Senator from Kentucky decided to break the rules in the  opposite direction. It wasn't a slowdown this time in filling the  vacancy; it was an acceleration, a speedup. In that instance, they  broke most of the precedents in the Senate in terms of considering  Supreme Court nominees for Amy Coney Barrett. So President Trump was  able, thanks to the complicity of the Senator from Kentucky, to appoint  three members of the Supreme Court.   The rulings in the last several weeks are just what the Senator from  Kentucky and others have prayed for: a reversal of the rights of  American families across the board. Basically, the right to access to  reproductive freedom for women in this country was attacked in a way  that few thought would ever happen, and now we are living with the  consequences.   The Senator from Kentucky just said Democrats are trying to change  the subject. I am not changing the subject. There will be a hearing  before the Senate Judiciary Committee tomorrow on this decision by the  Supreme Court on overturning Roe v. Wade.   I want to say it is interesting that when the Senator from Kentucky  is  [[Page S3189]]  looking for moral and academic support, he turns to an unheard-of  professor from Yale to quote. He uses that professor as a source to  say: Don't worry. Just because we took away the freedom of women when  it comes to their reproductive health, we are not going to go so far as  to address any decisions on contraception, family planning, and the  like.   Well, I might recommend to the Senator from Kentucky that he read the  decision in Dobbs overturning Roe v. Wade and the concurring opinion  from Justice Clarence Thomas, which said specifically that very thing.  Now, he said, that we have done Roe v. Wade, it is time to look at  cases that address the issue of privacy, the issue of same-sex  marriage, and the issues of contraception, explicitly using those  words.   So to suggest that some Yale professor should be trusted more than  this Justice on the Court who has given us fair warning is hard to  understand.    Madam President, I move to proceed to legislative  session.    Madam President, I move to proceed to executive session  to consider Calendar No. 676.

I ask unanimous consent that the injunction of secrecy be  removed from the following treaty transmitted to the Senate on July 11,  2022, by the President of the United States:         Protocols to the North Atlantic Treaty of 1949 on the       Accession of the Republic of Finland and the Kingdom of       Sweden (Treaty Document No. 117-3).    I further ask that the treaty be considered as having been read the  first time; that it be referred, with accompanying papers, to the  Committee on Foreign Relations and ordered to be printed; and that the  President's message be printed in the Record.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session for a period of morning business, with  Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m., Tuesday,  July 12, and that following the prayer and pledge, the morning hour be  deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the  time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day and  morning business be closed; that upon conclusion of morning business,  the Senate proceed to executive session to resume consideration of the  Vazirani nomination, postcloture; further, that all postcloture time be  considered expired at 11:30 a.m.; further, that the Senate recess  following the cloture vote on the Dettelbach nomination until 2:15 p.m.  to allow for the weekly caucus meetings; and that if cloture is invoked  on the Dettelbach nomination, all postcloture time be expired at 2:30  p.m.; finally, that if any nominations are confirmed during Tuesday's  session, the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the  table and the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask that it stand adjourned under the previous  order following the remarks of Senator Portman.
