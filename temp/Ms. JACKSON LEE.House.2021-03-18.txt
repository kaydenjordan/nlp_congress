 Mr. Speaker, the FBI and the Secretary of Homeland  Security said the greatest threat to America is domestic terrorism,  White racism, white supremacy, not babies who have come here innocently  and through no fault of their own.   I rise with great enthusiasm to support H.R. 6 and to join my  colleague, Congresswoman Roybal-Allard, in her work. For two decades,  we have stood alongside each other.   The American Dream and Promise Act provides immigrant youth and  current or potential holders of temporary protected status or deferred  enforced departure the opportunity to become citizens.   This is the very same person. This person, his name is Alonso  Guillen. He was a DACA. He died coming to Houston during Hurricane  Harvey trying to save lives. Cesar Espinosa, who organized a civil  rights organization, is a DACA recipient, and the EMS person who worked  with us during Hurricane Harvey, or Liberians on deferred status, and  TPS persons.   Let me just say, support this because it is the right thing to do.  They are not terrorists. It is not amnesty.   Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the Committees on the Judiciary  and on Homeland Security, as an original cosponsor of legislation to  extend the full promise of America to Dreamers, and a representative of  a state on the southern border, I rise in strong support of H.R. 6, the  ``American Dream and Promise Act of 2019,'' and the underlying  legislation.   The American Dream and Promise Act of 2019 establishes a roadmap to  U.S. citizenship for (1) immigrant youth and (2) current or potential  holders of (a) temporary protected status (TPS) or (b) deferred  enforced departure (DED).   Ensuring a path to earned citizenship is a non-negotiable principle  for me and the sine qua non of meaningful immigration reform  legislation.   Indeed, providing a path to earned access to citizenship has been a  central feature of every comprehensive immigration reform bill I have  co-sponsored or sponsored in the Congress since 2007 when I became  Ranking Member of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration and  introduced the ``Save America Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act,  (H.R. 1525),'' which I have reintroduced in each succeeding Congress.   Like H.R. 6, Section 501 of my legislation provides a path to earned  legalization status to those undocumented immigrants who have resided  in the United States for 5 years and meet other eligibility  requirements.   Mr. Speaker, as we stand today on the precipice of passing the  American Dream and Promise Act of 2019, I am thinking of the hundreds  of thousands of young immigrants whose lives will be changed for the  better by keeping our promise to them, so they can realize their dreams  and making America better, stronger, and more prosperous.   And at this moment, I am thinking of Alonso Guillen, an heroic  DREAMER who lived in my congressional district, and who came to the  United States from Mexico as a child and died when his boat capsized  while he was rescuing survivors of the flooding caused by Hurricane  Harvey in the Houston area.   That is the type of courage, honor, and commitment to service we are  talking when we speak of DREAMERS.   Mr. Speaker, Title I of H.R. 6, the Dream Act of 2019, contains  provisions regarding relief for immigrant youth.   Title II of the bill, American Promise Act of 2019, contains  provisions related to persons eligible Temporary Protected Stats (TPS)  or Deferred Enforcement Departure; the third and final title contains  general provisions that apply to both Titles I & II).   Mr. Speaker, I support H.R. 6 because it keeps America's word to the  more than 800,000 young people we asked to come out of the shadows and  walk proudly and unashamedly as legitimate members of the American  community.   The legislation does this by providing conditional permanent resident  (CPR) status and a roadmap to lawful permanent resident (LPR) status  and, eventually, earned U.S. citizenship for immigrant youth who  entered the U.S. before age 18, have four or more years of residency,  and graduated from high school (or the equivalent).   H.R. 6 also provides an opportunity to apply for LPR status for  people who currently have or who may be eligible for TPS or DED and who  have three or more years of residency.   Mr. Speaker, individuals who are eligible for protection under the  bill have lived in the United States for much of their lives; the  average Dreamer came to the United States at the age of 8, while the  average TPS- or OED-eligible person arrived in 1997.   Without permanent protections such as those in H.R. 6, the future of  these immigrants, and their families, are at risk in the United  States--as well as the fiscal and economic contributions they make.   Passing this legislation is the right thing to do and now is the time  to do it; in fact, it is long overdue.   I am mindful also, Mr. Speaker, that in addition to helping restore  America's reputation as the most welcoming nation on earth, the  legislation the House will pass also positions America to better  compete and win in the global economy of the 21st century.   According to expert studies, including one by the Center for American  Progress, ending deferred action for childhood arrivals would result in  a loss of $460.3 billion from the national GDP over the ensuing decade  and would remove an estimated 685,000 workers from the nation's economy  and workforce at a time when more, not fewer, workers are desperately  needed.   And 10 states, including my home state of Texas, would stand to lose  more than $8 billion annually in state GDP.   Mr. Speaker, immigrants eligible for protection under H.R. 6 are part  of Texas's social fabric.   Texas is home to 386,300 immigrants who are eligible for protection  under the Dream and Promise Act, 112,000 of whom reside in Harris  County.   These individuals live with 845,300 family members and among those  family members, 178,700 are U.S.-born citizen children.   Dreamers in Texas who are eligible for protection under the bill  arrived in the United States at the average age of 8.   TPS- and DED-eligible immigrants in Texas who would be eligible for  protection under H.R. 6 have on average lived in the United States  since 1996.  [[Page H1520]]    Immigrants eligible for the Dream and Promise Act own 43,500 homes in  Texas and pay $340,500,000 in annual mortgage payments.   Eligible immigrants in Texas and their households contribute  $2,234,800,000 in federal taxes and $1,265,200,000 in state and local  taxes each year.   Annually, these households generate $10,519,000,000 in spending power  in Texas and help power the national economy.   Mr. Speaker, let me highlight some of the more important provisions  of the American Dream and Promise Act.   H.R. 6 helps young persons in the following ways:   1. Extends the length of conditional permanent resident (CPR) status  from eight to ten years to give applicants more time to fulfill  requirements;   2. Stays the removal of minors who are not yet eligible for relief  but may become eligible in the future and who temporarily unenroll from  school;   3. Permits people with CPR to obtain legal permanent resident (LPR)  status without satisfying the employment, military, or educational  tracks if their deportation would cause ``hardship'' to themselves or  immediate family members (instead of ``extreme hardship'');   4. Includes apprenticeship programs as a qualifying education to  obtain CPR status;   5. Eliminates the costly medical examination for applicants;   6. Establishes a fee ceiling of $495 for immigrant youth applying for  CPR status;   7. Clarifies that people with CPR can access professional,  commercial, and business licenses;   8. Permits people with CPR who obtain a certificate or credential  from an area career and technical education school to obtain LPR  status; and   9. Updates the criminal background bars and inadmissibility  requirements.   Additionally, H.R. 6 provides LPR status to CPR holders who (1) serve  in the uniformed services for two years; (2) complete two years at or  obtain a degree from an institution of higher education; or (3) work 75  percent of the time in CPR.   Another important feature of this legislation is that makes it easier  for states to provide in-state tuition to immigrant students and  establishes that CPR-holders are eligible for federal loans, work  study, services, and grants.   For persons with TPS or DED status, the American Dream and Promise  Act provides much needed relief.   First, H.R. 6 provides LPR status for people with TPS or DED (and  those who were eligible but did not apply) who apply within three years  from the date of enactment if they (1) had at least three years of  continuous residence (as well as residence since the date required the  last time that the person's nation of origin was designated) and (2)  were eligible for or had (a) TPS on September 25, 2016, or (b) DED on  September 28, 2016.   This protection covers nationals of 13 countries: El Salvador,  Guinea, Haiti, Honduras, Liberia, Nepal, Nicaragua, Sierra Leone,  Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen.   I believe similar protections should be extended to Guatemalan  nationals in our country, which is why I will soon reintroduce the  ``Continue American Safety Act,'' which extends TPS status to Guatemala  and I look forward to working with my colleagues to achieve this  outcome.   Second, H.R. 6 classifies people with TPS or DED as inspected and  admitted for the purposes of Immigration & Nationality Act (INA)  section 245(a), making it easier to obtain LPR status through existing  channels (e.g., a family-based petition).   Third, H.R. 6 stays the removal or deportation of an individual while  an application is pending.   Fourth, the American Dream and Promise Act establishes a fee ceiling  of $1,140 for people with TPS or DED applying for LPR status.   Fifth, the legislation provides greater transparency by requiring the  Secretary of the Homeland Security (DHS) to provide an explanation for  and report within three days of publishing notice to terminate TPS  designation for certain nationals.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 6 is exceptional legislation and a welcome  development but is not a substitute for undertaking the comprehensive  reform and modernization of the nation's immigration laws supported by  the American people.   Only Congress can do that and passage of H.R. 6 shows that this House  has the will and is up to the challenge.   Comprehensive immigration reform is desperately needed to ensure that  Lady Liberty's lamp remains the symbol of a land that welcomes  immigrants to a community of immigrants and does so in a manner that  secures our borders and protects our homeland.   Mr. Speaker, let us build on the historic legislation that is the  American Dream and Promise Act and seize the opportunity to pass  legislation that secures our borders, preserves America's character as  the most open and welcoming country in the history of the world, and  will yield hundreds of billions of dollars in economic growth.   I urge all Members to join me in voting for H.R. 6, the American  Dream and Promise Act of 2021.    Madam Speaker, as I stood on the floor of the House  for H.R. 6, this is not amnesty. I thank the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Lofgren) for her leadership, and Mr. Nadler as well.   Madam Speaker, let me explain to you that under the American Dream  and Promise Act, which immigrants are eligible for, they would have  43,500 homes and $340 million in mortgage payments.   Today, I rise in support of H.R. 1603 because this would allow  farmworkers, agricultural workers, to be able to gain legal status and  to be able to seek a certified agricultural worker status.   Dr. Ruiz, our colleague, indicated that he was raised by farmworkers.  He saw the bent hands, the bent banks, and the broken hands, and he saw  the patriotism. This is not amnesty. I will tell you what it is not. It  is not the Trump policy of caging children in cages. It is not the  Trump policy of turning young 11-year-olds back across the border to be  raped.   I hope my colleagues who are talking about abortion and talking about  rape voted for the Violence Again Women Act to really protect immigrant  women.   I rise to support this legislation because it will provide dignity,  opportunity for an enhanced economic engine, as the farmworkers take  certified status because they can do it over and over again.   Where is the bread on our table coming from?   The hardworking farmworkers who are out there every day in these  fields working to provide for the American people and the people around  the world.   We are the breadbasket of the world and, because of their work, we  are able to feed many. So I rise in enthusiastic support. I wish my  colleagues would have been as enthusiastic and as angry about caging  children as they are today about us fixing the immigration system.   Madam Speaker, I ask for support of H.R. 1603.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1603, the bipartisan  ``Farm Workforce Modernization Act,'' which will stabilize the  agricultural sector and preserve our rural heritage by ensuring that  farmers can meet their labor needs well into the future.   First, the bill establishes a program for agricultural workers in the  United States (and their spouses and minor children) to earn legal  status through continued agricultural employment.  [[Page H1553]]    Specifically, the bill creates a process for farm workers to seek  Certified Agricultural Worker status, a temporary status for those who  have worked at least 180 days in agriculture over the prior 2-year  period.   Certified Agricultural Worker status can be renewed indefinitely with  continued farm work (at least 100 days per year).   Applicants must undergo background checks and pass strict criminal  and national security bars.   Dependent status is available for spouses and minor children.   The bill does not require workers to do or apply for anything else in  order to stay and work in the United States.   But long-term workers who want to stay have the option of earning a  path to lawful permanent residence by paying a $1,000 fine and engaging  additional agricultural work, as follows:   1. Workers with 10 years of agricultural work prior to the date of  enactment must complete 4 additional years of such work.   2. Workers with less than 10 years of agricultural work prior to the  date of enactment must complete 8 additional years of such work.   The Farmworkers Movement in this country was started and led by a  great leader, Cesar Chavez who said:         We cannot seek achievement for ourselves and forget about       progress and prosperity for our community. Our ambitions must       be broad enough to include the aspirations and needs of       others, for their sakes and for our own.    The Texas Farm Workers Union (``TFWU'') was established by Antonio  Orendain and farmworker leaders of the Rio Grande Valley active with  the United Farm Workers (UFW) after a disagreement with UFW leadership  over direction of a melon strike in south McAllen, TX in 1975.   In August 1975, nearly ten years after he began organizing farm  workers for the United Farm Workers in the Rio Grande Valley of South  Texas.   Antonio Orendain worked for Cesar Chavez in the Chicago UFW national  grape and lettuce boycott office.   Farmworkers undertake some of the toughest jobs in America.   They have earned the opportunity to build their lives without the  fear of being uprooted from their families and their communities.   The bipartisan Farm Workforce Modernization Act empowers the economic  and physical well-being of immigrant families while providing much- needed labor security for our nation's farms.   The agricultural industry relies on the labor of 2.4 million  farmworkers--about half of whom are undocumented.   This bill would protect thousands of families from deportation.   This is a big step in making our immigration system more humane and  more efficient.   I know the farming and agricultural communities in the state of Texas  farm and my district borders communities that farm.   What we are doing here is the right thing and attempting to reinforce  the breadbasket that the United States happens to be to the world.   I have heard the clamoring of farm workers for a very long time but I  have also heard the need for fairness and the improvement of conditions  that they are working in with adequate compensation.   This bill regularizes people who want to be regularized and who want  to contribute to helping the agricultural industry in this great  nation.   I would like to thank my Judiciary Committee colleagues on both sides  of the aisle, and in particular, Chairman Nadler and Subcommittee  Chairwoman Lofgren, for their work in shepherding this important  legislation to the floor.   I am reminded of our tenure here on the Judiciary Committee and our  record of being fair and bipartisan on immigration reform for at least  2 decades.   I urge all members to join me in voting for H.R. 1603, the Farm  Workforce Modernization Act of 2021.    Will the gentleman yield?    Let me say that we can respect each other's  differences, and I thank the gentleman for explaining that. Amnesty is  not related to people working to earn their status, and that is what  this bill does, just as the DACA bill does. They earn their status.    Madam Speaker, I thank the distinguished chairman  for his leadership, and I thank the ranking member as well.   Madam Speaker, I stand here today to recognize the hardworking  Burmese Americans who are here, who are fighting every day for their  friends and their relatives in their native land.   On February 1, 2021, hours before the Burmese Parliament was to  convene in a new session, Aung San Suu Kyi, the leader of the Burma  ruling party; and President Win Myint, the duly-elected head of  government, were deposed in a military coup.   How shameful.   As that coup was done, violence prevailed. And as violence prevailed,  people lost their lives.                                time  1600    This is a worthy act of condemnation. I also support H. Res. 134, the  resolution condemning the coup in Burma, and condemning the still  detaining of Aung San Suu Kyi to her place of residence. She is in  danger.   So I rise today to support H.R. 1112, which declares: ``It is the  policy of the United States to instruct, as appropriate,  representatives of the United States Government to use the voice, vote,  and influence of the United  [[Page H1563]]  States at the United Nations to hold accountable those responsible for  the military coup in Burma.''   The legislation also directs that not later than 90 days after the  date of the enactment of this act that Congress gets a report from the  Secretary of State as relates to the military coup in Burma, and  provide a description of the efforts taken by the United States to help  the people of Burma restore their democratic form of government.   I want to cite a constituent in my district--first of all, the people  from Burma who have been generous in their help of Houstonians, their  fellow Houstonians, in Hurricane Harvey, in the freeze, in COVID-19-- Mr. Mouton, who has provided resources to all of the people in the area  representing the community of those from Burma. He has been generous in  his support when people have been in need. That is what people from  Burma here in the United States do.   So this statement that we are making is to say that we are standing  with the freedom fighters. We are standing with those who believe in  democracy.   And I want to salute the Parliament. The Parliament and the duly  elected members of the Burmese Parliament who have taken it upon  themselves to continue serving as representatives of the people through  alternative methods of communicating and convening is courageous and  laudable and inspires the respect of freedom-loving people everywhere.   It is our goal, as we stand on the floor of the House, for the  American peoples' voices to be heard through H.R. 1112, the Protect  Democracy in Burma Act of 2021, and H. Res. 134, the resolution  condemning the coup in Burma, and to support the American-Burmese  community.   Madam Speaker, as a senior member of the Committee on the Judiciary  and the Member of Congress for the Eighteenth Congressional District of  Texas, the home of a large and vibrant Burmese community, I rise in  strong support of H.R. 1112, the ``Protect Democracy In Burma Act of  2021,'' which condemns the military coup in Burma and calls for the  unconditional release of detained democratically-elected leaders and  civil society members and declares it the policy of the United States  to support a return to Burma's democratic transition.   Madam Speaker, on February 1, 2021, hours before Burmese Parliament  was to convene in a new session Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the leader of  Burma's ruling party, and President Win Myint, the duly elected head of  government, were deposed in a military coup on February 1, 2021.   As part of the military coup, the Burmese military declared martial  law, suspended the civilian led government, and detained newly elected  Members of Parliament in the capitol, Naypyidaw, thereby usurping the  role of the democratically elected government and parliament.   The inability of newly elected Members of Parliament to begin their  official mandate due to the Burmese military's actions directly  threatens the democratic trajectory of Burma's Parliament, and thereby  the country.   By preventing the Parliament from completing its work, the Burmese  military has rendered impossible and effectively nullified the  international collaborative relationships that have supported and  strengthened the institution, including the Burmese parliament's  partnership with HDP.   Because of the Burmese military's seizure of government through the  detention of State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi, President Win Myint,  and other government leaders, Burma is not represented by a  democratically-elected government.   Madam Speaker, H.R. 1112 declares it to be the policy of the United  States to instruct, as appropriate, representatives of the United  States Government to use the voice, vote, and influence of the United  States at the United Nations to hold accountable those responsible for  the military coup in Burma.   The legislation also directs the representatives of the United States  Government to engage with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations  (ASEAN) and ASEAN member states to promote a return to Burma's  democratic transition and democratic values throughout Southeast Asia  and support the centrality of ASEAN within the regional architecture of  the Indo-Pacific.   Finally, the legislation directs that not later than 90 days after  the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State shall  submit to the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on  Appropriations of the House of Representatives and the Committee on  Foreign Relations and the Committee on Appropriations of the Senate a  report on the military coup in Burma and a description of efforts taken  by the United States to help the people of Burma restore their  democratic form of government.   Madam Speaker, the will and determination of those duly elected  Members of the Burmese Parliament who are taking it upon themselves to  continue serving as representatives of the people through alternative  methods of communicating and convening is courageous, laudable, and  inspires the respect of freedom loving people everywhere.   That is why I strongly support H.R. 1112, the ``Protect Democracy in  Burma Act of 2021,'' and urge my colleagues to join me in voting for  its passage.    Mr. Speaker, I was in the United States Congress  when the first hate crimes legislation was written. It was written  after the heinous killing of James Byrd in Texas, where a Black man was  dragged through the streets of Texas and decapitated.   Tomorrow, the President of the United States will go to Georgia,  where eight people were killed, six of whom happen to be Asian women.  Yet a captain in the Cherokee Sheriff's Department said that the  perpetrator had a bad day.   Mr. Speaker, wrapped in racism, white supremacy, and hatred, the  Georgia law says that if you kill women, it may be a gender hatred  crime. I want a full investigation. I believe in the Constitution due  process, but this is a hate crime. People are dead, Asian women are  dead, and this perpetrator should be held accountable.   If you are in law enforcement, the best role that you have is as a  fact finder and someone who can offer sympathy that makes sense, not  that the perpetrator had a bad day and this is what he did. I am having  a bad day because we still have hatred in this country.                            ____________________
