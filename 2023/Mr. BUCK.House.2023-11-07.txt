 Mr. Speaker, on October 7, Hamas terrorists paraglided into  a music festival and began an unprovoked spree of violence. Babies were  beheaded, young girls raped, hundreds kidnapped, and many murdered in  vile ways.   To compare a modern democracy with a repressive terrorist state is  wrong, but it is also wrong for Congress to take this action at a time  when we have serious issues that we face. To take an action and take  down the words, to strike the words, to censure a fellow Member, no  matter how incorrect we believe she may be, is wrong.   We lower ourselves when we try to take action against someone else  for their words. We all go back to our districts, and thank goodness  social media hasn't caught every one of us with everything that we say  back in our districts because we would all be standing here.    This is a wrong time to do this. It is the wrong action to take.  Let's pass a resolution condemning this kind of language, condemning  anti-Semitism on college campuses and elsewhere, but it is absolutely  wrong to vote for this motion.
