 Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize Fairview Moravian Church  in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, for hosting its third annual Police  Appreciation Day last Friday. It was my privilege to attend this  inspiring and exciting event in honor of the entire Winston-Salem  police force and their families.   Fairview Moravian Church did an incredible job of bringing together  the community to celebrate the commitment and sacrifices that law  enforcement officers and their families make to protect and serve the  community. Numerous local businesses also participated in the event by  providing a wonderful meal and various door prizes.   I commend Police Chief Catrina Thompson, along with her leadership  team, for the leadership they provide the police force, and I commend  and thank, with all my heart, the Winston-Salem police force and all of  the men and women who make daily sacrifices to keep the community safe.  They are truly a dedicated group of people.   The Fifth District is fortunate to have the congregation of Fairview  Moravian Church devote its time and effort to carry out this tradition  to show the men and women of the police force the support they deserve  every day.   May God continue to bless everyone involved.                            ____________________
