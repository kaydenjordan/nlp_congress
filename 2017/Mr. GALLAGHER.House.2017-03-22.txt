 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous materials on the topic of my Special Order.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Wisconsin?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous materials on the topic of my Special Order.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Wisconsin?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I was back in Green Bay, Wisconsin, the  past week. Someone asked me: What is the biggest surprise you have  encountered since being in Congress?   I said: I will give you a negative surprise and a positive surprise.  The negative surprise was how much of our time is spent here in  Congress doing things that really, in my opinion, have nothing to do  with the hard task of legislating, running around to an endless series  of meetings that distract us from the hard work of the floor of coming  together and fixing problems.   I said: But on the positive side, I have been blown away by the  quality of talent, the commitment to service, and just the incredible  collection of experiences we have in the freshman class of the 115th  Congress--on both sides of the aisle, by the way.   I think we have a unique opportunity to seize this moment and send a  message to our citizens back home that we are ready to change politics  as usual and we are ready to work together to get things done. So today  we would like to speak about that in general and in particular about  term limits, an idea whose time has come.   In my 10 years in the Marine Corps and during two deployments to  Iraq, I saw brave young men and women from across this country working  together, doing whatever it took to accomplish the very difficult  mission.                                time  1715    I would submit that our constituents from across the country sent us  here to accomplish a very difficult mission. They sent us here not to  treat our time here as a career, but rather like a deployment, an act  with a sense of urgency to get things done. And, my gosh, do we have a  list of problems that we need to fix.   Our healthcare system in this country has failed the American people,  the Federal debt and deficit continue to balloon, taxes are driving out  businesses and jobs, and our foreign policy is in shambles right now.  These issues aren't new, yet they never seem to get fixed. Why is that?  Well, I would argue because Washington isn't working for the American  people. The people's House has become distracted and distorted from its  original intention. It is up to us--the new Members of Congress--to fix  that and restore the balance that the Founders and the Framers had in  mind--the concept of the citizen legislator--people from all walks of  life who would put aside their primary responsibility and come and  embark on a season of service and then return home when that season was  done.   Today, I am proud to be joined by my fellow freshmen Members of  Congress who are going to speak about term limits. It is my honor to  welcome a man who served his country for a career in uniform in the Air  Force. He could have enjoyed a nice retirement and had some relaxing  time, but he chose to step up and serve yet again in Congress.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. Bacon), my  distinguished colleague, the pride of Omaha, Nebraska, a general, now  Congressman.    Mr. Speaker, listening to my colleague's remarks, I  was reminded of what another general,  [[Page H2341]]  General Dwight D. Eisenhower, said: ``You know, farming looks mighty  easy when your plow is a pencil, and you're a thousand miles from the  cornfield.''   I think that sentiment was echoed by Don Bacon, which is to say  people who have actual experience dealing with hard problems are the  best type of people to legislate on those problems from Congress.   Mr. Speaker, I am honored to welcome another distinguished colleague  from Louisiana. We in Wisconsin are all honored to welcome a bunch of  LSU fans to Lambeau Field. I won't rehash how that went, but it was a  great coming together of two great sports fans. It was really a  privilege for everyone there.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Johnson),  my colleague.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Johnson. And I just want to  [[Page H2342]]  say that he and all the great citizens of the great State of Louisiana  are welcome back any time to Lambeau Field. It was an honor to have him  there.   Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to introduce a colleague from  Pennsylvania's Eighth District, who served his country in the FBI. I am  now honored to serve with him on the Homeland Security Committee, to  which he brings an incredible wealth of experience. I think he is  living proof of the necessity of embarking on term limits and  implementing them now.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.  Fitzpatrick).    Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Khanna for his  comments. He gets at a really important point, which opponents of term  limits will say: Well, we have term limits that occur naturally every 2  years. But as he pointed out, with a 94 percent incumbent reelection  rate, and a turnover rate that is less than European monarchy, it isn't  working that way, owing to the advantages of incumbency. So we need to  take action right now. I thank him for his commitment to this. This  really is a bipartisan issue.   I am now honored to yield time to my fellow Marine, the gentleman  from Michigan (Mr. Bergman), a man who also served his country in  uniform, and like General Bacon before, could have easily decided to  enjoy retirement, but felt the call to step up and serve his country  again. He brings a wealth of experience, and it is my honor to serve  with General--now Congressman--Jack Bergman. We are neighbors. We have  territory that borders each other, and so far, we have avoided any land  disputes.    I thank Congressman Bergman not only for his  leadership in the freshman class, but a lifetime of leadership and a  lifetime spent leading marines.   I ask my team here in Congress, whenever we are considering a  difficult issue, to apply what I call the lance corporal test. In other  words, how are the policies that we are debating today and how is the  legislation that we are considering going to affect that lance  corporal, that 19-year-old man or woman at the tip of the spear?   I think General Bergman has seen in his career how messy things can  get at the tip of the spear when you are far removed from air- conditioned offices in Washington, D.C.   I believe having more people not only with military experience, but  with experience from a wide range of occupations will allow us to more  thoughtfully consider how our policies here, designed in Washington,  D.C., have real impacts on the American people and, indeed, across the  world.   I now yield to the gentleman (Mr. Arrington) from Lubbock, Texas, to  talk more about this issue. It has been great to work with the pride of  Texas Tech, the pride of Lubbock, Texas.    I thank Congressman Arrington for his comments. As he  rightfully points out, the time is now for big and bold action. We have  a unique window of opportunity here that we must seize. The American  people gave us an opportunity to turn this country around, to really,  in my opinion, save the country. But that is all it is: a fleeting  opportunity. And what we do over the coming days and weeks will  determine whether we get more of that opportunity.   I thank Congressman Arrington for reminding us that this is just the  first step; that the hard work is yet to come. We have to fight for  this idea to implement it, and there is a lot of hard work ahead. I  look forward to working with him on that.   I know there is a division of opinions on this issue, and there are  some principled arguments against term limits.   I just remember talking with the man who held this seat before I did,  Congressman Reid Ribble. He had spent his entire life in roofing, which  was a nonstandard preparation for serving in Congress, but he decided  to give up his successful private sector career to come here for a  season of service and to work on behalf of the people of northeast  Wisconsin.                                time  1745    He term-limited himself. I would debate this issue with him, and we  went back and forth. Ultimately, he said something that stuck with me,  and I think it is the most powerful argument for implementing term  limits.   He said: Every day, I woke up, and I knew that I had one less day to  make a difference in the people's House. One less day. And so every  day, I woke up with a sense of urgency, wanting to fix problems and get  things done on behalf of my constituents.   I just think about that whenever I consider this debate. I just think  about, if all 535 Members of the House and the Senate woke up with that  same sense of urgency, if we all woke up every day knowing we had one  less day to make a difference, imagine what we could accomplish working  together.   So, Mr. Speaker, I thank all of my colleagues who have spoken so  eloquently on behalf of term limits, and I look forward to working with  them.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
