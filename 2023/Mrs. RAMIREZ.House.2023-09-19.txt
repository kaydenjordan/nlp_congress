 Mr. Speaker, I rise today as the proud Representative  of a congressional district in Illinois, a State committed to progress,  justice, safety, and human rights.   Yesterday, Illinois made history as the first State in the Nation to  eliminate cash bail, a standard used to punish poverty instead of  upholding justice. A standard that kept those without means, especially  Black and Brown Illinoisans, in jail for months as they awaited trial,  while letting slip those who could afford bail independent of the crime  that they were accused of.   Some may say we are reforming our criminal justice system, but we are  doing more than that. I especially thank Senator Robert Peters, who led  the effort in the Illinois General Assembly. We, unlike other States,  are creating a justice system that protects the victims, ensures equal  due process for everyone independent of their means. The Pretrial  Fairness Act is a historic win for civil rights advocates across our  Nation, and it is time Congress followed Illinois' lead toward  progress.                            ____________________
