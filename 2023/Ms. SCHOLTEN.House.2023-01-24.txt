 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to champion the American  economy and to voice my support for American workers and businesses.   I have just returned from a busy district work period back in west  Michigan, where I saw firsthand the need for a champion on economic  revitalization.   The district I represent has long been known for manufacturing and  industry. Many global companies started right in west Michigan out of  garages and storefronts, driven by their local communities and  supported by their representatives in government, but we all see  firsthand the difficult economic times that are taking their toll on  our communities and across the United States. Just last year, my  district alone lost dozens of small businesses.   This is unacceptable, and it is why I am committed to moving the  American economy forward in Congress. It is so important that we, both  Republicans and Democrats, support American industry and our economy.  It is not only the right thing to do; it is what our constituents  expect us to do.   We have so much in common here, and I believe that both parties can  come together and support American ingenuity and innovation. Let's get  to work.                            ____________________
