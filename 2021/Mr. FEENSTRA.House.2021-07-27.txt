 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 18 which  would make the Hyde amendment permanent.   This week we will consider the partisan Health and Human Services  budget. It is unfortunate that Democrats are continuing their assault  on the fundamental right to life in this bill. It kills the Hyde  amendment which ensures taxpayer dollars cannot be spent on abortions.   Hyde has saved 2.5 million babies since it was enacted. My faith  teaches me that every person is created for a purpose and a reason, and  that is why I will always be a defender of the unborn. Americans should  not be forced to fork over their taxpayer dollars so defenseless babies  can be murdered on the taxpayer dime.   Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the Committees on Energy  and Commerce, Ways and Means, and the Judiciary be discharged from  further consideration of H.R. 18, and ask for its immediate  consideration in the House.
