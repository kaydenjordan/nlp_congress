 Mr. President, yesterday morning, Democrats and  Republicans reached an important agreement to move forward on three  bipartisan--underline bipartisan--appropriations bills: MILCON-VA,  Agriculture, and Transportation-HUD.   We will begin voting on amendments as soon as this afternoon and keep  going through the rest of the week and into the next. It is my hope  that with bipartisan cooperation, we can wrap up our work on these  bipartisan appropriations bills sometime next week.   And this will be the Senate working as it should, both parties  cooperating, debating amendments, working through differences, without  grinding the legislative process to a halt. Democrats promised our  Republican colleagues that their voices would be heard, and we are  making good on that promise. Forty amendments will be considered, many  of them bipartisan, on issues ranging from telehealth funding for  veterans, fixing infrastructure hit by natural disasters, to  investments in rural America.   We worked closely with Republicans to put these appropriations bills  together. If passed, the bills will make a huge difference for American  farmers, for our infrastructure, for housing, and for our military  bases and veterans.   Bipartisanship isn't easy. On the contrary, these days it is  exceedingly difficult, but we are moving forward thanks to the good  work of our appropriators, especially Chair Murray and Vice Chair  Collins. They have set the tone from the start here in the Senate that  bipartisanship should lead the way.   It was true in the Appropriations Committee; I hope it remains true  here on the floor because we are going to need bipartisanship in all  that we do  [[Page S5156]]  during this time of divided government.   Bipartisanship will be essential for passing these appropriations  bills; bipartisanship will be essential for keeping the government open  in less than a month; and bipartisanship will be essential for passing  the President's national security request.   I would say to my colleagues in the House, my Republican colleagues,  if you try to do things not in a bipartisan way, it is going to lead to  cul-de-sacs, gridlocks, and other things that hurt the American people.   Both parties recognize we must support our allies in Israel against  Hamas. Both parties recognize that we must support our friends in  Ukraine against Putin. Both parties know that we must fight the scourge  of fentanyl coming through the border, outcompete the Chinese  Government, and support Taiwan.   So to my Republican colleagues, House and Senate, let's work together  to ensure that passing the supplemental remains bipartisan because only  things that win support from both sides will make it to the President's  desk.   I thank my colleagues on both sides who have shown that  bipartisanship is still the key to getting things done here in the  Senate. And, now, because of that bipartisanship, the appropriations  process is finally--finally--moving forward.                           Artificial Intelligence    Mr. President, on our AI Insight Forum, yesterday, the Senate held  our second bipartisan AI Insight Forum. This one was focused on our  North Star for AI, and that is innovation.   It was an amazing 3 hours. We learned so much about all the things we  need to do on AI as well as things we still don't know. The biggest  takeaway from our AI Insight Forums so far is that government has to be  involved on AI, and that was the consensus among everybody yesterday,  just as it was a few weeks ago. Democrats, Republicans, liberals,  conservatives, and everyone in between knew that government had to be  involved.   But after yesterday's conversation, I will add a few more things we  agreed to. First, as you know, at the last forum, everyone agreed that  the government had to be involved, but after today's forum, there was  universal agreement that Congress had to be prepared, not just to be  involved but to invest significant resources in AI innovation, both  inside the government and outside, helping companies and universities  and others because the government can do things in terms of dollar  investments that others simply can't. The awesome power of the Federal  Government and its ability to provide resources is way beyond the  capability of any one company, university, et cetera.   One number mentioned yesterday was about $32 billion in nondefense  Federal spending, which is what the bipartisan National Security  Commission on AI said we need in their 2021 report. It doesn't have to  happen all at once, but it is important we prioritize these investments  now and continue over time. Just about everybody in the room agreed  that $32 billion is really a floor not a ceiling, so we are going to  need--if we want to stay No. 1 in AI, if we want to get our arms around  it, if we want to make sure the good is maximized and the bad is  minimized, we are going to need significant Federal dollars.    AI is another reason that we must fully appropriate the funds  authorized in the CHIPS and Science Act, and that came up many times.  There are many things that we authorized in the CHIPS and Science Act  that haven't been appropriated. We have to do those things if we want  to stay in the lead economically and in AI.   The second point that was made was that Congress doesn't have a lot  of time to act because AI moved so fast and is growing in its  complexity. We need to be proactive, not reactive. That is one reason  we have made these AI Insight Forums a priority.   A third point that was made was our race against the Chinese  Government. China is not waiting to invest in AI, just as they didn't  wait on science and chips. With the CHIPS and Science bill, we met  them--maybe even exceeded them--by putting in some real investments. We  must do the same thing with AI or we will fall behind. And many of the  speakers noted that if China gains the lead in AI, they will become the  No. 1 economy in the world. They will set the values--authoritarian,  not democratic values--and Americans will suffer.   So this investment in AI must be done; otherwise, we will fall behind  China, something we don't want to do, and both parties agreed that is  the case.   And particularly a point made by some of my Republican colleagues, we  will fall behind on national security. If China gets ahead of us in AI  and applies that to national security and we don't do what we are  supposed to do, we will really have some problems. So that is point 3.   And point 4, just to reiterate, is that we need innovation. We need  the government to help create innovation, both on the transformational  side--creating new vistas, unlocking new cures, improving education,  strengthening national security, protecting global food supply--but  also, and this is harder, on sustainable innovation. That means to  minimize the harms that come from AI like job loss, racial and gender  bias, and economic displacement because if we don't have some  guardrails, the whole thing, the whole AI enterprise, could go off the  rails, and that would be of real detriment to this country and to our  world.   The private sector does a good job on positive transformational  innovation. They need some help. The government needs to be involved,  particularly in setting an ecosystem that works, in providing some of  the resources to smaller companies so they are not dwarfed by the  larger companies. But only the government can provide the guardrails  for sustainable innovation.   It is not reasonable to expect all companies to act on their own and  even less reasonable that they would act in concert, even if a few do.  The challenge will be a balance between placing guardrails and  preserving innovation.   It is a tough challenge, but, you know, as Theodore Roosevelt said,  we are in the arena. And if not us, who? No one will do it.   So, again, yesterday was an exciting, illuminating, eye-opening  conversation. Thank you to all the Senators who came yesterday from  both sides of the aisle. And let's note, we are still just at the  beginning. We will continue to hold bipartisan AI Insight Forums in the  weeks and months to come and encourage the relevant committees to begin  drawing up bipartisan legislation.                                   New York    Mr. President, on the Second Avenue subway, New York City is in the  midst of an infrastructure renaissance, from the Gateway Tunnel to East  Side Access to Penn Station Access. Today, I have even more great news  for New York. I am proud to announce that the Second Avenue subway will  receive $3.4 billion in Federal funding to advance to phase 2 of its  construction.   I have worked myself to the bone for years fighting for Federal  funding for the Second Avenue subway, and I want to thank my colleague  who has been along my side as we do this, and that is Congress Member  Adriano Espaillat, who represents the area in Congress, and he, too,  has been a champion for funding.   Thanks to the investments we made in our bipartisan infrastructure  law, Second Avenue subway has now received the largest capital  investment grant in the history of the program, the CIG Program. So  this is no longer abstract. Billions of dollars passed in Congress, but  now it is across the country like here in New York and in East Harlem,  in particular, it is becoming real--real in terms of jobs and real in  terms of better transportation.   The Federal funding will mean tens of thousands of good-paying jobs  in New York, and expanded services will benefit more than 300,000  riders on the Second Avenue subway every single day. That is more  people than most cities have so it is important to do.   Most importantly, the subway will now expand into East Harlem, which  has desperately needed better access to public transportation. When  work on the Second Avenue subway is complete, people in East Harlem  will have an easier time getting to work, going to the doctor's office,  getting to school, and so much more. And it is not just an easier time.  The studies show when there is transit, people get better and  [[Page S5157]]  more high-paying jobs because they can find these jobs and then get to  them easily and don't say: Well, it is such a long commute, I can't go  work there.   So thanks to President Biden, thanks to our Democratic and Republican  bipartisanship action in the Senate, which I was so proud to help lead,  New York continues to reap the benefits of our agenda: stronger  infrastructure, more manufacturing jobs, lower prescription drug costs,  and more opportunity.   I thank the administration for awarding New York this game-changing  Federal grant, and we will keep going to improve life for New Yorkers  as we are doing for all Americans.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that at 2:15  p.m., the Senate vote on the Rubio No. 1237 and Kennedy No. 1354  amendments, and that at 5:45 p.m., the Senate vote on Lankford  amendment No. 1232, with all previous provisions remaining in effect.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.
