 I object.    Mr. President, I am the one who entered the objection, and  let me say to my good friend from Vermont that I agree with him 100  percent that we should get back to what made the Senate great.   We have rules around here, and the rules are very clear that you  don't impugn another Senator. Now, you can't do that in your words and  you can't do it with writings. You can't hold up a writing that impugns  another Senator and say: Well, this is what somebody else said. I am  not saying it, but that is OK.   It is not OK. It is a violation of the rules, and we should get back  to what made this Senate great, and that is, to stay within the rules,  stay within civility, and not impugning another Senator, whether it is  through words or whether it is through writings.   I yield the floor.
