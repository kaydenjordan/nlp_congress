 Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from the Garden State of New  Jersey (Mr. Pallone), my good friend, just told you all the things that  weren't in this bill that he wished were. My distinguished chairman,  Mr. Walden, just whispered in my ear that we have put everything you  talked about in bills, subcommittee, full committee, and on the floor,  and you voted against them every time this year, every time.   Now, where I come from, you vote for what is in the bill, not what is  not in the bill. I wished we had a balanced budget amendment to the  Constitution in this bill. I wish we fully funded our military for the  rest of the year in this bill. I wish we, by an act of Congress, gave  Texas A&M the national championship in football in this bill. That is  not going to happen.   What is in this bill? We fully fund the Children's Health Insurance  Program for every State of the Union and the territories for 6 years;  never been done before. Fully fund children's health insurance for  every State and territory in the Union for 6 years, at existing levels,  and it increases each year for the next 6 years. It is fully paid for,  fully offset.   Not every Democrat, but almost every Democrat, has voted against that  already twice, and if they vote against it this evening, they will vote  against it for the third time.   I am the manager of the Republican baseball team. If you strike, if  you miss it three times, it normally means you are out. I hope that  some of my friends on the minority side will, tonight, vote with us to  fund SCHIP and to fund the government for the next month.   I am one of the Republicans who support DACA. I am on the Dream Act.  I am also on the Republican alternative. I would love to vote for DACA,  but the deadline for DACA is not until March. The SCHIP programs  expired in September. We need to pass this CR and send it to the  Senate. Vote ``yes.''   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members once again are reminded to please  address their remarks to the Chair.                                time  1715
