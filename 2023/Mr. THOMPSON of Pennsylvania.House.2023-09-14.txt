 Mr. Speaker, tomorrow, September 15, is  POW/MIA Recognition Day.   This important day is a time to remember the brave men and women who  have yet to return home. Currently, there are more than 80,000 American  servicemembers who are still missing and remain unaccounted for from  World War II, the Korean war, the Vietnam war, the Cold War, and the  Gulf wars.   Our servicemembers are the bravest among us. They answer the call to  protect and defend our country in times of war and in times of peace.   While many return home, some do not. We must uphold our promise to  our POW/MIA and never stop searching until they are returned to their  loved ones.   This is why today, Representative Connolly and I reintroduced the  Prisoners of War and Missing in Action Trade Agreement Resolution.   This resolution urges our mutually beneficial trade agreements to  include a commitment from trading partners to continue search and  recovery efforts of our Nation's missing servicemembers. It is  imperative we continue our efforts to bring home members of our armed  services.   This amendment will assist the United States in upholding the eternal  promise to our Armed Forces to always bring our men and women home.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.                            ____________________
