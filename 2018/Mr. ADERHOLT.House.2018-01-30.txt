 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to  support this Defense Appropriations bill.   It has been noted here already: a total of $659 billion for full-year  funding for the Department of Defense, including $584 billion for base  funding and $75.1 billion for overseas contingency operations. It also  fully funds a 2.4 percent pay raise and supports an increase in troop  numbers.   When you add the $4.7 billion in emergency missile defense and other  funds requested by the President in November, funding for this DOD  appropriations totals $664 billion--fully consistent with the NDAA for  FY 2018.  [[Page H723]]    The House passed nearly identical legislation last year back in July,  and then again in September.   Despite the best efforts in the House, here we are again. We are  doing this legislation again--the other body has failed--and we are  operating on the fourth continuing resolution for FY 2018. That is the  30th CR--or continuing resolution--that Congress has passed since  January of 2011.   The House passed each of the 12 appropriations bills and their  individual subcommittees and each of the 12 appropriations bills in  full committee markup, and each bill has seen the light of day on the  House floor.   The other body, Mr. Speaker, is a different story. Not one single  appropriations bill has seen the light of day on the Senate floor. No  progress has been made on any individual appropriations bills because  that body can't seem to get them on the calendar. Part of that has been  the demand of every administration nominee be discussed for a full 30  hours--something that this Congress never did under President Obama.   If going to a 51-vote process for appropriations bills is the only  way to break this logjam, then such a decision should be made. I am on  record for that idea, as are many Senators as well.   Mr. Speaker, we find ourselves in this situation once again. The real  question is: Will the other body do theirs?
