 Madam Speaker, in addition to all of the evils of the new  rules package, as you have already heard, eliminating the comparative  print requirement is the single biggest damage you can do to  transparency and accountability in this House.   The comparative print requirement was a top priority of the  bipartisan Select Committee on the Modernization of Congress, a number  one, top priority of the bipartisan committee. Every State in the  country that I know of uses comparative print. It shows you clearly  what language in the bill actually changes the law. States can do it,  but this great U.S. House of Representatives just can't seem to do it.   It is an absolutely shameful thing, and I urge Members of the House  to oppose this horrible rules package that destroys transparency and  accountability.
