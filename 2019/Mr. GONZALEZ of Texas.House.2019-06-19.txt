 Madam Chair, I rise today to offer bipartisan  solutions to a problem.   I would also like to acknowledge my friend and colleague, the  gentleman from Ohio, Congressman Stivers, for his support in this  effort.   This problem is in the backyard of every south Texan or any resident  along the border. The problem is an immigration system that is ill- equipped to process immigrants on our southern border.   I assure you, we understand the complexity and the problem with much  more compassion than anyone in this country. The only way to relieve  pressure in this pressure cooker of a system is to process these cases  more efficiently.   In 2016, we had record-breaking numbers of cases. We had 521,000  cases. The number now is 876,000 cases waiting for asylum in this  country.   I asked a simple question of the Executive Office for Immigration  Review. I asked: What will it take to get these cases processed and up  to date so that immigrants may have a hearing on their claim within the  same year? The answer was to increase the agency's ability to hear  cases, which means more judges, more benches, and more support staff.  That is what my amendment seeks to do.   The only way we can reach into these detention centers is to act  immediately. I ask for my colleagues' support.                                time  1715
