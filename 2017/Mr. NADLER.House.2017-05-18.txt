 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this legislation  which would expand the death penalty by adding a 17th aggravating  factor--killing or targeting a police officer, probation officer, or  firefighter--to the list of 16 aggravating factors already on the  books.   Mr. Speaker, I have the greatest respect for our Nation's public  servants, our police, our firefighters, the men and women of the Armed  Forces, our teachers, and our other government employees. They serve  our Nation out of a sense of duty to our country and for the honor and  privilege of helping others.   But I cannot, in good conscience, support the bill we have before us  simply because its purported goal, though certainly not its result, is  to protect our public safety officers. The legislation is unnecessary  and duplicative since there are already extensive penalties at both the  State and local level for the murder of law enforcement officers.   As we know, numerous studies have demonstrated that the death penalty  is not an effective deterrent to crime in any event. Numerous studies  have shown that what enhances the deterrent is certainty and swiftness  of punishment, not severity of punishment. Therefore, adding the death  penalty as a punishment is unlikely to prevent future violence against  our police and our firefighters.   In addition, I believe the bill is counterproductive to our goal of  improving law enforcement and community relations.   If you oppose the death penalty, as I do, because, in many cases,  there is no appropriate access to counsel, which we know; because the  death penalty has racial disparities in its application, which we know;  and because, as we have seen over the past many years, there is a  strong possibility of a wrongful conviction leading to the untenable  situation of putting an innocent person to death, and we know that this  has been done in my State and others, then you should oppose this bill  and any bill expanding application of the death penalty which will  result in innocent men and women being executed. This bill does nothing  to correct any of these issues.   If you oppose the death penalty on moral and religious grounds,  perhaps because you believe that all life is sacred and that the State  should not sanction death as a punishment, then you should oppose this  bill as well.   There is another fundamental objection to this bill. It is one thing  to impose a death penalty for murder, bad as that is, or for any crime;  it is another thing to impose a death penalty for attempted murder.  This bill imposes the death penalty for attempted murder of police,  firefighters, and probation officers.   I am not aware that we have in the law, anywhere, a death penalty for  an attempted crime; and here, we are establishing a death penalty for  an attempt, an unsuccessful attempt. The bill imposes the death penalty  on persons who ``killed or attempted to kill.''   So under this bill, if you aimed the gun, even if you did not hit the  person or injure him in any way, the death penalty would be imposed.  This is a fundamental change in the law for which we are given no  reason at all.   The law has always recognized a distinction between a terrible act  and an attempted terrible act. The attempted terrible act certainly  should be punished, but not as severely as the accomplishment of the  terrible act. Here, we are establishing a death penalty for an  unsuccessful attempt to commit the crime, and no reason is given for  this fundamental break with our legal traditions.    So, for all these reasons--this bill is unnecessary, duplicative,  ineffective, counterproductive, and where it is new, excessive--I  oppose this legislation and urge my colleagues to do the same.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the gentleman from  Louisiana (Mr. Johnson) will control the time of the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte).   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I hadn't planned to speak again, but a  gentleman on the other side was just completely incorrect in what he  said, and I have the bill here.   The bill does establish the death penalty for attempted killing, and  here is  [[Page H4336]]  the language. The bill is very short. It says:         The law is amended by inserting after paragraph 16 the       following:        Paragraph 17, killing or targeting of law enforcement       officer.        A. The defendant killed or attempted to kill, in the       circumstance described in subparagraph B, a police officer,       etc.    And B says:         The circumstance referred to in subparagraph A is that the       person was killed or targeted while he was engaged in       performance of his duties, basically.    So this implies the death penalty lists, as an additional aggravating  factor for the death penalty, someone who killed or attempted to kill a  police officer, a probation officer, a firefighter while they were  engaged in their duties--killed or attempted to kill. That is what it  means when it says killing or targeting. Targeting means attempting to  kill.   It is very clear. You cannot misread this. Maybe the drafter made a  mistake, but it is very clear. This applies the death penalty to  someone who kills or attempts to kill. It is the first instance I know  of in the entire corpus of American law where an attempted murder,  attempted killing, an attempted anything is given the death penalty.    Mr. Speaker, I must again correct the gentleman on the  other side. The underlying title 18 is the criminal code. It lists a  series of crimes and a series of penalties, and then you have a list of  aggravating factors, which make the death penalty mandatory if any of  them are present. There are 16 aggravating factors. This is number 17  and adds an aggravating factor; and when this aggravating factor is  present, the death penalty is mandatory.   Among the things this aggravating factor says, is ``attempt.'' So it  is the first death penalty--for that matter, it is the first death  penalty, mandatory or not, for an attempt, as opposed to an actual  killing. Even if it weren't mandatory, we should not have a death  penalty for an attempt. You should have a severe penalty, but a death  penalty should be reserved for actual murder and such crimes, not for  an attempt. Attempt is always punished more leniently than the actual  accomplishment of the heinous act.
