 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate and commemorate  Dr. Jose Francisco Pena Gomez on the 20th anniversary of his passing.   From his lifetime of service, Dr. Pena Gomez will, without question,  be recorded in history as a civil rights icon to the marginalized Afro- Latino community and advocate for the poor.   Dr. Pena Gomez personified his motto, ``Primero la gente,'' or ``The  People First,'' serving as Mayor of Santo Domingo, vice president of  the International Socialist Party for the Western Hemisphere, president  of the Dominican Revolutionary Party, and twice nominated for the  Presidency of the Dominican Republic.   Dr. Pena Gomez was a fierce proponent of free speech and denounced  unfair election practices in the Dominican Republic and around the  world. He was fervent in his condemnation of civil and human rights  violations in Latin America. The largest airport in Santo Domingo bears  his name and welcomes people from all over the world.   It is my pleasure and great honor to celebrate the life of Dr. Pena  Gomez with his family and those who fondly remember his model and  standard.   Primero la gente.
