 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2105.   When I travel around my district, which is rich with technology  workers, the thing that I hear repeated concern about is the increasing  need for individuals with the skill set, education, training, and  knowledge of cybersecurity matters.   With the recent events with Equifax, WannaCry, and OPM breaches, it  is clear that our cybersecurity infrastructure needs to be  strengthened.   In December 2016, the Commission on Enhancing National Cybersecurity  specifically recommended that the administration should ``develop  concrete efforts to support and strengthen the cybersecurity of small-  and medium-sized businesses.''   With small businesses accounting for most of the U.S. economy's jobs  and sales, it is imperative that we provide guidance to help them  identify, assess, manage, and reduce their cybersecurity risks. By  making these resources readily available to small businesses across the  country, this commonsense legislation will help them protect their  sensitive data and business from cyber threats so they can grow our  economy and provide more jobs instead.   I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this measure, the NIST  Small Business Cybersecurity Act, and I urge my colleagues to vote  ``yes'' on its passage.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Florida (Mr. Webster) for his  leadership on this legislation.
