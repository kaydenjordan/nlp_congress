 Mr. President, I rise today to recognize  the work of a wonderful Floridian, Miami-Dade County Commissioner  Rebeca Sosa.   Born in Camaguey, Cuba, Commissioner Sosa and her family escaped the  island following the Communist Revolution and fled to Puerto Rico,  where she grew up. She received her bachelor's degree in secondary  education from the University of Puerto Rico, before earning another  degree in elementary education from Saint Thomas University in Miami  Gardens. She has been an educator for more than 30 years and is  currently a teacher-trainer for Miami-Dade County Public Schools.   Since 2001, Commissioner Sosa has also served on the Miami-Dade  County Commission as the District Six commissioner. In 2012, she was  elected by her colleagues as chairwoman of the county commission, where  she served a 2-year term. Before her time on the county commission, she  spent 7 years serving as the mayor of the city of West Miami.   Commissioner Sosa has spent her career working to improve the lives  of Floridians living in the city of Miami, Coral Gables, West Miami,  Hialeah, and Miami Springs. Having fled Cuba, she understands the value  of freedom and has sought to create a community in Miami-Dade County  that promotes opportunity and prosperity.   In her decades of public service, Commissioner Sosa has done immense  good for the residents of Miami-Dade County.   As mayor of West Miami, she helped the city recover from a 52 percent  budget deficit and secured more than $5 million in grants for capital  improvement projects and improvements to the city's drainage and park  systems.   As a county commissioner, she supported transportation projects as  she championed Port Miami, signed a sister port agreement with the  Puerto Rico Ports Authority, and worked to increase the number of  international flights out of Miami International Airport. Commissioner  Sosa has also used her position to help improve care for Florida's  seniors by creating the Elder Affairs Advisory Board and sponsoring  legislation to form what would become the Elder Abuse Task Force.  Additionally, her work to protect Florida's environment has been  recognized by many, and her successful efforts to secure funding for  community projects and parks has improved the lives of Floridians  throughout Miami-Dade County.   What is more, as a member of the Cuban diaspora, Commissioner Sosa  has used her position to fight for democracy and human rights in Cuba  and to stand against the abuses of the illegitimate communist Cuban  regime. Last year, she led the county commission to unanimously declare  July 11, 2021, to be ``Patria y Vida/SOS Cuba Day'' in Miami-Dade  County.   And all along the way, she has sought to improve the economic  conditions of Miami, and to support small businesses owners and create  jobs for Florida families.   I want to recognize Commissioner Sosa for all of her work to support  Floridians living in Miami-Dade County and thank her for friendship and  decades of public service. Miami-Dade County and the State of Florida  are better off because of her service to the community and to the  State, and Floridians wish her the best of luck as she leaves the  county commission.                            ____________________
