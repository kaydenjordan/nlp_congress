 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to voice my strong support for  the impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden.   House Republicans have uncovered serious and credible allegations of  his conduct, a culture of corruption.   We now know this to be true:   The Biden family received more than $20 million in foreign payments  from China, Russia, Ukraine, and Romania.   That 10 percent cut for the big guy, well, yes, that was for Joe  Biden.   The Bidens created over 20-plus shell companies to conceal the money.   Joe Biden joined 20 phone calls with Hunter Biden's business  partners.   Texts invoked Biden to shake down a Chinese business partner for  cash.   Joe Biden used pseudonyms on emails.   There are at least 150 suspicious activity reports.   Joe Biden's pattern of behavior is deeply disturbing and concerning  for our national security.   Mr. Speaker, we need answers. We need those bank records. We need the  truth.
