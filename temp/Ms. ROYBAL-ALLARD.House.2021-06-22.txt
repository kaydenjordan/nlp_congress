 Mr. Speaker, I rise to support reauthorization of  my Newborn Screening Saves Lives Act. I thank Chairman Pallone for his  support and for bringing my bill to the floor.   My sincere gratitude to my newborn screening partners and colleagues,   Mike Simpson, Katherine Clark, and Jaime Herrera Beutler, and my  heartfelt appreciation to the public health groups that continue to  support my newborn screening efforts, including the March of Dimes, the  Association of Public Health Laboratories, the Muscular Dystrophy  Association, and  [[Page H2942]]  the National Organization for Rare Disorders.   Newborn screening involves a baby receiving a simple blood test to  identify life-threatening diseases before symptoms begin. Prior to the  development of these tests, children would die or suffer lifelong  disabilities.   In 2008, when my original bill passed, newborn screenings and access  to follow-up information were not consistent or available to families  in all communities. Only 10 States and the District of Columbia  required screening for a complete panel of recommended disorders, and  there was no Federal repository of information on the diseases.   Today, all 50 States and D.C. screen for at least 30 of the 35  recommended core conditions, and a national clearinghouse has the most  recent newborn screening information available to parents and  professionals.   Newborn screening is a public health success story that makes the  difference between health and disability, or even life and death, for  the approximately 12,000 babies who each year test positive for one of  these conditions, babies like Cruz, a beautiful little girl born on  February 4 this year to one of my district office deputies. Thanks to  newborn screening, in just 4 days, Cruz was diagnosed with maple syrup  urine disease, which prevents the body from breaking down certain amino  acids typically obtained from protein.   If Cruz's disease had gone undetected, the buildup of amino acids in  her body would have become toxic, leading to seizures, swelling of the  brain, coma, and, ultimately, death. Today, the management of her amino  acid levels keeps Cruz out of the hospital, protects her from critical  medical complications, and gives her family the gift of watching their  daughter grow up healthy.   This is just one of the thousands of success stories that illustrate  the critical need to pass H.R. 482 into law. This will guarantee high- quality technical assistance for State programs and public health labs,  access to the most current programs and educational materials, and it  will ensure the advisory committee continues its work of researching  and recommending new screenings for State programs, which also save our  healthcare system millions of dollars for each child identified and  treated early.   Reauthorization will also commission a National Academy of Sciences  study to make recommendations for a 21st century newborn screening  system.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the passage of H.R. 482 to  ensure all newborns like Cruz are blessed with early, comprehensive,  and consistent testing and follow-up programs for a healthy and  productive life.                                time  1430
