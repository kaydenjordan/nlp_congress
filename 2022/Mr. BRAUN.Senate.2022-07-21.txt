 Mr. President, I rise today to fix a troubling loophole in  our earmark rules. Earmarks are something I strongly oppose. I believe  they breed corruption, overspending, waste, and abuse.   There has been bipartisan concern about the earmarking process for  decades. In 2007, the process got so out of control that even  earmarking's biggest supporters decided we needed guardrails.   The Senate passed the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act. The  bill created Senate standing rule 44, which requires the authors of any  bill considered by the Chamber to do this: identify each earmark  contained in the bill and ensure that the text is publicly available at  least 48 hours prior to proceeding to the bill.   These two protections helped shine light on the earmarking process.  There was significant bipartisan support for the protections in rule  44.   In 2007, on the Senate floor, Senator Hillary Clinton said that rule  44 would help curb wasteful spending by creating greater transparency  ``in the earmark process.'' It was nearly unanimous, including the two  Senators from New Hampshire.   I want to read a portion of her comments.         I believe we can improve accountability by mandating       publication of the earmark for a minimum period of time prior       to any vote on the underlying measure, ensuring that both       other elected officials and the general public have the       opportunity to scrutinize the sponsored outlay. Taking these       common-sense steps would ensure that legislators are made to       answer for the spending they cosponsor.    A quote from Hillary Clinton. I couldn't agree more, in this case.  But the drafters of Senate rule 44 left something out. The rule does  not apply to legislation brought to the floor as an amendment from the  House.   This means that a determined majority can ignore the protections  offered under the rule simply by using a common procedural mechanism.   The bill I seek to pass today closes this loophole. Senator Durbin  commented about how important it was back then as well.   Congress should abide by the rules it created for itself. We recently  saw the consequences of this loophole. The Omnibus appropriations bill  considered in March contained nearly 5,000 earmarks, totaling nearly  $10 billion. The Senate passed the bill less than 48 hours after  receiving the text, in violation of the spirit of rule 44.   As Dr. Tom Coburn used to say in this Chamber, earmarks are a  ``gateway drug.'' We must close this unintended loophole before the  situation gets worse. In fiscal year 2010, the last year of earmarking  before the congressional ban, Congress passed 11,000 earmarks at a sum  of $32 billion. We cannot go back there.   Earmarks give Congress a personal incentive to vote for the huge  spending bills that are dragging America into bankruptcy. I talked  about it last night when I introduced my own budget to try to go the  other direction.   Return of earmarks will mean the return of earmark scandals and  earmark corruption much sooner than you think. Let's do the minimum to  prevent this.   I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on Rules and  Administration be discharged from further consideration and the Senate  now proceed to S. Res. 687; further, that the resolution be agreed to  and that the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the  table.    Mr. President, with all due respect to the Senator from  New Hampshire, Senator Shaheen, back in 2007, both New Hampshire  Senators Gregg and Sununu as well as all 98 Senators who voted back  then I think intended not only for the letter of the law but they  wanted the spirit of the law to be aligned with it.   We now have a new way, something that can come over here that  violates a standing rule of the Senate. I am guessing it will probably  be used again down the road where we have to get something, we have no  time to look at it. I think the spirit of the law would say that we  need the 48 hours and the ability to know who is on it and who isn't.   And then in the bigger picture, I would ask this question--and the  American public ought to listen, ask it themselves--is this place  getting more responsible or are we giving better value to you? Do we  budget? Do we use regular order? And most importantly, are we creating  more and more deficit and more and more debt?   We know what the answer is. I talked about it for 15 minutes  yesterday evening. We are doing everything we can to avoid the rules,  pay attention to the spirit of the law. And in what we are delivering,  it is a product I think that shows less and less responsibility out of  a body that should not be making rules that make it easier to run  deficits and go into debt. It ought to be the opposite.   And if we don't, I think future generations will hold us accountable  for the things that we seem to do best, which are the gimmicks to get  around budgeting, avoiding the rules on a technicality.   The American public deserves better.   I yield the floor.
