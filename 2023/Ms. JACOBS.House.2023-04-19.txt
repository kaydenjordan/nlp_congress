 Mr. Chair, Dr. Maya Angelou once said: ``When people show  you who they are, believe them the first time.'' Well, House  Republicans have shown us over and over again who they are, and it is  time we believe them.   They have introduced a national abortion ban. They oppose paid family  leave. They blocked the ERA. They fought against universal childcare.  Now they are using the false guise of protecting women to blatantly  discriminate against the trans community and threaten the privacy of  all women and girls.   House Republicans make trans kids' participation in sports seem  sinister and conniving, and that couldn't be further from the truth.  Trans kids are kids. They should be able to live full lives with  unlimited opportunities, including playing sports.   Despite what some of my colleagues have falsely claimed, trans girls  and women do not have an overwhelming physical advantage compared to  others. Just like all athletes, sometimes trans athletes win and  sometimes they lose, but we know this isn't about facts. This is about  discrimination and scoring political points.   To my colleagues who haven't been exposed to the LGBTQ+ community or  met someone who is trans or may not understand all of the different  terms, you still know this is wrong. You know it is wrong to isolate  and stigmatize and shame kids.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose this legislation.
