 Mr. Speaker, over the weekend, President Trump and our  British and French allies made it known that the heinous actions of  dictator Bashar al-Assad will not be tolerated.   Over the past 3 years, Assad, aided by Iran and Russia, has continued  to carry out chemical warfare against his own people. Not only is this  in direct violation of Syria's previous agreement to destroy their  chemical weapons stockpile, but it also violates every tenet of basic  human decency and violates our Geneva Conventions standards.   Through pictures and images, the world quickly saw the aftermath of  Assad's most recent attack on his own people: scores of people dead or  dying while foaming at the mouth, including women and innocent  children.   By aiding Assad's murder of his own people and then working to  prevent a response by the United Nations, Russia and Iran deserve equal  blame and scrutiny when it comes to these attacks.   Mr. Speaker, I urge the administration to follow through with the  sanctions on Russian companies that was announced by Ambassador Nikki  Haley and to continue sending a clear message that these horrific  criminal actions by the dictator, Assad, will not be tolerated.                            ____________________
