 Madam President, I agree with so much of what the Senator  from Arizona just said.   We are getting ready to go through a procedural motion that I just  want to briefly explain. Senator Paul has offered an amendment. I would  prefer that we have an up-or-down vote on this, personally. I do not  support the amendment for many of the reasons that Senator McCain just  laid out. But in order for Senator Paul--I am doing this out of respect  for his desire to have a recorded vote. I am going to move to table his  amendment, which allows him, per Senate rules, to actually get a vote.  If it were just a straight up-or-down vote, he would have to have  unanimous consent for this to occur. He cannot get that. So this is not  a hostile act. He is sitting right beside me, and he understands what I  am doing.   I am going to move to table this shortly. I do not support the  substance of this amendment. I agree that we need to take action on an  AUMF, even though the administration believes--and I agree with them-- that they have a legal basis to do what they are doing now against  ISIS, per the 2001 and 2002 AUMFs. I agree with that.   I am all for updating the AUMFs. Our committee intends to do so.  There has been a bipartisan amendment offered by committee members  wherein we hope to take up an AUMF. But doing away with the legal basis  by which we are going against ISIS today, before we have implemented  and put in place another one, to me, is not prudent. It would mean we  would immediately need to begin winding down our operations, and it is  not in our national security interests to do so.   So out of a courtesy to the Senator from Kentucky, who serves on our  committee, I move to table the Paul amendment No. 871, and I ask for  the yeas and nays.   This will allow him to have a recorded vote.   With that, I yield the floor.
