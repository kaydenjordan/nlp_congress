 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2722. Our  elections are the foundation of our democracy, but they face increasing  threats.   There is bipartisan agreement that we must do more to guard against  these threats to our most fundamental democratic process. Our elections  must allow us to truly hear the voices of every American voter.   My home State of Georgia has recently taken steps to safeguard its  voting processes from cybersecurity threats, and this bill would  provide necessary funding to support these efforts in Georgia and  across our country.   This legislation will strengthen the partnership of the Election  Assistance Commission, the Department of Homeland Security, and our  State election officials.   Together, we must modernize our election infrastructure and ensure  the security of our democracy.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this critical measure.
