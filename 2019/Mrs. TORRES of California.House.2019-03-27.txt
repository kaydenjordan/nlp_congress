 Madam Speaker, by direction of the  Committee on Rules, I call up House Resolution 252 and ask for its  immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 252         Resolved, That at any time after adoption of this       resolution the Speaker may, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule       XVIII, declare the House resolved into the Committee of the       Whole House on the state of the Union for consideration of       the bill (H.R. 7) to amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of       1938 to provide more effective remedies to victims of       discrimination in the payment of wages on the basis of sex,       and for other purposes. The first reading of the bill shall       be dispensed with. All points of order against consideration       of the bill are waived. General debate shall be confined to       the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally divided and       controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the       Committee on Education and Labor. After general debate the       bill shall be considered for amendment under the five-minute       rule. In lieu of the amendment in the nature of a substitute       recommended by the Committee on Education and Labor now       printed in the bill, it shall be in order to consider as an       original bill for the purpose of amendment under the five-      minute rule an amendment in the nature of a substitute       consisting of the text of Rules Committee Print 116-8       modified by the amendment printed in part A of the report of       the Committee on Rules accompanying this resolution. That       amendment in the nature of a substitute shall be considered       as read. All points of order against that amendment in the       nature of a substitute are waived. No amendment to that       amendment in the nature of a substitute shall be in order       except those printed in part B of the report of the Committee       on Rules. Each such amendment may be offered only in the       order printed in the report, may be offered only by a Member       designated in the report, shall be considered as read, shall       be debatable for the time specified in the report equally       divided and controlled by the proponent and an opponent,       shall not be subject to amendment, and shall not be subject       to a demand for division of the question in the House or in       the Committee of the Whole. All points of order against such       amendments are waived. At the conclusion of consideration of       the bill for amendment the Committee shall rise and report       the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been       adopted. Any Member may demand a separate vote in the House       on any amendment adopted in the Committee of the Whole to the       bill or to the amendment in the nature of a substitute made       in order as original text. The previous question shall be       considered as ordered on the bill and amendments thereto to       final passage without intervening motion except one motion to       recommit with or without instructions.        Sec. 2.  Upon adoption of this resolution it shall be in       order without intervention of any point of order to consider       in the House the resolution (H. Res. 124) expressing       opposition to banning service in the Armed Forces by openly       transgender individuals. The resolution shall be considered       as read. The previous question shall be considered as ordered       on the resolution and preamble to adoption without       intervening motion or demand for division of the question       except one hour of debate equally divided and controlled by       the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on       Armed Services.     Madam Speaker, for the purpose of debate  only, I yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Burgess), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume.  During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the  purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent  that all Members be given 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks.    Madam Speaker, on Monday the Rules  Committee met and reported a rule, House Resolution 252, providing for  consideration of two bills: H.R. 7, the Paycheck Fairness Act; and H.  Res. 124, expressing opposition to banning service in the Armed Forces  by openly transgender individuals.   The rule provides for consideration of H.R. 7 under a structured  rule. The rule provides 1 hour of debate, equally divided and  controlled by the chair and ranking member of the Committee on  Education and Labor. It self-executes a manager's amendment. It also  makes in order nine amendments.   The rule provides for consideration of H. Res. 124 under a closed  rule, and it provides 1 hour of debate, equally divided and controlled  by the chair and ranking member of the Committee on Armed Services.   Madam Speaker, 56 years ago, President John F. Kennedy signed the  Equal Pay Act. He referred to this law as a ``structure basic to  democracy''--equal pay for equal work, in essence, equality. But the  sad reality is that, over 56 years later, women are still paid less  than their male counterparts for the same work. I know, because it  happened to me.   One of my first jobs was in a male-dominated industry selling steel.  It didn't matter if I performed as well, if not better, than my male  colleagues; I was still paid less. I had to leave that job, which I  loved, because I wasn't getting my fair share. It was a shame then, and  it is a shame now.   In the sixties, women made 60 cents on the dollar. Now the average  woman makes 80 cents compared to her male counterpart--80 cents. For  women of color, the gender wage gap is even more severe:   For every dollar made by her non-Hispanic White male counterpart, an  African American woman makes 61 cents, a Native American woman makes 58  cents, and women who look like me, Latinas, make 53 cents on the dollar  for similar work. That is less than the average woman made in the  1960s.   Do I not work just as hard as my male counterparts?   Do I deserve to make 53 cents on the dollar?   Do I not have to support my household as much as a man?   Latinas lose, on the average, $28,386 every year. That amounts to  more than $1 million over her career.   What would an extra $1 million mean for the working woman or for her  children? That she never has to chose between paying for childcare or  buying groceries or not worrying about how to send her kids to college.  Maybe she could even fulfill the American Dream of purchasing a home.   Some people brush this off by arguing that women choose different or  easier jobs than men, like being a teacher or a nurse. To those people,  I ask: Who sets those salaries? When was the last time you were  underpaid to teach 40 children in a classroom setting?   Nursing assistants each suffer roughly three times--three times--the  rate of back and other injuries as construction workers. Are you going  to tell me that the nurse who spends 12 hours on her feet taking care  of those most in need doesn't deserve higher pay, or the 911 dispatcher  who is working the graveyard shift, fielding call after call after  call, coordinating an effective emergency response so that they  themselves can save lives or the first responders can save lives?   Don't tell me women's work is easier. We need equality--in practice,  not just in law.  [[Page H2841]]    H.R. 7, the Paycheck Fairness Act will make equal pay a reality. It  addresses the many complicated facets of sex-based discrimination.   Even when it is crystal clear, it is incredibly difficult to win a  lawsuit to prove that employers are discriminating on the basis of sex.  The Paycheck Fairness Act requires employers to demonstrate that wage  disparity is based on a bona fide factor other than sex, such as  education, training, or experience.   In workplaces where women are empowered to know how much they are  making compared to their male colleagues, the gender gap shrinks by 7  percent; however, some workplaces penalize employees for discussing  their salaries. The Paycheck Fairness Act would prevent retaliation  against employees for wage transparency.   Sex discrimination causes women to make 6.6 percent less than equally  qualified male counterparts on their first job. Over time, as raises  and bonuses are decided based on a women's prior salary history, this  gap is made even worse. The Paycheck Fairness Act prevents employers  from asking for a salary history.   Another factor that contributes to gender pay disparity is that women  are less likely to negotiate for a higher salary. Studies show that men  are expected to negotiate, but when women ask for more money, they are  penalized and still paid less. The Paycheck Fairness Act creates a  grant program to fund negotiation and skills training.   Currently, employees must opt in to class action lawsuits brought  under the Equal Pay Act, running contrary to Federal Rules of Civil  Procedure. This makes it more difficult for women to use the courts to  correct equal pay disparities. The Paycheck Fairness Act allows them to  opt out, removing barriers to participate in class action lawsuits and,  therefore, addressing systematic gender-based inequality.   I have offered two amendments to the Paycheck Fairness Act bill to  highlight the serious effects of the gender pay gap on women of color.   The Paycheck Fairness Act is a step in the right direction. Women who  look like me should not make 53 cents on the dollar for the same work  as our White male colleagues, and even less than the average woman made  60 years ago. It is wrong, and it is unjust. That is why it is crucial  we pass H.R. 7, the Paycheck Fairness Act.   Now, I would like to turn your attention to H. Res. 124, expressing  opposition to banning service in the Armed Forces by openly gay  transgender individuals.   For me, this issue hits close to home. I am a proud mother of an Air  Force veteran.   It wasn't a decision they made lightly. It was one made with great  personal sacrifice, and the U.S. Government made a promise to them that  they would be safe to be themselves.    Imagine how their mothers and fathers must feel knowing that our  Nation has broken a promise to their children. This doesn't make us  safer.   We should welcome every qualified person who is willing to stand up  to deploy and enlist in our Armed Forces to serve alongside people like  my son.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I would like to take this  opportunity to inform my colleague from Texas that the women in Texas  make $0.72 to their male counterparts. I think Texas women deserve to  have equal pay.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Rhode Island  (Mr. Cicilline).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Trahan).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Frankel).    Madam Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman  from Florida an additional 30 seconds.    Madam Speaker, having more women enter the  workforce does not mean that women are earning equal pay for equal  work.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman from New  York (Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney).    Madam Speaker, I have no additional  speakers, and I reserve the balance of my time to close.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance  of my time.   The smart and innovative women of Arizona's Eighth Congressional  District deserve to have a voice in this debate, and I am going to give  it to them.   They earn 80 cents to every dollar that their male counterpart earns.  They deserve to have fair wages for the equal work that they are  performing.   Before I begin my closing statement, I would like to take a moment to  honor a valuable member of my staff: Justin Vogt.   Justin has been my legislative director for 2 years. During that  time, he has been a phenomenal member of my team, designing innovative  legislative initiatives, providing wise counsel, and serving as a  generous mentor to my junior staff.   Now he will move on to be an excellent staff director for the  Economic Opportunity Subcommittee of the Veterans' Affairs Committee.  We are sad to see our waffle maker, Justin, leave our office, but we  are so proud of all that he has accomplished.   Madam Speaker, 60 years from now, I hope that we have moved forward  as a Nation. I hope that our daughters and granddaughters grow up in an  America that recognizes their value through the quality of their work  and not their gender. Imagine that.   The Paycheck Fairness Act gets us closer to securing a future for  them.   A recent McKinsey study found that, if women's full potential in the  labor market was reached, $4.3 trillion would be added to the labor  market in 2025. Our economy would benefit from that woman power.   There has been enough talk about lawyer fees. Women attorneys deserve  equal pay for equal work, too. This argument is nothing more than an  attempt to avoid talking about the pervasiveness of wage discrimination  in this country.   The policies in the Paycheck Fairness Act work. Just look at  California. In 2017, Californian women made a median of 89 cents to  every dollar made by their male counterparts.   In just a few years, we decreased gender pay disparity by more than  any other State.   I have heard it said that addressing wage equity is bad for moms.  What is bad about getting fair pay? Equal pay for equal work.   Mothers make 71 cents for every dollar earned by fathers in similar  jobs. If we paid women fairly, maybe they would get a chance to spend  more time with their kids.   If my colleagues care about moms spending time with their kids, let's  pass National Paid Family Leave Act standards. Let's create better  working conditions for pregnant women. Let's fund programs for  affordable childcare.   This is just the beginning. The cost for American women, their  families, and our economy is much too high to wait any longer.   Madam Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the rule and a ``yes'' vote  on the previous question.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Burgess is as follows:         At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 3. Notwithstanding any other provision of this       resolution, the amendment printed in section 4 shall be in       order as though printed as the last amendment in part B of       the report of the Committee on Rules accompanying this       resolution if offered by Representative Lesko of Arizona or a       designee. That amendment shall be debatable for 10 minutes       equally divided and controlled by the proponent and an       opponent.        Sec. 4. The amendment referred to in section 3 is as       follows: after section 3 insert the following:       SEC. 3A. FLEXIBILITY FOR WORKING PARENTS.         Section 6(d) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29       U.S.C. 206(d)) is amended--        (1) by redesignating paragraphs (2) through (4) as       paragraphs (3) through (5), respectively; and        (2) by inserting after paragraph (1) the following:        ``(2) Notwithstanding the other provisions of this       subsection, an employee and an employer may voluntarily       negotiate compensation and benefits to provide flexibility to       best meet the needs of such employee and employer, consistent       with other provisions of this Act.''     Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of  my time, and I move the previous question on the resolution.    Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the  desk.    Madam Chair, I rise today to offer an  amendment to H.R. 7, the Paycheck Fairness Act, and I strongly support  H.R. 7 and any effort to address the gender wage gap in this country.   A terrible disparity exists in our country. Women on average make 80  cents to every dollar made by their White male counterpart. What is  worse is that it is not getting any better.   Last year, the gender wage gap actually grew for women of color. For  every dollar made by their non-Hispanic White male counterpart, an  African American woman makes 61 cents, a Native American woman makes 58  cents, and women who look like me, Latinas, make 53 cents on the dollar  for similar work. That is less than the average woman in the 1960s.   Do I not work just as hard as my male counterparts? Do I deserve to  make 53 cents on the dollar? And do I not have to support my family  just as much as any man?   Because of the gender pay gap, Latinas lose an average of $28,386.  That amounts to more than $1 million over her career.   To earn the same amount as her White non-Hispanic male colleagues, a  Black woman must work until she is 86 years old. You cannot get those  hours back, those years back, or those decades back.   The gender wage gap contributes to a wealth of disparity that makes  it harder for people of color to get ahead.   In 2013, the median White household had about $134,000 in total  wealth. For the median Black household, it is $11,000. That is a 13-to- 1 ratio.   Addressing the gender wage gap is the first step to addressing larger  issues of pay parity among historically underserved groups.   My first amendment changes the findings section of the Paycheck  Fairness Act to recognize the devastating impacts the wage gap has on  women of color. We must acknowledge that the wage gap is not color  blind. By failing to recognize the specific effect the wage gap has on  women and girls of color, these impacts might go unnoticed.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I am prepared to close.   Madam Chair, my amendment shines a light on the plight of women and  girls of color and sets the tone to take their struggle into account  throughout the rest of the bill.   My colleagues on the other side of the aisle might have never heard  about retaliation, about blacklisting. When women have the courage to  come forward and report these wage thefts and abuses, they are treated  differently under current law. That is why this bill is important. That  is why this amendment is important.   Madam Chair, I would like to thank the gentlewoman from Connecticut  (Ms. DeLauro) for introducing this bill, for her dedication to fair  pay.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to support my amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the  desk.    Madam Chair, I rise today to offer a  second amendment to H.R. 7, the Paycheck Fairness Act.   This amendment ensures that women and girls of color are included in  the research, education, and outreach done by the Secretary of Labor.   The sad truth is that women, especially women of color, are still  paid less than their male counterparts for the same type of work. I  know this because it happened to me.   One of my very first jobs was in a male-dominated industry, selling  steel. It didn't matter that I performed as well, if not better, than  my male colleagues. It didn't matter that I sold steel in three  languages while they sold in just one. I would do my own data entry to  get the job done, while they relied on an assistant. And when I needed  to rush a shipment, I was not afraid to walk into the warehouse, pick  the material, pack it, and send it to my customer. I was still paid  less.   I had to leave that job that I loved because I wasn't getting my fair  share. It was a shame then and it is a shame today.   On average, Latinas still get paid 53 cents to every dollar made by  their White male colleagues for the same type of work.   Today, we can act to change this. By passing the Paycheck Fairness  Act with my amendment, maybe young Latinas and other women of color  will not have to suffer and share my experience.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, my amendment will expand the  Paycheck Fairness Act to ensure the Secretary of Labor is paying  attention to specific issues and researching the wage gap; educating  employers, the media, and labor organizations on these findings,  specifically highlighting the impact on underrepresented groups;  ensuring minorities are included in informational and educational  outreach programs; and celebrating the accomplishments of employers who  are leading the way to specifically address the gender gap issue for  women of color.   By paying specific attention to women of color in their research,  maybe, one day, we can fill that gap to recognize that diversity of  perspective can be an asset.   I wonder how different my experience would have been if the Paycheck  Fairness Act would have been in place at the time. Would I still have  become a homeowner? Maybe. Would I still have been a successful mother  of three sons? Maybe. Would I have been able to afford to pay for  childcare? Maybe. These are the things that women in business and the  workforce are having to deal with every single day.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
