 Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 3128, and I  ask that it be reported by number.    Mr. President, Americans making over $100,000 a year  claimed nearly 80 percent of electric vehicle tax credits in 2016.   According to the National Resource Defense Council, a leftwing  environmental advocacy group, EVs cost $19,000 more than gas-powered  vehicles.   My colleagues on the other side of the aisle like to say wealthy  Americans should pay their fair share in taxes. Yet they want to expand  the tax credit to disproportionately benefit even more people with six- figure salaries.   Everyday Americans are living paycheck to paycheck because of the  sharp rise in costs due to inflation, but my colleagues on the other  side want to subsidize luxury vehicles only the rich can afford using  money from hard-working taxpayers, and my amendment would put a stop to  that.   It simply prohibits individuals from claiming the tax credit if they  make over $100,000 a year or if the car they are buying costs over  $40,000. There is nothing wrong with the well-off buying fancy cars. I  just don't think America's hard-earned taxpayer dollars should help to  pay for it.   While I question why we are subsidizing this industry at all, the  least we can do is to show bipartisan support for denying taxpayer  subsidies for the rich.    Mr. President, we have a pickup truck.                          Vote on Amendment No. 3128     I ask for the yeas and nays.
