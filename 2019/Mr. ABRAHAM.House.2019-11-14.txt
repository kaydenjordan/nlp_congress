 Mr. Speaker, the people of Louisiana lost a great man  when former University of Louisiana at Monroe President Dwight Vines  passed away at the age of 88.   Dr. Vines was born in Jackson Parish in 1931. After earning his  doctorate degree in business administration, he became a professor at  Northeast Louisiana University, which would later become ULM.   Under his leadership as president, from 1976 to 1991, ULM developed  40 new degree programs and built a school of nursing, an aquatic  center, and a sports stadium, and it expanded its library.   In addition to his time at ULM, Dr. Vines served as economic  development officer for the city of Monroe and district director for  former Fifth District Congressman Dr. John Cooksey.   Please join me in honoring a great Louisianan, Dr. Dwight Vines.                            ____________________
