 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Neal for his  outstanding leadership.   Wow. Can you feel the love in this room today? Can't you? I will tell  you, I got to hand it to you, the ``vote no and take the dough'' crowd  is pretty good. Everybody votes against the bill but then gets a  newsletter out and takes credit for all the good work that is in the  bill. No one voted for the American Rescue Plan, and yet, you took  credit for that and sent letters out to people about their checks. But  that is to be understood.   Mr. Speaker, what this bill does is to make sure that working  families, on average, will get $430 back in their pockets each month;  save more than $14,000 a year in childcare; and universal pre-K will  save families about $8,600 a year as well. Seniors will now have lower  prescription drug prices, an estimated savings of $900 a year; and  families in Connecticut will no longer be double-taxed on State and  local taxes.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Rosa DeLauro and Rich Neal for their hard work.
