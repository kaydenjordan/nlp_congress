 Mr. President, this month, I am proud to recognize  Gerard ``Jerry'' Lachance of Sandown, NH, as our Granite Stater of the  Month in honor of his incredible dedication to supporting our veterans.   At 70 years old, Jerry is currently on a more than 2,000-mile journey  by bike from Florida to the northernmost tip of New Hampshire to raise  funds for Project Hero, a nonprofit that builds adaptive bikes and  helps support veterans and first responders impacted by injury and  posttraumatic stress disorder.   Jerry, an avid cyclist for 12 years, a volunteer firefighter of more  than 20 years for the Sandown Fire Rescue, and a Vietnam veteran,  wanted to find a way to give back and support the brave servicemembers  he considers to be his heroes. During one of Project Hero's honor  rides, Jerry met a veteran who lost his leg during his service. The  veteran was using an adaptive bike that he received from Project Hero,  which inspired Jerry to do more to help the organization.   In 2016, Jerry biked from the New Hampshire-Canadian border to Key  West, FL, with the goal of raising $5,000, but his community was so  inspired by Jerry's ride that he ended up raising $25,000 for Project  Hero.   This year, over the course of his 40-day ride, Jerry hopes to raise  another $25,000 to support our veterans.   We owe our brave veterans and servicemembers a debt of gratitude that  we can never truly repay, but we must try. Efforts like Jerry's are an  example for all of us of the dedication and support we can give to  those who have sacrificed bravely for our country.   Jerry Lachance has proven to be a shining example of how we can  support our veterans, and he embodies the values and all-hands-on-deck  spirit of the Granite State. I thank Jerry for both his own military  service and his commitment to our veterans, and I am honored to  recognize him as our Granite Stater of the Month.                            ____________________
