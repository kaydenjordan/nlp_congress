 Madam President, I want to compliment my friend, the  Senator from Ohio, for his comments. I know my friend, the Senator from  Washington, is going to make comments after this, so I will try to make  mine as brief as possible.   I apologize. I joined the majority of Senators who are a little bit  raspy today after our late night last night.   I rise in opposition to the nomination of Steven Mnuchin to serve as  our Nation's next Secretary of the Treasury.   As the President's principal economic adviser, the Treasury Secretary  holds a special significance in our system of government. The Treasury  Department must ensure America's debts are paid, secure our role as a  global economic power, and develop policies that help build an economy  that works for all Americans.   Based on Mr. Mnuchin's record, my meeting with him, along with his  answers during the Senate Finance hearing and followup questions, I am  unable to support his nomination to serve as Treasury Secretary.   I want to take time today to discuss some specific policy issues that  Mr. Mnuchin and I disagree with and some of the areas where I hope that  if he is confirmed, we might be able to find common ground.   On financial reform and protecting the economy from too big to fail,  Mr. Mnuchin's comments, coupled with comments and announcements from  others in the administration, are deeply concerning.   Mr. Mnuchin's statements of ``concern'' about title II of Dodd-Frank,  in particular, revealed to my mind, at least, a disturbing lack of  understanding about how the financial system has evolved since the 2008  crash.   We should never forget that Lehman Brothers' collapse caused enough  uncertainty across the financial system to trigger a run on nearly  every other bank. The Lehman collapse also was part of the requirements  that required that $700 billion much fabled taxpayer bailout.   The resulting financial chaos destroyed millions of jobs, devastated  home values, and froze lending to consumers and small businesses. The  truth is, many Americans are still trying to dig their way out of that  financial crisis.   To ensure that taxpayers didn't end up on the hook again for another  bailout, Congress passed Dodd-Frank that required banks to put in  additional financial capital to make sure there were living wills so  these large, significant financial institutions actually had ways that  they could resolve themselves and, in a sense, get ready for  bankruptcy. But we also said, in the event that bankruptcy was not  adequate, there would be, as a cause of last resort, the ability using  the FDIC to unwind these large institutions.   Well, we are years later and what we have seen is that other  countries around the globe had basically modeled their systems after  what we created in terms of title I and II in Dodd-Frank.   Since 2010, our regulators have worked diligently with the Bank of  England and other foreign counterparts to ensure a global megabank can  be resolved without using taxpayer dollars.   I would further note that even the National Bankruptcy Conference,  which is composed of bankruptcy judges, lawyers, and academics, believe  ``orderly liquidation authority under Title II should continue to be  available, even if the bankruptcy code is amended.''  [[Page S1087]]    Unfortunately, Mr. Mnuchin and other members of the administration  have expressed great concern with title II, and that causes me concern  in terms of his nomination.   In tax reform, the Secretary of the Treasury has also historically  played an important role. I have long argued that our Tax Code is  broken. It is simply not working for enough Americans and American  businesses.   I would welcome efforts to smartly--and on a bipartisan basis--work  to reform the Tax Code, but I am concerned about how a tax reform  process under this administration might play out.   First, Mr. Mnuchin has repeatedly said there should be no absolute  tax cut for the upper class. I found that good. Some have even started  to call this the ``Mnuchin rule.''   As the nominee, though, he has failed to commit to following his own  rule or to provide any specific answer on how he would reduce the tax  burden on middle class and working families. In fact, President Trump  campaigned on a plan that based upon independent budget analysis, would  add close to $5 trillion to our national debt and that would, in the  same amount, slash taxes for corporations and those at the top of the  income scale. Yet this same plan and any effort to be revenue-neutral  would end up then raising taxes on middle-class families.   The truth is, again, an independent analysis of President Trump's  plan shows that while middle-class earners might see a smaller increase  in their aftertax income, the increase and the benefits to the upper 1  percent would be where most of the benefits went to. That is before we  even get to issues like the President's plan to repeal the Affordable  Care Act and the implications that has for middle-class Americans.   Because of this and because of his unwillingness to explain how we  would pay for this tax reform and the notion that somehow through  dynamic scoring this would all, in effect, self-correct leaves me with  great concerns. I would simply point out to my colleagues that when Mr.  Camp proposed a tax reform plan that I didn't agree with--but it at  least had some basis in financial reality--there were eight separate  dynamic scoring plans put together; in effect, magic dust that could  somehow resolve even big tax cuts that would suddenly, somehow  mysteriously pay for themselves.   We saw the effects of that kind of action with the Bush tax cuts  early in 2003. We have seen this well in terms of actions that have led  our country to $20 trillion in debt.   So I believe that Mr. Mnuchin's failure to come through with a truly  revenue-neutral or legitimate plan that would not misuse dynamic  scoring raises enormous concern as well.   Finally, I am concerned that Mr. Mnuchin lacks an understanding of  the critical role the Treasury Department plays in both crafting and  implementing economic standards.   It was useful to hear that Mr. Mnuchin committed to 100 percent  sanctions during his nomination. I am not sure, with some of the  actions of the administration since then, if we can actually hold him  to those commitments.   Treasury obviously has a role that is much more important than just  enforcement. Treasury's role vis-a-vis Iran, Treasury's role vis-a-vis  the Russian sanctions are extraordinarily important in his  unwillingness, particularly around Russia, to make a firm commitment.  Again, this raises a clear concern for me, and this is a concern that  is shared by both Democratic and Republican Members of the Senate who  feel that we need to keep the pressure on Mr. Putin's behavior not only  in the Middle East but in Ukraine and, candidly, Russia's unprecedented  involvement and interference in our own election.   Again, the Treasury Secretary plays an important and critical role.   There are areas--let me make clear though--where, if Mr. Mnuchin is  confirmed, I hope to work with him, and that one area in particular is  housing finance.   I believe very strongly--and having worked with many Members on the  other side--that we need to reform our housing finance system so we  don't have, in the case of Fannie and Freddie, instances where when  times are going good, there is private sector gain, but when crisis  happens, the taxpayer pays the bill.   We saw this take place back in 2008, where the American taxpayers  literally had to put up $188 billion of taxpayer money to bail out  Fannie and Freddie.   It is true, many years later, most of those funds have been repaid,  but as somebody who spent longer as a venture capitalist than I have as  a Senator, I can assure you, the taxpayer did not get fair return on  those funds that were taken out in the midst of the crisis.   Now we see certain hedge funds were trying to take advantage of this  arbitrage, buy in to Freddie and Fannie, and then hope that  policymakers will turn a blind eye and simply return to the old style  of doing business, where as long as things are going well, hedge funds  and others will do well by owning Fannie and Freddie, but if the stuff  hits the fan again, taxpayers will be caught holding the bill.   I was happy to hear--and I was pleased to hear that Mr. Mnuchin went  on record during the Finance hearing, opposing the so-called recap and  release plan and was supporting a bipartisan solution to reform these  entities.   Again, if Mr. Mnuchin is confirmed, I look forward to working with  him in this area.   Finally, there is an area that I think most of us on both sides of  the aisle realize that we can't play Russian roulette with and that is  dealing with our debt ceiling. Here again was an area where I would  actually give Mr. Mnuchin some credit because he acknowledged that the  notion that some have put forward that if America would prioritize to  pay one bill and not another is both financially unsound and  practically impossible. On that item, I want to give Mr. Mnuchin his  due.   On balance, because of some of the comments that Mr. Mnuchin has made  around tax reform, around sanctions, around the issues related to  making sure we have a vigorous and independent Treasury, I don't  believe he brings the characteristics and qualities needed to be a  Treasury Secretary. So I will not be able to support his nomination,  and I will urge my colleagues in joining me to oppose him when his vote  comes up on Monday.   With that, I yield the floor.    Madam President, in honor of African-American History  Month and in support of efforts to promote education and training in  21st century careers involving science, technology, engineering, and  mathematics, I want to bring the attention of this body to the stories  of three remarkable African-American women. Katherine Johnson, Dorothy  Vaughan, and Mary Jackson broke through barriers of gender and race as  trailblazers at NASA's Langley Research Center in Hampton, VA, more  than a half century ago. Together with my colleagues Senator Tim Kaine  and Congressman Bobby Scott, we honor these women.   Before John Glenn orbited Earth or Alan Shepherd walked on the Moon,  several hundred female mathematicians used pencil and paper, slide  rules, and adding machines to perform the complex equations which  launched America's journey into space. Among these ``human computers,''  as they were known, were Katherine Johnson, Dorothy Vaughan, and Mary  Jackson--three women who have become symbols for many other women, many  of them women of color, who worked at NASA Langley's West Area  Computing Group complex and helped America dominate space and  aeronautics research.   Virginia author Margot Lee Shetterly grew up surrounded by this  little-known history, much of it relayed by her father, who also was an  internationally recognized scientist with NASA's Langley Research  Center. And Shetterly masterfully tells the story in her book ``Hidden  Figures'', which currently is an Academy Award nominated motion picture  of the same name.    Thanks to Margot Lee Shetterly's book and the popularity  of the film, these hidden figures are hidden no longer. And the stories  of Katherine Johnson, Dorothy Vaughan, and Mary Jackson reflect  America's story: the powerful combination of individual drive and  accomplishment and the certain knowledge that America is at its very  best when we are inclusive and welcome everyone's contributions of  capability and talent.   The stories of Katherine Johnson, Dorothy Vaughan, and Mary Jackson  also provide compelling testimony to support our bipartisan efforts to  promote education and training in the STEM disciplines: science,  technology, engineering, and mathematics. Those are the disciplines  which will continue to provide the opportunities of the future, and  these are the disciplines where we must do a much better job of  recruiting and retaining young women, especially girls of Color.   It is an honor to place in the record of this body the stories of  these exceptionally talented individuals. They were among the brightest  minds of their generation, and their intellect and their collective  body of work helped change America's future.                            ____________________
