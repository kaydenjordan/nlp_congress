 Mr. President, today I stand to recognize the 150th  anniversary of Missouri University of Science and Technology. Part of  the University of Missouri System, Missouri S&T was founded in 1870 in  Rolla, MO, as one of the first technological institutions west of the  Mississippi and continues to be one of the top technological research  institutions in the nation.   Originally established as the University of Missouri School of Mines  and Metallurgy, Missouri S&T has grown from its original mining focus  to offer 99 degree programs, while maintaining its leadership in  engineering and the sciences. In fact, Missouri S&T is consistently  ranked as one of the top engineering schools in the nation.   Missouri S&T was chartered on February 24, 1870, and classes were  first called to order on November 6, 1871. Since that time, more than  60,000 men and women have gone on to carry their status as ``miners''  into successful endeavors all over the world. Missouri S&T alumni  consistently achieve some of the highest average starting salaries in  the Midwest, and the university is ranked sixth in the Nation for  annual return on investment.   The campus boasts a Center for Infrastructure Engineering Systems, a  Materials Research Center, a Center for Biomedical Research, and  several other centers generating world-class discoveries. Faculty,  staff, and students produce research on everything from bioactive glass  and bioactive ceramic scaffolds for regenerating bone to advancing  treatments for traumatic brain injury. Partnerships with hospitals, the  U.S. Army, and local businesses that are industry leaders have  strengthened and grown already successful programs and put Missouri S&T  at the forefront of solving difficult problems.   The commitment of Missouri University of Science and Technology to  educate young men and women and push for solutions to some of our most  difficult problems is to be commended. I extend my sincere thanks for  everything the faculty, staff, and administrators have accomplished  over the last 150 years. Congratulations to Chancellor Mohammad  Dehghani and all Missouri S&T faculty, staff, students, and alumni on  this important occasion.                            ____________________
