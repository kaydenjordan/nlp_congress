 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding me time.   Mr. Speaker, I have been listening to my colleagues from the other  side of the aisle talk about the 1 percent, the people at the top of  America.   Let me tell you who benefits from the status quo of our Tax Code. It  is the 1 percent. They can afford the lawyers, the accountants, and the  lobbyists to get them all these special tax treatments that the rest of  us don't get. If you want to do something about the 1 percent, fix the  current Tax Code.   Instead, what our friends on the other side of the aisle keep doing  is defending the present Tax Code, because if you don't pass this bill,  we have the present Tax Code. We have the status quo, and the rest of  us don't see the benefits from the present Tax Code. The rest of us  need a break.   Now, I asked the chair of the House Ways and Means Committee, when he  was before the Rules Committee the other night, three questions that I  think are relevant to everybody in America.   The first thing I asked him was: Will the average individual taxpayer  in my district get a tax cut? He said: Absolutely. And he pulled out a  sheet of paper. He said: In fact, in your district, Congressman, the  average family of four is going to get a tax break of over $2,100 a  year.   I know in some places in America, $2,100 a year extra in people's  pockets doesn't sound like a lot of money, but in south Alabama, an  extra $2,100 in the pockets of hardworking parents who are trying to  raise two kids, that is a lot of money. So that is a good thing that is  coming out of this bill.   I asked him: Will it be easier for those individuals to fill out  their tax returns? He said: Absolutely. By making the changes we made  in here and taking out some of these special tax breaks, we made it  easier for everybody to fill out their tax return.   Then I asked a third question. I just heard the gentlewoman from New  York talk about how this benefits big corporations. I don't have big  corporations in my district in south Alabama. I have got mainly small  businesses. Let me tell you about one.   It is called Fast Time Convenience Store. Now, we call those in  Alabama filling stations, because you go there and you put gas in your  car. In the morning, you go get a cup of coffee, you get one of their  breakfast biscuits, and you see a lot of people in there getting ready  to go to work. You go in there at lunchtime. You have also got  something called Fred's Kickin' Chicken. You go in there and get a good  thing of fried chicken and a soft drink, and he has got some barbecue  in a little trailer across the way. That is the sort of businesses I  have got in my district.                                time  1030    I think those businesses are darn important. The owner of that  business asked me the other day when I was in there: I don't care about  the big boys.  [[Page H10254]]  Are you going to do something that helps me, that helps businesses like  me?   So I asked the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee: Are we going  to be helping those small businesses?   Absolutely. They are going to see historic tax cuts, particularly if  they are one of these passthroughs; historic tax cuts. Yes, their tax  returns will be simpler to fill out.   So when I think about it from the standpoint of south Alabama--and I  daresay my district is not that much different from most every other  district that is being represented here--I see a threefer. Individuals  get a substantial tax cut, more money in their pocket. Individuals will  have an easier time filling out their returns. These small businesses  that are the backbone of America are getting a real break.   Now, I know that our friends on the other side of the aisle think  that the government needs to be more involved in the lives of ordinary  Americans. But in order for the government to do that, the government  has to have money. The government doesn't produce anything and it  doesn't provide a single service, so they don't sell anything.   So how does the government get money?   It takes money. A tax is a taking. It takes money from people in the  private sector.   We on this side of the aisle don't think the government should be so  involved in people's lives in America, and we don't think we should be  taking so much money from them through taxes. So we have come up with  this bill that gives sort of tax breaks to ordinary people and small  businesses, and we believe that that benefits America in two ways:   Number one, giving people more control over their money is a good  thing in and of itself.   Number two, we are absolutely convinced--and dozens and dozens of  economists have told us--that this is a major shot in the arm for the  American economy.   This is also a jobs bill because this is going to pump up the  American economy and get our economy growing at a much faster rate.  When we do that, we not only create more jobs, but we create a sort of  lift in our economy when we start seeing real wage growth. What we have  been missing out there is real wage growth.    Madam Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 10 o'clock and 45 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Thursday, December 21, 2017, at 9 a.m.                            ____________________
