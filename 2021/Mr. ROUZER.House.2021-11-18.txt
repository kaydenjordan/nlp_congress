 Madam Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding.   Madam Speaker, the 2,000-plus-page bill before us today has countless  provisions that are going to substantially increase the debt,  incentivize even more people not to work, and hike the taxes of the  very ones who create the jobs.   It levies more than $400 billion in tax hikes on small businesses,  and it includes a $1.2 trillion Made in America tax plan that is going  to do nothing but send jobs overseas. It spends nearly $80 billion so  the IRS can go after the average taxpayer and snoop around his bank  account. It eliminates work requirements for welfare when, in fact, we  have 10.4 million jobs available.   It prevents lifesaving drugs from coming to market and  disincentivizes the innovation necessary to discover cures. It hinders  domestic energy production and even imposes a tax on natural gas.   Should this monstrosity become law, it will hurt the economy, drive  up the debt, and increase inflation even more--all of which means the  standard of living of each and every American is going to decline.
