 MALONEY of New York. Mr. Chair, I thank Congresswoman  Lee for yielding and for her extraordinary leadership on this issue and  in so many other areas.   Mr. Chair, I rise in strong, strong support of H.R. 1865. It is  transformative legislation. It is important and it will save lives. It  is a historic legislative achievement. I thank my colleague Ann Wagner  for her selfless, dedicated, effective leadership in bringing this bill  to the floor. I thank my colleagues, Joyce Beatty and Sheila Jackson  Lee, Congresswomen Roby and Walters, really everyone, and the  leadership of this body for bringing this bill to the floor. I hope we  should all pass it. It is important.   This bill clarifies that internet companies that actively advertise  the sale of trafficking victims, many of whom are children and minors,  are not protected by the Communications Decency Act, Section 230. When  Congress enacted it 22 years ago, it never, never intended to make the  internet into a red-light zone and a protected area to shield sex  traffickers and corporations from selling our young people, many of  whom are stolen, doped, forced into sex trafficking, and then protect  them from the appeals of their parents for some type of justification,  some type of recognition of the harm that they have caused.   Now, this bill, like every other sex trafficking bill, has been a  bipartisan effort between Democrats and Republicans. It is landmark. It  is important. And we must continue to fight this modern-day form of  slavery wherever it exists, and this crime has absolutely exploded  online because it is so profitable.   You can sell a gun once. You can sell illegal dope once. But they  sell the human body over and over again until they die.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Chair, this is an important  issue. I must tell you that we have a choice.   This has gone to the courts, and the courts have said Congress must  decide whether Congress wants to shield corporations, profit-makers,  exploiters--I would say--murderers of young children online, selling  them for sex trafficking. So if you vote against this bill, you are  shielding them. If you vote for it, you are protecting our children.   This bill removes obstacles for attorneys general throughout the  country to enact State antitrafficking laws. That is why 50 attorneys  general have supported it.   Victims and families will be given a pathway to justice through  private civil action that they have been denied too long. Over 50  organizations have come out in support of H.R. 1865, and I include in  the Record a list of those organizations.

Some corporations, like  Facebook, Sheryl Sandberg, and others have stood up and said: Enough is  enough; protect our children.   Mr. Chair, I include in the Record the following statement from  Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook.         Sex trafficking--particularly of young girls and boys--is       one of the most heinous acts that takes place anywhere in the       world. Those of us in the United States must recognize that       these deplorable acts of buying and selling children for sex       don't just happen in other countries. They happen here all as       well--right under our noses, on our streets, and on the       Internet. We all have a responsibility to do our part to       fight this. That's why we at Facebook support efforts to pass       amended legislation in the House that would allow responsible       companies to continue fighting sex trafficking while giving       victims the chance to seek justice against companies that       knowingly facilitate such abhorrent acts.        I care deeply about this issue and I'm so thankful to all       the advocates who are fighting tirelessly to make sure we put       a stop to trafficking while helping victims get the support       they need. Facebook is committed to working with them and       with legislators in the House and Senate as the process moves       forward to make sure we pass meaningful and strong       legislation to stop sex trafficking.     MALONEY of New York. Mr. Chair, today, 22 years after  [[Page H1296]]  Congress passed the CDA, we have the opportunity to declare that the  intention of the law was never to protect traffickers and companies  that actively sell and enable them to continue this incredible,  horrible, life-taking crime of promoting sex trafficking and selling  our young people.   I urge a strong ``no'' vote. Let's make it unanimous. Let's show the  world, the courts, the families, the victims where we stand.
