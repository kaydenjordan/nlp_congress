 Madam Speaker, last November the American people  delivered a clear message: Women want the right to make their own  reproductive decisions.   My Republican colleagues must have missed that message because they  just passed a bill that inserts politics into private family decisions.   That bill is an attempt to create a false and gruesome narrative to  interfere with a doctor's care for her patients and to falsely suggest  that doctors don't already have a legal obligation to provide the best  possible care for their patients.   This fearmongering is dangerous. It could leave doctors fearful of  providing the best care for patients who are facing devastating  circumstances. It could cause further pain to families facing the  heartbreak of a fetus with a fatal abnormality.   The real aim of this bill is to vilify and punish women and their  doctors.   I voted ``no'' on H.R. 26. I will continue to stand up for women's  reproductive rights.                            ____________________
