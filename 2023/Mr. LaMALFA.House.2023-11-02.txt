 Mr. Speaker, it is incredible the amount of anti- Semitism that is rising up in this country and around the world, at a  time when we preach tolerance, equity, and so many other things related  to that, that we would have this wave of anti-Semitism coming out  against Jewish people that is done brazenly in the light of day, on our  college campuses, our media, and even across the street a couple weeks  ago when they blocked off Independence Avenue, ostensibly for rights  for others.   Here we are. We have an alliance with the country of Israel, which is  extremely important for us. Look at the partnerships we have with the  United States and Israel in developing technology, for saving water in  agriculture, medical technology, and, yes, important technology for  defense systems, our Patriot missiles and their Iron Dome when we work  together.   It is imperative that we continue our alliance with Israel, and this  package of $14 billion, instead of going to the IRS, goes to help the  country of Israel.                            ____________________     Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, in 1906, the Antiquities Act was passed by  Congress to give the President authority to declare our national  monuments were historical landmarks and structures. But this act  required that declaration be confined to the smallest possible area to  do a given job. In 2023, we see the original intent of this bill has  become almost unrecognizable.   Much like Congress has experienced and the American people have  experienced with the Clean Water Act and  [[Page H5288]]  the definition of the waters of the United States, the executive branch  has continually run wild with the authority Congress at one time had  granted it.   While the Clean Water Act was used by both the Obama and Biden  administration in an attempt to put all water under the jurisdiction of  bureaucrats in Washington, D.C., so too has the Antiquities Act been  used to take vast tracks of land, especially in the Western United  States, out of consideration for economic development and responsible  land management, such as for fire.   Some of the early drafts of the Antiquities Act even mentioned a  total limitation of any monuments to 640 acres. A limitation on  monument size, 640 acres was the original draft. That is only one  square mile.   By contrast, in August President Biden designated new lands to the  Grand Canyon totaling nearly 1 million acres. That would be  approximately 1,500 square miles.   When President Teddy Roosevelt signed the Antiquities Act into law,  he did so believing it would allow the U.S. to honor its history and  protect public lands. All good things.   Today, when word of a new national monument reaches an area, such as  my area in northern California, my constituents in Colusa County didn't  react with hope or an appreciation of history in this particular  instance. Instead, they reacted with anger, frustration, or even fear  of what it will mean for lands in their areas.   For example, will the Federal Government still perform necessary  forest and land management? That is an issue we deal with continuously.  As we saw in my district in 2021, we had a 1-million-acre fire known as  the Dixie fire due to lack of forest service management on Federal  land.   And another question would be: Can we still allow for recreation on  these lands?   Mr. Chairman, this body has allowed the executive branch to take too  much of our authority away from Congress. The abuse of the Antiquities  Act is just the latest in a long line of white flags Congress has flown  against the President.   Mr. Chairman, I urge adoption of my amendment, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I appreciate the thoughts by my good  colleague from Maine, and I appreciate her.   In this particular case, we are limiting, relative to the whole  country, a small area. This affects several thousand acres, not the  entire country. The President's whole powers are in one county in my  district, Colusa County in northern California. They have asked not to  be included in this monument because it would limit their ability to do  important things, such as manage the land for fire danger or  recreation. It is really rather sparse land in that area. It is good  for deer hunting.   So what is it you really need a monument for? If you are going to do  extensive things like mining, drilling, putting in pipelines or power  lines, you already have to get permits for those. And it takes the  mines we are going to need in this country if we are going to electrify  everything, they take 20 years to get a mine made. But that is not even  proposed in this area. It is simply to have a little autonomy in the  area.   Now, when it wasn't affecting Colusa County, the locals there weren't  particularly against the moment as it didn't affect their county. After  an additional portion got drawn in, they said, Well, wait a minute.  This is our county. We already have difficulty in this rural county  with revenue and being able to do the things we need to do in a rural  economy, in an agriculture economy or what little tourism they can get  out that way too, they are having that option taken away from them.   With the monument, you basically can't do anything on the land,  including in many cases, mechanized forest firefighting. You have to go  out with hand tools in some of these areas. And so, it just means the  fire gets bigger. It just means less options for locals.   I thought the Antiquities Act was supposed to be preserving things  for the people's enjoyment, not completely cutting them off. That is  why we are so strongly opposed to this being added to Colusa County in  this instance here.   With that, I still oppose. I appreciate being able to work over on  the other side with Senator Padilla's office on this conversation in  moving forward to say, Let us have our autonomy in our areas of  northern California where we don't think a monument works for us in  order to manage the land as needed.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, my amendment would stop the latest in a  series of land grabs in the West by the Biden administration.   Many of the Presidential proclamations and the executive actions  enabling these land grabs stem from section 216 of Executive Order  14008 signed by President Biden just a week after taking office.   This order started the 30 by 30 plan which seeks to restrict and lock  away roughly 30 percent of this Nation's public lands by the year 2030.   ``30 for 30'' is a nice series on ESPN about sports figures, but 30  by 30 is very dangerous for us in the West.   In support of this executive initiative, the Bureau of Land  Management published a new resource management plan for northwest  California at the end of September. Much of the BLM plan area overlaps  with my own congressional district.                                time  2015    In total, the so-called preferred alternative detailed in BLM's draft  management plan would designate 42,000 acres as protected for the  environment or for conservation.   Under the Bureau's current management plan, just 100 acres of land  are labeled suitable for wild and scenic river designations, but this  draft plan would see the number would explode to nearly 34,000 acres.  The difference between 100 acres is one-sixth of a square mile, and  34,000 acres is 53 square miles.   In Shasta County, 33,000 acres would be labeled areas of critical  environmental concern. Concern. We can be concerned about just about  anything around here, can't we? Several thousand more will be removed  from eligibility for livestock grazing. Grazing, which is known to be  very helpful in fire suppression and actually stirring the land and  having things grow.   The same interest groups that are supportive of this management plan  are also behind a continuous push to remove hydroelectric dams now on  Butte Creek, as well as the ones we are suffering up on the Klamath  River. This would prevent recreational fishing on Butte Creek.   Madam Chairman, the 30 by 30 plan is indicative of how much  environmentalists just don't understand real life for rural Americans  and certainly life for the people in my own congressional district. If  environmentalists actually lived in the Churn Creek Bottom or up in  Magalia, they would understand that my constituents who do live there  want to take care of the natural resources.   The folks in Churn Creek Bottom don't just graze without regard to  the health of the land. They know, because they live there, that they  will need to graze this land again in a few months, in a few years, in  10 years, and on, as many families have been doing for six generations  in my district.   In my life, I am really a rice farmer. I would fight to protect our  rivers from pollution because it is bad for my crops and for my  neighbors. This isn't rocket science, folks. Beyond my farm, the  waterways in the Sacramento Valley need to be clean because people like  to recreate, like to fish, and just have a nice environment. No, we are  not bad stewards of the land. We certainly don't need Biden coming in  and setting aside 30 percent of all lands in just 7 scant years.   Bureaucrats with orders from D.C., however, should not be telling  Americans to stay away from the public lands. They already know how to  take care of their lands and their rivers. Most of these resources are  the lifeblood of each and every rural town, anyway.   I urge adoption of this amendment in order to keep just a little more  freedom, a little more possibilities in the economy and a lifestyle  that was once normal in rural America.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I have been hearing all day, we need more  plans that can gain bipartisan support, yet the people I represent,  especially in the northern part of my district, don't believe there is  bipartisan support when the Federal agencies come in and take away  their water, make it where they can't access their land, they can't  [[Page H5332]]  get grazing permits anymore. It is crammed down their throats by an  administration that is listening to somebody else rather than them.  That doesn't sound very bipartisan.   It is putting these people out of business who have been successful  for five, six generations on being good stewards of the land, yet now  it is not good enough because of something called climate change, which  CO2 only represents 0.04 percent of our atmosphere. That is  hardly measurable. Yet we are going hell-bent on ruining our economy,  ruining people's lives, ruining legacies because of something that  people who fly in their private jets to Davos like to talk about and  put upon us.   Madam Chair, 30 for 30 does not do anything for climate change. It  just makes it just about impossible to produce domestic food, domestic  energy, et cetera, in this country. That is why I am bringing this  amendment, and I appreciate an ``aye'' vote.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, on rollcall No. 588, I mistakenly voted  ``no'' when I intended to vote ``aye.''                   Amendment No. 112 Offered by Mr. Norman
