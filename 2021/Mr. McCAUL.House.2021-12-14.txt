 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  [[Page H7796]]    Madam Speaker, let me just say to my good friend, Chairman Meeks, we  all deplore anti-Muslim persecution. No one should ever be attacked or  denied their human rights or dignity because of their faith. So, we  actually agree on the intent and the spirit behind this. But I do have  some concerns with the wording in many parts of this legislation.   Madam Speaker, the United States Government is rightly committed to  opposing these monstrous acts of violence that we have seen directed at  Muslims around the world. This includes the horrific mosque shootings  in Switzerland, Quebec, and Christchurch.   Our commitment must also apply to anti-Muslim persecution by foreign  regimes, especially when it amounts to genocide. I am proud of our  bipartisan work to condemn and punish the Burmese military's genocide  against the Rohingya Muslims that began in 2016.   We are also working in a bipartisan fashion to oppose the Chinese  Communist Party's ongoing genocide against the Uyghur Muslims that we  passed together in a bipartisan manner on this floor just the other  day.   Today, more than 1 million Muslims and other ethnic and religious  minorities are held in camps and exploited as slave labor. Muslim  children are ripped from their mothers' arms to be raised by the  Communist Party. Muslim women are suffering systematic sexual violence,  forced sterilization, and forced abortion.   Members on our side are fully committed to combating these anti- Muslim atrocities. I am proud of the work, again, that Chairman Meeks  and I were able to do together to hold the Chinese Communist Party  accountable for their genocide, and I thank the gentleman for his  efforts.   In addition, I am pleased that right after this bill, Chairman  McGovern, who has worked so hard with this committee, and Senator Marco  Rubio in the Senate will finally be able to send to the President's  desk a bipartisan, bicameral bill to combat the forced labor that  supports the CCP's Uyghur genocide.   Unfortunately, the rushed, partisan bill before us today does not  live up to these two serious bipartisan efforts. Committee Democrats  made no effort to work toward a bipartisan agreement before the markup,  and the bill has no Republican cosponsors.   This legislation is dangerously vague and unnecessarily duplicative.  It doesn't frame things in terms of anti-Muslim persecution, nor does  it use the typical statutory language like ``gross violations of  internationally recognized human rights.''   Instead, it uses the undefined, nonlegal term of ``Islamophobia.''  This word appears nowhere in the Federal statutes. It is so vague and  subjective that it could be used against legitimate speech for partisan  purposes. Even the term ``phobia'' connotes irrational fear, not  discrimination.    The bill also completely ignores the State Department's extensive  efforts already underway to protect the rights of Muslims. Regular  monitoring and reporting are already carried out by human rights  officers or embassies worldwide, as well as the Bureau of Democracy,  Human Rights, and Labor; the Office of International Religious Freedom;  and the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom.   The annual ``Country Reports'' on human rights contain detailed,  country-specific narratives of human rights violations targeting  Muslims. The ``Annual Report on International Religious Freedom''  details anti-Muslim abuses and U.S. Government policy to address such  challenges.   In addition, the current nominee to serve as the Ambassador at Large  for International Religious Freedom, Rashad Hussain, is a prominent  Muslim American.   Madam Speaker, the lack of a special envoy is not a sign of bigotry.  In fact, there is no special envoy for the hundreds of millions of  Christians who face dangerous persecution today. Also, there is no  special envoy for the Hindus or the Buddhists or the Baha'is or the  Yazidis or many other people of faith who experience persecution.   We have heard a lot from the other side about the office and special  envoy on anti-Semitism, and I imagine that we will continue to hear  about this during this debate. But while the wording of today's bill is  modeled after the two prior anti-Semitism bills, the process has been  completely different and inadequate.   Both bills, in 2004 and 2020, came after dedicated hearings showing  the need for specialized legislation. The second bill is based on 16  years of experience before a Senate-confirmed special envoy was added.   In stark contrast, today's bill is the result of a hurried, partisan  push over the last 6 days. This legislation was introduced less than 2  months ago. We have not held any hearings focused on whether the new  State Department bureaucracy is needed or useful to counter anti-Muslim  hate.   Finally, today we received the oddest Statement of Administration  Policy that I can ever recall, basically saying that while the  administration supports passage of the bill, it would like for this  bill to be rewritten. This State Department would like for this bill to  be rewritten. Why aren't we consulting with the State Department to get  this bill right before we throw it on the House floor and pass it with  such haste?   In it, the administration also says that it wants to include language  to ``ensure the Secretary of State has the necessary flexibility and  permissive authority to designate such an office and special envoy.''  In other words, the administration doesn't want to be required to  create this office and position, as this bill mandates.   Combating religious persecution against all people of faith,  including Muslims, is a serious issue, and it deserves the kind of  serious attention that draws bipartisan support. I also believe that a  definition for clarity as to what Islamophobia is and how it would  apply should be done through the legislative intent of the Congress and  not left up to the bureaucracy in the State Department.   Unfortunately, the text has been rushed to the floor. It is vague and  redundant, as I have said. For that reason, I do oppose it.   I am going to get, later, into some definitions of Islamophobia from  various scholars and lawyerly articles that really bring out how vague  this term is. We are not saying we are protecting against persecution  of Muslims or international human rights for Muslims. It is  Islamophobia that I think draws the most scrutiny to this bill.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Ohio (Mr. Chabot), a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Perry), a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Tennessee, (Mr. Burchett), a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 6 minutes to the gentleman from  Kentucky (Mr. Barr), a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Van Duyne).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    I continue to reserve the balance of my time, Mr.  Speaker.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman from New York is prepared  to close, I am ready to close.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Let me just first say that all of us deplore anti-Muslim persecution.  We are seeing a lot of that in Afghanistan today, especially the small  children. We deplore violence on violence, Sunni against Shia. No one  should ever be attacked or denied their human rights or dignity because  of their faith. I believe both sides of the aisle agree on this, and I  personally agree with the intent and the spirit of this bill.   The United States Government is rightly committed to opposing these  acts of violence that we have seen directed at Muslims around the  world. The State Department has an office to do so.   What I do object to, Mr. Speaker, is the unfortunate circumstance  that the bill before us abandons the usual statutory language about  violations of internationally recognized human rights. Instead, it uses  this vague term, Islamophobia. Look it up on Wikipedia. It says it can  mean many things.   This Islamophobia is not defined. It is not that we are against the  anti-Muslim persecution or against international human rights  violations against Muslims, but rather this Islamophobia.   In connection with that, I would like to quote a 2016 article from  Columbia Law Review that states: ``There is no singular, cogent, or  consensus definition of Islamophobia.''   Similarly, the University of Oslo's Center for Research on Extremism  calls Islamophobia a ``contested term.''   These are law review articles, not mine.   It goes on further to say: ``The term conflates opposition to Islam  with prejudice toward Muslims.''   These expert descriptions underscore the need for due diligence that  this text has not yet received. I wish the minority had been given an  opportunity to discuss this bill before it was thrown in on the markup,  for we all oppose religious persecution against Muslims or any other  faith. I am a Catholic. Any other believers in any faith should be  protected from this hate speech and violence.   So for those reasons, because the definition is not provided,  Islamophobia is a very broad term that can be subject to many  interpretations.   If we don't define that in the Congress through legislative intent,  who will?   That means we cede our authority over to the executive branch, and  then they write what Islamophobia means. I wish we had used different  terms, terminologies that are in statute under law rather than  something that is sort of borne on a Wikipedia page.                                time  2030    To me, that is not the way we legislate here. I have done a lot of  great legislation with the chairman and the previous chairman of this  committee, and I intend to keep doing that with him. I  [[Page H7803]]  appreciate our joint efforts to advance strong, responsible bipartisan  legislation to protect religious freedom.   We are going to have one of those bills coming up right after this  one on the Uyghur Muslims, and I appreciate that. I know this has been  a heated debate, and some things have been said today that could be  offensive. This is not about one Member of Congress. This is about our  ability to come together as Americans and come out with a strong  bipartisan bill that makes sense so we can send the message around the  world that this will not be tolerated, just as we are standing up for  the Uyghur Muslims with the genocide bill and the bill that is going to  follow this debate here today.   Mr. Speaker, it has been a rigorous debate, and we expected this. I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
