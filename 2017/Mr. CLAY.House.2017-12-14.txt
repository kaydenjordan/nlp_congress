The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 657, the  gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Clay) and a Member opposed each will  control 5 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Missouri.    Mr. Speaker, the amendment offered makes important changes  to our bill, H.R. 2396, which is a straightforward, commonsense measure  that seeks to streamline the privacy information consumers get from  financial institutions and makes the information available much more  frequently via electronic delivery.   We have been working on what I consider to be a simple but necessary  fix to a 20-year-old law throughout this year, and I believe the  amendment we have presented for your consideration will undoubtedly  benefit consumers. We have worked with our colleagues on the Financial  Services Committee to modify and strengthen the underlying bill, and I  appreciate everyone's efforts.   Mr. Speaker, I would also like to thank the committee's ranking  member, Ms. Waters, for her and her staff's efforts to improve our  bill. I consider this amendment to be an effort to improve the  underlying legislation. While Ms. Waters still has some outstanding  concerns, I do appreciate her working with us.   The amendment clarifies the process by which consumers can opt out of  having their information shared with unaffiliated third parties. It  limits the application of the alternative delivery mechanism to vehicle  financial companies--that is simply what the amendment does--rather  than all financial institutions, as defined under the Gramm-Leach- Bliley Act and other technical and conforming changes.   Mr. Speaker, we believe these changes make our bill stronger and we  urge the adoption of the amendment.  [[Page H9914]]    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I claim time in  opposition to the amendment.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman is recognized for 5 minutes.   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate Mr. Clay's  effort to make the bill better. He is absolutely correct, we have been  attempting to work together to see if there was a way that we could  deal with the issue at hand and absolutely ensure that our consumers  not only have a right to information that explains to them what their  rights are and how they can opt out when their information is being  sold, really, to unaffiliated organizations.   Mr. Speaker, just in case people are not following exactly what we  are talking about when we talk about opt-out rights, let me draw your  attention to the fact that you oftentimes are receiving loads of mail  in your mailbox, everything from somebody who is selling pet food to  clothing, to services, to all kinds of products, and you don't know why  they are sending you all this junk. Well, they are sending you this  junk because somebody sold your information to all of these  organizations because you didn't know that you had not opted out. You  maybe didn't know what your rights are. But citizens have a right to  have that information, and they have a right to be respected and not  thought to be simply throwing it into the wastebasket.   It doesn't matter whether it is for all businesses in the United  States or just for automobile dealers. It is about every citizen having  the right to have their privacy protected and not having people sell  their information to unaffiliated organizations that will cause them to  be pressured or solicited over and over again and their mailboxes  filled with information because their privacy information has been sold  to one of those unaffiliated organizations.   Mr. Speaker, I think that Mr. Clay is attempting to streamline the  bill. I appreciate the efforts that he has put into attempting to do  this, but this does not correct the problem. This undermines the  efforts of all of these consumer groups that worked for years to get  these notices sent to our consumers.   Mr. Speaker, despite the fact that we have tried and we have worked  and we have listened to each other, I would ask for a ``no'' vote on  the amendment.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, just in closing, let me offer some  clarification.   In the fall of 2014, the CFPB finalized a rule allowing financial  institutions to post their annual privacy notices online instead of  delivering them individually if they met a series of conditions,  including not sharing the customer's nonpublic information with  unaffiliated third parties.   In December of 2015, Congress went further by enacting an outright  exemption from the mailing requirement for financial institutions that,  one, do not share nonpublic personal information about a consumer with  unaffiliated third parties; and, two, have not changed its disclosure  policy and practices since the most recent disclosure was sent to  consumers.                                time  1030    Institutions that provide financing for vehicle purchases or leases  do not meet the criteria set forth by Congress and are, therefore,  required to continue issuing paper privacy notices to consumers.   Mr. Speaker, this amendment helps to improve this bill. It modernizes  this requirement. I just urge the body to adopt the amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the previous question  is ordered on the bill, as amended, and on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Clay).   The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from  Missouri (Mr. Clay).   The amendment was agreed to.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the engrossment and third  reading of the bill.   The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was  read the third time.                              Motion to Recommit    Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to  recommit at the desk.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentlewoman opposed to the bill?   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I am opposed to the  bill.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion to  recommit.   The Clerk read as follows:         Ms. Maxine Waters of California moves to recommit the bill       H.R. 2396 to the Committee on Financial Services with       instructions to report the same back to the House forthwith       with the following amendment:        In subsection (g)(3) of the matter proposed to be inserted       by section 2 of the bill, insert after subparagraph (B) the       following flush-left text: ``For purposes of this subsection,       the term `vehicle financial company' does not include a       financial institution that is engaging or has engaged in a       pattern or practice of unsafe or unsound banking practices       and other violations related to consumer harm.''.        Add at the end the following:        ``(4) Additional definitions.--For purposes of this       section:        ``(A) Federal consumer financial law.--The term `Federal       consumer financial law' has the meaning given that term under       section 1002 of the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010       (12 U.S.C. 5481).        ``(B) Pattern or practice of unsafe or unsound banking       practices and other violations related to consumer harm.--The       term `pattern or practice of unsafe or unsound banking       practices and other violations related to consumer harm'       means engaging in all of the following activities, to the       extent each activity was discovered or occurred at least once       in the 10 years preceding the date of the enactment of this       Act:        ``(i) Having unsafe or unsound practices in the       institution's risk management and oversight of the       institution's sales practices, as evidenced by--         ``(I) an institution lacking an enterprise-wide sales       practices oversight program that enables the institution to       adequately monitor sales practices to prevent and detect       unsafe or unsound sales practices and mitigate risks that may       result from such unsafe and unsound sales practices; and        ``(II) an institution lacking a comprehensive customer       complaint monitoring process that--         ``(aa) enables the institution to assess customer complaint       activity across the institution;        ``(bb) adequately monitors, manages, and reports on       customer complaints; and        ``(cc) analyzes and understands the potential risks posed       by the institution's sales practices.        ``(ii) Engaging in unsafe and unsound sales practices, as       evidenced by the institution--         ``(I) opening more than one million unauthorized deposit,       credit card, or other accounts;        ``(II) performing unauthorized transfers of customer funds;       and        ``(III) performing unauthorized credit inquiries for       purposes of the conduct described in subclause (I) or (II).         ``(iii) Lacking adequate oversight of third-party vendors       for purposes of risk-mitigation, to prevent abusive and       deceptive practices in the vendor's provision of consumer       products or services.        ``(iv) Having deficient policies and procedures for sharing       customers' personal identifiable information with third-party       vendors for litigation purposes that led to inadvertent       disclosure of such information to unintended parties.        ``(v) Violating Federal consumer financial laws with       respect to mortgage loans, including charges of hidden fees       and unauthorized or improper disclosures tied to home       mortgage loan modifications.        ``(vi) Engaging in unsafe or unsound banking practices       related to residential mortgage loan servicing and       foreclosure processing.        ``(vii) Violating the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act.''.    Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California (during the reading). Mr. Speaker, I  ask unanimous consent to dispense with the reading.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentlewoman from California?   There was no objection.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentlewoman from  California is recognized for 5 minutes in support of her motion.   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, this is the final  amendment to the bill, which will not kill the bill or send it back to  committee. If adopted, the bill will immediately proceed to final  passage, as amended.   My motion would prevent institutions that have engaged in a pattern  or practice of unsafe or unsound banking practices and other violations  related to consumer harm from being able to evade important consumer  protections.   When companies repeatedly exhibit indifference to consumer protection  and demonstrate that they are incapable of complying or are unwilling  to comply with U.S. laws and regulations, they should not be allowed to  benefit from those bad actions.  [[Page H9915]]    As I have already mentioned, under this bill, as amended, companies  like Wells Fargo would be free to share or sell customer information  with any company, with minimal reminders to their customers.   We all know that Wells Fargo has engaged in illegal student loan  servicing practices, inappropriate checking accounts, overdraft fees,  unlawful mortgage lending practices, overcharging veterans for  refinanced loans, enrolled customers in life insurance policies without  their consent, delayed mortgage closing dates until after the  expiration of the borrower's interest rate lock to levy additional  fees, and charged over 570,000 customers with auto insurance policies  they did not need, which resulted in at least 20,000 customers,  including Active-Duty servicemembers, having their vehicles  inappropriately repossessed.   Companies like Wells Fargo are why I introduced H.R. 3937, the  Megabank Accountability and Consequences Act, to make sure that lenders  that have engaged in abusive practices face real consequences for their  wrongdoing. It is time we truly hold companies that demonstrate a  pattern of harming consumers accountable. These institutions must no  longer be allowed to abuse hardworking Americans.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of my motion, and I yield back the  balance of my time.
