 Mr. President, I am pleased to be introducing the  Investment in Tomorrow's Pediatric Workforce Act with Senator Cassidy.  This critical legislation would provide funding for the Title VII  pediatric subspecialty loan repayment program.   The Title VII health professions programs have a longstanding history  of increasing the supply of health care professionals, expanding access  to care in rural and urban underserved areas, and developing a  workforce that reflects the Nation's diversity and the needs of  patients. These education and training programs guide current and  aspiring health professionals to high-demand careers in areas of  greatest need. Pediatric subspecialty care is one such shortage area.   According to the American Association of Child and Adolescent  Psychiatry, there are currently only 8,300 child and adolescent  psychiatrists (CAPs) in the United States--many of whom are not  practicing full time--far short of the estimated need of over 30,000  CAPs. On average, patients wait almost two months to see a CAP, a  startling concern given that the incidence rates of mental illness and  behavioral disorders among children in the United States continue to  grow. Fifty percent of all lifetime cases of mental illness begin at  age 14; seventy-five percent by age 24.   This legislation would take an important first step in incentivizing  more health care professionals to go into pediatric subspecialties and  increase the supply of these professionals to ensure more children have  greater access to the health care they need. I look forward to working  with stakeholders supporting the legislation including the American  Academy of Pediatrics, the American Association of Child and Adolescent  Psychiatry, the Arthritis Foundation, the American College of  Rheumatology, and the Child Neurology Society, as well as my colleague,  Senator Cassidy, to pass the Investment in Tomorrow's Pediatric  Workforce Act, and to strengthen all of the Title VII health  professions programs.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I am pleased to be introducing the  Investment in Tomorrow's Pediatric Workforce Act with Senator Cassidy.
