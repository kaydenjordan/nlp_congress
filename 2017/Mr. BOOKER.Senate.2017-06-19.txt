 Madam President, I have a parliamentary inquiry. Am I  correct in stating that the text of S. 1796 and S. 1679 were posted on  the websites for the respective committees, each for 6 days? The  Affordable Care Act was posted on the websites of the respective  committees, each of them, actually for 6 days prior to committee  consideration?   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Secretary of the Senate's office, through  the Senate Library, confirms that each committee posted its legislation  online for 6 days prior to consideration.    Madam President, with the hope for regular order, the  hope for committee process, the hope for transparency, the hope for the  chance for the Senate to work as it was intended, I ask unanimous  consent that no motion to proceed to Calendar No. 120, H.R. 1628, be in  order until the bill has been the subject of executive session meetings  in the Committee on Finance, during which amendments from the majority  and minority received votes, and the bill has been favorably reported  from the committee.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?   Mr. McCONNELL. I object.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.   The Senator from Illinois.    Mr. President, I am grateful for the recognition. I am  grateful for my colleague from Hawaii and for my colleagues from across  the country who are going to be coming to the floor tonight.   This is going to be a long evening because there are a lot of folks  who are frustrated. There is frustration not just about the actual bill  itself, a lot of this frustration right now is building because of the  brokenness of this process. It is a process that is right now about  secrecy. It is a process that has been conducted behind closed doors in  back rooms. It is a process that is not reflective of our history, of  our traditions, or of the many calls from both sides of the aisle, in  my short time in the Senate, hearing echoes of a chorus from my  colleagues on both sides of the aisle who talk about regular order,  regular order, regular order.   Several of my colleagues and I earlier were asking for unanimous  consent--trying to use the process of the Senate to bring about a  better process--a process that would bring this legislation out into  the light of day and create an opportunity reflective of the Affordable  Care Act, where we would have people able to put input into this  process. A debate would happen. Discussion would happen. Actually, we  would come forward with a bill the American public would see go through  the debates.   In fact, through the process, the very Constitutional Convention of  this country--perhaps some of the biggest issues of humanity--were  debated in an open forum. We have records of those discussions, records  of those deliberations. Everything from the representation that each  State should have to issues as profound as slavery were right there,  out in the open. Tonight, it is remarkable to me, it is almost tragic  to me, to see a process that is so broken, a process that is so  secretive, a process happening in back rooms--everything Americans  dislike about politics of old--people working in secret on a bill they  are going to try to force through Congress with no public input, no  hearings, no meetings, no markups, no debate, no public accountability.   So there will be a lot of voices tonight speaking about the realities  of this legislation. I am one of those folks. I came from a children's  hospital this afternoon with parents and with children who suffered  accidents--car accidents and more--telling me how they were relying on  Medicaid. I think it is one of the most terrifying things that is about  to happen because people look at the House bill--a bill our President  even called mean--and they are fearing for their own communities,  fearing for families like theirs.   I understand the substance of this bill should have many people  afraid about what kind of country we are going to be when we look at  the House version of the bill and see that it violates our common  values and ideals as a nation--to give massive tax breaks worth  hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars to the wealthiest and, at  the same time, cut the social safety net to a degree we haven't seen in  my lifetime. The substance of this is frightening, but the process, to  me, violates the values I know so many of my colleagues hold and that  any of us, watching this happen in an objective way, would criticize.   We know the starting place in the House. We know the details of that  bill--23 million Americans losing health insurance, the gutting of  Medicaid by $800 billion, throwing one-sixth of our economy into  crisis, but it is the process that is fundamentally at odds with the  principles and the values of especially this body, the Senate. When I  was running for this office, I had so many people come to me and say:  This is the greatest deliberative body on the planet Earth--the  Senate--which slows things down, the saucer that cools the tea as our  ancestors said. This body has a history of grappling with issues. This  process is so at odds with everything I believe about this body and how  it is supposed to operate. The Senate is meant to be a place of  powerful consideration of debate, of discussion.   Now, the history of this body and its debates and discussions is  really interesting. The longest consecutive session in Senate history  was a debate during the First World War about whether to arm merchant  ships. That is the record. By the way, issues of war and peace I would  hope would bring about substantive, deliberative debate, discussion,  open air. This body is probably--in fact, the elder statesmen and  [[Page S3579]]  women in this body I have spoken to on both sides of the aisle,  sometimes the most difficult decisions they have made are involving war  and peace. What is interesting, if you look at the history of the body,  the longest consecutive session debate was about war and whether to arm  merchant ships in the First World War.   What was the second longest debate? The second longest consecutive  session in Senate history was actually healthcare, or, more  specifically, it was the healthcare debate in 2010 about the Affordable  Care Act or so-called ObamaCare. In fact, here we are looking at a  process that seems to be screaming something to the floor: No hearings,  no markups, no committee sessions--screaming to the floor in the shadow  of the second longest consecutive session of debate. That, to me, is a  contrast that speaks volumes about the wrongness of this moment in  history. Anyone objectively standing back would agree and concur that  for something that is so deeply at the core of what our country is  about--we literally founded this Nation because of life, liberty, and  the pursuit of happiness--life. What more fundamental aspect of life is  there?   A critical constituent part of that has to be how we preserve life,  how we embolden life. What is the state of our healthcare? For this  great, historic, deliberative body to be doing that without so much as  a pause, with the brilliant minds on both sides of this aisle, with the  thoughtful people on both sides of this aisle, people who have come  through portals and processes where they expose themselves and their  lives to public discussion, public debate--that is what a democracy is,  and that is what this Republic was founded upon, not secrecy, not back  rooms.   This body reflects the best of what democratic principles are. Now we  are rushing something through that fundamentally affects life, and we  are pushing it to the floor with an insult to our history, an insult to  our values.   It has been said before, but I remind my colleagues that the  Affordable Care Act had a lengthy process before that near  recordbreaking consecutive days of session. The Senate's HELP Committee  held 14 bipartisan roundtables, 13 bipartisan hearings, 20 bipartisan  walkthroughs, and considered nearly 300 amendments. The Affordable Care  Act actually accepted over 160 amendments--160 Republican amendments to  shape the bill.   The Finance Committee held 17 roundtables, summits, and hearings; 13  bipartisan Member meetings and walkthroughs, 38 meetings and  negotiations, and then a 7-day markup on the bill--the longest markup  in over 20 years. That is our history. In the end, the Affordable Care  Act went through a lengthy process, through which the policy experts,  market experts, medical professionals, health nonprofits, insurers,  hospitals, and families all came to this Senate and put forward their  input and their ideas.   This wasn't a Republican bill or a Democratic bill by the politicians  themselves. America was invited to the table. Hours and hours of  hearing records show that people--whether the bill ended up reflecting  their ideas or not--had their say. That is what is beautiful about this  democracy, is that the dignity and the voice and the opinions of others  is brought into the process.   I was mayor of Newark during the time that this process was going on.  People in my community were riveted by it. They knew that issues that  would affect their lives were going on here in the U.S. Senate, at a  time when the No. 1 reason for personal bankruptcy in my State was  because people were declaring bankruptcy because of their healthcare  bills--something that is not happening now at those levels.   People were caring and concerned about what was going on, and  representatives from my community came down. I saw how that process  shaped the bill. I saw how Republican ideas shaped the bill. I saw how  hospitals and insurers and advocates and doctors and nonprofits, the  AARP, and others let their voices be heard, shaped the process, had  input, had voice, and their dignity and perspectives were respected.    I fully yield to the majority leader.                    Unanimous Consent Requests--H.R. 1628     I fully yield to the majority leader.                    Unanimous Consent Requests--H.R. 1628     Mr. President, I recognize my more senior Senator is here  from Delaware, so I suspend at this time in deference to an opportunity  for the senior Senator from Delaware to have a few words.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.    Will the Senator yield for a question?    Will the Senator yield for a question?    Will the Senator yield for a question?    Will the Senator yield for a question?    Will the Senator yield for a question?    Will the Senator yield for a question?    Will the Senator yield for a question?    Will the Senator yield for a question?    Will the Senator yield for a question?    Will the Senator yield for a question?    Will the Senator yield for a question?    Will the Senator yield for a question?    Will the Senator yield for a question?    Will the Senator yield for a question?    Will the Senator yield for a question?    Will the Senator yield for a question?    Will the Senator yield for a question?    Will the Senator yield for a question?    Mr. President, can I ask the Senator from Connecticut a  question?   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Thank you very much.   The Senator's charts plainly showed who benefits from the Republican  bill that we saw in the House. The CBO, as he pointed out, plainly  demonstrates that 23 million Americans will lose healthcare. I have  heard him talk about this on other issues--how we as Americans are far  more connected than we realize and that while one family might suffer  from lack of health insurance--like the folks he talked about in the  beginning of his remarks--the reality is that when that child doesn't  get the healthcare they deserve, when they don't achieve in life the  great potential they might have, others suffer as well. You see this as  you travel to European countries. They have vastly more people insured,  vastly more investments in childhood education and childhood  healthcare.   I am wondering if the Senator can extrapolate for me for a moment  that this isn't just about individual families who are vulnerable. It  is really all Americans, who suffer when other Americans are not  getting the benefit of healthcare in this country.    If I can ask the Senator from Connecticut one more  question--that interrelatedness is a part of a larger system. We all  benefit from these systems. My colleague mentioned hospitals, and  whether it is my family who gets injured and is rushed to a hospital or  a wealthy family or a poor family, those hospitals are a critical part  of the healthcare system.   I was mayor of a city, and I imagine my experience is similar to that  of the Senator from Connecticut. Our hospitals before the Affordable  Care Act were having a really difficult time because so many of those  costs at the most expensive point--when a disease had become so much  more acute--were being pushed into hospital emergency rooms. My State  was having a very difficult time with the costs of that charity care.  They literally had tough choices. They weren't going to close their  doors when somebody went into diabetic shock or someone had an asthma  attack or some of those diseases were not treated at an earlier stage.   I am wondering if the Senator can help explain, in terms of  Connecticut's perspective, why this has an impact on all of us in terms  of the systemic healthcare systems that sustain our communities.    That brings up one more issue, if the Senator will  indulge me, because I just visited his State. As I was talking to a lot  of his members--being from New Jersey, there might be a small rivalry  between our two northeastern States. A couple of folks came up to me  and got in my face in a polite and joking way about how our  Constitution was formed. They talked about the Connecticut Compromise.  As you well know, this was a compromise that allowed our Republic to  form, understanding they would have two bodies, the House and Senate.  Every State would have two Members representing it. In many ways, the  Founders of our country, coming out of this, viewed this body very  differently than the other body.    Now, the other body, you served in. I am hoping maybe you can shine  some light. I have been here 3\1/2\ years. You had experience as a  House Member and as a Senator. You said something some people at home  might dismiss as hyperbolic partisanship, but I have been here 3\1/2\  years, and I have seen this body change. What frustrates me is that  when I was here for a brief period of time and Democrats were in the  majority, I heard Republicans talk about regular order, how urgent  regular order is. When we are in charge, we will have regular order.  The leader spoke publicly about this thing called ``regular order.''  The House operates on majority rule. Our Founders saw that as a very  different body than this, which is in many ways talked about as a  different rhythm--a different way of doing things. In fact, one Senator  over here can have a lot of power within this system, sometimes to the  frustration of folks, to slow things down.   You made the claim about this being broken. This is a perfect example  of it--this idea that this would be the body, on such a big issue, that  would have a chance to be deliberative and to focus on this. I think  you are right. We have seen this body, in the very short period of time  I have been here, begin to undermine not just things that happened  under the Obama administration but to undermine traditions that go back  decades, if not more than a century.   I wonder if, being that State, as I was told, so critical to our  Constitution, you could give some light on why you really are  substantively, factually saying that this is probably one of the low  moments of the Senate in the way that this process is being done.    They might have been born in New Jersey.    They might have been born in New Jersey.    They might have been born in New Jersey.    I thank Senator Murphy for giving me those few moments.   I wonder if the Chair would recognize me to give a few remarks  myself.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.    Thank you very much, Mr. President.   I want to pick up on that conversation that we were having, in which  Senator Murphy laid plain on his charts about larger issues with this  bill. I want to get back to the point he was just talking about and  that I observed here in the Senate for about 3\1/2\ years, and that is  the functioning of this body. I love history. I am one of these guys  who doesn't read any fiction any more. I love reading about this  country, about its past leaders, about great moments in history.   What is interesting about this body is that, being someone who has  the privilege to stand on this floor--quite literally, given to me by  the State that I love, New Jersey--I walk on this floor and I feel a  sense of history every time I am here. It has been 3\1/2\ years, and it  hasn't lost its ``wow'' factor for me that I get to stand on this  floor. I have to say that I love my State, and in my campaigning, I  don't think the issue that I am New Jersey's first Black Senator came  up that much. New Jerseyans wanted to know: Would I come down here and  fight for them? I was aware of the history of being the fourth African  American popularly elected in the history of this body. I came down  here as a student of many of the great moments in time on this floor  and many of the records that were set.   I think some of those records are really germane to this moment right  now. The longest filibuster on this floor is where one Senator could  actually grind the workings of the Senate down to a crawl because of  Senate rules and Senate traditions. In this case, it is something I  wasn't even alive for, but something that, to me, is frustrating. But  it is a moment of history that shows what regular order is. It slows  down this body.   A filibuster takes 60 votes to overcome. So here was this moment. It  was  [[Page S3603]]  actually almost exactly 60 years ago. That was the 1957 Civil Rights  Act. It was Strom Thurmond who gave this long filibuster, trying to  block something that--yes, indeed--was going to have societal impacts  on this country--the 1957 Civil Rights Act. This is one illustration of  how, when monumental pieces of legislation come to this floor, the  history of this body and the traditions of this body are to slow things  down, to have a process, to have rules--especially for things that are  so monumental. In this case, it was the 1957 Civil Rights Act-- something on which we look back in the past and say: Wow, it took them  a long time to get there, but it demonstrates what this body's rules  have been about for a long time.   Let me go with another record that I mentioned earlier tonight, but  it shows, again, that when monumental pieces of legislation are coming,  this is a body that looks closely, takes its time, is deliberative, and  has a time-honored process. That is the other record set by the longest  consecutive session in Senate history. It was a debate about truly one  of the more important things in our society, which is issues of war and  peace. The longest consecutive session in the Senate history of debate  and of deliberation--open and public, not just for the Nation to see  but for the world to see--was a debate during the First World War about  whether to arm merchant ships. It brought about tremendous  consternation, tremendous debate, as we did the lead up to the First  World War. What is interesting is, if you think about the forming of  our country in that debate--again, the Constitutional Convention was  public, open, transparent--issues were debated. One of the fundamental  reasons for organizing our government was seen as the protection of the  American people, the ideals of a common defense, and the public  welfare. These were the things, literally, put into the preamble of our  Constitution, about what this government is about--that these are the  most important ideals. In fact, we herald some of these ideals. They  have become part of our civic gospel. Everyone knows when they hear the  words ``liberty and justice for all'' that they are part of our civic  gospel.   Part of that gospel, as well--in the core center of our country--is  that this is a nation about life, liberty, and the pursuit of  happiness. As to that word ``life,'' this government, this Republic is  affirming the ideals of life. It is only understandable when we are  debating epic pieces of legislation that will go to affect the lives of  tens of millions of Americans.   I was in the children's hospital today. Families in peril, families  in crisis were talking about the lives of their children. I have seen  it happen, unfortunately, to neighbors and people of my community. When  the lives of their children are at stake or threatened or afflicted  with disease, it puts so many things in perspective.   So here we have legislation speeding its way to the Senate floor that  goes to the fundamental ideals of this Nation. Will we be a country  that has a system of healthcare that affirms life?   When we are talking about records in the Senate, it is no coincidence  to me that one of the longest times that there was a consecutive  session in Senate history for debate--no coincidence to me--was about  war and peace. It was the rush, as some people saw it then, toward war  in World War I. What is fascinating is that folks should know that the  second longest consecutive session in Senate history was about  healthcare. It was in 2010. It was over the Affordable Care Act, a bill  that the full Senate spent 25 consecutive days considering, 160 hours.  Those 160 hours in session does not include hundreds more hours in  committee hearings, in meetings. All that took place in the development  of a bill that came to this floor and set a record about being the  second longest debate.   It is perfectly justifiable that the bill should have taken so much  time, so much focus--that the world's greatest deliberative body would  deliberate, would do its job. As for that piece of legislation, don't  believe the lie; it wasn't rushed through here. It didn't get the  express train through the Senate. It set records for discussion,  deliberation, debate, and a process that included comments, input,  thoughts, and testimony from Americans across the country--not just red  States, not just blue States, but of all Americans. It was justifiable.  It was absolutely justifiable.   I wasn't here. I was at home in Newark. I was mayor of the city.   This debate went on and on and on, and it captured the attention of  the Nation. It was something I had never seen before and I haven't seen  since. The President of the United States then, Barack Obama--this to  me was stunning; it caught my attention--was on national TV cameras.  Sure, it was C-SPAN--not what I turn to first when I am home relaxing  on my couch. But the President of the United States invited Congress  in--Republicans, some of the smartest minds. I have served here 3\1/2\  years now. Some of the smartest minds I have met in this country are  here in the Senate on the Republican side. He invited the Congress in  to discuss and debate with him on live TV healthcare. I don't know if  Reagan did that. I don't know if Bill Clinton did that. I can't  remember that they did. So here was something that was done fully in  the light, vetted, debated, deliberated, discussed in open air.    The hearing numbers are incredible. I have been here 3\1/2\ years,  and I have never seen anything like it. In the Senate's so-called HELP  Committee--Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions--they held 14  bipartisan roundtables, 13 bipartisan hearings, 20 bipartisan  walkthroughs, and they considered 300 amendments. This is the thing I  didn't know until I got to the Senate because of all the rhetoric on  24-hour cable news. This wasn't a purely Democratic bill. They actually  accepted over 160 amendments from Republicans. The stories I have heard  from people on both sides of the aisle is that they were bending over  backward trying to pick up one Republican vote, so they incurred and  took on amendments that actually shaped the bill, Republican ideas onto  this healthcare bill, 160 amendments. But stop, that is only in the  HELP Committee.   In the Senate Finance Committee, they held 17 bipartisan roundtables,  they held summits and hearings, 13 member meetings and walkthroughs, 38  meetings and negotiations, bipartisan. They held a markup. I have been  to lots of markups. I have never seen them last or scarcely can think  of times they have lasted for more than a day, but they held, in the  Finance Committee, a 7-day markup on the bill. That 7-day markup--talk  about records--that 7-day markup was the longest markup on a bill in 20  years. That was the process.   A bill affecting that fundamental American ideal that this Nation-- founded like no other, not a theocracy, not a monarchy. It is the  oldest constitutional democracy on the planet Earth that affirmed  ideals that put into the ether of Earth, for the first time, this  Constitution, talking about life, liberty, and the pursuit of  happiness. This healthcare bill involved such debate and discussion and  the Nation participated. Policy experts, market experts, medical  professionals, health nonprofits, insurers, hospitals, Americans all  got to put forward their input, their ideas. Sure, all of them were not  accepted, but everything went into the mix.   This should be shocking to the consciousness of all people of good  conscience who aren't reflexively partisan, but look at the history of  this country, a history that is proud, a history that should be  shameful about how things got done in matters of war and peace, in  matters of foreign policy and domestic, in matters like integration and  civil rights that made it possible for me to stand on the Senate floor.  There was a process, and somehow in the last 3\1/2\ years--in the name  of what? A vicious brand of partisanship that somehow undercuts not  just the voice of Democrats, not just the voice of policy experts, not  just the voice of hospital experts, not just the voice of medical  professionals--it doesn't just undercut their involvement in the  process, but it is an insult to the history and the traditions of this  body.   This was not the constitutional intent that something as important as  healthcare should be done in a back room where a small handful of  Senators are trying to hammer out amongst themselves a piece of  legislation that is going to affect tens of millions of Americans and  change our economy and change our communities. There is honor in this  place that isn't  [[Page S3604]]  on TV. There are good folks on both sides of the aisle. I have gotten  to know them. I consider folks my friends. I know their hearts. This  does not sit well the way this is being handled. I know it.   This is one of those moments of history that somebody just needs to  raise their hand and say: You know what. I might even like that bill  that comes out of that back room. I may like that bill that was  hammered out by 12 Republicans, but this process is wrong. It is an  insult to our history. I wouldn't want this done to me.   This is the moment. It is a test. History will look back and see what  this body did at this moment in history. I fear we are going to fail  the test.   What is even more painful than that, for me, is not just the sadness  or the anguish I feel about a body contorting its traditions, breaking  its way, what even hurts me more than that is what they are going to be  pushing through. We saw it in the House.   Instead of this body coming together--and literally there is  agreement on this. All of us believe the Affordable Care Act needs to  be improved. I have had it in conversations, formal and informal, that  we could build upon the Affordable Care Act. We could correct for its  deficiencies, and we could build upon its extraordinary successes.   I see those extraordinary successes in my State. I have Republicans  and Democrats who are now fearful about the consequences should a bill  like the House Republican healthcare bill be made law. There are folks  who fear for their families, fear for their children, who don't want to  go back to the Nation we had before, where the No. 1 reason for  bankruptcy was not being able to afford your medical bills, where  people with preexisting conditions were denied insurance, when mental  healthcare wasn't in parity with physical healthcare. I can go through  all the things I have seen make a huge difference in New Jersey in  communities, rural and urban, for Americans.   I want to highlight some of those right now, some of those questions  that people are asking at home about what happens if a bill like the  House bill becomes law, if they take that bill here in the Senate and  push it through, send it back to the House this bill that subverted  process, inclusion and debate and deliberation, and go to that process  called reconciliation. There are questions that are being asked.   Here is one: What happens to a mother who is pregnant with, say, her  second child who suddenly loses Medicaid coverage? Now, understand, a  very large percentage of the children born in the United States of  America are born covered by Medicaid, which we already see in this  House bill is being gutted, which is the biggest rollback in the safety  net in our country in my lifetime and more.   What happens to that mother who is pregnant with her second child and  loses her Medicaid coverage and her prenatal care? If she loses her  prenatal care along with it, what happens to that American citizen?  What happens to that baby?   Well, we know that according to the U.S. Department of Health and  Human Services, babies born to mothers who receive no prenatal care are  five times more likely to die than those whose mothers did receive  prenatal care. Tragically, women without prenatal care are three to  four times more likely to suffer maternal mortality--that means dying  in childbirth--than women with prenatal care, and these rates  significantly increase for women of color.   What happens to the tens of thousands of mothers who may lose access  to maternity services, and what happens to the already dismal infant  mortality rate and maternal mortality rates in our country if this plan  goes through? That is a legitimate question. The data is clear. You  restrict access to prenatal care, you endanger children, Americans, and  you endanger mothers.   Let's keep asking those questions. What happens to the healthcare  worker who works 60 hours a week taking care of others but loses their  own healthcare coverage and then is unable to afford getting screened  themselves, preventive screenings for cancer--let's say ovarian cancer.  What happens to them? We don't have to imagine what happens when  millions of Americans forgo preventive screenings. We have factual data  on what happens should access to those preventive screenings--like what  happened with the House healthcare bill--what would happen.   The American Cancer Society tells us clearly that inadequate health  coverage is a barrier to preventive care, early detection, and optimal  treatment. They find, for example, that patients with stage II  colorectal cancer who have it detected have higher survival rates. In  fact, they point out that people with stage II colorectal cancer with  adequate health insurance have better survival rates than people with  stage I colorectal cancer who have no health coverage. In other words,  the American Cancer Society shows that access leads to survival and  denial leads to higher rates of death.   A recent cancer study found that ``the number of Americans whose  cancers were diagnosed at the earliest stage when it was most likely to  be cured increased after ObamaCare went into effect, and more citizens  had access to health coverage.'' You take away the expanded coverage  that was founded through ObamaCare, you decrease preventive screenings,  you decrease early detention and, as indicated by the American Cancer  Society, death rates go up.   Another question, in general: What happens to cancer rates in America  when these gains are reversed? What happens when these gains are  reversed? What happens to the father of two who is diagnosed with a  rare cancer who can't afford the additional estimated $82,000? His  cancer treatment goes up if this bill, like the Republican House bill,  passes. That is what is estimated--$82,000 is what his cancer  treatments would go up. What happens when he can't afford that care,  when he is forced to choose between his family's home, for example, and  treating his cancer?   Well, this is what we know. These are the facts that from 2010 to  2016, personal bankruptcy filings have dropped close to 50 percent in  the United States of America. One of the collateral benefits of  ObamaCare is there was a 50-percent drop in personal bankruptcy  filings, with experts agreeing that the Affordable Care Act played an  important role in this significant decrease.   A group of economists has estimated that the House Republican bill  would cost the average enrollee more than $1,500 more per year than the  current system. This is despite the fact the surveys have found that  the majority of Americans have less than $1,000 in savings, with one  study finding that 63 percent of Americans don't have the savings to  cover a $500 emergency.   Remember what Senator Murphy showed? That is a bill that gives  massive tax cuts to the wealthiest of Americans, shifting the cost  burden so the average enrollee now under this bill is going to see a  $1,500-more-per-year payment when the average American doesn't have the  savings to cover about a $500 emergency.   Another question that folks are asking is, What happens to the family  whose child with a disability loses their access to home and support  services--the physical and speech therapy they receive through  Medicaid--if the Republican plan goes forward?   I was in a hospital today with such parents telling me about children  who--the only way they got the coverage was because of the expanded  Medicaid. Now what happens under the Republican plan? We know that  Medicaid is a critical lifeline for people and families with  disabilities, providing access to services such as rehabilitative  therapy to help children meet developmental goals.   One of the incredible young women, girls, I met today--because of  developmental therapy, she went from not being able to walk to now  continuing to do the things that her normal teenage peers and her twin  sister are able to do.   We know that today, 15 percent of kids are growing up with  developmental disabilities. In New Jersey, 1 in 41 children lives with  autism. But this plan that was passed in the House threatens to make it  more difficult for children with disabilities to receive the care they  need, to go to school, and to live healthy lives. Losing coverage could  mean the difference between a child with a disability achieving a  developmental milestone or falling further behind. Unfortunately, in  the Republican bill that passed the House,  [[Page S3605]]  that is exactly what will happen if it should become law.   If that bill passes, what will happen to older Americans who qualify  for Medicare but still need access to critical health services? We know  that insurance companies would likely be allowed to charge older  Americans much higher premiums under the Republican plan. Remember, it  used to be capped. The cost for older Americans used to be capped. It  is now being estimated that Americans between the ages 55 and 64 would  pay some of the highest increases. That increase would be $5,200 more  per year. Standard & Poor's actually estimated that premiums for a 64- year-old could increase by 30 percent under the Republican bill that  passed the House.   The Congressional Budget Office noted in their report on the House  Republican health care plan that ``although the agencies expect that  the legislation would increase the number of uninsured broadly, the  increase would be disproportionately large among older people with  lower incomes, particularly people between 50 and 64 years of age with  incomes of less than 200 percent of the Federal poverty level.'' Think  about that for a second. Executives of insurance companies, pharma  companies--the richest will get tax breaks into the hundreds of  thousands of dollars, but the poorest folks, the elderly in our  community, according to the CBO, would see their costs go up  considerably.   The New Jersey Hospital Association noted that ``under current law, a  64-year-old making $26,500 a year will pay an average of $1,700 in  annual premiums.'' Under the AHCA--the Republican plan in the House-- that same individual making just above minimum wage will pay, under  their plan, between $13,600 and $16,100 in premiums. That is the  increase for older Americans, working Americans. That is the increase.   We know that as more older Americans lose their health coverage and  in turn enter Medicare in worse health, our entire Medicare system is  made weaker and less solvent.   If this bill passes, what happens to older Americans who have already  spent their life savings in nursing homes? We know that right now for  elder Americans in nursing homes, Medicaid actually covers the cost of  two out of three of those individuals.   I will quote from a piece that ran just this past weekend in the New  York Times: ``Roughly one in three people now turning 65 will require  nursing home care at some point during his or her life.''   Over three-quarters of long stay nursing home residents will  eventually be covered by Medicaid.   Many American voters think Medicaid is only for low-income adults and  their children, for people who aren't ``like them.'' But Medicaid is  not somebody else's insurance; it is an insurance for all of our  mothers and fathers and eventually for ourselves.   I continue the quote:         Mr. Trump and the Republicans would lower spending on the       frailest and most vulnerable people in our healthcare system.       They would like most Americans to believe that these cuts       will not affect them, only their ``undeserving neighbors,''       but that hides the truth that draconian cuts to Medicaid       affect all of our families. They are a direct attack on our       elderly or disabled and are dangerous.    I want to wrap up with this concluding thought: We know right now  that we are at a turning point in our country, that the process that  has made this deliberative body known throughout the land, throughout  humanity--that this deliberative body is about to alter its tradition  and have a bill that affects tens of millions of Americans done and  crafted in a back room without public input and rushed to this floor.  That is what the process is right now.   As Martin Luther King said in a speech to the medical community for  human rights in 1966, ``Of all the forms of inequality, injustice in  health care is the most shocking and inhumane.''   This bill will perpetuate injustice in our Nation. It will further  the gulf between the haves and have-nots. But it does not just target  the vulnerable, the elderly, the poor; it targets all of us. It targets  our character as a country, our highest ideals, the very core of many,  if not all, of our States. The least of these. The least of these.   We cannot allow this legislation that will so hurt our country to be  crafted in darkness behind closed doors. It subverts a mighty tradition  of the world's most deliberative body to be rushed through and cause so  much damage to so many Americans and indeed the very soul of our  country.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cruz). The Senator from Indiana.                            ____________________
