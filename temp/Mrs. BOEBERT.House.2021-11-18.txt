 Madam Speaker, I thank my friend, the ranking member on  the Budget Committee, who has done an excellent job exposing these  terrible schemes to the American people this Congress.   Madam Speaker, America does not need and cannot afford this junk.  America doesn't need 80,000 new IRS agents snooping in our private  transactions. These are politically weaponized bureaucrat bullies that  we are looking to hire more of.   America cannot afford $1.5 trillion in new taxes, while Federal  bureaucrats haul off and spend $4.1 billion on electric bicycles.                                time  1100    Do they realize that this will use more fossil fuels, more petroleum  products, to create electric bicycles than conventional bicycles? I  don't think so. I think they have lost their ever-loving minds.   It includes $7.8 billion for environmental justice going toward woke  universities; $100 billion for amnesty workarounds, as our southern  border is completely invaded by nearly 2 million illegal aliens, many  of them criminal aliens. There is $55 billion for Green New Deal  policies and tax breaks so congressional Members from the Bronx can  afford a new Tesla.   Biden's broke back budget has another $330 billion to incentivize  workers to stay home. News flash to the party of wealthy cities and  wealthy elites: We have a worker shortage right now in America. We have  an inflation crisis. This will only make things worse, much worse, not  better.   But let me guess. When things do get worse, as they inevitably will,  we will need to reelect you-all's sorry selves so you can fix it,  right? No thanks. I will pass. I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on  this monstrosity of a spending bill.
