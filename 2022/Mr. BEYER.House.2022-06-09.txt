 Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise today to express my strong support for H.R.  2377, the Federal Extreme Risk Protection Order Act. Included in this  legislation, is the Extreme Risk Protection Order Act, which I have  been proud to co- lead for many years with my friend and colleague,  Congressman Carbajal.   Madam Speaker, April 16, 2007, 15 years ago, 32 Virginia Tech  students, in my home and Commonwealth, were killed by a young man who  was well-known to the community to have paranoid schizophrenia. He had  been hospitalized. He had been picked up by the police. He had been  banned from classes. There was every reason in the world for him to be  on the background checklist. Yet, he was able to buy the weapons  legally that killed those 32 kids.   In 2014, I had a long conversation with a friend who was deeply  depressed. He was having trouble getting out of bed, trouble finding a  psychiatrist who would treat him. I made some calls to try to find  somebody, and then didn't do anything but worry, and was stunned when  he got out of bed to go buy a gun and kill himself.   To this day, I so regret that I did not call his wife, and we went  together to the court to get him on the background checklist. We have  all lost too many friends. We all are grief-struck by the massacre of  children.   Red flag laws may not protect everyone, but it will save many lives  and it is a start.
