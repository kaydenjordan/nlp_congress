 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate McHenry  County College on their 50 years of service to our community and State.   Since April 1967, MCC administration, faculty, staff, and trustees  have demonstrated unparalleled commitment to their students through  quality degree and certificate programs.   Through the college, the community is provided a diverse and relevant  array of enrichment and lifelong learning opportunities; everything  from advanced manufacturing, engineering, and healthcare to fine arts,  the humanities, continuing education and training, and everything in  between.   I commend the college, led by President Dr. Clint Gabbard, for its  continued focus on student success, innovation, and contribution toward  the community's economic development.   True to its goal of student success, the college has been ranked  among the top 150 community colleges in the Nation and scores in fourth  place in the State for student success rates and affordability.   From visiting and hosting numerous congressional events at MCC, I am  always impressed by the extraordinary efforts and commitment of McHenry  County College faculty and staff.   Congratulations, McHenry County College, on your 50th anniversary.                            ____________________
