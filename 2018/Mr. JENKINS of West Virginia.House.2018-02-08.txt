 Mr. Speaker, West Virginia is literally  ground zero in the opioid epidemic. Our overdose rate is not just a  little bit higher than the national average of the No. 2 State. It is  actually 33 percent higher than the No. 2 State. So when we passed the  21st Century Cures legislation, dedicating $1 billion to fight this  horrific epidemic, it gave us hope; it gave me hope.   And that hope was particularly strong in rural States like West  Virginia, that finally we might see real resources where it really  counts, in rural  [[Page H1067]]  communities. But unfortunately, many of the worst-hit States like mine  ended up receiving only a minimal amount of funding.   Let me give you an example. A more populous State received five times  more funding than my State, but my State's overdose rate was five times  higher than the more populous State.   This bill, like every bill, has parts I like and parts I don't like.  One of the issues I have fought for is making sure the now $6 billion  we are putting towards fighting the opioid crisis will actually get to  the places where it matters most.   We must use a formula based on per capita statistics to ensure funds  go to the hardest hit States and smaller States where the crisis and  the need is the greatest.   As a member of the Appropriations Committee, and having a direct hand  on how the $6 billion will be targeted, I have been reassured that  rural States like mine will not be shortchanged and--we will work to  make sure the language in our funding bill makes it abundantly clear to  the Federal agencies that actually set the allocation formulas--we want  resources flowing to where they count most.   I want to thank Chairman Frelinghuysen and his predecessor Chairman  Rogers for their commitment and leadership to helping.
