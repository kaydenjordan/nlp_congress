 Mr. Speaker, this week, the USS Carl Vinson arrives in Da  Nang, Vietnam. This is the first visit of a U.S. aircraft carrier to  Vietnam in four decades, and obviously for a very different purpose.  Together, Vietnam and America are demonstrating the importance of open  sea lanes for commerce, security, and regional development.   Arriving aboard the USS Carl Vinson is a young officer named Tower  Cook. Tower is from Dallas, Texas, and the grandson of former U.S.  Senator John G. Tower of Texas. Senator Tower was elected to the Senate  in a 1961 special election and served the people of Texas for 24 years.  He led the implementation of President Reagan's strategy of a larger,  competitive, modern Navy, and it was an honor for me to work for him  the final 2 years of his term in office.   President Reagan and Senator Tower's vision of the importance of the  Navy is illustrated by this week's visit of the Carl Vinson to Vietnam.  Senator Tower, also a master chief petty officer, is looking down from  his heavenly perch with great pride in seeing his grandson, Tower Cook,  and the success of the United States Navy.                            ____________________
