 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1665, the  Building Blocks of STEM Act, which supports STEM education research  focused on early childhood education.   There is a lot of discussion about the gender disparity in the STEM  workforce and the leaky pipeline that widens the gap as women and girls  continue through school.   Although women make up half of the U.S. workforce, they make up less  than a quarter of those employed in STEM occupations.   The Building Blocks of STEM Act addresses these disparities by  ensuring an equitable distribution of STEM education research funding  for projects focused on young children and helping us  [[Page H7168]]  understand why girls are encouraged or discouraged from participating  in STEM activities.   It also ensures that the National Science Foundation grants are  awarded to entities that are working in partnership, such as research  universities with local education agencies, to increase participation  in computer science education.   Computer science is particularly struggling to recruit and retain  women, who make up less than 18 percent of the computer science  workforce. The number is trending down, not up.                                time  1415    This has a ripple effect on our country's ability to fill the high- skilled jobs of today and tomorrow. We need the next generation of  young women to pursue STEM degrees, and we are not seeing the numbers  we need.   It is critical that we continue to work on STEM opportunities for  middle-school-aged children and older, but we also need to ensure our  Federal resources start at the beginning and support research on STEM  education of younger students, starting at the beginning of their  educational career.   We know this all too well in Michigan. We know the structural and  cultural barriers that exist for women interested in STEM from a very  young age. Lack of support, unconscious or conscious gender bias, and  stereotype threats are just a few.   In several studies, when children were asked to draw a mathematician  or a scientist, girls were twice as likely to draw a man as they were a  woman, while boys almost universally drew men, often in a lab coat.   The science is clear that children who engage in scientific  activities from an early age, before middle school, develop positive  attitudes toward science and are more likely to pursue STEM experiences  and career opportunities later on.   We need to be working toward interventions to increase the number of  girls and women in these fields, and that is why I am so proud to  sponsor this bill.   I thank Chairwoman Johnson for her leadership on the House Science  Committee toward increasing STEM opportunities for women, particularly  for women of color.   I introduced this bipartisan legislation with my colleague,  Congressman  Jim Baird, along with our counterparts in the Senate,  Senators Jacky Rosen and Shelley Moore Capito. I urge my colleagues on  both sides of the aisle and in both Chambers of Congress to support  this bill and send this important legislation swiftly to the  President's desk.    Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to have been joined by my  colleagues to introduce H.R. 2397, the American Manufacturing  Leadership Act. I thank Chairwoman Johnson,  [[Page H7171]]  Ranking Member Lucas, Representatives Balderson and Gonzalez, and the  sponsors of the original Revitalize American Manufacturing Innovation  Act, Representatives Kennedy and Reed, for their partnership in leading  this legislation and for being such great champions for advanced  manufacturing.   Today is a great day. It is a great legislative day and a great day  for American manufacturing, for innovation, for our workforce, and for  the effective utilization of our Federal Government to advance, grow,  and compete.   Today, the American Manufacturing Leadership Act reauthorizes the  Manufacturing USA program through bipartisan support and the willpower  of our Federal Government.   What began in Youngstown, Ohio, as a pilot initiative, the vision of  a lab that would usher in 3D printing applications, workforce training  programs, and the transfer of new technologies across the country and  into the supply chain, is now one of the 14 institutes encompassing  various research concentrations. Those include Lightweight Innovations  for Tomorrow Institute located in Detroit; REMADE Institute in  Rochester, New York; Digital Manufacturing Institute in Chicago; and  PowerAmerica in North Carolina for battery technology.    This work is in my blood, and it is part of why I came to Congress.  It is also imperative for our role in global competition and for the  investment in industrial policy and strategy vis-a-vis sound economic  policy.   We will ensure that Manufacturing USA can continue to contribute to  the growth of our domestic advanced manufacturing base and an advanced  manufacturing workforce to fill the high-skilled jobs of the future.   AMLA authorizes agencies to renew their institutes for an additional  period of funding following a fair review of the institutes' progress.  It also strengthens the important partnership between Manufacturing USA  and the Manufacturing Extension Partnership program, as well as other  relevant programs across the Federal Government.   Finally, the bill authorizes funding to allow the National Institute  of Standards and Technology, NIST, and the Department of Energy to  continue funding their current institutes and stand up at least one  additional institute in fiscal year 2020 and each year thereafter.   The real strength of these institutes lies in the consortium model,  with the private partners contributing at least 50 percent of the  funding.   In 2017 alone, Manufacturing USA raised almost $180 million in  investments from the private sector from nearly 1,300 manufacturers,  universities, community colleges, government labs, and NGOs.   They are only able to do this because the Federal Government sets the  table and provides support in the planning, development, management,  and operation of each institute.   Manufacturing USA institutes provide critical U.S. global leadership  in advanced manufacturing.                                time  1430    The institutes serve as a unique collaborative platform for industry  and academia to engage in best-in-class expertise to solve challenges  and usher in new innovations.   The program is making, I believe, incredible strides in workforce  development for the future and existing workforce. For example, in  2017, the LIFT institute in Detroit reached over 160,000 students  across the country through innovative web-based curricula, as well as  in-person training programs. And the Manufacturing Institute in  Chicago, the digital manufacturing lab, has used a taxonomic approach  to codifying job roles specific to the changing nature of advanced  manufacturing brought on by the Internet of Things.   The United States will never be able to compete by bringing back the  manufacturing of yesterday. We can celebrate our milestones--50 years  since we landed on the Moon--as we usher in the innovations to improve  the lives and outcomes of our manufacturing base for the next 50 years.   The American Manufacturing Leadership Act has already been endorsed  by the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, the American  Society for Mechanical Engineers, the Bipartisan Policy Center, and the  American Association of Manufacturers.   To the small and midsized manufacturers, to the suppliers, to the  complex web of craftsmanship, to the future engineer, to the computer  programmer, to the student dreaming in Livonia, Michigan, about what  they are going to do, this one is for you.   I urge my colleagues to support this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3153, the  EFFORT Act.   The opioid epidemic is one of the deadliest public health emergencies  of our time, and it affects not just those addicted to opioids, but  everyone around them as well.   The numbers describing this epidemic are truly staggering. According  to the CDC, between 1999 and 2017, almost 400,000 Americans died from  an opioid-related overdose. These statistics have worsened over time,  with the CDC reporting that the number of Americans who died as the  result of an opioid-involved overdose in 2017 was six times higher than  the number who died in 1999.   My home State of Michigan has been hard-hit by this epidemic. Between  2016 and 2017, drug overdose deaths in Michigan increased by almost 14  percent, but it was not the only State suffering in this way.   In the same timeframe, 23 States, including Michigan, had a  significant increase in the rate of deaths from a drug overdose.   It is long past time that we invest in significant resources in  combating the opioid epidemic.   As chairwoman of the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee's  Subcommittee on Research and Technology, I have seen firsthand the  excellent work done by the National Science Foundation. Their previous  work on addiction and opioids have resulted in critical insights into  not only the psychological process of addiction, but the social impacts  of addiction as well.   Despite the progress made by the National Science Foundation, there  is no doubt that further work is essential to combat the opioid  epidemic.   H.R. 3153 will take advantage of the NSF's strength in basic research  across many disciplines, from neuroscience to social science, in  collaboration with the expertise of the National Institutes of Health  in public health.   The research authorized in this bill will allow us to develop a more  focused and effective policy to address the opioid epidemic.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to commend my colleagues, Representative  Wexton and Representative Baird, both of whom I have the privilege of  working with on the Science, Space, and Technology Committee, for their  excellent leadership on this bipartisan bill, and I urge all of my  colleagues to join us in passing it.
