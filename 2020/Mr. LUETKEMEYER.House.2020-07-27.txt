 Mr. Speaker, I was unable to be present for a  recorded vote on S. 2163, the Commission on the Social Status of Black  Men and Boys Act. Had I been present, I would have voted ``yea'' on  rollcall No. 167.      MEMBERS RECORDED PURSUANT TO HOUSE RESOLUTION 965, 116TH CONGRESS       Boyle, Brendan F.
