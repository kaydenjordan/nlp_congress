 Mr. Speaker, thank you for the opportunity to speak on  behalf of an incredible leader and a dedicated public servant, who we  lost yesterday.   Mark Lowery committed much of his life to serving Arkansans as an  elected official, educator, and journalist.   During his time as State representative for 10 years, he had Arkansas  youth and families top of mind. He brought significant reforms to the  education system and fought hard for fairness in elections. Most  recently, he was elected the Arkansas State treasurer. Although Mark  will be deeply missed, his legacy lives on.   My prayers are with Mark's family and friends as they navigate this  incredibly sad and difficult time. I offer them my sincere condolences.   My hope is that we can all find solace in knowing Arkansas is better  off because of Mark Lowery's dedicated work for the people of Arkansas.                            ____________________
