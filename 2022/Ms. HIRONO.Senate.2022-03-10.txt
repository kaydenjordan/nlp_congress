 Mr. President, I was listening very carefully to my  friend, my colleague from Texas, on his comments regarding the process  by which we give our advice and consent to all of our judicial  nominees, but, of course, particularly our responsibility with regard  to Supreme Court nominees.   There seems to be some concern that we are rushing the nomination  process for Judge Jackson. Nothing could be further from the truth  because everybody remembers the speed with which nominee Amy Coney  Barrett was put on the Court, from the time of her nomination to the  hearings, to her being sworn in.   There will be enough time for all of our Members of this body to  consider Judge Jackson's nomination, not to mention that we have  already confirmed her twice, once to the district court and another  time to the circuit court. It is not as though she is unfamiliar to us.   Also, any connotation that somehow President Trump's nominees were  ill-treated--again, nothing could be further from the truth because the  whole process, especially with regard to Justice Kavanaugh, was with  the utmost desire on the part, particularly, of the Democrats on the  Judiciary Committee to get to the bottom of certain allegations against  Justice Kavanaugh that were highly serious.   To cast any kind of doubt or aspersions on the work of the members of  the Committee--especially the Democrats on the Committee--with regard  to President Trump's nominees is not well-taken.                            ____________________     Mr. President, let me move onto why I am here this  afternoon. It is not an exaggeration to say that we are at a crisis  point. Republican legislatures all across the country are continuing to  pass bills that control our bodies and, at the same time, Trump Supreme  Court nominees are closer than ever to overturning Roe v. Wade.   There are 26 States across the country that are likely, if not  certain, to ban abortion if the Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade.  There is no question that these restrictions that have been enacted by  States all across the country have an incredibly discriminatory impact  and will disproportionately harm those who are already facing far more  obstacles when it comes to accessing healthcare, including women of  color, women with low incomes, people with disabilities, LGBTQ+  individuals, rural women, and many more.   For over 50 years, Roe v. Wade enabled women to make the decision  about whether or not they wanted to  [[Page S1086]]  start a family. But, today, because of new abortion care restrictions,  90 percent of counties in the United States do not have an abortion  provider. Women are faced with impossible decisions and, as a result,  will be forced to have babies they can't afford, didn't plan for, or  are unable to care for, or faced to have babies under life-threatening  conditions. And, tragically, women may also die because they lack the  access or resources to safely end pregnancy. Abortion bans are a matter  of life and death.   Women across the country are under attack and so, too, are the  healthcare professionals who provide safe and legal abortions. Today is  Abortion Provider Appreciation Day. This day was established to honor  Dr. David Gunn, who was killed on March 10, 1993, outside his abortion  clinic in Pensacola, FL, by a White supremacist, anti-abortion  extremist.   Abortion providers are compassionate, credentialed, and highly  trained professionals who allow women to actually make choices about  their own bodies, their futures, and whether or not they want to start  a family, and they do so without judgment and in the face of violence.   Tragically, Dr. Gunn's murder was just the first known instance of a  murder of an abortion provider. Across the country, abortion providers  experience intimidation, harassment, threats, and violence from anti- abortion extremists.   According to NARAL, between 1977 and 2015, there were over 7,200 acts  of violence carried out against abortion providers by anti-choice  extremists. These included 42 bombings, 185 arson attacks, and  thousands of death threats, bioterrorism threats, and assaults. Every  single day, even right here in DC, anti-choice extremists station  outside of abortion clinics and harass staff and patients.   Fourteen States and the District of Columbia have needed to enact  laws to protect abortion providers and patients, including laws that  prohibit blocking the entrance to a clinic, threatening or intimidating  staff, damaging property, and more. Three States have even had to go so  far as to establish a ``bubble zone'' to protect people within a  certain distance of a clinic. These doctors, nurses, and staff fear for  their lives just to provide access to reproductive care.   Being an abortion provider is a dangerous profession in this country.  What other medical profession deals with this level of harassment and  violence just to provide medical services, medical care? For what other  medical profession do we have to create a bubble zone of protection?   On Tuesday, I joined Senator Peters and my colleagues in the House to  introduce a resolution to honor all healthcare providers who keep  patients safe and healthy and do their part to help provide access to  reproductive care, including abortions.   Today, on Abortion Provider Appreciation Day, I stand on the Senate  floor to affirm my commitment to ensuring the personal safety of all  abortion providers and clinic staff. I thank these fearless individuals  for maintaining abortion access to communities across our country. A  big aloha and mahalo to these courageous people.   I yield the floor.
