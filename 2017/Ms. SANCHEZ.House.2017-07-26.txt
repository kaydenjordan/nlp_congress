 Mr. Speaker, after more than 6 months of failing to pass  any major legislative bills, House Republicans are becoming desperate  for a win. So desperate, they decided to sneak in $1.6 billion into a  funding bill to start construction on an unworkable wall along our  border. While I support real border security, this stunt is a far cry  from that.   I believe in investing our Federal dollars wisely. Instead of  building a medieval solution that will not work, why don't we use those  billions of dollars for a big, beautiful jobs package? Or big,  beautiful bridges, roads, and infrastructure throughout this country?  Or to ensure that our children can access higher education and job  training, healthcare, and housing?   Instead, my Republican colleagues are attempting to distract us from  their failures by passing this bill. You would think that with their  back against a wall, they wouldn't be this eager to start building  another one.                            ____________________
