 Mr. Speaker, let me just read from the Constitution.   Article I, Section 5: ``Each House shall be the judge of the  elections, returns and qualifications of its own Members, and a  majority of each shall constitute a quorum.''  [[Page H2026]]    You can't pass a bill on this floor with proxies and have it upheld  unless you change the Constitution, and this doesn't do it.   Now, some here say: But if it saves one life, it is worth it. How  about the million Americans who laid down their lives not for a wishy- washy, ``Oh, maybe we should be afraid. We might get something and  die.'' They didn't do that in the Spanish flu days. They didn't do it  in the Civil War. But now we are going to do it. Come on.   There were people that died, saying things like: ``Live free or  die.'' And now, we are going to amend the Constitution with a House  rule. That is ridiculous.   If you are going to destroy 40 million lives and livelihoods, at  least have the courage to come here and do it in person.   You didn't let the Member from Georgia do it years ago. You denied  that, and I felt like you were right. We have to preserve the  Constitution, not abuse it with a House rule.
