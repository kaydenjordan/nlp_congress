 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, it may have taken a while, but it looks  like  [[Page S1717]]  the White House may finally be coming to the debt ceiling negotiating  table in a more serious way.   The President has now appointed members of his staff to negotiate  directly with Speaker McCarthy's team--a logical and overdue step since  the passage of debt ceiling legislation depends on an agreement between  the President and the Republican-controlled House of Representatives.   I was also encouraged by the White House's statement after Tuesday's  debt ceiling meeting, which noted that the President is ``optimistic  that there is a path to a responsible, bipartisan budget agreement if  both sides negotiate in good faith and recognize that neither side will  get everything it wants.''   ``[A]nd recognize that neither side will get everything it wants''-- that part is very important because previously the Democrats' and the  President's position was that Democrats should get everything they want  and that Republicans should get nothing--an extremely unrealistic  position and one that suggested Democrats did not understand the nature  of divided government.   So I am grateful that the President seems to be taking a more  realistic view of what is necessary for an agreement. It is unfortunate  that it has taken the White House this long. Speaker McCarthy has been  ready to negotiate for months, and the President should have engaged  seriously months ago, but better late than never.   I hope that over the next few days, the two sides will be able to  swiftly reach an agreement. A good place to start would be with a good,  long look at the policies in the House Republicans' Limit, Save, Grow  Act, which pairs a debt ceiling increase with commonsense spending  reforms, things like reclaiming unspent COVID money; modestly  strengthening work requirements in Federal entitlement programs for  able-bodied Americans--a move, I might add, supported by more than 60  percent of the American public--in order to help individuals move from  welfare to work; capping discretionary spending for next year at the  fiscal year 2022 discretionary spending level--the same level we were  successfully operating at mere months ago; repealing the green energy  subsidies in the so-called Inflation Reduction Act, whose estimated  cost has ballooned since the bill was passed; passing permitting  reform--a bipartisan priority--to help get both conventional and green  energy projects off the ground more quickly, which could help grow our  economy; repealing the President's reckless student loan giveaway,  which could otherwise end up costing American taxpayers close to $1  trillion; and other commonsense measures.   The provisions of the Limit, Save, Grow Act have been the subject of  a lot of fearmongering from Democrats, who have been set against  including any spending reforms as part of a debt ceiling package, but  these are responsible ideas worthy of consideration as part of a debt  ceiling agreement or, for that matter, in any other context.   Our Nation has a massive national debt--$31 trillion and counting-- and a serious spending problem, and the Limit, Save, Grow Act is a  reasonable and responsible attempt to get our Nation back on a more  fiscally sustainable path, saving on the order of $4.5 trillion over  the next 10 years.   While, as the President pointed out, neither side will get everything  it wants in negotiations, I hope ideas from the Limit, Save, Grow Act  will make it into a final debt ceiling agreement.   Despite the President's attempts to claim the mantle of fiscal  responsibility, the truth is that spending under the Biden  administration has reached staggering levels compared to prepandemic  Federal budgets, and if we don't get spending under control, we are  going to be facing some very serious economic consequences.   So, as I said, I am pleased that the President seems to be taking  negotiations a little more seriously. I hope he will not allow himself  to be distracted by extreme members of his own party, like the  individuals who are suggesting that the President attempt to raise the  debt ceiling on his own, using a dubious interpretation of the 14th  Amendment, if Democrats don't like the debt ceiling agreement.   Debt ceiling increases have a long history of being paired with  deficit reduction measures or other budgetary policy changes. In fact,  7 of the last 10 debt ceiling increases have been accompanied by  budgetary reforms and policy changes.   It is time for all members of the Democratic Party to recognize what  the President appears now to be recognizing, and that is that in  divided government, both parties have to compromise to reach an  agreement, so credit to the President for acknowledging this fact. I  hope--I hope--that over the next few days, we will see a deal emerge  that not only raises the debt ceiling but also puts us on a more  sustainable fiscal path moving forward.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator  from Iowa (Ms. Ernst), the Senator from Kansas (Mr. Moran), and the  Senator from Florida (Mr. Rubio).   Further, if present and voting: the Senator from Florida (Mr. Rubio)  would have voted ``no.''   The result was announced--yeas 49, nays 47, as follows:                        [Rollcall Vote No. 132 Ex.]                                  YEAS--49       Baldwin      Bennet      Blumenthal      Booker      Brown      Cantwell      Cardin      Carper      Casey      Coons      Cortez Masto      Duckworth      Durbin      Feinstein      Fetterman      Gillibrand      Hassan      Heinrich      Hickenlooper      Hirono      Kaine      Kelly      King      Klobuchar      Lujan      Markey      Menendez      Merkley      Murphy      Murray      Ossoff      Padilla      Peters      Reed      Rosen      Schatz      Schumer      Shaheen      Sinema      Smith      Stabenow      Tester      Van Hollen      Warner      Warnock      Warren      Welch      Whitehouse      Wyden                                  NAYS--47       Barrasso      Blackburn      Boozman      Braun      Britt      Budd      Capito      Cassidy      Collins      Cornyn      Cotton      Cramer      Crapo      Cruz      Daines      Fischer      Graham      Grassley      Hagerty      Hawley      Hoeven      Hyde-Smith      Johnson      Kennedy      Lankford      Lee      Lummis      Manchin      Marshall      McConnell      Mullin      Murkowski      Paul      Ricketts      Risch      Romney      Rounds      Schmitt      Scott (FL)      Scott (SC)      Sullivan      Thune      Tillis      Tuberville      Vance      Wicker      Young                               NOT VOTING--4       Ernst      Moran      Rubio      Sanders   The nomination was confirmed.    Mr. President, today I recognize Abigail Johnson,  an intern in my Washington, DC, office, for all of the hard work she  has done for me, my staff, and the State of South Dakota over the past  several months.   Abigail is a graduate of Roosevelt High School in Sioux Falls, SD.
