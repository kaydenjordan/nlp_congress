 Mr. Speaker, for far too long, Long Islanders have paid  much more in taxes to both Washington and Albany than we have received  back in investments.   Published recently, the Long Island Regional Planning Council's 2023  Balance of Payments comparison highlights this disparity--a Long  Island-D.C. deficit of $26 billion; and a Long Island-New York State  deficit of $15 billion.   Mr. Speaker, addressing this injustice where Long Islanders subsidize  Albany's and Washington's bloated spending is vitally important to my  constituents.   To right this wrong, Albany lawmakers must implement judicious  spending cuts and reduce income taxes, while at the same time providing  proper investments in Long Island's infrastructure and schools.   Here in Washington, Congress must increase the State and local tax  deduction cap. By increasing the cap, Congress can make a substantial  impact on lowering the cost for all New Yorkers.   The collaboration between State and Federal entities on these  comprehensive measures is crucial for securing a brighter and more  prosperous future for Long Islanders.
