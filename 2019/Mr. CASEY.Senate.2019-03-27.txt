 Mr. President, I rise to talk about an issue that I know  is on the minds of many, many Americans, especially folks who are in  the middle class or who are struggling to get to the middle class, and  that is the issue of childcare.   I think most of us in this Chamber agree that all children born in  this country have a light inside of them. For some children, that light  will shine very brightly without a lot of help as they have innate  abilities or they have circumstances they are born into for which they  don't need a lot of help from public policy or from programs or from  legislation. Yet there are a lot of children who have a light inside of  them that can burn to the full measure of its potential if we do our  job. When I say ``our job,'' I mean the job of elected officials. I  think it is the job of every elected official at every level of  government and of those who work with them to do everything they can to  make sure that the light inside of every child burns as brightly as at  least the full measure of his or her potential.   We know, just by way of one example in the context of childcare, that  affordable, high-quality childcare enables parents to work so they can  support their families. Also, quality, affordable healthcare helps give  children the early learning experiences they need to develop and  succeed in school. When children learn more and it is early in life,  they will earn more much later in their lives. That connection between  learning and earning isn't just a rhyme; all the research shows that  there is a direct connection. When that child learns at a younger age  because of early education and quality childcare and so many other  strategies, we are all better off. Not only is that child better off in  his or her family, but we are all better off. We will have a higher  skilled workforce; we will have a more productive workforce; and we  will grow and be able to out-compete any country in the world if we  invest in early learning.   Unfortunately, we know the challenges. The cost of childcare has  increased by 25 percent in just the last decade, which has created  significant  [[Page S2032]]  financial strains for those same middle-class families. According to  data from Child Care Aware, which is in my home Commonwealth of  Pennsylvania, the average cost of full-time, center-based childcare is  about $11,560 for an infant and about $8,712 for a 4-year-old. This is  about 12 percent of a married couple's annual income in Pennsylvania,  and it is nearly 46 percent of a single parent's annual income--46  percent. That is not sustainable. That is not a number that anyone  should be satisfied with. Frankly, I am not sure that 12 percent of the  annual income for a two-parent family is sustainable. We should get  that number into the single digits. The bill I will talk about in a  moment seeks to do that.   Just this past week, when we were all back in our States and were  able to travel for the better part of a week, I had the chance to get  to six childcare centers in cities across Pennsylvania, and I spoke to  more than 25 families who shared their stories about their struggles.  The struggle, of course, in this case, was the struggle to afford high- quality childcare.   I was in Philadelphia, Pottstown, Gettysburg, Verona, Erie, and  Reading. If you had charted those cities on a map, you would have  literally gone from the furthest corner of the southeastern part of our  State, which is Philadelphia, to the most remote, northwestern corner  of the State, in Erie. I went to communities below Erie and to the  northeast as well--so literally every corner of the State. Across those  communities, we heard a lot of the same challenges, a lot of similar  stories.   For example, one single mom in Philadelphia told us recently what, I  think, is emblematic of what is happening in a lot of communities:         I struggle every day to make ends meet. I am not eligible       for any public assistance, so I juggle my bills just to make       ends meet. I have to become very creative in making sure that       I pay my mortgage, utilities, and childcare.    Then she goes on from there to write:         Then I decide if I can pay for anything in addition to       that, such as healthcare, food, necessities for my child or       my home. I knew I would not be able to afford childcare.       Luckily, I have the support of loved ones in my life who       support me when I fall short. Most do not have this.    Then this single mother goes on to write the following:         All of my family and friends struggle to pay for childcare       because we are middle class individuals who make too much       money to qualify for childcare assistance or any other       programs, but we also don't make enough money to actually       afford childcare out of pocket. Oftentimes, we have to choose       a childcare based off of a price and not based off of the       quality of education they will provide our children at the       childcare facility.    Notice what she wrote at the end there. She is making a decision  about the childcare she will provide for her children based off only  one consideration--the price. It is not based on the quality.    Therein lies the problem that we have to try to solve. If we have  millions and millions of families--middle class or who are struggling  to get to the middle class--making childcare determinations based  solely on the cost, we will all be in trouble over time. That is not  what we should be doing. It doesn't mean the price will not be a  challenge for so many, and it doesn't mean the price will be  irrelevant, but if they are not able to find quality childcare that is  affordable, that child will be worse off over time; that community will  be; and the rest of us will be. We will not have the high-skilled  workforce that we need. We will not be able to compete and win the  battle across the world that we need to win, and that is the battle to  create the highest skilled workforce in the world and to maintain that  advantage.   When I was in Gettysburg this past week, I heard from two parents who  had adopted two children, one of whom has significant medical issues  and has been in and out of the hospital. They have struggled to find a  childcare center that is able to handle the behavioral and  developmental needs of their children. The father, who is a small  business owner, has had to make adjustments to his work schedule and  sell off some of his business assets to make ends meet. He has had to  choose between paying for his own health insurance or that of his  children. He has had to give up his own insurance to ensure there will  never be a lapse in coverage for his children. He makes too much money  to qualify for childcare subsidies but lives with constant anxiety over  his financial situation.   Part of his testimony and that of his wife was very emotional because  of the stress and the pressure on that family--the stress and pressure  of the healthcare itself and also of the stress and pressure because of  the cost of childcare.   I was grateful he was willing to share his story. In a public  setting, it is not easy to talk about the burdens that you live with  every day in order to push a policy forward so as to make life better  for another family. Like a lot of these parents, I was grateful they  were willing to help us better understand those struggles so that we  could better propose good policy.   We also heard from a single mom who works long hours as she tries to  advance and work her way up the corporate ladder. Prior to her current  circumstance, she was waitressing and barely making $11,000 a year.  When she was hardly making any income, she was able to make ends meet  with the assistance of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program  and CCIS, which is our State's childcare program that helps families.  Now she is in a different circumstance. She works full time--an  achievement that she is quite proud of. She is no longer eligible,  though, for these programs because her income has gone up.   The good news is her income went up, and she has a full-time job. The  bad news is that it knocks her out of eligibility. She must pay the  full cost of childcare and be away from her children. She doesn't know  what she will do during the summer as she will need to increase the  time her children are in care, which will result in higher costs when  her children are on summer break. So that is the dilemma she faces-- working harder and getting a full-time job but then not being able to  afford help. She needs help from us as well.   I spoke with a mother in Verona, PA, in Allegheny County, who has an  11-month-old child who is in childcare now. Though both she and her  husband work full time, they struggle to afford care. They would like  to grow their family, but, again, the cost of childcare is their main  reason for not doing so. We know that childcare helps children grow and  learn, that it helps parents work and provide for their families, and  that it helps employers retain a productive workforce. Yet families  across the country are unable to afford care. That is why it is so  important that we increase Federal investments in early learning and  childcare.   For example, in fiscal year 2018, the Childcare and Development Block  Grant program was funded at $5.27 billion here in Washington. That was  an 83-percent increase--the largest single increase in the history of  the program. In that same year--the last budget year, the last  appropriations year--Head Start received a little more than $9.8  billion, and that was $610 million more than the program got in 2017.   Both of those were good results. It doesn't happen every day in  Washington, we know. These historic, bipartisan investments were  continued in the last fiscal year. So there was an increase in this  last fiscal year. It was nowhere near the increase of the prior year,  but there were extra dollars to sustain funding. These investments are  already making an impact in States like Pennsylvania and across our  country, but there is so much more unmet need and so much more work to  be done. So it is good news on the block grants, but, of course, that  is not the whole story on childcare.   I am pushing for both increased funding for the next fiscal year--the  one we are working on now, 2020--as well as two bills that will make  high-quality childcare accessible and affordable for low- and middle- income families. The first is the Childcare for Working Families Act,  and the second is the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit Enhancement  Act. I will discuss them in that order.   The Childcare for Working Families Act would first provide direct  financial assistance to working parents to help pay for childcare and  early learning to ensure that no parents would pay more than 7 percent  of their household incomes for childcare if they earn less than 150  percent of the State's median income.   These numbers change between median household income and median  [[Page S2033]]  family income, but if you are just looking at the median household  income in Pennsylvania, it is about $57,000. If you do 150 percent of  that, you will be into the eighties, roughly. We don't know where the  line would be drawn for certain State by State, but if we can come up  with a way to keep costs below 7 percent for folks who are in that  income range--say, roughly, in the low eighties down--we can help these  families do two things: go to work while providing childcare for their  children that is quality childcare and also be able to afford it.   The second part of the bill--and it is, basically, three parts--will  be universal access to high-quality preschool programs for 3- and 4- year-olds.   The third part would be to improve workforce compensation by ensuring  that all childcare workers are paid a living wage and that early  childhood educators are provided parity with elementary schoolteachers  who have similar credentials and experience. So there are three parts  to that bill--childcare help, early learning help with preschool, and  paying the workforce more.   People in both parties say it all the time: We care about our  children, and we care about our seniors. But sometimes the folks who  provide care to both groups of Americans--those who provide care and  early learning to children and those who provide skilled care in  nursing homes and other settings to seniors--are among the lowest paid  workers in our society. So we say we prioritize those Americans, and we  don't lift them up with the kind of workforce that they sometimes need.   The second bill I will talk about--and then I will wrap up--I will  soon reintroduce with Congressman Davis. It is a proposal to improve  and expand an existing tax credit which we know as the child and  dependent care tax credit, not to be confused with the child tax  credit, the tax credit you may have eligibility for if you have a  child. This one focuses on child care and dependent care.   This bill would help families pay for childcare expenses by doing the  following: first, increasing the maximum amount of the credit from just  over 1,000 bucks--about $1,050--to $3,000 per child, and it could go up  as high as 6,000 if you have more than one child, making the full tax  credit available to most working families with incomes up to $120,000 a  year.   Now, under the current law, that credit starts to lose its value once  you hit only $15,000 of income--not that high of an income level. By  raising that number, you are going to get a lot more middle-class  families that will benefit, as well as some trying to get to the middle  class.   The third part of the bill would ensure that lower income families  are better able to benefit from the credit by making it fully  refundable.   You have this strange dynamic where folks are working and they have  an income, but the income is rather limited and the credit is not  refundable. So they don't get anything back from that credit. So it  isn't worth much to them in many cases.   The last part of the bill will retain the value over time by indexing  the benefits of this child and dependent care tax credit and raise  those thresholds based upon inflation.   In conclusion, I think it is pretty simple. All children deserve the  chance to learn and succeed, regardless of where they are born or  regardless of their family's income. That is why it is so important to  make sure that all families have access to high-quality, affordable  childcare and early learning. Together, these proposals will help to  bring us closer to that reality and, I would argue, closer to meeting  our obligation as elected officials at every level of government--this  being the Federal level in the Congress, the Senate and the House,  meeting our obligation to make sure that the light inside of every  child burns to the full measure and shines to the full measure of its  potential.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
