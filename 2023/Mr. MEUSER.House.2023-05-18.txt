 Mr. Speaker, as we celebrate National Police Week, we  honor and thank the brave men and women of law enforcement. Just this  week we passed the POLICE Act, and I proudly supported it.   Public safety is the most important factor to a high quality of life  and perhaps the number one function of government, but, sadly, we have  seen a rise in anti-law enforcement rhetoric and violence.   Already this year, 135 officers have been shot in the line of duty, a  more than 50 percent increase from this time in 2020. This should be  agonizing to all Americans.   As well we must, as elected officials, always show respect for the  work and authority of the police. If we don't, portions of the public  will not, and weakening the thin blue line is dangerous to police  officers and to society as a whole.   To all those who put on the uniform every day, we say thank you to  America's finest. As your Representative in Congress and the son of a  former police detective, know that I will always back the blue.                            ____________________
