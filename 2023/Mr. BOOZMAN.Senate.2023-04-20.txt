 Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of National  Rendering Day.   As ranking member of the Senate Agriculture Committee and a voice for  Arkansas farmers and ranchers, I have seen firsthand their dedication  to producing the most affordable, abundant, and safe supply of food in  the world. That responsibility extends beyond the farm, with rendering  playing a critical role in ensuring we can meet the growing global  demand for food, feed, and fuel.   U.S. renderers contribute $10 billion in annual economic activity.  These include many small businesses which are the backbones of our  economy. Utilizing innovative technologies and a highly skilled  workforce, renderers reclaim otherwise wasted animal material such as  protein, bone, and fat, as well as used cooking oil from restaurants.   For hundreds of years, renderers have been upcycling the unused  materials into higher-value applications including pet food, biofuels,  soaps, gels, and candles in addition to fertilizer. By reducing the  amount of waste sent to landfills, rendering makes our food production  footprint smaller and helps minimize the environmental impacts of  animal agriculture and food production.   In Arkansas, there are many successful rendering companies, and I am  grateful for the jobs they create and their proficiency in generating  useful products for consumers. We celebrate the inaugural National  Rendering Day on April 21 and recognize the countless contributions of  the industry to protecting the environment, delivering sustainable  solutions, and growing the economy. I am pleased to join this special  acknowledgment to help bring awareness to reducing and eliminating food  waste through rendering and promote rendered products as a sustainable  choice for our planet.                            ____________________
