 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend  their remarks and include extraneous material on the subject of this  Special Order.    Madam Speaker, during my Special Order  tonight, my colleagues and I will address the inaction by the Biden  administration and House Democrats to address this major crisis that we  see on our southern border, this humanitarian crisis. And, yes, that is  the right word. It is a crisis by any objective measure.   We are also going to address tonight the President's so-called  infrastructure plan. That is a lot for us to talk about. So we will  squeeze it into this hour.   When President Biden was inaugurated, the American people will  remember, Madam Speaker, that he called for unity. He promised to work  across the aisle, to work with Republicans in Congress. But so far  those words have been completely empty promises.   Everyone can acknowledge and everyone can see on television that  there is a real crisis at the southern border,  [[Page H2042]]  and it is a crisis of the administration's creation.   President Biden has stopped construction of the border wall. He  reimplemented the catch-and-release policy of the Obama administration.  He reversed the remain in Mexico policy of the Trump administration.  And he selectively is enforcing immigration laws.   The results are not surprising. Our Border Patrol is now completely  overwhelmed, and the southwest border encounters have reached a 15-year  high. I want you to look at these numbers, Madam Speaker. This is the  border crisis. The first column here is January of this year. We had  78,323 southwest border encounters. The next month, in February, it  goes up to 100,441. Last month, in March, it was 171,700. This is a  crisis. We all know the numbers for April are going to be staggering.   I know that there are Members on both sides of the aisle here--I know  there are Members, our Democrat colleagues, who want to join us to take  action to fix this. But we can't do it without the administration.   Look, here are five simple steps that we can take that would help end  the border crisis:   Number one, finish the wall;   Number two, reinstate the remain in Mexico policy;   Number three, turn away high-risk individuals at our border. These  are dangerous folks, some of them, coming across, and we know that.   Number four, require negative COVID tests before releasing migrants,  illegal immigrants, into the U.S.;   Number five, let's send a clear message to the whole world to  discourage illegal immigration.   What a concept. These aren't difficult things. The Trump  administration had it all figured out, but now politics has gotten in  the way of good policy.   In addition to finally solving the border crisis, there is another  item in the news that Americans desperately want us to address, and  that is the need for an infrastructure package. That could be a  bipartisan solution that we could all work on together. It should be  nonpartisan, but because it impacts every single congressional district  in every State, all of us, every American, wants this to happen.   But the plan that the White House introduced isn't really about  infrastructure at all. In fact, only 6 percent of the $2.5 trillion  proposal would go towards bridges, highways, and roads. The rest goes  to fund Democrat Big Government priorities, like the Green New Deal,  and payoffs to liberal special interest groups. What an outrage.   The facts are that the House majority is the slimmest of any House  majority since World War II, and the Senate is divided 50/50. Given  these facts, we just want our Democratic colleagues and President Biden  to end this partisan agenda for the sake of the American people.   I look forward, Madam Speaker, to hearing from my Republican  colleagues tonight about both of these issues.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr.  Grothman), who represents the Sixth Congressional District of  Wisconsin.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  Wisconsin for that dire warning. I guess if you subscribe to modern  monetary theory, none of this is a concern, but it is for those of us  who live in the real world.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Fallon), who  represents the Fourth Congressional District of Texas.    I thank the gentleman from Texas.   We came here to drain the swamp, but it is really difficult during  the current administration. We will get back to it soon, though, I am  confident of that.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Latta), who  represents the Fifth District.    I thank my friend for that compelling  eyewitness account. Anyone who is looking at the evidence cannot deny  this is a problem.   I would like to yield to the gentlewoman from Arizona (Mrs. Lesko).  Being from a border State, she knows a whole lot about this.    I thank the gentlewoman for that passion.  She is right, she has been there, and she sees it herself.   I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Nehls), who represents the  22nd Congressional District and will bring another border State  perspective. He also knows a lot about law enforcement.    I am so grateful for those comments and for  the gentleman's expertise. This passion that you see, Madam Speaker, is  deserved. We are so concerned that the President doesn't share it, and  that is what you are hearing echoed over and over tonight.    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Taylor), who  represents the Third District.    I thank the gentleman for that perspective  from Texas again. So we've got Texas and Arizona. Madam Speaker, we are  going to move a little further west, all the way west to California.   I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. Garcia), who represents  the 25th District there.    I thank the gentleman for that compelling  testimony from a first-generation American. That is meaningful. We  prize immigration, the legal kind. We believe in the rule of law, and  that is what maintains order.   I yield to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Cawthorn), the  youngest Member of Congress, but he is wise beyond his years.    Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Cawthorn for  that perspective.   Madam Speaker, I will move briskly because we have a lot of Members,  as you can see, who are passionate about these issues and want to weigh  in tonight.   I yield to the gentleman from the First District of the great State  of Alabama (Mr. Carl), who will take the podium here.    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman  from North Carolina (Ms. Foxx).    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from  North Carolina for her remarks, and we do call out the administration.  That is what this Special Order is all about.   I yield to the gentleman from Tennessee's Second District (Mr.  Burchett).    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  Tennessee for those bold words, and he is right. I think that expresses  the sentiment of a lot of Americans.   I yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Gimenez), who knows a lot  about immigration as well as infrastructure because he is a former fire  chief and mayor and now a Member of Congress.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  speaking with such authority.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania's Ninth  District (Mr. Meuser).    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  mentioning just one of the many Republican ideas we have. And as he  said, we are not there at the table.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Tennessee's Sixth  District (Mr. Rose).    Madam Speaker, it is a con job, indeed.   Madam Speaker, may I inquire how much time I have remaining.    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman  from Michigan's First District (Mr. Bergman), who is the highest ranked  military officer ever elected to the United States Congress and also my  dear friend and classmate.    Madam Speaker, I thank the general. I  appreciate that so much.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Baird),  Fourth District, another American hero, another hero of mine, a  gentleman who sacrificially served his country and deserves to speak  here tonight and has great insight for us.    Madam Speaker, I thank my friend. It is so  sad that broadband needs are not being met because politics are in the  way.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Carter).    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman so  much for that.   Madam Speaker, I am delighted to go back across the country again to  the great State of California's Eighth District. I yield to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Obernolte).    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  that California perspective.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.  Thompson), the Republican leader of the House Agriculture Committee.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman. That  went so well, I think we will stay in the State of Pennsylvania, going  to the 12th District.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.  Keller).    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman. And  he has indeed been in Washington too long.   Madam Speaker, there is a common denominator tonight. The crisis at  the border and the problems with the infrastructure package were both  entirely created by the Biden administration.   They were both thus completely avoidable, completely predictable, and  they have done and are doing an extraordinary disservice and real  damage to the American people.   We ask, again, of all of our Democrat colleagues and President Biden  and his administration, please, please, for the sake of our country,  put the partisanship aside. Let's govern with common sense, let's fix  these problems before they become so great that we are unable to do so.   Madam Speaker, we end the Special Order, and I yield back the balance  of my time.                            ____________________
