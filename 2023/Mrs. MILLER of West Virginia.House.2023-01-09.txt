 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the  Family and Small Business Taxpayer Protection Act.   The last 2 years under Democrat rule have resulted in terrible  policies and more unnecessary taxes for the American people. Americans  have been feeling the weight of destructive policies since their first  day in power, and now it is time for our Republican majority to fix  this mess.   The pressure on American taxpayers has continued to increase since  the passage of the so-called Inflation Reduction Act when they gave $80  billion of new funding for the IRS to hire the 87,000 new agents to  needlessly audit families and small businesses that are forced to fund  the out-of-control spending and misguided Green New Deal priorities.   How do more audits and scrutiny from the IRS benefit hardworking  Americans? Liberals in Congress chose to target American taxpayers by  supercharging the IRS, which solely focuses on auditing the hardworking  Americans who already pay more than their fair share. This is  unacceptable and must be reversed.   Through the Inflation Reduction Act, Democrats used the tools of the  IRS as a means to increase reckless spending.
