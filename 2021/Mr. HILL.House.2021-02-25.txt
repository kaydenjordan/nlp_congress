 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Texas for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, tonight I rise in celebration of Black History Month. I  rise in honor of the memory of Daisy Bates, a native Arkansan and civil  rights hero.   Daisy Bates was born in south Arkansas in 1914 and moved to Little  Rock in 1942. Active in the NAACP, Daisy and her husband, L.C., started  the Arkansas State Press, a weekly newspaper, which they used to call  attention to racial injustices.   In the face of violent threats, Mrs. Bates courageously led the  movement to desegregate Little Rock Central High School, recruiting and  mentoring the Little Rock Nine.   Daisy Gatson Bates became an icon in the fight to end segregation in  the Jim Crow South. She was the only woman to speak at the 1963 March  on Washington, led by Dr. Martin Luther King.   Daisy Bates is a hero to Arkansans and Americans, and I am proud to  honor her legacy today, and I look forward to her statue joining the  pantheon of American leaders highlighted in the U.S. Capitol.                 NATO States Are Not Paying Their Fair Share     Mr. Speaker, on a cold Tuesday in January, an irritated  President met with his National Security Council. During the meeting,  the President was outspoken, and complained, We cannot continue to pay  for the military protection of Europe while the NATO states are not  paying their fair share and living off the fat of the land. We have  been very generous to Europe, and now it is time for us to look out for  ourselves.   Mr. Speaker, that quote urging Europeans to pay their fair share in  their own defense by way of their responsibility to the North Atlantic  Treaty Organization was not made by President Trump, it was not made by  President Obama, or even George W. Bush. Mr. Speaker, that irritated  President was John F. Kennedy.   We are now nearly 60 years after that meeting, and 30 years following  the reunification of Germany and the collapse of the USSR. Yet, the  debate continues.  [[Page H704]]    Recently, NATO held a 2-day video conference with the theme of  increasing NATO's funding for our core deterrence and defense  activities. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg told the assembled  allies that spending more together would demonstrate the strength of  our commitment to Article 5, our promise to each other. And it would  contribute to fairer burden sharing. Sound familiar?   When then-candidate Donald Trump became President, only three of the  then 28 countries were spending the agreed upon guideline figure of 2  percent of gross domestic product on defense.                                time  1845    With President Trump's urging, today, 7 countries out of the now 30  NATO allies are meeting this important benchmark. The United States is  joined by its longtime allies, Great Britain and Greece. Yet the only  other countries meeting the benchmark are countries that know well the  risk of Soviet--and now Russian--threats or threats from external  forces of terror. These are the formerly enslaved countries from behind  the Iron Curtain: Bulgaria, Estonia, Poland, Latvia, Lithuania, and  Romania. As Americans, we salute their partnership, and we share in  their renewed sense of freedom.   Mr. Speaker, as we in the legislative branch of this government meet  and confer with our parliamentary counterparts, as well as foreign  ministers and finance ministers from our NATO allies, let us urge  cooperation with our promise to defend each other, but, more  importantly, urge the rapid adoption to achieve that fairer burden  sharing, a goal so long ago argued for by President Kennedy.
