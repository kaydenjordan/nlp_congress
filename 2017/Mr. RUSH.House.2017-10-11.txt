 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 190, the Power and Security  Systems, or PASS, Act.   Mr. Speaker, this bill would provide a noncontroversial technical fix  to a Department of Energy efficiency standard, and it has widespread  bipartisan support.   I would also like to acknowledge my colleagues, Mr. Welch from  Vermont, Mr. Brooks from Alabama, as well as Senator Gardner and  Senator Cantwell, for their work in sponsoring this bill and getting it  to the floor here today.   Mr. Speaker, this legislation would simply amend the Energy Policy  and Conservation Act to require the Department of Energy to issue a  rule by July 1, 2021, which would determine whether energy conservation  standards for external power supplies should be amended.   The rule must contain any amendment standards and would apply to  products manufactured on or after July 1, 2023.   Mr. Speaker, current law exempts external power supplies for security  or life safety systems from energy conservation standards until July 1,  2017. This bill simply extends that exemption to July 1, 2023.   Mr. Speaker, this clarification is necessary in order to exclude  power supply circuits, drivers, and devices that are designed to power  security alarms, lifesaving devices, and surveillance systems.   Mr. Speaker, as I stated, this legislative fix has widespread support  from both houses of Congress, from both sides of the aisle, as well as  from industry and the energy efficiency community.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this valuable  piece of legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 920, the National Clinical Care  Commission Act.   Mr. Speaker, this legislation aims to help improve Federal efforts to  treat and to prevent metabolic and autoimmune disorders related to  insulin.   The most common metabolic disorder in the U.S. is diabetes, which  affects more than 25 million Americans. Another 86 million Americans  have prediabetes, a condition associated with an increased risk of  developing type 2 diabetes and heart disease.   Mr. Speaker, diabetes takes a huge toll on human health; in fact, it  is the seventh leading cause of death in our Nation.   Additionally, Mr. Speaker, all too often diabetes leads to avoidable  complications, such as blindness, such as limb amputation, and also  kidney failure.   In addition to the effects on human health, Mr. Speaker, diabetes  care makes up a large percentage of U.S. healthcare expenditure.   Mr. Speaker, currently $1 of every $5 of healthcare cost is spent  caring for people with diabetes. The proportion of Medicare funding is  even greater than this. Currently, $1 of every $3 of Medicare  expenditure is spent caring for people with diabetes.                                time  1500    Mr. Speaker, that is why it is important to improve the Federal  efforts that prevent avoidable cases of diabetes and other metabolic  disorders, and to ensure that all Americans have the treatment and the  management services necessary to successfully manage this and other  similar conditions.   Mr. Speaker, this legislation was previously passed in the 114th  Congress and again at the beginning of the 115th Congress. I am pleased  to see that the Senate took action on this legislation to support  passage of this bill into law.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on S. 920, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Iowa (Mr. Loebsack).    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
