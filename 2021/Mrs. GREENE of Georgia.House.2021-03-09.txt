 Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition of  gun control bills.   I rise today in support of our Second Amendment, the greatest freedom  that we have as Americans, and a right that people all over the world  wish that they had.   The Second Amendment reads: ``A well-regulated militia, being  necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to  keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.''   H.R. 8 and H.R. 1446, both gun control bills, infringe on the  people's right to keep and bear arms. We must stand up and stop the  constant flow of gun control bills that constantly come out of this  House. The American people have these freedoms for a very good purpose.   You see, the right to defend oneself is something that should never  require us to be on a list. It should never require us to pay a tax. It  should never require us to wait to be able to purchase a firearm to  defend ourselves. It should never require rules or shame or  condemnation from another American.   Right now, we are in a time where people are being shamed just for  being a gun owner. Our government is constantly pursuing legal gun  owners and making them out to be the bad guy.  [[Page H1128]]    Take, for example, in Atlanta, Georgia, my home State, just this past  weekend at the NBA All-Star game, there were 13 shootings. These were  all illegal shootings. None of those criminals signed up for a  background check for their guns. None of those criminals considered  that they needed a waiting period before they used their firearm. And  none of those criminals cared about any of the laws on the books when  they shot people.   Criminals don't care about gun laws. Criminals just don't care.  They're going to commit their crime. They are going to murder someone,  whether they have a legal gun, an illegal gun, a knife, a hammer, you  name it. They are criminals. They break the law.   H.R. 8 requires a background check on gun owners. Everyone knows that  for a background check, you have to submit all your information to get  that background check done. It is actually nothing but a national gun  registry list. And everyone knows that a registry list leads to gun  confiscation later on. This is what gun owners know. This is what gun  owners fear of a government that may become too tyrannical, which I  would like to remind you is the whole reason why we have the Second  Amendment in the first place. It is because our brave men and women who  founded our country fought against a tyrannical government that was  coming to take away their guns.   This is not what we want in America. We never want a war on our land,  but we also don't want a government that becomes too controlling and  overbearing and takes away the rights of gun owners.                                time  1030    You see, gun rights are American rights, and gun rights are women's  rights. Yesterday was International Women's Day. It is a wonderful  thing to be an American woman. We are the freest women in the world.  For us to be able to have the right to own a firearm and protect  ourselves when someone is trying to hurt us is a great right.   Madam Speaker, there is a woman named Carol Bowne, who was stabbed to  death outside of her New Jersey home by her ex-boyfriend. Carol knew  her best chance of defending herself from a violent ex-boyfriend was a  gun, not a piece of paper, not a 911 call. She knew her ex-boyfriend  was violent and wanted to kill her, so she went to buy a gun.   But you know what? It was a background check, the rules of the State,  the oppressive gun rules of that State, that led to her being stabbed  to death because it delayed her ability to buy a gun and defend herself  from an ex-boyfriend that was out of his mind.   Carol Bowne had a restraining order. She was following the law  against her boyfriend, so she had a restraining order. She had reported  him to the police, but he still came to her house and killed her in the  driveway. She was waiting for her approval of her gun permit-- literally, what we are talking about with H.R. 8, background checks,  and H.R. 1446, a 20-day waiting period.   She was following the law, and she still got stabbed to death and  murdered by her ex-boyfriend. You see, she had gone to the township  police department 2 days before her death to check on the status of her  languishing application.   Another indication of her fear of her out-of-his-mind ex-boyfriend,  she had installed surveillance cameras around her home. Guess what?  Those cameras recorded----    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to  call up H.R. 682, the Reopen Schools Act, to get our kids out from  behind screens and back in the classroom.    Madam Speaker, I would like to remind my  Democrat colleagues across the aisle that I am from the State of  Georgia, where, proudly, we are open. My son has been going in person  to school this entire school year. As a matter of fact, he played  football, where they had practices and games and parents got to attend  and sit in the stadium.   Children being kept home from school is about the worst thing that  [[Page H1172]]  you can possibly do. If you really want to do anything to help  Americans, reopen the schools, reopen America, and stop wasting more  American tax dollars.   It is a complete lie to the American taxpayers that you are going to  save the day with your $1.9 trillion spending bill, and you think you  are going to save children. If you want to save children, reopen the  schools.   The Biden administration is fine with having 100 percent open schools  at the border for children who are coming into our country.   Why are our children being forced to stay home in blue States and,  many places, for no reason when their parents pay the taxes?   The best way to save America is reopen.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to Democrat  gun control bills far and wide.   I would like to tell you about a gun law in Georgia: In order to  provide for the emergency management of the city, and further, in order  to provide for and protect the safety, security and general welfare of  the city and its inhabitants, every head of household residing in the  city limits is required to maintain a firearm, together with  ammunition.                                time  2145    Mr. Speaker, that is Kennesaw, Georgia, where, over 6 years, there  has only been one murder and a violent crime rate of 2 percent.  [[Page H1184]]    Would you like to know why? It is because every single criminal knows  that if they are going to attack someone in Kennesaw, Georgia, they are  going to go across a gun owner, and it is the law that every household  and homeowner owns a gun and keeps one in their household.   You see, guns are not scary. The fact that we may not have guns is  scary. Guns are a great form of protection. It is an equalizer to a  criminal who could care less about all the gun laws that Democrats want  to pass on Americans, infringing on their Second Amendment rights.   H.R. 8 and H.R. 1446 are just more gun control legislation violating  Americans' great right to bear arms. I rise in opposition to both of  these bills, and I hope that the Democrats will come to their senses  and figure out that gun rights are American rights.
