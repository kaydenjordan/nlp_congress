 Mr. Speaker, I rise to oppose this perverse,  illegitimate effort to do Donald Trump's political dirty work.   This resolution is nothing more than an extreme political stunt built  on absolutely zero evidence of wrongdoing. The one thing it does prove  is that Republicans are focused on the wrong priorities. This  resolution clearly has nothing to do with protecting the Constitution  from high crimes and misdemeanors.   How do we know? Because a year of investigation, piles of documents,  and a herd of the Republicans' own witnesses confirm there is zero  evidence of wrongdoing. Instead, the Republicans' wasteful witch hunt  just confirms that President Biden is a good and honorable man.   What this resolution really does is cover up a full year of do- nothing Republican policies that ignored our families' needs and  neglected an array of global threats to democracy.   Worse, this resolution tries to obscure the corrupt and criminal acts  of the former President and want-to-be dictator Donald Trump.   This extreme political stunt is built upon the sick, twisted  extremism of House Republicans and totally unmasks their complete  absence of an agenda that helps the American people.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on this resolution.
