 Madam Speaker, I would like to take a moment to discuss  [[Page H4258]]  the devastating drought affecting Utah this year.   Ninety percent of the West is experiencing extreme drought  conditions. This includes every county in the great State of Utah-- already one of the driest States in the Union.   Drought impacts lives and livelihoods. One of the Juab County farmers  in my district runs a farm that has been in his family for three  generations. This year, his farm has yielded zero output because of the  drought. Unfortunately, his story is not unique.   Aquifers are not recharging, springs are dry, wells are pumping  harder than ever before, and farmers are facing increased power costs.  This means fewer crops and fewer dollars in the pockets of our rural  farmers. On top of that, Utah's drought conditions make devastating  wildfires more likely and harder to fight.   Each one of us has an important role to play in conserving resources  and adapting for the near future and beyond. Utahn livelihoods and  generational family farms are at stake, and I stand ready to assist  local leaders and our State's Federal delegation to ensure the safety  and prosperity of every Utahn.   I call upon the Biden administration to step up their efforts on the  interagency working group that is supposed to be addressing these  severe conditions.                            ____________________
