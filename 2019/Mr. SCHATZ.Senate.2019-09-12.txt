 Mr. President, it is not a rhetorical flourish to say  that Senate Republicans are being fully obedient to the President of  the United States. The evidence of the last few days has confirmed that  Republicans are not standing up for American institutions when they are  tested, and they will not defend the American people when it counts the  most. Through their silence, through their legislative actions, and  through their votes, Republicans are allowing funds appropriated to the  Department of Defense--funds that address critical military needs in  their own home States--to be stolen in order to pay for the President's  wall.   Let me explain. The way we do MILCON, military construction, is  nonpartisan. It is not bipartisan; it is nonpartisan. That means there  is zero politics involved in selecting military construction projects  for funding.   The process goes like this: The base commanders decide what projects  they need in order to support their missions and military communities.  These projects are set up through the chain of command from the base  command to the installation command. If the installation command says  the project meets the cut and is important enough for military  readiness, it is sent to the Service Chief, the Marine Corps  Commandant, the Secretary of the Navy, and so on.   From there, each Service Chief decides what projects to present to  the Office of the Secretary of Defense, and then the Office of the  Secretary of Defense racks and stacks these projects. It is a rigorous  process, and not a single Member of the U.S. Senate gets to intervene  during this process. They figure out which ones get addressed in the  fiscal year, and some projects make the cut and others don't. The only  thing we get to decide, once the matrix is sent to us, is how much  money we have to deal with all of our military construction needs.  Again, there is zero political involvement--no politicians, no side  deals, no partisan uniforms. So by the time the Congress receives the  final list of projects from DOD, every project has been thoroughly  vetted. We recognize that at that point, every project is essential for  the safety and security of the Nation, and every Secretary of Defense,  every Secretary of the Army, every Secretary of the Navy, and so on  looks us in the eye in the Senate Armed Services Committee and in the  Defense Appropriations Subcommittee and says: This is essential. There  is not a penny out of place. We need this, and we need this badly.   Shame on the Republicans for allowing this argument over whether to  build a border wall to do two things; first, to infect the institution  of the Department of Defense with politics and to start to undermine  the credibility of the Department and its interactions with the  legislative branch; second, and very importantly, to diminish funding  for critical military projects.   What kind of projects are we talking about? There are 127 projects  that are being raided that we funded. We enacted a law, the President  declared an emergency, and the Republicans upheld that emergency. Now  these projects are being defunded.   Let me give you a couple of examples out of these 127. This is the  form that comes in. These are the words of the Department of Defense.   The first project, Fort Bragg, NC, ``Butler Elementary School  Replacement.'' There is a section that is called ``IMPACT IF NOT  PROVIDED.'' In other words, this is what happens if we don't provide  this funding. This is what the Department of Defense says:         The continued use of deficient, inadequate, and undersized       facilities that do not accommodate the current student       population will continue to impair the overall educational       program for students. If a new facility is not provided, the       substandard environment will continue to hamper the       educational process and the school will not be able to       support the curriculum and provide for a safe facility.    Let me take this example of the Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort,  Laurel Bay, SC. The impact if funding is not provided:         [Fire and emergency service] personnel assigned to Laurel       Bay will continue to work from a significantly undersized and       unsafe facility. Because the structure does not meet seismic       requirements, complete structural collapse is probable during       a seismic event, causing death or major injury to emergency       personnel, and thus preventing timely response to the [Marine       Corps] housing community following the event.    Finally, and this is going to be 3 out of 127 projects rated: Fort  Greely, AK, ``Missile Field #1 Expansion.'' These are the ground-based  interceptors designed to enhance our missile defense in the case of an  attack from North Korea, ``IMPACT IF NOT PROVIDED.'' This one is  succinct and scary:         Planned enhancements and capabilities of the BMDS to meet       emerging threats will not  [[Page S5464]]       be available for our Nation's homeland defense.    Those are 3 out of 127 projects.   I just want to ask my Republican colleagues: Where do you draw the  line? I understand you can't stand up to the President every time or  even most of the time, but my goodness, when they take funding from  military families, from bases and installations, from missile defense,  from military schools, can't you draw the line there? There has to be a  point at which you say enough is enough. There has to be a point when  you decide that agreeing with the President under any and all  circumstances--and in this case, the most extreme of circumstances--is  not how you are going to lead and govern on behalf of your home State.   Let me say this in closing: I still hold out hope for a bipartisan  solution to this issue. Democrats and Republicans may have very  different goals, and we have different ideas about how to reach them,  but there has to be a better way forward than raiding military funds  for the wall. If there is anything that can bring the Senate together,  it should be ensuring the safety, security, and well-being of our  Nation's servicemembers and their families.   I yield the floor.
