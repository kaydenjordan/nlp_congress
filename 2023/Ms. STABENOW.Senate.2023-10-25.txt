 Mr. President, I rise today to speak about rural  communities like my hometown of Clare, MI. It was a great place to grow  up. My dad and my grandpa ran the local Oldsmobile dealership on Main  Street, and my mom was director of nursing at the local hospital, and  my relatives were dairy farmers.   And I saw how hard they worked every single day, rarely taking a day  off. In fact, on Thanksgiving or Christmas, they were not there most of  the time. They had to run back and milk the cows. So I so appreciated  how hard they worked. I had many jobs growing up, but my first real job  was at the local Dairy Phil, where I learned the art of filling a cone  with soft-serve ice cream.   It wasn't a big town. It still isn't. But there was a real sense of  community there. People shopped at local businesses, attended local  events, cheered for the local high school sports teams, and rallied  around local families when they needed help.   Places like Clare still exist, of course. In fact, in August, I was  there to celebrate the Dairy Phil's 70th anniversary. But small towns  and rural communities have seen a lot of changes over the years, and  not all of them have been good. When I graduated from high school in  1968, about 1 in 4 people lived in rural communities. Today, only 1 in  7 call rural America home. There are fewer people and a lot fewer  farms.   Among other things, trade wars started by the Trump administration  helped fuel this consolidation, causing dramatic drops in crop prices  and billions in ad hoc inequitable Federal trade assistance payments.  As people have left and as our economy has changed, many smalltown Main  Streets have a lot more empty storefronts. Other towns have lost their  schools, and more than 190 rural hospitals have closed since 2005.   Our small towns and rural communities are under a lot of pressure,  and that is something that we all should care about. These communities  are important. They are a crucial part of the fabric of our Nation. And  I am so proud of the investments we have made over the last few years  to strengthen that fabric.   We invested in healthcare and rural hospitals during the pandemic. In  the American Rescue Plan, we invested in telehealth to bring healthcare  providers to people where they were when they needed healthcare. In  fact, telehealth visits by people in rural areas skyrocketed from 9,000  visits in 2019 to more than 830,000 visits in 2020. We invested in  keeping critical rural hospitals open, like where my mom worked as a  nurse.   We also know that healthcare above the neck is as important as  healthcare below the neck. Farmers and ranchers have always been a  stoic group, more likely to tough it out than to talk about it. That  can make anxiety and depression and other mental health issues worse.  In fact, farming is one of the occupations with the highest risk of  suicide today.   We took big steps towards getting folks the help they needed by  investing in our bipartisan certified community behavioral health  clinics. I so appreciate the Presiding Officer's support in that.   There are now more than 500 of these clinics operating across the  country, many of them in rural communities. It is the largest  investment in behavioral healthcare in our Nation's history.   Our rural communities have also been pummeled by the climate that is  changing right before their eyes. Last year, our country saw 18  separate billion-dollar disasters--18--costing 474 Americans their  lives and over $175 billion in damages. This year, we have already seen  24 separate billion-dollar disasters so far. But it doesn't take a  billion-dollar disaster to destroy a family farm. Think about the  cherry farmer who loses an entire crop when warm weather causes the  trees to bloom early only to be wiped out in a cold snap a few weeks  later. Or a wheat farmer whose hard work is leveled when a violent  summer storm pummels her fields with hail. Or a family who  [[Page S5173]]  have to slaughter their entire population of turkeys when their farm is  struck by avian flu.   Farming has always been a tough way to make a living. With the  climate crisis, it is getting even tougher. That is why it is so  important that we invested almost $20 billion in new funding for  voluntary conservation programs to support our farmers and ranchers as  they work to mitigate their risks from violent, unpredictable weather  events and as they lead in our country's efforts to tackle the climate  crisis.   During the COVID-19 pandemic, we also learned how important high- speed internet is. All of a sudden, the lack of good internet  connection meant our kids couldn't make it to class--maybe they would  sit in the parking lot of a fast-food restaurant to try to get Wi-Fi.  And folks couldn't see a doctor.   It proved the point that I have been making for years that high-speed  internet is infrastructure. And I am so proud we came together in a  bipartisan way to address this.   In our bipartisan infrastructure law, we invested $65 billion to help  ensure that all Americans, whether they live in a big city or 30 miles  from the closest highway--have access to high-speed internet.   We also remember how hard it was to get basic food staples when  supply chains broke down during the pandemic. It was even harder in  small towns and rural communities. That is why we invested in  strengthening food supply chains that build connections between local  farmers, communities, and businesses.   Small and regional processing operations also bring jobs back into  the community instead of shipping them off to large, consolidated  centers hundreds of miles away.   Our food systems should be at the heart of our communities. This is  about how we get local products from local farmers and producers onto  local tables.   It is also important to note that when we invest in rural America, we  are not just investing in the families who live there--which is  important to do, of course--but we are investing in all of us because  each and every one of us depends on our farmers and local communities.   Why am I saying all this? First of all, we have multiple needs in  small towns and rural communities. We have spent the last 2\1/2\  years--and I want to thank the Biden administration for investing in so  many ways to support our small towns and rural communities. They need  it. They need our support.   But right now, we have the opportunity and responsibility to come  together to build on those investments, those things that relate to  quality of life and economic opportunity. And that is called the farm  bill. The farm bill is our next opportunity to truly revitalize rural  America.   I am committed to passing a strong, bipartisan farm bill as soon as  possible. This is actually the sixth one that I have been involved in.  It is the sixth farm bill that is coming to Congress and the third one  that I have been leading.   You know, our committee is unique. We don't just sit at a raised dais  facing witnesses. Instead, we sit around a table, much like families do  after a long day of work, and we face each other.   That is part of our bipartisan tradition. To get a farm bill done, it  needs to be bipartisan. It must pull together the broad coalition of  support that has been the cornerstone of this process for decades.  Since Ranking Member Boozman and I started working on a bipartisan farm  bill in April of 2022, the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition,  and Forestry and its subcommittees have held more than 20 hearings.  There has also been countless farm bill listening sessions around the  country.   I appreciate so much the community input and the bipartisan work of  our committee Members. The success of a farm bill is always based on  finding bipartisan solutions to the problems we need to address and  bipartisan ways to address funding priorities. In this farm bill, that  means protecting our critically needed conservation funding for our  farmers, and it means keeping nutrition funding in the nutrition title  for our families.   Having said that, I have committed to finding ways to bring  additional resources to meet other needs in the farm bill that are so  important to producers.   I am very grateful that Leader Schumer is committed to find several  billion dollars in additional resources through bipartisan offsets  outside the farm bill to help us achieve that goal.   I have to tell you, it is almost unheard of, because I remember not  that long ago when the Senate leadership was telling us to cut--cut-- $23 billion from the farm bill. So I am grateful for this unified  commitment to get this done.   There are a lot of people counting on us to get this done. More than  21 million Americans depend on the food and agriculture industry for  their jobs.   In Michigan, that is one out of four people that are in agriculture  and the food industry. Another 4.6 million Americans work in the  growing biobased manufacturing industry that I think is so exciting.   But the farm bill isn't just about jobs. It isn't just about our  economy. The farm bill has three goals in my mind: We want to keep  farmers farming; we want to keep families fed; and we want to keep  rural communities strong and build on the investments that we have done  in the last 2\1/2\ years.   The farm bill is the foundation of the farm safety net. During our  oversight hearings this year, every single group representing farmers  told us that protecting and strengthening crop insurance was their No.  1 priority. They asked for more options to make it more affordable, and  I support that.   Crop insurance covers over 130 different crops, large and small, and  it is continuing to expand to more crops and regions.   Coming from Michigan where we grow more than 300 different crops, I  am proud that I have been known as the specialty crop champion. During  my time in the Senate, I have led efforts to expand crop insurance  protection, especially for my State's fruit and vegetable growers. I am  continuing to work on ways to expand crop insurance for specialty crops  and other farmers.   Time and time again, from small producers in Michigan to national  groups like the American Farm Bureau, we all hear from farmers across  the country that we must protect and enhance crop insurance. I agree.  It is the number one risk management tool for farmers.   It can be tailored and evolve to meet the individual needs of  farmers. Most importantly, farmers will see the benefits of any changes  that we make to crop insurance immediately. Any changes we make to  reference prices in the commodity title, for instance, will not have  any impact until the fall of 2025, at the earliest. This is why I am  currently exploring a proposal that would make crop insurance premiums  more affordable on area-based crop insurance plans. No mandates--just  new options to support our producers.   The Agricultural Risk Coverage and Price Loss Coverage programs are  very important to many of our farmers as well, and we built a solid  base in improving those programs in the 2018 Farm Bill.   There is good news here. In 2022, farmers recorded the highest farm  income in history, and 2023 is projected to be the seventh highest in  the last 21 years.   But we know that farmers have also experienced a lot of challenges  and that not everyone has benefited from the recent high prices.   We know input costs have been rising. And though the costs of diesel  fuel and fertilizer are declining, we need to ensure farmers have  effective tools to address their costs so they can keep farming.   Fortunately, USDA is using its authority to help farmers long-term by  supporting the development of lower cost, American-made fertilizer and  implementing innovative fertilizer technologies. This will create more  jobs, provide more choices for farmers, and make us less reliant on  foreign supplies of fertilizer.   In many ways, the farm bill already helps farmers address higher  input costs.   The dairy safety net is structured around the difference between the  cost of feed and the price of milk. Crop insurance can also expand and  adjust to provide similar policies for a broader group of farmers.   There is other good news. In the 2018 farm bill, we were able to  improve the PLC program by including what was  [[Page S5174]]  called an escalator--an escalator provision that is projected to  increase reference prices for most commodities--there are 20  commodities in that commodity title--and most will see a 10 to 15  percent increase by this 2025 crop year under existing law without any  changes. So because of this escalator, we are going to see reference  prices for many commodities increase by 10 percent to 15 percent by  2025.   I can't claim any credit for this provision. It was a bipartisan idea  championed by the former House Republican chairman, Mike Conway, of  Texas.   But I know it is important to find other ways to include ARC and PLC  for the 22 crops that benefit from this program as well. As we do so, I  believe it is important to find the best ways to help all of our  farmers, both beginning farmers who are crucial for our future as well  as medium- and large-established operations.   But we can't lose sight of the fact that the farm safety net extends  far beyond title I, the commodity title, and title XI, the crop  insurance title. The ``farm'' does not need to be put back into the  farm bill; it is on every page. The farm safety net is support for  research. It is access to affordable credit and loans. It is specialty  crop block grants and dairy and sugar programs and disaster assistance  and trade. It is protecting the health of our livestock, and it is  voluntary conservation programs.   I strongly believe--and I know I have colleagues on both sides of the  aisle who agree--that conservation programs are a vital part of risk  management for our farmers today. As I said earlier, you don't need to  explain to a farmer what the climate crisis is. They see it in their  orchards and their pastures and their fields every day. Farmers want to  make their operations more resilient in the face of the climate crisis.  They want to build healthier soil by keeping carbon in the ground. That  is why we are seeing record demand for popular voluntary conservation  programs that we have passed, and the good news is we now have more  funding to meet their needs.   The farm safety net is also about building markets, and we have  received some great news on that front. This week, Secretary Vilsack  announced $2.3 billion in investments from the Commodity Credit  Corporation to invest in trade promotion, markets. That is what our  farmers are saying are the top two things: crop insurance and markets.  They want to be able to trade. So Secretary Vilsack has announced $2.3  billion to invest in trade promotion and important in-kind  international food assistance. It is so critical. This will support  American farmers and help people in need around the world.   I very much appreciate Secretary Vilsack's responding to my request,  the request I sent with Senator Boozman. I very much appreciate that he  responded and said yes to what Senator Boozman and I had asked.  Secretary Vilsack's continued commitment to meet the needs of our  agricultural community, as well as his partnership with us to get a  bipartisan farm bill done, is so important.   This new CCC funding doubles the amount available for trade promotion  for the next 5 years. We never see that, and we are able to do that  now. It also creates an opportunity to spread the money out more evenly  over 10 years. This would allow us to grow permanent baseline funding  for trade promotion programs in this farm bill and in every subsequent  farm bill--something that has not happened since 2006.   Our farmers are looking to sell their products across the ocean, but  they are also looking to sell their products across the country, across  the State, and across the street. When our growers can get their apples  on lunch trays at the local elementary school or sell tomatoes to their  neighbors at the Saturday morning farmers' market, that puts money in  their pockets and keeps our local economy going.   Farm bill trade promotion programs, international food assistance,  bioeconomy programs, local foods programs--all of these increase market  opportunities for our Nation's farmers to be successful. And we all  want farmers to be successful, not just those who are already doing  well but those who are new or who are struggling. That is why I am  laser-focused on ensuring that the farm bill includes targeted support  for beginning farmers, for our organic farmers, and for our BIPOC  farmers and urban growers.   While the farm bill is the backbone of the farm safety net, its  nutrition programs are the backbone of the family safety net. So we  want to make sure that we keep farmers farming, but we want to make  sure that we keep families fed as well. I believe that no parent should  have to worry about whether or not their child is going to be able to  eat, and no American senior should have to go hungry because their food  budget simply won't stretch far enough. It would be unconscionable to  further cut the modest assistance of $6 a day that helps millions of  Americans put food on the table and make ends meet.    I also reject the premise that we must choose between supporting  farmers and supporting families. The needs of farmers and families are  interconnected. Farmers benefit when families can afford to buy the  food they produce, and the economy benefits as well. In fact, every  dollar in SNAP--every dollar in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance  Program--generates $1.50 in economic activity. Someone is buying food.  They are going to the grocery store. It is the farmers, the  transportation; it is the grocery store. It is one of the quickest ways  to create economic opportunity.   Just like the farm safety net, these nutrition programs expand during  times of need and contract during times of plenty. We have already seen  participation in SNAP decline as the country continues to recover from  the COVID-19 pandemic--just like the program is designed to do.   Nutrition assistance is also much more than SNAP. It is what we call  Double Up Food Bucks, which started in Michigan, with the idea of being  able to support families in going to the local farmers' market and  buying fresh fruits and vegetables that are more expensive by giving  double the value of their SNAP dollar. This has been so successful that  we are now expanding it to grocery stores, and it is widely successful  across the country.   This is also about the wonderful work of our local food banks. It is  getting fresh local foods to children in school. It is ensuring that  those same children aren't going hungry in the summer or when school  isn't in session.   I am extremely proud that, in December, Senator Boozman and I led the  successful effort to establish the first permanent investment in child  nutrition in over a decade, which will provide summer meals to 29  million children--29 million children--every summer, and it is  providing support for farmers' markets, which strengthen connections  between growers and the communities they feed.   So our goal: Keep farmers farming; keep families fed; and then,  finally, keep rural communities strong.   A strong farm safety net and a strong family safety net build strong  small towns. Every American, no matter where they live, deserves a  great quality of life and the chance to be successful. That is why we  have put money into high-speed internet. That is why we have supported  rural hospitals. That is why we have supported telehealth. That is why,  in the last 2\1/2\ years, we have invested in rural communities.   The truth is, we need strong small towns. We need thriving rural  communities. We need young folks to go off to college and want to come  home, work on the farm, start a small business, and raise their  families in the communities where they grew up. We need small towns to  have strong schools and quality healthcare, high-speed internet, and  vibrant Main Streets. We need the Dairy Phil in Clare, where I worked,  to teach young people the art of creating the perfect soft-serve ice  cream cone and so many other life lessons. We need them to do that for  another 70 years.   Getting the farm bill done won't be easy--it never is--but I am  committed to doing so. Unfortunately, it looks like this is going to  take a little longer than I would like, but it would be irresponsible  to allow vital programs and the farm safety net to lapse and revert to  Depression-era policy in January. We cannot allow that to happen. And,  given the chaos in the House, I know we will need an extension.   But let's be clear: It would be equally irresponsible to take our  focus off of a 5-year farm bill that provides stability  [[Page S5175]]  and certainty for our farmers and communities. I am laser-focused on  delivering a bipartisan farm bill that keeps farmers farming, families  fed, and rural communities strong and on getting it done in the coming  months. It is critical that we give rural America and agriculture the  certainty of a 5-year farm bill.   The unifying principle behind the farm bill is that it is a safety  net for farmers and families. When crops fail or when disaster strikes,  the farm safety net steps in to provide stability and security. When a  pandemic hits or the economy takes a turn for the worse, it is the  family safety net that steps in. The farm bill is designed to--and it  must--support both.   Senator Boozman and I have a strong working relationship, and we have  already accomplished so much together. I know that we can come together  with colleagues on both sides of the aisle and agree on a bipartisan  farm bill that addresses the important needs of agriculture and rural  America. Together, and with the bedrock support of the broad farm bill  coalition, everyone, from farmers to climate to nutrition advocates--we  can get this done. Communities, farmers, and families are counting on  us.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I rise today to salute the people of  Michigan past and present who have served in our Armed Forces and to  honor their families.   There are few actions as selfless as serving in our military. When  our Nation called, these brave Michiganders stood up. They were willing  to be sent anywhere--at any time--in order to protect our Nation, our  people, and our values. Some of them never came home. Others came home,  but were never quite the same. And many continue to serve their  communities long after their military commitment is fulfilled: a U.S.  Marine veteran from Holland who walks across the State each year to  raise awareness of mental health issues and to highlight organizations  that serve veterans; an Air Force veteran in Mid-Michigan who shares  her own painful story about trying to fit in to help support other  historically excluded veterans; an Upper Peninsula veteran who has  spent decades coaching and mentoring young people through youth sports.   These veterans have our backs. It is crucial that we have theirs,  too. That is why I was so pleased when President Biden signed the  bipartisan PACT Act into law last year. This law helps ensure that  veterans who were exposed to Agent Orange, burn pits, and other toxic  substances during their service receive the healthcare and benefits  they have earned.   One year later, the Department of Veterans Affairs has received more  than 780,000 disability claims under the PACT Act and approved more  than 348,000. And more than 111,000 veterans have enrolled in VA  healthcare, including nearly 10,000 in Michigan. These 10,000 Michigan  veterans served honorably and bravely. Sadly, they have paid a price  for that service. And just as they were there for us in our Nation's  time of need, now we can be with them in theirs.   Whether it is healthcare, education, a chance at a good job, or  military recognition, veterans should not stand at the back of the line  for anything. That is what my dad--a World War II veteran--taught me,  and I have spent my time in public service ensuring that we keep our  promises to our veterans. The PACT Act is one more promise kept.   On this Veterans Day and every day, I salute everyone who has served  in our military and their families. I thank them for their service,  their sacrifice, and their deep dedication to our Nation. Every day,  they show us what patriotism is all about.                            ____________________     Madam President, I would ask unanimous consent that  John Schmidt, a detailee in my office, be granted floor privileges  until December 31 of this year.
