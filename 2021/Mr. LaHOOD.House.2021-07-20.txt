 Mr. Speaker, I thank Dr. Burgess for yielding and Dr.  Wenstrup for leading this effort.  [[Page H3712]]    If the previous question is defeated, we will amend the rule to  immediately consider S. 1867, the COVID-19 Origin Act of 2021. This  legislation, which passed the Senate by unanimous consent, is simple.  If passed, the bill would require the Biden administration's Director  of National Intelligence to declassify intelligence information related  to any potential links between the Wuhan Institute of Virology, also  known as the Wuhan lab, and the origins of COVID-19 in order to better  prepare for and avoid future pandemics.   Let's remember the devastating effect that this pandemic has had in  this country with over 600,000 deaths and 4 million deaths worldwide.   In May, Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee released an  interim report outlining the growing evidence of a possible lab leak of  the COVID-19 virus.   Here are the facts. Number one, we know, based on numerous reports,  that the researchers at the Wuhan lab fell sick with COVID-related  symptoms in the fall of 2019. Number two, we also know that there was  active engagement by the Chinese military at the Wuhan lab. And, number  three, we know that the Chinese Government has continued to hinder  efforts for data collection and transparency in this investigation.  Essentially, Mr. Speaker, they have been nontransparent and  noncooperative.   The bottom line is, the American people deserve a full accounting of  the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has resulted in shutting  down our economy, massive deaths across the world, and millions out of  work.   Mr. Speaker, how can we prevent a future pandemic if we don't know  the genesis of this one?   This vote today will help answer those questions and get to the  origins of the pandemic. I am proud to join my friend, Congressman  Wenstrup, in this effort for transparency, and I urge my colleagues to  defeat the previous question.
