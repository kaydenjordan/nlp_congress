 Mr. Speaker, I recognize National Police Week; however,  every day I am aware that officers protect and serve, put their lives  on the line each day they serve, and some give their lives for that  service.   I also recognize what officers realize, that their sacrifice and  service is for everybody: people they know and don't know, and people  who love them and people who hate them.   That is a big part of why our officers should be recognized, because  no matter who it is, no matter what the danger is, police are trained  to and police do what we naturally don't do as civilians: they run  towards the danger, not away from it.   As a former prosecutor, I worked with many law enforcement officers  that I will never forget. More importantly, there are victims and  victims' family members who will never forget the service of police,  including the family of Azahel Cruz, a 6-year-old that was killed in a  drive-by shooting.   The case went unsolved for 5 years; however, due to the dogged  determination of Officer Tom Larkin and DA Investigator Peter Austin,  witnesses were found, evidence was presented, I proved the case at  trial, and a murderer was convicted and removed from the streets for  good.   Police work will never replace the life of Azahel, but that service  and the service and sacrifice of our officers is exactly why we  recognize our police officers this week.                            ____________________
