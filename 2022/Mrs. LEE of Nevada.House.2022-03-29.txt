 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize this last  week of March as National Area Health Education Centers, or AHEC, week.   The AHEC program is vital to this country and for Nevadans because we  are facing an unprecedented shortage of healthcare providers. The  doctor shortage in southern Nevada is nearing crisis levels, which  means longer wait times, fewer choices, and less access to quality  healthcare.   The size of Nevada's physician workforce ranks near last in this  country. As our community continues to expand, the challenges continue  to grow.   To solve this crisis, underserved communities like Las Vegas need to  expand the resources we offer so that medical providers can learn and  grow their careers right here.   That is exactly what AHECs do. They are part of the solution. The  Nation's 300 federally funded AHECs are in nearly every State and in  multiple U.S. territories. In the past 5 years, they have trained 2  million healthcare professionals.   Please join me in saluting AHECs as they continue to be committed to  prepare, plan, and train for a better healthcare future.                            ____________________
