 Mr. Speaker, in the fall of 1912, Forsyth County, in  my district was the site of an appalling racial cleansing.   Following the death of a White woman named Mae Crow, three Black men,  Rob Edwards, Ernest Knox, and Oscar Daniel, were accused of her murder  and lynched without due process.   Following this, White men on horseback dubbed ``night riders'' rode  throughout Forsyth County terrorizing families and burning Black  churches, homes, and businesses, ultimately driving out over 1,100  Black residents.   Forsyth County continued to have little to no Black residents for  almost a century.   Today, I am introducing a resolution condemning the lynchings of Rob  Edwards, Oscar Daniel, and Ernest Knox in 1912 and condemning the  actions of the white supremacist mobs which forced out nearly the  entire Black population of Forsyth County.   It is particularly important during Black History Month that we as a  Nation acknowledge horrific events such as this one and honor the  memory of the victims of these tragedies.   I urge my colleagues to support this resolution and reaffirm this  body's commitment to fighting white supremacy and seeking justice to  right the wrongs of our past.                            ____________________
