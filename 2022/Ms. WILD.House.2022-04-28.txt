 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor a constituent, Ms.  Vivian Fahr, who recently completed her GED at the age of 88.   After completing the 10th grade, Vivian left school and got married.  From that point on, she never stopped working hard to raise four kids,  pay the bills, and put food on the table. One day, she remarked to her  daughter-in-law that she regretted never having had the chance to  finish her education.   Vivian's family connected her to ProJeCt of Easton, an outstanding  interfaith coalition in my district that provides free educational  programs to members of the community. With the organization's help,  Vivian started her coursework at age 87 and diligently worked to obtain  her degree, always attending class, participating, and asking for  assistance when needed.   Vivian is an inspiration to her children, her grandchildren, the  greater Lehigh Valley community, and students of all ages. She is a  testament to the importance of high-quality education.   Congratulations, Vivian.                            ____________________
