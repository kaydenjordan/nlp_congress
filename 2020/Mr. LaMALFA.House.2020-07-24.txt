 Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague from Texas. It is  very gracious of him to yield me time.   I just wanted to point out, in the recent CARES Act, there was money  to be directed to our State and local governments around the country.  In my own home State of California, larger governments have been  fortunate enough to receive aid from the Coronavirus Relief Fund, but  many of our smaller counties and cities have not.   Under 500,000 population, there seem to be strings attached to  distributing that money. The problem is that is not State money; that  is Federal dollars directed to go to local governments.   So, at the hands of our California Governor, many of our rural  counties are facing extreme budget deficits as a result of the  coronavirus and have yet to receive a penny of those allotments from  that fund that we in Congress federally have set up for them.   While the virus cases increase across the country, counties that have  yet to receive the aid will have to bear the brunt of even more  coronavirus costs, as well as the other issues that they deal with in  their budgets, keeping law enforcement on the road, our highways and  roads repaired that are county jurisdiction, and all that.   As the House and Senate plans to take up more coronavirus relief in  the coming days and weeks, we need to make sure that the localities  that the money we sent to in the CARES Act actually have the money  distributed to them as it was intended by the Federal Government, to  those local smaller entities, cities, and counties. This is before we  even consider sending even more money to the States or other forms of  local government.   It is not the State's money. The next bill needs to go directly to  all those forms of local government that was implied and promised and  intended by Congress.
