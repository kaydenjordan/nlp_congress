 Madam Speaker, I rise today in favor of the rule, which  provides for consideration of my bill, the Ending Forced Arbitration of  Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Act.   This bill would simply void forced arbitration provisions as they  apply to sexual assault and harassment claims, giving survivors the  choice of how to pursue justice. It would allow sexual assault or  harassment survivors to discuss their cases publicly if they would  choose. And it would eliminate institutional protection for harassers  and abusers.   The rule also includes an amendment I co-led with Ranking Member    Ken Buck of Colorado. This amendment was negotiated in good faith with  Democrats and with Republicans to address concerns as my bill was  debated in committee. We promised them that we would work together to  address those issues, and we did.   My bill has the support of Democrats and Republicans. It has support  in the House and in the Senate. And passing the rule is the next step  toward sending this bill to the President of the United States and  having it become the law of the land. I urge my colleagues to support  the rule.
