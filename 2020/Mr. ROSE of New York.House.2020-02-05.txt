 Madam Speaker, I rise today in honor of Mark  and David Carles, two brothers with an unbreakable bond.   Ever since they were kids growing up on Staten Island, Mark and his  older brother, David, have been absolutely inseparable. When Mark was  diagnosed with a rare form of liver cancer in October of 2018, David  postponed his baseball career to take care of his brother.   While Mark was using a breathing tube and unable to speak, the  brothers communicated using sign language. After a life-threatening  surgery, the first thing Mark did was sign David's name.   Mark is a talented runner who, with David's support, refused to let  chemotherapy get in the way of his training, whether it was doing laps  down hospital corridors or running around the dining room table.   The brothers have even encouraged their father, Sandy, to run with  them as well. All three train for road races together. Mark recently  finished the Staten Island Athletic Club 5K in under 24 minutes.   Mark and David, your deep commitment to one another is an inspiration  to Staten Island, all of New York City, and all of America.   Mark, you are a fighter. You inspire your family, your friends, and  all those who you fight for as well.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Lawrence for  that kind introduction, and the gentlewoman is an honorary fellow New  Yorker.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to support my bill, H.R. 4794, to rename the post  office in Dyker Heights, Brooklyn as the Mother Frances Xavier Cabrini  Post Office. Mother Cabrini was a great New Yorker and a great American  who devoted her life to helping the poor and underserved to include  immigrants throughout New York City.   Mother Cabrini is famous across the United States for her work  providing education in underserved communities. She began her work  organizing classes for Italian immigrants and orphans through the city.  She helped found Columbus Hospital in New York City's Lower East Side,  which is now a part of the world-renowned Memorial Sloan Kettering  Cancer Center.   After her success in New York, she was called upon to open up schools  all around the world; not only across the United States, but also in  Europe, and Central and South America.   Mother Cabrini is not just a New York icon, although she is that. Her  name is affixed to buildings in Chicago, Seattle, New Orleans, Denver,  Los Angeles, and Philadelphia.   Cabrini was naturalized as a U.S. citizen in 1909 and canonized as  Saint Frances Xavier Cabrini on July 7, 1946 by Pope Pius XII as the  patron saint of immigrants.   I am proud to have the support of my colleagues from the New York  delegation, both Democrats and Republicans, who have come together in  recognition that the time has come to give Mother Cabrini her due  recognition.   Mother Cabrini will always be a shining example of our country's  commitment to the less fortunate, particularly immigrants in our  country. She also serves as a testament for the power of education, the  power of education to relieve poverty and empower communities,  regardless of their background.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this bill.
