 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 2229) to waive the passport fees for first  responders proceeding abroad to aid a foreign country suffering from a  natural disaster, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2229         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``First Responders Passport       Act of 2019''.       SEC. 2. PASSPORTS FOR FIRST RESPONDERS.         (a) In General.--Subsection (a) of section 1 of the Act of       June 4, 1920 (22 U.S.C. 214; 41 Stat. 750; commonly referred       to as the ``Passport Act of 1920''), is amended, in the third       sentence, by inserting after ``to attend a funeral or       memorial service for such member;'' the following: ``at the       discretion of the Secretary, from an individual, including a       volunteer, who is operating under a contract, grant, or       cooperative agreement with the United States Government to       proceed abroad within the first seven days after a natural       disaster to aid a foreign country suffering from such natural       disaster;''.        (b) Report.--Not later than 90 days after the end of the       first full fiscal year after the date of the enactment of       this Act, the Secretary of State shall submit to the       Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives       and the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate a report       on the number of waivers of fees for the execution and       issuance of passports to first responders under section 1 of       the Act of June 4, 1920, as amended by subsection (a) of this       section, for such fiscal year.       SEC. 3. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include in the Record extraneous material on H.R. 2229.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, let me start by thanking the gentleman from Ohio (Mr.  Chabot) for his hard work on this legislation. This is a good bill that  passed the House in the 114th Congress, and I am glad we are  considering an updated version of it now.   USAID-supported search and rescue teams have played an essential role  in the aftermath of many overseas natural disasters, including  earthquakes in Nepal, Haiti, Japan, and New Zealand. Just this past  month, search and rescue units from Virginia were deployed to the  Bahamas to assist the victims of Hurricane Dorian.   These first responders provide specialized capabilities and  demonstrate our commitment to international partners during their times  of need. They put their lives on the line to help people around the  world who are in need, and by doing so, they demonstrate the compassion  of the American people.   This bill would authorize the Secretary of State, at their  discretion, to waive passport fees for the brave Americans who mobilize  quickly as part of a U.S. Government-supported team to help other  countries when a natural disaster strikes.   This is a commonsense fix to help ensure the rapid deployment of  Americans who risk life and limb to help other countries in their times  of need. It is a good bill that I am proud to support.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in doing so, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume for purposes of closing.   Mr. Speaker, the First Responders Passport Act is a good measure that  passed the House in the 114th Congress. I am glad we are considering it  again today.   This is a straightforward and commonsense measure to make sure we can  rapidly deploy American search and rescue teams to other countries when  disaster strikes.   I urge all Members to join me in supporting this measure, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 1632) to require a strategy for engagement with  Southeast Asia and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN),  as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1632         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Southeast Asia Strategy       Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) Southeast Asia is the fulcrum of the Indo-Pacific       region, providing both a geographic and maritime link between       East and South Asia.        (2) The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), a       regional intergovernmental organization, remains central to       the Indo-Pacific region's institutional architecture and to       United States foreign policy toward the region.        (3) The United States has reaffirmed that the security and       sovereignty of its Southeast Asian allies and partners,       including a strong, independent ASEAN, remain vital to the       security, prosperity, and stability of the Indo-Pacific       region.        (4) The United States has committed to continuing to deepen       longstanding alliances and partnerships with a range of       Southeast Asian nations, including by promoting our shared       values, democracy, human rights, and civil society.        (5) Since the end of the Second World War, United States       investments in strengthening alliances and partnerships with       Southeast Asian nations have yielded tremendous returns for       United States interests, as working with and through these       alliances and partnerships have increased the region's       capacity and capability to address common challenges.        (6) ASEAN member states are critical United States security       partners in preventing violent extremism and protecting the       freedom and openness of the maritime domain and in preventing       the trafficking of weapons of mass destruction.        (7) ASEAN member states have contributed significantly to       regional disaster monitoring and management and emergency       response through initiatives such as the ASEAN Coordinating       Centre for Humanitarian Assistance on Disaster Management, an       inter-governmental organization that facilitates coordination       and cooperation among ASEAN member states and international       organizations in times of emergency.        (8) According to the 2018 ASEAN Business Outlook Survey,       ASEAN member states are vital to the prosperity of the United       States economy and exports to ASEAN economies support more       than 500,000 jobs in the United States.        (9) The United States and ASEAN have recently celebrated       the 40th anniversary of their ties and established a new       strategic partnership that will enhance cooperation across       the economic, political-security, and people-to-people       pillars of the relationship.       SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY.         It is the policy of the United States to--        (1) deepen cooperation with ASEAN and ASEAN member states       in the interest of promoting peace, security, and stability       in the Indo-Pacific region;        (2) affirm the importance of ASEAN centrality and ASEAN-led       mechanisms in the evolving institutional architecture of the       Indo-Pacific region; and        (3) establish and communicate a comprehensive strategy       toward the Indo-Pacific region that articulates--        (A) the role and importance of Southeast Asia to the United       States;        (B) the value of the United States-ASEAN relationship;        (C) the mutual interests of all parties;        (D) the concrete and material benefits all nations derive       from strong United States engagement and leadership in       Southeast Asia; and        (E) efforts to forge and maintain ASEAN consensus,       especially on key issues of political and security concern to       the region, such as the South China Sea.       SEC. 4. STRATEGY FOR ENGAGEMENT WITH SOUTHEAST ASIA AND                     ASEAN.         (a) In General.--Not later than 180 days after the date of       the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State, in       consultation with the heads of other Federal departments and       agencies as appropriate, shall develop and submit to the       appropriate congressional committees a comprehensive strategy       for engagement with Southeast Asia and ASEAN.        (b) Matters To Be Included.--The strategy required by       subsection (a) shall include the following:        (1) A statement of enduring United States interests in       Southeast Asia and a description of efforts to bolster the       effectiveness of ASEAN.        (2) A description of efforts to--        (A) deepen and expand Southeast Asian alliances,       partnerships, and multilateral engagements, including efforts       to expand broad based and inclusive economic growth, security       ties, security cooperation and interoperability, economic       connectivity, and expand opportunities for ASEAN to work with       other like-minded partners in the region; and        (B) encourage like-minded partners outside of the Indo-      Pacific region to engage with ASEAN.        (3) A summary of initiatives across the whole of the United       States Government to strengthen the United States partnership       with Southeast Asian nations and ASEAN, including to promote       broad based and inclusive economic growth, trade, investment,       energy and efforts to combat climate change, public-private       partnerships, physical and digital infrastructure       development, education, disaster management, public health       and economic and political diplomacy in Southeast Asia.        (4) A summary of initiatives across the whole of the United       States Government to enhance the capacity of Southeast Asian       nations with respect to enforcing international law and       multilateral sanctions, and initiatives to cooperate with       ASEAN as an institution in these areas.        (5) A summary of initiatives across the whole of the United       States Government to promote human rights and democracy, to       strengthen the rule of law, civil society, and transparent       governance, and to protect the integrity of elections from       outside influence.        (6) A summary of initiatives to promote security       cooperation and security assistance within Southeast Asian       nations, including--        (A) maritime security and maritime domain awareness       initiatives for protecting the maritime commons and       supporting international law and freedom of navigation in the       South China Sea; and        (B) efforts to combat terrorism, human trafficking, piracy,       and illegal fishing, and promote more open, reliable routes       for sea lines of communication.        (c) Appropriate Congressional Committees Defined.--In this       section, the term ``appropriate congressional committees''       means--        (1) the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on       Armed Services of the House of Representatives; and        (2) the Committee on Foreign Relations and the Committee on       Armed Services of the Senate.   [[Page H7876]]      Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include in the Record extraneous material on H.R. 1632.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, let me start by thanking the gentlewoman from Missouri  (Mrs. Wagner), the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Castro), and the gentleman  from Florida (Mr. Yoho) for introducing this legislation.   Southeast Asian states and the Association of Southeast Asian  Nations, or ASEAN, have been central to American policy in Asia for  decades. They are key partners in advancing our interests in the Indo- Pacific.   But at this point, the Trump administration still hasn't put together  a comprehensive strategy on how to strengthen our engagement with these  countries. This legislation would require such a strategy.   It calls on the Secretary of State, working with the Secretaries of  Defense and Commerce, to come up with a plan that will make sure the  United States and our partners are working together on some of the most  critical issues we are facing, from climate change and human rights to  security cooperation, energy, and a growing global economy.   A multiyear strategy for our engagement with ASEAN and its member  states will help us build partnerships in the region focused on short- term challenges, as well as longer term opportunities. Many Southeast  Asian countries face the same global challenges that we do, like  terrorism and human trafficking. The United States can and should be  their preferred partner to address these issues.   This bill will help us take stock of our ongoing and planned efforts  in these areas and determine what strategic personnel and funding  resources are necessary to make these efforts successful.   Mr. Speaker, this is a good, straightforward piece of legislation. I  am glad the House is considering it today, and I reserve the balance of  my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume for the purpose of closing.   Mr. Speaker, let me first thank my colleagues who have taken part in  this debate. I thank the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. Wagner) and  the ranking member, Mr. McCaul, for their leadership in this area.   I want to just close by being clear with ourselves as a Congress, as  the United States of America. If we are not engaged in the Indo-Pacific  region, if we are not building bridges of friendship and cooperation,  if we are not bringing American leadership and American values to this  critical part of the world, who is going to fill the void? The answer  is easy. It is China.   We can't be muddling our way through when it comes to our policy. We  need a smart, proactive approach that meets current challenges and  builds the framework for successful, long-term engagement.   Mr. Speaker, this bill will help us meet those goals. I am pleased to  support it. I urge all Members to do the same, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 2327) to direct the Secretary of State to provide  assistance to civil society organizations in Burma that work to secure  the release of prisoners of conscience and political prisoners in  Burma, and assistance to current and former prisoners of conscience and  political prisoners in Burma, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2327         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Burma Political Prisoners       Assistance Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress makes the following findings:        (1) Aung San Suu Kyi and the National League for Democracy       (NLD) pledged that they ``would not arrest anyone as       political prisoners'', but have failed to fulfill this       promise since they took control of Burma's Union Parliament       and the Government's executive branch in April 2016.        (2) As of the end of April 2019, there were 331 political       prisoners in Burma, 48 of them serving sentences, 90 awaiting       trial inside prison, and 193 awaiting trial outside prison,       according to the Assistance Association for Political       Prisoners in Burma.        (3) During its three years in power, the NLD Government has       provided pardons for Burma's political prisoners on six       occasions. State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi took steps to       secure the release of nearly 235 political prisoners in April       2016. On May 23, 2017, former President Htin Kyaw granted       pardons to 259 prisoners, including 89 political prisoners.       On April 17, 2018, current President Win Myint pardoned 8,541       prisoners, including 36 political prisoners. In April and May       2019, he pardoned more than 23,000 prisoners, including 20       political prisoners.        (4) The Burmese security forces have used colonial-era laws       to arrest and charge political prisoners and prisoners of       conscience. These laws include but are not limited to       provisions of the Penal Code, the Peaceful Assembly and       Peaceful Procession Act, the 1908 Unlawful Associations Act,       the 2013 Telecommunications Act, and the 1923 Official       Secrets Act.        (5) On December 12, 2017, Reuters reporters Wa Lone and       Kyaw Soe Oo were arrested and charged with violating the       Official Secrets Act, continuing a trend of restricting media       and free speech and attempting to thwart coverage of the       events in Rakhine State.        (6) On September 3, 2018, Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo were       convicted and sentenced to seven years in prison. Time       Magazine included pictures of the two reporters on the cover       of its ``Person of the Year'' issue on December 10, 2018, as       two of the ``Guardians and the War on Truth''.        (7) On May 6, 2019, Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo were released       after more than 500 days behind bars.        (8) According to Burmese free speech organization Athan, 44       journalists and 142 activists since 2016 were charged with       colonial-era laws used to stifle dissent and restrict       activist groups and have faced trial.        (9) Since December 2018, three Kachin activists were       sentenced to six months in prison in connection with peaceful       antiwar protests; a protester demonstrating against the       Myitsone Dam (a controversial Chinese-backed hydropower       project) was charged for peaceful demonstrations, and police       used excessive force to crack down on peaceful protesters in       Kayah State, with some of the demonstrators charged under       vaguely worded, repressive laws.        (10) On August 18, 2017, Aung Ko Htwe was arrested because       he gave a media interview in which he described his       experience as a child soldier, including how the Burmese       military abducted and forcibly recruited him when he was 13       years old. He was charged under Section 505(b) of Burma's       Penal Code.        (11) Although former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson took       Burma off the State Department's list of the worst offenders       in the use of child soldiers in 2017, the Department       reinstated Burma to the list in 2018. According to the United       Nations, the Burmese military and ethnic guerrilla groups       remain ``persistent perpetrators' in the recruitment and use       of children in [Burma].''.       SEC. 3. CHILD SOLDIERS.         It is the sense of Congress that no one should be jailed       for freely expressing him or herself or for speaking against       the use of child soldiers.       SEC. 4. PEACEFUL ASSEMBLY.         It is the sense of Congress that Burma must immediately       drop defamation charges against the three Kachin activists,       Lum Zawng, Nang Pu, and Zau Jet, who led a peaceful rally in       Mytkyina, the capital of Kachin State in April 2018, and that       the prosecution of Lum Zawng, Nang Pu, and Zau Jet is an       attempt by the Burmese authorities to intimidate, harass, and       silence community leaders and human rights defenders who       speak out about military abuses and the impact on civilian       populations.       SEC. 5. PRESS FREEDOM.         It is the sense of Congress that press freedom is a       fundamental human right and should be upheld and protected in       Burma and everywhere, and that Burmese authorities must       immediately cease the arbitrary arrest, detention,       imprisonment, and physical attacks of journalists, which have       created a climate of fear and self-censorship among local       journalists.       SEC. 6. STATEMENT OF POLICY.         It is the policy of the United States that--        (1) all prisoners of conscience and political prisoners in       Burma should be unconditionally and immediately released;        (2) the Administration and the Department of State should       use all of their diplomatic tools to ensure that all       prisoners of conscience and political prisoners in Burma are       released; and        (3) the Burmese Government should repeal or amend all laws       that violate the rights to freedom of expression, peaceful       assembly, or association, and ensure that laws such as the       Telecommunications Law of 2013 and the Unlawful Associations       Act of 1908, and laws relating to the right to peaceful       assembly, all comply with international human rights       standards.       SEC. 7. POLITICAL PRISONERS ASSISTANCE.         The Secretary of State shall continue to provide assistance       to civil society organizations in Burma that work to secure       the release of prisoners of conscience and political       prisoners in Burma, and assistance to current and former       prisoners of conscience and political prisoners in Burma.       Such assistance may include the following:        (1) Support for the documentation of human rights       violations with respect to prisoners of conscience and       political prisoners.        (2) Support for advocacy in Burma to raise awareness of       issues relating to prisoners of conscience and political       prisoners.        (3) Support for efforts to repeal or amend laws that are       used to imprison individuals as either prisoners of       conscience or political prisoners.        (4) Support for health, including mental health, and post-      incarceration assistance in gaining access to education and       employment opportunities or other forms of reparation to       enable former prisoners of conscience and political prisoners       to resume a normal life.        (5) The creation, in consultation with former political       prisoners and prisoners of conscience, their families, and       representatives, of an independent prisoner review mechanism       in Burma to review the cases of individuals who may have been       charged or deprived of their liberty for peacefully       exercising their human rights, review all laws used to       arrest, prosecute, and punish individuals as political       prisoners and prisoners of conscience, and provide       recommendations to the Burmese Government for the repeal or       amendment of all such laws.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include in the Record extraneous material on H.R. 2327.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of my bill, the Burma Political  Prisoners Assistance Act.   Next week, I will travel to Bangladesh, where I am going to spend  time in Cox's Bazar, the site of the world's largest refugee  settlement. Since August of 2017, hundreds of thousands of Rohingya  refugees have fled to Cox's Bazar from Burma, where villages were  burned to the ground, women and girls were raped, and many were  massacred at the hands of Burmese security forces as part of a campaign  that can only be described as genocide.   When I come home to the United States, I plan to speak openly and  honestly about what I saw and share the stories of Rohingya refugees I  talk to. And, while I don't expect everyone to like what I have to say,  I know that, here in America, I won't be persecuted for exercising my  right to free speech and sharing an honest account of the atrocities so  many have experienced in Burma.   But, if Burma was my home country, I would not be able to rest so  easy, no matter my ethnic group or religion. That is because colonial- era laws are used to stifle dissent and imprison people who dare to  speak out or work to protect human rights.  [[Page H7878]]    Take the example of Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo, Reuters journalists who  were arrested while investigating a massacre of Rohingya men and boys  and spent more than 500 days in prison before being released after  massive international pressure earlier this year; or, Aung Ko Htwe, a  former child soldier who gave an interview talking about his experience  being abducted and forcibly recruited by the Burmese military when he  was just 13 years old. For that offense, he was imprisoned for 2 years  and just released earlier this month.   Were it not for incredibly brave people like Wa Lone, Kyaw Soe Oo,  and Aung Ko Htwe, the world might not know about the horrors that have  occurred in Burma.   Journalists, activists, and anyone who is willing to use their voice  to call out wrongdoing must be protected. That is why Congresswoman Ann  Wagner and I introduced the Burma Political Prisoners Assistance Act.   This bill calls for the release of political prisoners and prisoners  of conscience in Burma and directs our State Department to bolster its  work to achieve these ends.   We need to support efforts to amend or repeal the unjust laws that  are being used to stifle free expression and honest reporting. We  should support the creation of an independent prisoner review mechanism  to examine cases like the ones I just mentioned and offer  recommendations as to how the law might better protect free expression.  And we must aid the organizations that are working to secure the  release of political prisoners and prisoners of conscience.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this  important bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume for the purpose of closing.   Mr. Speaker, I am so happy that, between the day we introduced this  legislation and today, Wa Lone, Kyaw Soe Oo, and Aung Ko Htwe were  released, but there are so many other people like them whose names we  do not know but to whom we owe tremendous gratitude for their bravery.   For the courageous people of Burma who have raised their voices to  insist on accountability, to demand reform and bring justice to light,  I hope this legislation helps to bring about the change they so richly  deserve.   I want to thank Congresswoman Ann Wagner for her partnership on this  bill and for all her work to protect human rights in Southeast Asia. I  hope this bill is the first of many we work on together.   And I thank Chairman Engel and Ranking Member McCaul for prioritizing  this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to join me in supporting this  measure, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 3190) to authorize humanitarian assistance and  impose sanctions with respect to human rights abuses in Burma, and for  other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3190         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

(4) Transitional justice.--The term ``transitional       justice'' means the range of judicial, nonjudicial, formal,       informal, retributive, and restorative measures employed by       countries transitioning out of armed conflict or repressive       regimes to redress legacies of atrocities and to promote       long-term, sustainable peace.        (5) War crime.--The term ``war crime'' has the meaning       given the term in section 2441(c) of title 18, United States       Code.       SEC. 3. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) On August 25, 2017, Burmese military and security       forces violently and disproportionately responded to an       attack on security outposts, resulting in a mass exodus of       Rohingya from the Rakhine State of Burma into Bangladesh,       which the International Organization of Migration called       ``unprecedented in terms of volume and speed''.        (2) Between August 2017 and March 2019, in response to the       violence perpetrated by the Burmese military and security       forces, the United Nations estimates more than 740,000       Rohingya, approximately 75 percent of whom are women and       children, have fled to Bangladesh, fearing loss of life,       livelihoods, and shelter. Rohingya have continued to flee       Burma in significant numbers, including in 2019. According to       the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, more than       1,400 Rohingya have arrived in Bangladesh since January 1,       2019.        (3) Even after the Burmese military scaled back attacks       against Rohingya in late 2017, security forces continued to       impose restrictions on the basic freedoms of Rohingya in       Rakhine State, including on freedom of movement. In November       2017, Amnesty International determined that Rohingya       remaining in Rakhine are ``trapped in a vicious system of       state-sponsored, institutionalized discrimination that       amounts to apartheid''.        (4) Despite the steps taken toward democracy in Burma,       there exists limited control by the civilian government over       civilian agencies as well as military and security forces       that carried out the violence in Rakhine State. The military       and security forces continue to engage in grave human rights       abuses against ethnic minorities throughout in the country.        (5) Both government- and military-initiated investigations       into human rights abuses in Burma involving violence between       ethnic minorities and Burmese security forces have failed to       yield credible results or hold perpetrators accountable.        (6) In a public address on October 12, 2017, State       Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi laid out the following goals for       the State of Rakhine:        (A) Repatriation of those who have crossed over to       Bangladesh.        (B) Effective provision of humanitarian assistance.        (C) Resettlement of displaced populations.        (D) Economic development and durable peace.        (7) Due to restrictions enforced by the Rakhine State       government and the national military and security forces,       there has been little progress made since that time and       limited ability for the international community to support,       verify, or evaluate the Government of Burma's efforts. There       are also credible reports of Burmese military and security       forces bulldozing numerous villages where violence occurred,       thus destroying physical evidence, and in some cases,       constructing new military installations on top of the       bulldozed villages.        (8) On November 22, 2017, former Secretary of State Rex       Tillerson stated that ``After a careful and thorough analysis       of available facts, it is clear that the situation in       northern Rakhine state constitutes ethnic cleansing against       the Rohingya. Those responsible for these atrocities must be       held accountable''. He also said the violence ``has a number       of characteristics of certainly crimes against humanity''.       Despite repeated requests from Members of Congress, as well       as the result of its own investigation (the executive summary       of which was released on September 17, 2018), the Department       has declined to make a determination if the atrocities in       Rakhine State constitute genocide or crimes against humanity.        (9) On December 12, 2017, Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo, two       Reuters reporters covering the crisis in Rakhine State, were       entrapped, arrested, and charged with violating the Official       Secrets Act, continuing a trend of restricting media and free       speech and attempting to thwart coverage of the events in       Rakhine State.        (10) Another barrier to the voluntary, safe, dignified and       sustainable return of the Rohingya to Rakhine State is the       refusal of the Government of Burma to reinstate the full       citizenship of the Rohingya, as well as the Government's       unwillingness to consider the repeal of or amendments to the       Citizenship Act of 1982 that stripped the Rohingya of their       full citizenship.        (11) During 2018, the ongoing conflict in Burma escalated       in Kachin and Shan States, reignited in Karen (Kayin) State,       and spread into Chin and Rakhine States. Along with the       increase in fighting between Burma's security forces and       several ethnic armed organizations, there was a rise in       allegations of human rights abuses perpetrated by Burmese       security forces in these conflict areas.        (12) In April 2018, thousands of civilians fled fighting       between the military and ethnic armed groups in Kachin State,       prompting peaceful demonstrations. In December 2018, three       prominent activist in Kachin State, Lum Zawng, Nang Pu and       Zau Jet were convicted and sentenced to six months       imprisonment for defaming the military.        (13) On June 6, 2018, the United Nations Refugee Agency and       the United Nations Development Programme signed a tripartite       Memorandum of Understanding with Burma. The Office of the       United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and various       international human rights and international relief agencies       agreed that conditions in Rakhine State are not sufficient       for the voluntary, safe, dignified, and sustainable return of       the Rohingya.        (14) The United Nations Independent International Fact-      Finding Mission on Myanmar, the Department of State, and more       than a dozen human rights organizations have reported and       documented a campaign of violence perpetrated by the security       forces of Burma, which indiscriminately fired on and killed       civilians, raped women and girls, and arrested Rohingya men       without any cause or charges. Satellite images obtained by       Amnesty International reveal that, out of the approximately       470 villages in northern Rakhine State, nearly 300 were       partially or completely destroyed by fire since August 25,       2017, most of which were completely or partially populated by       Rohingya Muslims.        (15) In its report of September 17, 2018, the United       Nations Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on       Myanmar determined that there was sufficient evidence of       ``genocidal intent'' in the attacks against the Rohingya in       Rakhine State, and probable ``crimes against humanity'' and       ``war crimes'' in Burmese security forces assaults on ethnic       minorities in Kachin and Shan States. The Mission recommended       that the United Nations Security Council ``should ensure       accountability for crimes under international law committed       in Myanmar, preferably by referring the situation to the       International Criminal Court or alternatively by creating an       ad hoc international criminal tribunal''. The Mission also       recommended the imposition of targeted economic sanctions,       including an arms embargo on Burma.        (16) On September 3, 2018, Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo were       convicted and sentenced to seven years in prison and released       as an act of Presidential amnesty on May 6, 2019, after over       500 days in jail. Time Magazine included pictures the two       reporters on the cover of its ``Person of the Year'' issue on       December 10, 2018, as two of the ``Guardians and the War on       Truth''.        (17) According to the free-speech organization Athan, 44       journalists and 142 activists have faced trial since 2016       charged with colonial-era laws used to stifle dissent, while       tightening restrictions on activist groups.        (18) On September 28, 2018, the United Nations Human Rights       Council passed a resolution that calls for an independent       mechanism to collect and analyze evidence in regard to the       serious international crimes committed in Burma against       Rohingya Muslims and other minorities since 2011. The       resolution requests that the independent mechanism ``prepare       files in order to facilitate and expedite fair and       independent criminal proceedings, in accordance with       international law standards, in national, regional or       international courts or tribunals that have or may in the       future have jurisdiction over these crimes''.        (19) On November 15, 2018, the Government of Bangladesh and       the Government of Burma abandoned plans to return more than       2,000 Rohingya to Rakhine State after it was determined that       none were willing to voluntarily return given the current       conditions in Rakhine State, as well as the Government of       Burma's failure to ensure the returnees' safety, dignity, or       sustainability of their livelihoods.        (20) A December 2018 report by the Public Law Interest &       Policy group noted that ``the destruction of their villages,       crops, and virtually all infrastructure clearly points to a       strategy of ensuring the Rohingya's permanent removal. The       mass killings and accompanying brutality, including against       children, women, pregnant women, the elderly, and those       crossing the border to Bangladesh further suggest, however,       that, at least in the minds of some perpetrators, the goal       was not only to expel, but also to exterminate the Rohingya .       . .'' and that ``there are reasonable grounds to believe that       crimes against humanity, genocide, and war crimes have been       committed against the Rohingya in Myanmar's northern Rakhine       State''.        (21) Despite substantial evidence of widespread and       systematic atrocities committed by Burmese security forces in       Rakhine State, State Counselor Aung San Suu Kyi and Burma's       Commander-in-Chief Senior General Min Aung Hlaing continue to       maintain that no such widespread and systematic atrocities       occurred.        (22) On December 13, 2018, the United States House of       Representatives passed House Resolution 1091 (115th Congress)       which expressed the sense of the House that ``the atrocities       committed against the Rohingya by the Burmese military and       security forces since August 2017 constitute crimes against       humanity and genocide'' and called upon the  [[Page H7880]]       Secretary of State to review the available evidence and make       a similar determination.        (23) On December 19, 2018, the United Nations Humanitarian       Coordinator requested $202,000,000 for the 2019 Humanitarian       Response Plan for Burma.        (24) The 2019 Joint Response Plan for the Rohingya       Humanitarian Crisis asks the international community to       provide $20,500,000 in assistance to meet needs in       Bangladesh.        (25) On May 14, 2019, the United Nations Fact-Finding       Mission on Myanmar urged all countries to cut off economic       ties to Burma's military-owned businesses, stating ``. . .       due to the gravity of past and continuing violations,       attention must be given to the political, economic and       financial ties of the Myanmar military . . . so we can cut       off the money supply as a means of increasing pressure and       reducing the violence.''.

It is the policy of the United States as follows:        (1) To support a complete transition to democracy and       genuine national reconciliation in Burma, including       accountability for the atrocities committed by the Burmese       military against the Rohingya population and other ethnic       minorities throughout the country.        (2) To pursue a United States strategy of calibrated       engagement, which is essential to support the establishment       of a peaceful, prosperous, and democratic Burma that includes       respect for the human rights of all its people regardless of       ethnicity and religion.

SEC. 102. SENSE OF CONGRESS WITH RESPECT TO HUMANITARIAN                     ASSISTANCE, FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT, AND RIGHTS OF                     RETURNEES.         (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--        (1) significant and sustained international funding, from       both public and private sources, is necessary to address the       medium- and long-term impacts of the crisis in Burma and the       impact of the crisis on Bangladesh; and        (2) the United States should make resolving the Rohingya       crisis one of its top priorities in its engagement with       regional institutions, such as the Association of Southeast       Asian Nations.        (b) Restoration of Humanitarian Access and Accountability       in Rakhine State.--Congress calls on the Government of Burma,       including the Burmese military and security forces, to ensure       full and secure humanitarian access to the State of Rakhine       and to cooperate with the ongoing international mechanism set       up by the United Nations Human Rights Council in September       2018 and funded by the United Nations General Assembly to       gather evidence and other information pertaining to       allegations of crimes against humanity and genocide committed       in Burma.        (c) Rights of Refugees, Internally Displaced Persons, and       Returnees.--        (1) Burma.--Congress calls on the Government of Burma to--        (A) ensure that Rohinyga in Burma have freedom of movement;        (B) create conditions for return of those displaced from       their homes and implement the recommendations of the Advisory       Commission on Rakhine State, which includes full and equal       citizenship;        (C) work closely with the international community,       including the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees,       to ensure the dignified, safe, sustainable and voluntary       return of all those displaced from their homes, especially       from Rakhine State, without an unduly high burden of proof;       and        (D) offer compensation or restitution to those refugees who       do not want to return to their homes.        (2) Bangladesh.--Congress calls on the Government of       Bangladesh to--        (A) ensure that the rights of refugees are protected,       including through allowing them to build more permanent       shelters, and ensuring equal access to healthcare, basic       services, education and work;        (B) work closely with the international community,       including the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees,       to ensure that any repatriation or resettlement of refugees       be dignified, safe, sustainable and voluntary; and        (C) ensure that any relocation or local integration of       refugees in Bangladesh be consistent with international       humanitarian principles, including freedom of movement, and       implemented only through voluntary, fully informed consent.       SEC. 103. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON FREEDOMS OF PRESS AND                     ASSOCIATION.         It is the sense of Congress that, in order to promote the       freedom of the press and speech, the Government of Burma       should undertake serious legal reforms including reform of       the Official Secrets Act, 1923, the Unlawful Association Act,       1908, and the Penal Code.       SEC. 104. IMPOSITION OF SANCTIONS FOR THE VIOLATION OF HUMAN                     RIGHTS.         The President shall impose sanctions--        (1) against officials in Burma, including Commander in       Chief of the Armed Forces of Myanmar Min Aung Hlaing, under       the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act (22       U.S.C. 2656 note); and        (2) against military-owned enterprises, including the       Myanmar Economic Corporation and Union of Myanmar Economic       Holding, under the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act (50       U.S.C. 1701 note), the Tom Lantos Block Burmese JADE (Junta's       Anti-Democratic Efforts) Act of 2008 (50 U.S.C. 1701 note),       and other relevant statutory authorities.

IMPOSITION OF SANCTIONS WITH RESPECT TO HUMAN                     RIGHTS ABUSES IN BURMA.

TITLE III--GOVERNANCE OF THE BURMESE MINING AND GEMSTONE SECTORS       SEC. 301. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON THE MINING SECTOR OF BURMA.         (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:        (1) In 2015, the nongovernmental organization Global       Witness estimated that the value of total production of jade       in Burma in 2014 was $31,000,000,000, almost 48 percent of       the official gross domestic product of Burma. As much as 80       percent of that jade sold is smuggled out of Burma.        (2) Burma's military and associated entities, including       companies owned or controlled by Myanmar Economic Corporation       and Myanmar Economic Holding Limited, their affiliated       companies, and companies owned or controlled by current and       former senior military officers or their family members, are       linked to the mining sector, including the gemstone industry,       and benefit financially from widespread illegal smuggling of       jade and rubies from Burma.        (3) Illegal trafficking in precious and semiprecious stones       from Burma, including the trade in high-value jade and       rubies, deprives the people of Burma and the civilian       government of critical revenue and instead benefits military-      linked entities, non-state armed groups, and transnational       organized criminal networks.        (4) In 2016, the Government of Burma began to take steps to       reform aspects of the mining sector, including--        (A) improving governance in the gemstone industry, by       temporarily suspending the issuance or renewal of jade and       gemstone mining permits;        (B) commissioning an environmental management plan for some       mining areas; and        (C) establishing the multi-stakeholder Jade and Gemstone       Support Committee under the Ministry of Natural Resources and       Environmental Conservation to develop recommendations for a       new industry-wide policy and limited gemstone payment       disclosures under the Myanmar Extractives Industry       Transparency Initiative.        (5) In January 2019, the Government of Burma adopted a new       Gemstone Law that does not adequately address corruption and       tax avoidance, conflicts of interest, or the factors fueling       conflict in Kachin State and other gemstone mining areas.        (6) The lifting in October 2016 of United States sanctions       on the importation of jade and jadeite and rubies from Burma       allowed such gemstones to legally enter the United States       market, but some retailers have refrained from sourcing       gemstones of Burmese origin due to governance and       reputational concerns.        (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--        (1) notwithstanding Burma's ``Trafficking in Persons''       ranking, the President should continue to provide assistance       to Burma, pursuant to the waiver authority under section       110(d)(4) of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000       (22 U.S.C. 7107(d)(4)), in order to re-engage with the       Government of Burma with respect to the mining sector and       should make available technical, capacity-building and other       assistance through the Department of State or the United       States Agency for International Development to support the       Government of Burma in efforts to reform the gemstone       industry; and        (2) companies that seek to import to the United States       gemstones or minerals that may be of Burmese origin or       articles of jewelry containing such gemstones should--        (A) obtain such materials exclusively from entities that       satisfy the transparency criteria described in section       section 302(b)(2) or from third parties that can demonstrate       that they sourced the materials from entities that meet such       criteria; and        (B) undertake robust due diligence procedures in line with       the ``Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Business       Conduct'' and ``Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply       Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk       Areas'' promulgated by the Organization for Economic       Cooperation and Development.

(e) Termination.--The date described in this section is the       date on which the President certifies to the appropriate       congressional committees that the Government of Burma has       taken substantial measures to reform the mining sector in       Burma, including the following:        (1) Require the mandatory disclosure of payments, permit       and license allocations, project revenues, contracts, and       beneficial ownership, including the identification any       politically exposed persons who are beneficial owners,       consistent with the approach agreed under the Myanmar EITI       and with due regard for civil society participation.

TITLE V--DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS       SEC. 501. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the Committee on the Budget of the House of       Representatives, provided that such statement has been       submitted prior to the vote on passage.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include in the Record extraneous materials on H.R. 3190.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I would first like to thank Chairman Engel and Mr.  Chabot for authoring this legislation.   Since August 2017, we have seen some of the most horrific ethnic  violence in the world at the hands of the Burmese military in Burma's  Rakhine State. The world has been shocked by the brutality of war  crimes and crimes against humanity committed by Burmese military and  security forces.   Thousands of Rohingya civilians have been killed. Many hundreds of  thousands more have been forced to flee their homes and livelihoods.  The U.N. and independent investigators have documented terrible sexual  violence against women and girls.   Despite all this bloodshed, there has been no meaningful  accountability for those responsible.   Let's be clear: The military that carried out genocide against the  Rohingya is the same military that has oppressed and abused minority  groups in Burma for decades. It is the same military that carries out  abuse against Burmese citizens to this day. This institution is rotten  to the core, and it is time for change.   This bill would impose financial, trade, and visa sanctions on those  responsible for these crimes, including the commander in chief and  those who have failed to investigate and prosecute these abuses. It  authorizes $220 million for humanitarian assistance to affected  communities, including communities in Bangladesh. It pushes economic  reforms designed to get the military out of the mining industry in  Burma.   This legislation passed the House before with an overwhelming vote of  support. I urge my colleagues to join me today in doing the same, once  again.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                          House of Representatives,                                    Committee on Foreign Affairs,                                 Washington, DC, September 20, 2019.      Hon. Maxine Waters,      Chairwoman, Committee on Financial Services,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairwoman Waters: I am writing to you concerning H.R.       3190, the Burma Unified through Rigorous Military       Accountability (BURMA) Act of 2019. I appreciate your       willingness to work cooperatively on this legislation.

I further       acknowledge that the inaction of your Committee with respect       to the bill does not waive any future jurisdictional claim       over the matters contained in the bill that fall within your       jurisdiction. I also acknowledge that your Committee will be       appropriately consulted and involved as this or  [[Page H7884]]       similar legislation moves forward and will support the       appointment of Committee on Financial Services conferees       during any House-Senate conference convened on this       legislation.

Sincerely,                                                    Eliot L. Engel,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                 Committee on Financial Services,                                 Washington, DC, September 23, 2019.      Hon. Eliot Engel,      Chairman, Committee on Foreign Affairs, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing concerning H.R. 3190, the       Burma Unified through Rigorous Military Accountability       (BURMA) Act of 2019. In order to permit the H.R. 3190 to       proceed expeditiously to the House Floor, I agree to forgo       formal consideration of the bill.        The Committee on Financial Services takes this action to       forego formal consideration of H.R. 3190 with our mutual       understanding that, by foregoing formal consideration of H.R.       3190 at this time, we do not waive any jurisdiction over the       subject matter contained in this or similar legislation, and       that our Committee will be appropriately consulted and       involved as this or similar legislation moves forward. Our       Committee also reserves the right to seek appointment of an       appropriate number of conferees to any House-Senate       conference involving this or similar legislation and request       your support for any such request.        Finally, I would appreciate your response to this letter       confirming this understanding, and I would ask that a copy of       our exchange of letters on this matter be included in the       Congressional Record during Floor consideration of H.R. 3190.            Sincerely,                                                     Maxine Waters,      Chairwoman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                     Committee on Ways and Means,                                 Washington, DC, September 20, 2019.      Hon. Eliot L. Engel,      Chairman, Committee on Foreign Affairs,      Washington, DC.

The Committee on Ways and Means takes this action with the       mutual understanding that we do not waive any jurisdiction       over the subject matter contained in this or similar       legislation, and the Committee will be appropriately       consulted and involved as the bill or similar legislation       moves forward so that we may address any remaining issues       within our jurisdiction. The Committee also reserves the       right to seek appointment of an appropriate number of       conferees to any House-Senate conference involving this or       similar legislation.

Hon. Eliot L. Engel,      Chairman, Committee on Foreign Affairs, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Engel: This is to advise you that the       Committee on the Judiciary has now had an opportunity to       review the provisions in H.R. 3190, the ``Burma Unified       through Rigorous Military Accountability Act of 2019,'' that       fall within our Rule X jurisdiction. I appreciate your       consulting with us on those provisions. The Judiciary       Committee has no objection to your including them in the bill       for consideration on the House floor, and to expedite that       consideration is willing to forgo action on H.R. 3190, with       the understanding that we do not thereby waive any future       jurisdictional claim over those provisions or their subject       matters.        In the event a House-Senate conference on this or similar       legislation is convened, the Judiciary Committee reserves the       right to request an appropriate number of conferees to       address any concerns with these or similar provisions that       may arise in conference.        Please place this letter into the Congressional Record       during consideration of the measure on the House floor. Thank       you for the cooperative spirit in which you have worked       regarding this matter and others between our committees.            Sincerely,                                                    Jerrold Nadler,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                    Committee on Foreign Affairs,                                 Washington, DC, September 19, 2019.      Hon. Jerrold Nadler,      Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Nadler: I am writing to you concerning H.R.       3190, the Burma Unified through Rigorous Military       Accountability (BURMA) Act of 2019. I appreciate your       willingness to work cooperatively on this legislation.        I acknowledge that provisions of the bill fall within the       jurisdiction of the Committee on the Judiciary under House       Rule X, and that your Committee will forgo action on H.R.       3190 to expedite floor consideration.

Thank you again for your       cooperation regarding the legislation. I look forward to       continuing to work with you as the measure moves through the       legislative process.            Sincerely,                                                    Eliot L. Engel,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume for the purpose of closing.   Mr. Speaker, it has been 2 years since the massacres in Rakhine  State, and the suffering continues across the border in Bangladesh.   The House has passed this legislation before with an overwhelming and  bipartisan vote, sending a strong message to perpetrators and victims  alike. I urge my colleagues to join me today in doing the same once  again.   This legislation is a necessary response to one of the most pressing  human rights and humanitarian concerns in the entire world today. I am  glad the House is considering it. I salute the gentleman from New York  (Mr. Engel), my chairman, and I encourage all Members to vote for its  passage.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  agree to the resolution (H. Res. 127) expressing the sense of the House  of Representatives on the importance and vitality of the United States  alliances with Japan and the Republic of Korea, and our trilateral  cooperation in the pursuit of shared interests, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows:                                H. Res. 127         Whereas the governments and the people of the United       States, Japan, and the Republic of Korea share comprehensive       and dynamic partnerships and personal friendships rooted in       shared interests and the common values of freedom, democracy,       and free market economies;        Whereas the United States, Japan, and the Republic of Korea       are all free societies committed to the principles of       inclusive democracy, respect for human potential, and the       belief that the peaceful spread of these principles will       result in a safer and brighter future for all of mankind;        Whereas the United States, Japan, and the Republic of Korea       are indispensable partners in tackling global challenges and       have pledged significant support for efforts to counter       violent extremism, combat the proliferation of weapons of       mass destruction, prevent piracy, improve global health and       energy security, promote human rights, address climate       change, contribute to economic development around the world,       and assist the victims of conflict and disaster worldwide;        Whereas the governments and the people of the United       States, Japan, and the Republic of Korea all share a       commitment to free and open markets, high standards for the       free flow of commerce and trade, and the establishment of an       inclusive, transparent, and sustainable architecture for       regional and global trade and development;        Whereas the United States-Japan and the United States-      Republic of Korea alliances are the foundation of regional       stability in Asia, including against the threat posed by the       regime in Pyongyang;        Whereas cooperation between and among our nations spans       economic, energy, diplomatic, security, and cultural spheres;        Whereas the United States and Japan established diplomatic       relations on March 31, 1854, with the signing of the Treaty       of Peace and Amity;        Whereas the relationship between the peoples of the United       States and the Republic of Korea stretches back to Korea's       Chosun Dynasty, when the United States and Korea established       diplomatic relations under the 1882 Treaty of Peace, Amity,       Commerce, and Navigation;        Whereas 2019 marks the 74th anniversary of the end of World       War II, a conflict in which the United States and Japan were       enemies, and the strength of the United States-Japan alliance       is a testament to the ability of great countries to overcome       the past and to work together to create a more secure and       prosperous future;        Whereas the United States-Korea alliance was forged in       blood, with United States military casualties during the       Korean War of approximately 36,574 killed and more than       103,284 wounded, and with Republic of Korea casualties of       more than 217,000 soldiers killed, more than 291,000 soldiers       missing, and over 1,000,000 civilians killed or missing;        Whereas, for the past 70 years, the partnership between the       United States and Japan has played a vital role, both in Asia       and globally, in ensuring peace, stability, and economic       development;        Whereas, approximately 50,000 United States military       personnel serve in Japan, along with some of the United       States most advanced defense assets, including the 7th Fleet       and the USS Ronald Reagan, the only United States aircraft       carrier to be homeported outside the United States;        Whereas, since the Mutual Defense Treaty Between the United       States and the Republic of Korea, signed in Washington on       October 1, 1953, and ratified by the Senate on January 26,       1954, United States military personnel have maintained a       continuous presence on the Korean Peninsula, and       approximately 28,500 United States troops are stationed in       the Republic of Korea in 2019;        Whereas the United States and the Republic of Korea have       stood alongside each other in the four major wars the United       States has fought outside Korea since World War II--in       Vietnam, the Persian Gulf, Afghanistan, and Iraq;        Whereas Japan is the fourth-largest United States trading       partner and together with the United States represents 30       percent of global Gross Domestic Product, and Japanese firms       have invested $469,000,000,000 in the United States;        Whereas, the economic relationship between the United       States and its sixth-largest trading partner, the Republic of       Korea, with which we have a free trade agreement, includes       358,000 jobs in the United States that are directly related       to exports to the Republic of Korea, and has resulted in more       than $40,000,000,000 in investments by Korean firms in the       United States;        Whereas Japan and the Republic of Korea stand as strong       partners of the United States in efforts to ensure maritime       security and freedom of navigation, commerce, and overflight       and to uphold respect for the rule of law and to oppose the       use of coercion, intimidation, or force to change the       regional or global status quo, including in the maritime       domains of the Indo-Pacific, which are among the busiest       waterways in the world;        Whereas the United States, Japan, and the Republic of Korea       are committed to working together towards a world where the       Democratic People's Republic of Korea (in this preamble       referred to as the ``DPRK'') does not threaten global peace       and security with its weapons of mass destruction, missile       proliferation, and illicit activities, and where the DPRK       respects human rights and its people can live in freedom;        Whereas section 211 of the North Korea Sanctions and Policy       Enhancement Act of 2016 (22 U.S.C. 9231; Public Law 114-122)       expresses the sense of Congress that the President ``should       seek to strengthen high-level trilateral mechanisms for       discussion and coordination of policy toward North Korea       between the Government of the United States, the Government       of South Korea, and the Government of Japan'';        Whereas the Asia Reassurance Initiative Act of 2018 (Public       Law 115-409) underscores the importance of trilateral defense       cooperation and enforcement of multilateral sanctions against       North Korea and calls for regular consultation with Congress       on the status of such efforts;        Whereas the United States, Japan, and the Republic of Korea       have made great strides in promoting trilateral cooperation       and defense partnership, including ministerial meetings,       information sharing, and cooperation on ballistic missile       defense exercises to counter North Korean provocations;        Whereas the United States views the General Security of       Military Information Agreement (GSOMIA) between the Republic       of Korea and Japan as important to United States security       interests in the region, and trilateral information sharing       as a critical aspect of cooperation between our allies;        Whereas Japanese Americans and Korean Americans have made       invaluable contributions to the security, prosperity, and       diversity of our Nation, including service as our elected       representatives in the Senate and in the House of       Representatives; and        Whereas the United States Government looks forward to       continuing to deepen our enduring partnerships with Japan and       the Republic of Korea on economic, security, and cultural       issues, as well as embracing new opportunities for bilateral       and trilateral partnerships and cooperation on emerging       regional and global challenges: Now, therefore, be it        Resolved, That the House of Representatives reaffirms the       importance of--        (1) the vital role of the alliances between the United       States and Japan and the United States and the Republic of       Korea in promoting peace, stability, and security in the       Indo-Pacific region, including through United States extended       deterrence, and reaffirms the commitment of the United States       to defend Japan, including all areas under the administration       of Japan, under Article V of the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation       and Security Between the United States of America  [[Page H7886]]       and Japan, and to defend the Republic of Korea under Article       III of the Mutual Defense Treaty Between the United States       and the Republic of Korea;        (2) a constructive and forward-looking relationship between       Japan and the Republic of Korea for United States diplomatic,       economic, and security interests and for open and inclusive       architecture to support the development of a secure, stable,       and prosperous Indo-Pacific region;        (3) strengthening and broadening diplomatic, economic,       security, and people-to-people ties between and among the       United States, Japan, and the Republic of Korea;        (4) developing and implementing a strategy to deepen the       trilateral diplomatic and security cooperation between the       United States, Japan, and the Republic of Korea, including       through diplomatic engagement, regional development, energy       security, scientific and health partnerships, educational and       cultural exchanges, missile defense, intelligence-sharing,       space, cyber, and other diplomatic and defense-related       initiatives;        (5) trilateral cooperation with members of the United       Nations Security Council and other Member States to fully and       effectively enforce sanctions against the Democratic People's       Republic of Korea (in this resolution referred to as the       ``DPRK'') and evaluate additional and meaningful new measures       toward the DPRK under Article 41 of the United Nations       Charter;        (6) trilateral cooperation to support and uphold a rules-      based trade and economic order in the Indo-Pacific region,       including the empowerment of women, which is vital for the       prosperity of all our nations;        (7) supporting the expansion of academic and cultural       exchanges among the three nations, especially efforts to       encourage Japanese and Korean students to study at       universities in the United States, and vice versa, to deepen       people-to-people ties; and        (8) continued cooperation among the governments of the       United States, Japan, and the Republic of Korea to promote       human rights.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on H. Res. 127.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this measure, and I want to start  by thanking Chairman Engel for his leadership in bringing this measure  forward today and Mr. McCaul, Mr. Sherman, and Mr. Yoho for their  partnership in demonstrating this is a bipartisan effort aimed at  strengthening the trilateral ties among the United States, Japan, and  the Republic of Korea.   For many years now, our three countries have worked hard to lay the  foundation for enduring regional security in Northeast Asia. We have  found common ground in many areas: promoting a rules-based economic  order in Asia, defending against aggression from North Korea, and  ensuring freedom of navigation and overflight, to name a few.   Recently, however, there has been an alarming deterioration of  relations between Seoul and Tokyo. Of particular concern to U.S.  interests has been the decision to end the 2015 agreement, an agreement  the U.S. worked closely with Seoul and Tokyo to reach, as well as the  politicization of bilateral trade disputes. There is no question that  we need to get this relationship back on track.   The United States, Japan, and Korea have nothing to gain from the  current trajectory, but we all have a lot to lose. American businesses  lose out when tense trade relations create uncertainty about markets  and supply chains. American security is undermined when one of our  greatest assets, our alliances, are weakened. And, of course, those who  want to see the rules-based order in Asia topple benefit from all of  this.   This resolution calls on the United States, Japan, and the Republic  of Korea to strengthen our trilateral cooperation in areas critical to  all of us and to safeguard and strengthen our longstanding diplomatic,  economic, security, and people-to-people ties.   This is a good measure that I am pleased to support, and I urge my  colleagues to do the same.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume for the purpose of closing.   Mr. Speaker, this resolution offers a positive vision for our  trilateral relationship. Its passage today reaffirms the importance of  our countries' cooperation on critical economic and security issues and  calls on Seoul, Tokyo, and Washington, collectively, to develop a  strategy to reverse the current trajectory and to work together to  build stronger ties.   It is a good resolution, and I urge my colleagues to join me in  supporting it.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  agree to the resolution (H. Res. 444) reaffirming the importance of the  United States to promote the safety, health, and well-being of refugees  and displaced persons, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows:                                H. Res. 444         Whereas the United States has historically served as the       benchmark for establishing a comprehensive response to       displacement crises around the world, as well as for       promoting the safety, health, and well-being of refugees and       displaced persons;  [[Page H7887]]         Whereas June 20 is observed as World Refugee Day, a global       day to acknowledge the courage, strength, resilience, and       determination of women, men, and children who are forced to       flee their homes due to conflict, violence, and persecution;        Whereas, in 2018, according to the United Nations High       Commissioner for Refugees--        (1) there were more than 70,800,000 displaced persons       worldwide, the worst displacement crisis in global history,       including more than 25,900,000 refugees, over 41,300,000       internally displaced persons, and 3,500,000 people seeking       asylum;        (2) on average, 37,000 people were forced from their homes       each day in the absence of peace and reconciliation in       countries where armed conflict, violence, and persecution       continue to reign;        (3) 13,600,000 new individuals and families were displaced,       the majority of whom were displaced within the borders of       their own countries;        (4) 60 percent of preventable maternal deaths occur in       situations of conflict and displacement, and 1 in 5 refugees       or displaced women in situations of humanitarian crisis       suffer sexual violence, a figure which is likely       underestimated;        (5) children accounted for about half of all refugees, only       half of them attend school;        (6) refugee children were five times more likely to be out       of school than children who are not displaced, with refugee       girls having less access to school than refugee boys;        (7) 67 percent of all refugees came from Syria,       Afghanistan, South Sudan, Myanmar, and Somalia, including       6,654,000 refugees from Syria alone;        (8) there were more than 13,000,000 forcibly displaced       Syrians, including 6,654,000 refugees, 6,184,000 internally       displaced people, and 140,000 asylum-seekers; and        (9) 84 percent of all refugees were hosted by developing       nations, and less than 1 percent of vulnerable refugees in       need of resettlement had the opportunity to resettle because       sufficient numbers of places do not exist; and        Whereas the United States resettlement program is a life-      saving solution critical to global humanitarian efforts,       which serves to strengthen global security, advance United       States foreign policy goals, and support regional host       countries while serving individuals and families in need:       Now, therefore, be it        Resolved, That the House of Representatives--        (1) reaffirms the bipartisan commitment of the United       States to promote the safety, health, education, and well-      being of the millions of refugees and displaced persons       uprooted by war, persecution, and violence in search of       peace, hope, and freedom;        (2) supports those who have risked their lives, working       either individually or for nongovernmental organizations or       international agencies such as the United Nations High       Commissioner for Refugees, to provide life-saving assistance       and protection to those displaced around the world;        (3) underscores the importance of the United States refugee       resettlement program as a critical tool for United States       global leadership to leverage foreign policy, strengthen       national and regional security, and encourage international       solidarity with host countries;        (4) calls upon the United States Secretary of State and       United States Ambassador to the United Nations to--        (A) continue supporting robust funding for refugee       protection and humanitarian response overseas and       resettlement to the United States;        (B) uphold the United States international leadership role       in responding to displacement crises with humanitarian       assistance, and restore its leadership role in the protection       of vulnerable refugee populations that endure sexual       violence, human trafficking, persecution and violence against       religious minorities, forced conscription, genocide, and       exploitation;        (C) work in partnership with the international community to       find solutions to existing conflicts, promote peace and       reconciliation, and prevent new conflicts from beginning;        (D) continue supporting the efforts of the United Nations       High Commissioner for Refugees and to advance the work of       nongovernmental organizations to protect refugees regardless       of their country of origin or religious beliefs;        (E) continue to alleviate pressures on frontline refugee       host countries that absorb the majority of the world's       refugees through humanitarian and development support; and        (F) respond to the global refugee crisis by meeting robust       refugee admissions goals; and        (5) reaffirms the goals of World Refugee Day and reiterates       the strong commitment to protect the millions of refugees who       live without material, social, or legal protections.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous materials on H. Res. 444.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I want to start by thanking the gentleman from California (Mr. Ted  Lieu) and the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Diaz-Balart) for introducing  this resolution, which affirms the importance of U.S. leadership to  assist the unprecedented number of refugees and displaced persons  around the world.   Our country has a rich history of accepting refugees from all walks  of life. It is the cornerstone of what makes America so special and why  so many of us are actually standing here today.   For decades, the United States admitted more refugees than any other  country. As a nation of immigrants, Americans have always felt a  special obligation to take in people fleeing violence and danger.   But now, precisely when we are facing a worldwide refugee crisis,  with the numbers of displaced people at a record high, the Trump  administration has drastically cut admissions. They are rejecting our  traditions of openness and willingness to help people facing great  peril by slamming the door on these innocent men, women, and children.   There are 70.8 million people who are displaced around the globe, and  the Trump administration has cut the number we are allowing into our  country to 30,000. It is a Band-Aid on a bullet wound, and it is a  moral stain on this country.   This resolution emphasizes the need for the U.S. to lead on the  global refugee crisis and calls on the Secretary of State and the U.S.  Ambassador to the United Nations to continue supporting refugees and  displaced persons. It is a good measure that I urge my colleagues to  support.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                           House of Representatives,                                    Committee of Foreign Affairs,                                 Washington, DC, September 12, 2019.      Hon Jerrold Nadler,      Committee on the Judiciary,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Nadler: I am writing to you concerning H.       Res. 444, Reaffirming the importance of the United States to       promote the safety, health, and well-being of refugees and       displaced persons. I appreciate your willingness to work       cooperatively on this legislation.        I acknowledge that provisions of the bill fall within the       jurisdiction of the Committee on the Judiciary under House       Rule X, and that your Committee will forgo action on H. Res.       444 to expedite floor consideration. I further acknowledge       that the inaction of your Committee with respect to the bill       does not waive any future jurisdictional claim over the       matters contained in the bill that fall within your       jurisdiction. I will also support the appointment of       Committee on the Judiciary conferees during any House-Senate       conference convened on this legislation.        Lastly, I will ensure that our exchange of letters is       included in the Congressional Record during floor       consideration of the bill. Thank you again for your       cooperation regarding the legislation. I look forward to       continuing to work with you as the measure moves through the       legislative process.            Sincerely,                                                    Eliot L. Engel,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                      Committee on the Judiciary,                                 Washington, DC, September 12, 2019.      Hon. Eliot L. Engel,      Chairman, Committee on Foreign Affairs,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Engel: This is to advise you that the       Committee on the Judiciary has now had an opportunity to       review the provisions in H. Res. 444, ``Reaffirming the       importance of the United States to promote the safety,       health, and well-being of refugees and displaced persons,''       that fall within our Rule X jurisdiction. I appreciate your       consulting with us on those provisions. The Judiciary       Committee has no objection to your including them in the bill       for consideration on the House floor, and to expedite that       consideration is willing to forgo action on H. Res. 444, with       the understanding that we do not thereby waive any future       jurisdictional claim over those provisions or their subject       matters.        In the event a House-Senate conference on this or similar       legislation is convened, the Judiciary Committee reserves the       right to request an appropriate number of conferees to       address any concerns with these or similar provisions that       may arise in conference.        Please place this letter into the Congressional Record       during consideration of the measure on the House floor. Thank       you for the cooperative spirit in which you have  [[Page H7888]]       worked regarding this matter and others between our       committees.            Sincerely,                                                    Jerrold Nadler,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume for the purpose of closing.   Mr. Speaker, 80 years ago, at the beginning of World War II, a ship  called the St. Louis neared America's shores. 937 passengers, almost  all Jewish refugees of the Nazis, asked for the United States to allow  them entry.   We easily could have absorbed all these people and more, but instead  we turned them away. Many were taken in by Western European countries,  but 254, more than a quarter of them, died in the Holocaust. We could  have prevented these deaths, but we didn't.   So as we consider this resolution, let's remember the lessons of the  St. Louis. I remain committed to undoing the devastation done to  America's tradition of admitting refugees. Our country's ceiling for  refugee admissions is already at a historic low. We must do more to  provide safe haven for the 70.8 million innocent people who are  displaced all around this world.   This administration's crackdown on refugees is irresponsible. It  leaves a moral stain on our Nation and will contribute to national  security threats stemming from global instability.   I urge my colleagues to support the good, bipartisan measure offered  by Mr. Lieu and Mr. Diaz-Balart.   I echo my colleague from Texas Mr. McCaul's remarks. It is a deep  honor to be here debating this measure with Mr. McCaul, and I look  forward to working with him in a bipartisan manner that is really a  unique and a proud tradition of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
