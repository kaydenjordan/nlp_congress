 Madam Speaker, I am here today to recognize the great  work of a fellow rice farmer, Nicole Montna Van Vleck. She was just  named the USA Rice Federation's 2021 Rice Farmer of the Year.   She is a third-generation rice farmer in northern California and  serves as president and CEO of her Montna Farms in Sutter County.   At Montna Farms, conservation is a priority. America's rice farmers  have a longstanding commitment to protect and preserve natural  resources.   Not only is she involved with her family's California rice operation,  but she also makes time for her passion of promoting the U.S. rice  industry.  [[Page H7619]]    She previously served as the chair of the USA Rice Farmers board of  directors, where she collaborated with growers across the country to  solve difficult policy issues and strengthen the industry.   Today, U.S. rice farmers produce more rice using less land, energy,  and water than they did just 20 years ago while providing critical  habitats for many, many species.   With leaders such as Nicole, America's rice farmers continue to serve  as leaders in farming by producing a very healthy, conservation- friendly food that generates jobs and economic opportunity in rural  areas.   Congrats, Nicole, on this great honor.                            ____________________
