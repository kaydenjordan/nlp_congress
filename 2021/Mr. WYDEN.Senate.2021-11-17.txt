 Reserving the right to object. Mr. President and  colleagues, sadly, this is the third time I have had to come to the  Senate floor to object to Republican proposals dealing with far-fetched  claims about vaccines.   And today I am struck by one issue in particular because my  background is working with senior citizens. I was the director of the  Gray Panthers at home for almost 7 years. I ran the legal aid office  for the elderly. I went into public service because of my passion for  the cause of the elderly and trying to protect their well-being and  keeping them safe.   It is almost as if this unanimous consent request ignores the  extraordinary human toll COVID-19 took on senior citizens in nursing  homes across the country: nearly 200,000 dead in nursing homes and  other long-term care facilities since the beginning of the pandemic-- mothers and fathers, grandmothers and grandfathers. That is roughly 1  in 10 residents in those nursing facilities, according to an analysis  of State and Federal data by the COVID tracking project.   How many of those senior citizens died alone, without being able to  spend their final hours or days with their loved ones? How many others  of those fortunate enough to survive the pandemic were still separated  from their family members for months and months and months in 2020?   We also know that the risks to nurses and doctor and EMTs were  massive as well. One major investigation found that more than 3,600  healthcare workers died of COVID in the first year of the pandemic--the  worst pandemic in a  [[Page S8335]]  century that our country is still wrestling with as we speak. Nobody in  this Chamber should forget that just over the last week, there have  been more than 1,000 COVID deaths per day.   And in my view, it doesn't do any good to unnecessarily suppress  access to highly effective vaccines while there is a deadly virus  circulating and mutating around the country and around the world.   Seniors who live in nursing homes and long-term care facilities are  safer when the people around them get vaccinated. And I just hope that  our colleagues will recognize the importance of that basic proposition.  When Americans are vaccinated, they and the people around them, based  overwhelmingly on the factual evidence, are less likely to die of  COVID-19. And everybody ought to be interested in stopping this virus  with these overwhelmingly effective vaccines. It shouldn't take a  requirement to get healthcare workers to protect themselves and their  patients.    As I close, I think--and, again, I am sad to have to come to the  floor and get into this issue, but because of my background working  with senior citizens, I think it is bad for senior citizens, bad for  the elderly to continue these frightening remarks about vaccines and  vaccine policies. They prolonged the pandemic. They led to more  infections and deaths.   With respect to the proposal that is before the Senate, I simply  don't believe Senators should oppose policies that would keep America's  elderly citizens safer after the pandemic has cost so many lives of  America's senior citizens. Therefore, I object.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print the  following letter in the Congressional Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:       To the Secretary of the Senate:        PN 1026, the nomination of Samuel R. Bagenstos, of       Michigan, to be General Counsel of the Department of Health       and Human Services having been referred to the Committee on       Finance, the Committee, with a quorum present, has voted on       the nomination as follows--        (1) on the question of reporting the nomination favorably       with the recommendation that the nomination be confirmed, 14       ayes to 14 noes; and        In accordance with section 3, paragraph (1)(A) of S. Res.       27 of the 117th Congress, I hereby give notice that the       Committee has not reported the nomination because of a tie       vote, and ask that this notice be printed in the Record       pursuant to the resolution.''                            ____________________
