 Madam Speaker, I have the honor and privilege to be  born as an American citizen. There are billions of people around the  world who don't have that privilege, that honor, and that blessing.   Today, I get to exercise my privilege as a Member of Congress to  bring my two grandchildren, ages 1 and 3, to the floor of the House of  Representatives. It is a very emotional moment for me because when I  see their beautiful brown eyes, I see their grandparents who were born  in another country, and I see their great-grandparents born in another  country, just like many people on this House floor whose grandparents  and great-grandparents came from Germany, Guatemala, Mexico, or any  other place on the planet.    We are fighting to do what is right, to do what is right for the gold  standard that the world has seen in the United States of America, a  place of hope and a place of future for people who are fleeing  persecution for religious reasons or otherwise to be able to come to  this country, kiss the ground that they walk on, and start anew.   My beautiful grandkids get to be American citizens because somebody  made the journey sometime before them.    Madam Speaker, I will close by saying this: The United  States of America has always been the gold standard, and that is the  argument that we are making here today.   This is not a game. We are fighting for the lives of human beings who  should have the opportunity to be just like every person on this floor:  to be allowed the freedom to be who they choose to be, who God made  them to be, by being in the greatest place on the planet. That is why  we are fighting today.                                time  1315     Madam Speaker, once again, I say I am blessed to be an  American citizen and honored to be a Member of the United States  Congress.   Today is a bittersweet day for me as, today, I was able to bring my  two grandchildren on the floor of this House, a courtesy that we afford  each other as Members of this luscious body: my 1-year-old  granddaughter, Jimena Luna De La Rosa, and my grandson, Joaquin Cruz De  La Rosa.   But, at the same time, we voted for less than what we should have for  the lives of so many men, women, and children who seek to come to the  greatest land on Earth, the United States of America.   We must do better. We must do more. And it is time that we push back  on a President who considers the gold standard to be the gold on a  toilet instead of the gold standard that we have come to be known for  around the world when it comes to having open arms of welcoming good  human beings to this great country, to be part of this great land.                            ____________________
