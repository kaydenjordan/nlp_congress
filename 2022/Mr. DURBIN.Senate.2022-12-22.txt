 I announce that the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders) is  necessarily absent.    I announce that the Senator from Virginia (Mr. Kaine) is  necessarily absent.    I announce that the Senator from New York (Mrs.  Gillibrand) is necessarily absent.    Mr. President, the logic of title 42 is a public health  response to a crisis. It was determined that foreigners coming into the  United States could be turned away under title 42, and more than a  million were last year.   Now, what has happened to the public health crisis? In June of this  year, our government announced it would no longer require COVID tests  for foreigners entering the United States. We have 22 million  international visitors each year, and now there is no longer a  requirement for testing.   So let's be honest. This is not about public health anymore. It is  our excuse for not tackling the very real challenge of coming up with a  border policy on a bipartisan basis.   I want to salute Senator Sinema and Senator Tillis for their  undertaking. I want to work with them in the future, and I think we  should reject this amendment.                          Vote on Amendment No. 6563    The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The question is on agreeing to the  amendment.    I ask for the yeas and nays.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second?   There appears to be a sufficient second.   The clerk will call the roll.   The legislative clerk called the roll.
