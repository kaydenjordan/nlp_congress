 Mr. Speaker, I rise today on  International Holocaust Remembrance Day to honor the memory of those  who were murdered during the Holocaust.   The Holocaust was the systematic, government-sponsored persecution  and murder of 6 million Jews by the Nazi regime and its collaborators.   We honor the resilience of survivors, and we rededicate ourselves to  uphold the sacred promise of ``Never Again.''   The events and results of the Holocaust were so devastating and so  extreme that we can barely imagine how such a horrendous event could  even take place. But we remember because it is an unthinkable scar on  humanity. We not only remember but, more importantly, we say ``Never  Again.''   Today, we mourn the lives of those we lost, and we celebrate those  who saved them, and we honor those who survived.   We must eradicate hatred and never become indifferent to the  suffering of  [[Page H435]]  others. On the day of remembrance, the most important thing to remember  is the humanity that exists in all of us.   May we always remember and always pledge ``Never Again.''                            ____________________
