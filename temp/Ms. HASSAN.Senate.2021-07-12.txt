 Mr. President, I am proud to recognize Maurice  Mailhot of Berlin as June's Granite Stater of the Month. Maurice, a  veteran who served in the Korean war and received two Purple Hearts  during his service, worked diligently to help redesign Veteran's  Memorial Park in Berlin. Starting with the memorial for the Spanish  American War, Maurice worked through northern New Hampshire's grueling  winter and into the spring to place each war memorial centrally and in  chronological order in the park, creating a tribute worthy of New  Hampshire's veterans.   The story of how Maurice came to redesign the park is a testament to  his service to his community and his indomitable spirit. A lifetime  member of the Veterans of Foreign Wars, VFW, Maurice was asked by his  fellow VFW members to lead and coordinate efforts to redesign Veteran's  Memorial Park in downtown Berlin. As one of the oldest members of the  group, Maurice could have said no and enjoyed his well-deserved  retirement, but instead, he not only organized the redesign but almost  singlehandedly completed the construction himself.   Maurice, working mostly alone, dug holes around each memorial so that  it could be lifted by machinery to a more optimal spot in the park.  Maurice also designed a new signpost for the memorial park, replacing  an older, wooden sign that failed to reflect the reverence that each of  the war memorials is intended to convey. The new sign, made of solid,  local granite, was donated by Maurice to honor Berlin's veteran  community.   Maurice embodies what it means to be a Granite Stater. Long after his  brave service to our country, Maurice continues to serve his community  and has gone to extraordinary lengths to honor his fellow veterans. I  am grateful not only for Maurice's service but also for his dedication  to his community, and I am honored to recognize him.                            ____________________
