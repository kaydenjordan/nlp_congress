 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize a faithful public  servant who served the city of Omaha for nearly 23 years.   Paul Kratz, who led the city's legal department as the city attorney,  retired last week to spend his days with his wife of 47 years, Diane.  He is also a wonderful friend of mine.   A 1975 graduate of the University of Nebraska College of Law, Paul  oversaw a staff of 35, including 24 attorneys, and negotiated  redevelopment agreements and managed litigation. Originally hired by  former Mayor Hal Daub, also a former Congressman here, he served during  the administrations of Mayor Mike Fahey, Mayor Jim Suttle, and current  Mayor Jean Stothert.   Mayor Stothert had this to say about Mr. Kratz:         Paul has been an important adviser, negotiator, and       taxpayer advocate for more than two decades. He has guided       mayors and city councils to make decisions that make Omaha       the great and growing city it is today.    Former Mayor Suttle said this about him:         During my time as mayor, Paul Kratz always told me what I       needed to hear, not necessarily what I wanted to hear. Out of       this foundation came a strong relationship built on trust and       honesty. In addition, it made me a better mayor and a better       leader, especially as we led the city through the two major       tragedies of a potential bankruptcy and the devastating 2011       Missouri River flood.    Former Mayor Daub said this:         Paul Kratz brought unique skills and a love of public       service to Omaha city government. Always the gentleman, his       calm and pleasant demeanor provided stability in his well-      managed office and earns broad agreement of admiring his       objectivity and wise advice. He understood and appreciated       the political ramifications of legal advice, the value of       compromise, and his insights and creative recommendations to       a multitude of tough issues were always helpful. His talent       and tenacity in public service is rare, and he will leave       very large shoes to fill.    Paul Kratz may have been the man behind the curtain in negotiations,  but his legacy will remain because of dozens of projects, including the  CHI Health Center, the Bob Kerrey Pedestrian Bridge, the TD Ameritrade  Park, and the College World Series contract.   In addition, the legacy of service of the Kratz family continues with  his children. His youngest son, Gregory Kratz, practices law in  Fairbury, Nebraska, and also serves as an officer in the Nebraska Air  National Guard. Jeff Kratz, his oldest son, serves as my legislative  director and has worked for many years serving the needs of Nebraska  taxpayers.    Paul Kratz's dedication to Nebraska has touched countless lives, and  his positive example has surely inspired another generation of his  family to carry his torch for many years to come.   We thank him for his dedicated service to our city and wish him the  best in future endeavors.                  Recognizing Steve Nelson on His Retirement     Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr. Steve Nelson,  a man who has been at the forefront of Nebraska's booming agriculture  industry and who retired on December 8 of this year as the president of  the Nebraska Farm Bureau, a position he has faithfully served since  2011.   A farmer his whole life, Steve has produced irrigated corn, hybrid  seed corn, and soybeans at his farm near Axtell in south central  Nebraska.   In his work with the Farm Bureau, both before and during his tenure  as president, Steve has helped to secure farm bills and worked to  reform and lower taxes to help protect farm and ranch families.   He has also fought to bolster animal agriculture against those who  want to end it and sought initiatives to grow Nebraska's livestock  industry.   While Texas and Nebraska may have had a rivalry on the football  field, they also have held a rivalry in livestock. During Steve's time  as president, Nebraska was ranked first for several years in commercial  red meat production.   Steve has also advocated for Nebraska's agriculture industry to other  countries, serving as a delegation member to Denmark, Japan, South  Korea, Belgium, and many others.   I am sure his wife, Elma, a retired nurse, is looking forward to  spending more time with her husband and is proud of the work he has  done, as are his kids: Scott and his wife, Amy, who farm with Steve;  and their daughter, Stacy, and her husband, Bobby, who live in Ashland.  Sadly, their daughter, Sarah, passed away unexpectedly in 2006. Of  course, his four grandchildren, I am sure, will spend more time with  grandpa on the farm.   I thank Steve for advocating and bolstering Nebraska's agriculture  industry. I thank him for his friendship and his counsel.   Madam Speaker, I wish Steve the best on his retirement from the  bureau.                            ____________________
