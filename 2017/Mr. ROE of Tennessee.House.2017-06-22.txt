 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R.  2353, the Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st  Century Act, which reauthorizes the Carl D. Perkins Career and  Technical Education Act.   Mr. Speaker, it's estimated that the U.S. spends $1.6 trillion  dollars on human capital development each year. That includes spending  on K-12 education, post-secondary education, and employer-based  training. In spite of all that spending, fewer than half of Americans  ages 25 to 64 have completed a credential beyond high school. All over  my district I hear from employers about the need for workers with the  right skills. Career and technical education is one way to do this.   I am pleased this legislation encourages states to utilize work-based  learning, but I would also note that I think we can further strengthen  it by encouraging apprenticeships, both registered and unregistered. As  our nation continues to transition itself from analog to digital, so  must our workforce. Apprenticeships are needed not only in traditional  trades, but also in emerging fields like advanced manufacturing and the  technology sector. President Trump demonstrated his commitment to this  workforce development model in a speech last week, and I look forward  to working on this model with the Chairwoman.   With these important reforms, we can help ensure the labor force of  tomorrow has the skills it needs.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Thompson) that the House suspend the  rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2353, as amended.   The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________
