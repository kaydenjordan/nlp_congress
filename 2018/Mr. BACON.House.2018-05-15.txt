 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of Peace Officers  Memorial Day and Police Week to show support of those who put their  lives on the line every day to protect Nebraskans and all Americans.  These law enforcement professionals protect the life, limb, and  property in assigned patrol areas during long hours, keeping them away  from their own families.   To those on the front line of our safety, it is not about the pay,  the hours, or the conditions they work in; it is about making the world  a better and safer place. Because of this, I have introduced three  pieces of legislation to support those who serve on the front lines.   H.R. 1970, the Kerrie Orozco Act, allows the immediate relatives of  first responders who die in the line of duty to continue to process  their immigration application in a timely manner, despite the death of  their loved one.   H.R. 5134, the STOP Straw Purchases Act, will increase punishment for  those who purchase guns for someone who is prohibited from possessing  one.   H.R. 4896 allows each State to extend the training requirements for  those carrying under the Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act from every  12 months to up to 36 months because  [[Page H3960]]  they already received extensive training.   I want to thank those who have served for their dedication to protect  and serve and to defend our communities. Your service will not be  forgotten.                            ____________________
