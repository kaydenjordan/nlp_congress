 Mr. President, I understand there is a bill at the  desk due for a second reading.    Mr. President, in order to place the bill on the  calendar under the provisions of rule XIV, I object to further  proceedings.    Mr. President, yesterday, Senators voted on an  overwhelming bipartisan basis--91 to 8--to advance critical legislation  granting the administration more of the policy tools it needs to hold  Iran accountable for its actions. We must now keep working toward final  passage. The bill makes clear that Congress recognizes that Iran's  aggressive behavior and efforts to expand its revolution across the  broader Middle East must be stopped.   Unfortunately, the Obama administration's desire to draw down our  conventional military presence from the Persian Gulf and Iraq created  the self-defeating imperative to avoid nation-state conflict at any  cost, and they were reluctant to take any action that might upset the  Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action--in other words, the so-called Iran  deal. They kept this hands-off approach even when Iran supported  terrorism and Shia militias and even as they harassed U.S. ships at  sea--actions that were not part of the nuclear program or the Iran  deal.   Advancing this bill makes the logical point that our Nation needs a  comprehensive strategy to deal with all areas of Iran's aggression. It  will give the current administration more of the tools it needs to take  a stronger approach than the previous administration. It includes new  mandatory ballistic missile sanctions, new terrorism sanctions, and a  mechanism to ensure better enforcement of the arms embargo. These  sanctions represent another key measure we can take now to keep  American families safer and to support our allies over in that region.   I want to again note the broad bipartisan support this legislation  has already received and encourage my colleagues on both sides of the  aisle to continue working together so we can pass it.                            ____________________     On another matter, Mr. President, just this week,  Ohioans learned that a major insurer will exit their State's ObamaCare  exchanges next year, leaving thousands in at least 18 counties without  a single option--not one; not a single option--  [[Page S3346]]  in the marketplace. The State's insurance department cites ObamaCare as  the reason behind this troubling news, saying:         Before the Affordable Care Act (ACA) Ohio had a very       competitive health insurance market. [But] new regulations       from [the] ACA have driven some companies out of Ohio and       made it harder for them to do business, both of which have       driven up the cost of health insurance in Ohio.    Forcing insurance options out of the marketplace, making it harder  for people to find coverage, driving up costs of health insurance-- these are the results of ObamaCare in Ohio and across the country, and  the pain is all too real for thousands of Americans like those the  President visited with just yesterday.   As he addressed a crowd in Cincinnati, the President shared the story  of a small business owner from Louisville--my hometown--who, as the  President said, is just one of the ``many victims of the ObamaCare  catastrophe'' forced on the American people. Before ObamaCare, this  Kentuckian's employees had access to multiple options for high-quality,  affordable healthcare. Now, under the failed healthcare law, these  workers face premiums that are 150 percent higher, while having fewer  choices. To make matters worse, health insurance under ObamaCare has  become so unaffordable that he now has difficulty creating new jobs  that would employ even more Kentuckians.   This Louisville man is not alone either. Just a couple of days ago,  Dr. Tom Price, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, met with  small business owners who have faced similar challenges because of  ObamaCare, people like one Kentuckian from Richmond. Here is what this  Kentuckian and founder of a CPA firm said of her experience with the  failed healthcare law:         Of all the clients that we see, there's not one good story       about ObamaCare. And it's mostly without exception, horror       stories of what has happened to themselves and their own       employees.    She, like so many others, knows that the so-called Affordable Care  Act has really been anything but affordable for too many small business  owners and their employees.   These Kentuckians' stories provide just a glimpse into the disastrous  impacts ObamaCare has had on Americans across the country. Although  some may try to paint a different picture now, ObamaCare is responsible  for the failures and the hurt it has created--not the American people,  not those of us trying to help rescue families from this ill-advised  law.   Since ObamaCare was fully enacted in 2013, premiums have increased by  an average of 105 percent and millions of Americans have lost their  plans. This year, people in just under three-quarters of counties  nationally have only one or two choices on the ObamaCare exchanges, and  the situation is likely to only get worse next year. That is why Senate  Republicans believe we must act. That is why we are working to keep our  commitment to the American people and finally provide relief from  ObamaCare. This law has failed the American people, and the status quo  is clearly unsustainable.   As Senate Republicans continue our conversations on a path forward, I  hope our Democratic colleagues will finally put aside their last-ditch  efforts to salvage this failing law that is hurting so many people in  the States they represent. It is time to face reality, no matter how  inconvenient it may be, and help those who are counting on relief from  ObamaCare.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
