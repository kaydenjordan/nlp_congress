 Mr. Chair, I rise to engage the gentleman from  Kentucky in a colloquy.   Mr. Chairman, Chicago Bridge & Iron Company, CB&I, is a major  international engineering procurement and construction firm with  headquarters in The Woodlands, Texas, where I live. Their headquarters  is a mere mile from my home.   The company employs nearly 34,000 people across the United States,  and more than 1,000 people in the Eighth Congressional District of  Texas.   CB&I built a world class petrochemical refinery in the Republic of  Colombia for Colombia's state-owned company, valued at nearly $8  billion.   A commercial dispute has arisen as a result of construction of the  refinery. And in an attempt to gain leverage, entirely unfounded and  unprincipled criminal charges have been filed against current and  former CB&I executives, both of whom are U.S. citizens.   Is it the intent of the committee, Mr. Chairman, that the Secretary  of State should report to the Committee on Appropriations on any  efforts by the Colombian Government to use its criminal process against  any United States citizen to advance commercial or political  objectives?   Is it further the intent of the committee that the Department of  State should engage with Colombia to examine and report on allegations  by United States citizens of procedural or substantive due process of  law violations relative to commercial disputes?
