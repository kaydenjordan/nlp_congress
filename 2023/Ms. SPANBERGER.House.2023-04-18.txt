 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Woodbridge  High School JROTC robotics team, which is competing in the JROTC  National Championship in Dallas.   In its very first year of existence, this team has already earned an  invitation to compete against teams across the country. After a season  of climbing the rankings, quickly learning about the skills needed to  win, and placing in statewide competitions, their hard work has paid  off.   Woodbridge High's team is the only JROTC VEX robotics team in the  entire Commonwealth. Today, they are not only making Woodbridge proud,  they are making all Virginians proud.   These Virginia cadets overcame the odds. Their determination, their  innovation, and their ability to rise above adversity make them fierce  competitors, and it puts them on a pathway to success as future leaders  of our communities, our Commonwealth, and our country.   These results are a testament to Virginia's JROTC students, their  instructors, and their parents.   Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the Vikings and wish them the best of  luck at nationals.
