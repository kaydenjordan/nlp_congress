 Madam Speaker, I rise today to commend the House for  passing H.R. 728, the bipartisan Title VIII Nursing Workforce  Reauthorization Act.   My wife, Mary, was a critical care nurse for over 45 years, and we  could tell you firsthand the role that nurses play in patient care.   But America is facing a shortage of skilled nurses. Our nursing  workforce in America is aging, and the average age is 50 years old. By  2022 there will be 1 million nursing jobs open and available.   We must find a way to encourage people to go into nursing. This bill  helps not only to recruit nurses but to provide rural and underserved  communities a competitive way to attract and keep talent.   Madam Speaker, H.R. 728 is a step forward in addressing our Nation's  growing need for nurses.                            ____________________
