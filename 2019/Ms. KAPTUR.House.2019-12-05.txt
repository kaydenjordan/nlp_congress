 Madam Speaker, next week, leaders from Ukraine, France,  Germany, and Russia will meet to discuss a road forward to peace in  Ukraine. President Zelensky was elected with a clear mandate to bring  to an end Russia's illegal war on Ukraine.   The question we must ask is: Peace at what cost to liberty?   Russia illegally invaded Ukraine, already leading to the deaths of  over 14,000 Ukrainians and the displacement of millions. The enemy of  liberty seeks to undermine democratic institutions that have secured  peace in Europe since the second World War ended.   During these sensitive negotiations, freedom lovers stand shoulder to  shoulder with the Ukrainian people. America will not tolerate any  nation that bullies Ukraine into a sham peace that only rewards Kremlin  aggression.   We join with the Ukrainian people in welcoming a just peace in  Ukraine. However, any peace agreement cannot provide legal cover for  Russia's land grab. Peace can only come to Europe when Russia respects  the integrity of Ukraine's borders.   Madam Speaker, liberty on the European Continent hangs in the  balance. Today we must do what is right and stand with Ukraine's people  so that tomorrow she will have a lasting peace and Europe, as well.                            ____________________
