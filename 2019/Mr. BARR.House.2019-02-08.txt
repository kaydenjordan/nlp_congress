 Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk.    I am in its current form.    Mr. Speaker, just a few minutes ago, we adopted, by a  recorded vote, a commonsense amendment offered by Congresswoman Mikie  Sherrill from New Jersey. Congresswoman Sherrill's amendment would  prohibit a childcare center, agency, or provider from caring for the  children of our Nation's veterans as authorized by this bill if they  employ an individual who has been convicted of a sex crime, a violent  crime, a drug felony, or another offense the VA considers appropriate.   Mr. Speaker, I applaud Congresswoman Sherrill for offering her  amendment, which I was pleased to join my colleagues in supporting on a  bipartisan basis. However, Ms. Sherrill's amendment failed to address  another troubling situation, a situation that, if this bill had gone  through regular order, may have been identified.   Specifically, Federal law allows but does not require a childcare  facility operated by a Federal agency or under contract with a Federal  agency to suspend a childcare worker if they have been charged with a  sex crime, an offense involving a child victim, a violent crime, or a  drug felony, but whose charge is still pending.   My motion to recommit, Mr. Speaker, is very simple. It would remove  that discretion and affirmatively prohibit the VA from paying a  childcare provider if they employ an individual who has been charged  with a sex offense, an offense involving a child victim, a violent  crime, a drug felony, or other offense that the Secretary determines  appropriate unless the childcare provider has suspended that individual  from having any contact with any children while on the job until the  case has been resolved.   It can take a considerable amount of time for some cases to proceed  through our criminal justice system. For example, in 2013, a nursing  assistant at the Alexandria VA Healthcare System in  [[Page H1480]]  Pineville, Louisiana, was charged with negligent homicide after a  physical altercation with a veteran patient who later died. In 2018, 5  years later, that case finally came to a resolution when the nursing  assistant pleaded no contest.   During those intervening 5 years, that nursing assistant remained as  a VA employee. He was suspended for some time, but eventually was  brought back to work while the charge was still pending. Imagine if  this individual had been caring for children.   This case illustrates the length of time the judicial process can  take and, regrettably, the need to remove the manager's discretion in  these situations.   Let me be clear, Mr. Speaker. This motion does not presuppose the  guilt of anyone who is charged with one of these crimes; rather, it  acknowledges, like we all did with Ms. Sherrill's amendment, that we  have an obligation to ensure the safety and the well-being of children  who will be cared for under this program.   Congress creates and oversees Federal agencies and the rules by which  they and their employees operate. Just as Congress created existing  guidelines giving agencies the discretion to deny employment for  convicted or charged sex offenders, so, too, can Congress remove that  discretion.                                time  1115    I am not willing to gamble with the safety of my own children, nor am  I willing to gamble with the safety of our veterans' children either.   Make no mistake, Mr. Speaker, any Member here today who votes against  this motion to recommit is voting to potentially expose children to the  care of an individual who has been charged with a serious crime,  including a sex crime against a child.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues for their support of this  commonsense motion to protect the children of the men and women who  have bravely served in uniform.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have a parliamentary inquiry.    The gentleman from Pennsylvania indicated that the effect  of this motion to recommit would kill this bill. We would like a ruling  on that, that the motion to recommit would not kill the bill, that it  would send the bill back to committee to rectify this problem that  jeopardizes the safety and well-being of the children of our veterans.   Is that true, Mr. Speaker?    I thank the Chair for the clarification, Mr. Speaker.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
