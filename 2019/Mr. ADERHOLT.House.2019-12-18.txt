 Madam Speaker, today, a duly elected President is being  impeached by the House of Representatives, by the Democrats compelled  by partisanship and not by the facts.   I am proud to stand here with President Donald Trump, and I plan to  cast my vote against both Articles of Impeachment.   It is not that the President abused his power. It is my colleagues on  the other side of the aisle who are abusing one of the most powerful  tools that has been entrusted to Congress in the Constitution by our  Founding Fathers.
