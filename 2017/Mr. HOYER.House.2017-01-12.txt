 Mr. Speaker, I rise out of a deep concern, not just for  the 30 million Americans who will lose access to health coverage and  the tens of millions of others who will see their costs rise if  Republicans repeal the Affordable Care Act without a replacement, but  as well for every American because the repeal will affect every  American, including every American who has health insurance through  their employer.   Let there be no mistake. Every American will be adversely affected by  the repeal of the Affordable Care Act. The repeal and delay plan ought  to be called repeal and deny, deny health coverage to tens of millions,  deny tax credits to small businesses to help them cover their  employees, deny those with preexisting conditions protection from high  premiums and coverage denials, and deny parents from covering their  children under age 26 through their own insurance plans. Every American  will be adversely affected if we repeal the Affordable Care Act.   I heard recently through social media from a woman in my district  whose family was able to save more than $1,200 a month because of the  ACA marketplace. Another wrote to tell me that the ACA made it possible  for her to sign up for coverage for the first time in years since she  lost her job and her employer-based insurance. When she needed to be  hospitalized this spring, having coverage saved her life.   Repeal and deny would be a disaster for our people and our economy. I  urge my Republican friends to instead work with the Democrats to  improve the Affordable Care Act.                            ____________________
