 Madam Speaker, as we stand here today,  gasoline in my hometown of Altoona, Pennsylvania, costs an average of  $4.49 per gallon; that is the highest price that we have ever paid for  gasoline.   On day one of his Presidency, Joe Biden canceled the Keystone XL  pipeline. Just last week, President Biden doubled down on his failed  policy of crushing American energy producers by canceling three key oil  and natural gas leases.   It is this reckless leadership that has led to record-breaking prices  that have made it so hard for rural Americans to afford to drive to  work, go to doctor appointments, visit relatives, or bring their kids  to a baseball game.   It is time to turn away from these failed policies and, once again,  rely on the energy that lies beneath the feet of my constituents--the  energy that comes from American coal, American oil, American natural  gas, and American Marcellus shale.   Madam Speaker, we cannot afford these high gas prices, and we cannot  afford this failed leadership.                            ____________________
