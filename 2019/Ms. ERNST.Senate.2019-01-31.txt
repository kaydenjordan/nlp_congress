 I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Thank you, Mr. President.   Today I rise on the 3-year anniversary of the tragic death of a  constituent of mine, Sarah Root. On January 31, 2016, the same day as  her college graduation, Sarah was killed in nearby Omaha, NE, by an  illegal immigrant named Edwin Mejia. He was drag racing with a blood  alcohol level more than three times the legal limit.   Despite requests by local law enforcement, Immigration and Customs  Enforcement failed to detain Mejia because of a nonsensical policy that  allows ICE to use discretion when determining whether to detain an  illegal immigrant. He posted bond, he was released, and 3 years later  remains a fugitive. It has been 3 years, and he is still a fugitive,  denying Sarah's loved ones any sense of closure or justice.   As a mom, I can't fathom the grief her family and friends continue to  feel after such a devastating loss. My own daughter is approaching the  age at which Sarah was killed.   Just 21 years old, Sarah was bright, she was gifted, she was full of  life and ready to take on the world. What a talented young lady.   She had just graduated from Bellevue University with a 4.0 GPA. She  was dedicated to her community, and she wanted to pursue a career in  criminal justice. Sarah had her whole future ahead of her, but her  opportunity to make her mark on the world was taken away from her. Her  life was tragically cut short. Yet even in death, Sarah touched the  lives of others. Sarah saved six different individuals through her  organ donation.   Sadly, what happened to Sarah Root is not an isolated incident.   We have seen this story play out time and again in the 3 years since  Sarah's killing--innocent lives taken by criminals who entered the  United States illegally through a porous border. Crimes committed by  those here illegally are truly among the most heartbreaking and  senseless, and that is because these crimes are completely preventable,  as the perpetrators should not be in the United States in the first  place.   Although nothing can bring Sarah back to her family, we can ensure  that ICE never makes this same mistake again. That is why I rise today  and, again, join with my colleagues from Iowa and Nebraska, including  the Presiding Officer; thank you again for joining in this legislation.  We are introducing Sarah's Law again in honor of Sarah Root.   Sarah's Law would require that ICE take custody of a person who is in  the country illegally and who is charged with a crime that seriously  injures another person. Sarah's Law would also require better victim  notification and amend the law to require that the Federal Government  take custody of anyone who enters the United States legally but  violated the terms of their immigration status or had their visa  revoked and is later charged with a crime that resulted in the death or  harm of another person.   President Trump implemented parts of Sarah's Law through an Executive  order in 2017, and I commend him for that. It included directing the  Secretary of Homeland Security to prioritize the removal of criminals  who are here illegally. The Executive order also establishes an office  to implement notification requirements of Sarah's Law.   Despite provisions of Sarah's Law being put into place by President  Trump's order, it is critical that the Senate take up this legislation  in order to codify these enforcement priorities so that any future  administration cannot remove these provisions. No family should ever  have to endure such a tragedy, especially one that could have been  prevented. The fact remains that Sarah's killer would not have been in  our country if it weren't for our country's broken immigration system.   Sarah's Law is commonsense reform. It recognizes the simple fact that  all criminals should be held accountable for their actions. How much  more commonsense can this be, folks? Hold criminals accountable. We  should not allow them simply to slip back into the shadows.   I recognize that the immigration debate has become a political  football. We see that every day here in Washington, DC, but the  security of our borders and enforcement of our immigration laws is not  a game. We must honor the lives of these innocent victims and do  better. We must work to stop future crimes.   I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues to fulfill  the promise I made to Sarah's loving parents, Michelle Root and Scott  Root. I will do everything I can to ensure that not one more parent has  to go through what the Roots have faced--the loss of their daughter and  the promise of justice.   Madam President, I thank you for joining me on this legislation. It  means a lot to this family and many others.                                  ______                                         By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mr. Leahy, Mrs. Murray, Mr.          Wyden, Ms. Harris, Ms. Rosen, Mrs. Shaheen, Mr. King, Mr.          Carper, Ms. Duckworth, Mr. Sanders, Mr. Bennet, Mr. Coons, Mr.          Blumenthal, Ms. Klobuchar, Mr. Reed, Mr. Kaine, Ms. Hassan, Mr.          Markey, Mr. Murphy, Mr. Menendez, Ms. Cortez Masto, Mr.          Heinrich, Mr. Udall, Mr. Cardin, Mr. Booker, Mr. Whitehouse,          Mr. Merkley, Mr. Van Hollen, Mr. Casey, Ms. Hirono, Mrs.          Gillibrand, Ms. Cantwell, Ms. Warren, Ms. Stabenow, Ms.          Baldwin, Mr. Brown, Ms. Smith, Mr. Warner, Mr. Peters, Mr.          Jones, and Mr. Schatz):   S. 292.
