 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in advance of Veterans Day, to  take a moment for our country, to take a moment and to thank those who  have served. You are going to see some faces on here, and I am just  going to highlight five individuals from my district in West Texas,  amongst the thousands who have offered to serve. Many of these are part  of the Greatest Generation and this is the greatest country in the  world, and it is because of their sacrifices.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a World War II hero, Mr. Bill  Womack of Midland, Texas, who celebrated his 100th birthday this year.  Mr. Womack joined the National Guard immediately after graduating high  school. And after the Pearl Harbor bombing, Mr. Womack became an  artilleryman stationed in North Africa and Europe.   Bill is one of the legendary Texas Liberators, a group of 488 Texans  who fought against the Nazi regime to liberate Jewish prisoners. He was  among the group of heroes who first breached the concentration camp,  Dachau, and helped bring World War II prisoners to safety.   Countless lives were saved because of the efforts and the  selflessness of Mr. Womack.                                time  1030                           Recognizing Phil George     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight a hero of mine,  Mr. Phil George, of San Angelo, Texas, a distinguished veteran and  university basketball coach.   Mr. George is a legend in my hometown of San Angelo. He is a veteran  of not only World War II and Korea, but also of Vietnam where he spent  years as an incredibly talented fighter pilot.   When our Nation called, he answered, multiple times. I cannot  overstate the sacrifices that he made both professionally and also in  his community after his service in the military. Not only is he a hero,  but he is also a mentor to so many.   He leaves a legacy in San Angelo to this day of the selfless ability  to lead others, to motivate others, to a life of service. His stories  are incredible. His faith in God is palpable, and his love for his late  wife, Toddy, and his entire family, are inspiring.   In addition to his record of service, he has an incredible record as  a basketball coach and athletic director at Angelo State University.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. George for his service to this Nation.                        Recognizing Maynard Schwertner     Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize Mr. Maynard Schwertner,  a Vietnam veteran who spent his entire life in the service of this  country, both in Vietnam and back at home.   As a well driller in Vietnam, Mr. Schwertner spent his time providing  clean water for civilians and the military. Back at home, Mr.  Schwertner has dedicated his life to serving fellow veterans, and that  includes helping establish Vietnam veterans chapters, memorials, and  support groups in San Angelo, Texas. He is a distinguished member of  the community who lives a life dedicated to supporting our Nation and  our Armed Forces.                         Recognizing Gilberto Torres     Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize Mr. Gilberto Torres for  his service in World War II. Gilberto was part of the second wave of  the D-day invasion of Normandy, the legendary amphibious invasion that  turned the tide of the war and led the allies to liberate Europe.   Tragically, when trekking through war-torn Europe, Gilberto was fired  upon and struck by enemy machine guns. He survived his injuries and was  honorably discharged, but not before earning many medals for his  heroism and his bravery, including the Purple Heart and the Bronze Star  Medal, and many more. He is in his 90s today and he hopes to visit  Normandy. I hope he can do that.                           Recognizing J.L. Stevens     Madam Speaker, I rise to recognize
