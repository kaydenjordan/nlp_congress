 Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to the legislation  before us, because today my colleagues across the aisle are trying to  tax people who want to quit smoking. It is cut and dried. That is the  issue, and it is just plain wrong.   I commend this House for the advances we have made this year when it  comes to addressing youth nicotine use. Up until this point, we have  already raised the purchasing age of tobacco products to 21 years old.  We have already increased age verification standards for the online  sales of e-cigarettes, and we are continuously performing oversight  over vaping-associated lung injuries. These are serious actions to  address serious problems.   But this bill before us today completely misses the mark and punishes  the very people who should be supported. Give me a break.   Studies show that taxing vaping products increases cigarette use, not  inhibits it. And further, this doesn't even address the root of vaping- related lung injuries, because the supporters of this bill remain  silent--silent--on black market THC products.   Federal health officials recently reported a case study that found 95  percent of vaping-related injuries were caused by using these illicit  products. This is the real problem.   Instead of overregulating this industry and overburdening taxpayers  trying to take control of their healthcare, I request that my  colleagues vote against H.R. 2339.
