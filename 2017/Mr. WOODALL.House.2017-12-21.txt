 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 670 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 670         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to take from the Speaker's table the bill (H.R.       1370) to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to require       the Secretary of Homeland Security to issue Department of       Homeland Security-wide guidance and develop training programs       as part of the Department of Homeland Security Blue Campaign,       and for other purposes, with the Senate amendment thereto,       and to consider in the House, without intervention of any       point of order, a motion offered by the chair of the       Committee on Appropriations or his designee that the House       concur in the Senate amendment with an amendment consisting       of the text of Rules Committee Print 115-52. The Senate       amendment and the motion shall be considered as read. The       motion shall be debatable for one hour equally divided and       controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the       Committee on Appropriations. The previous question shall be       considered as ordered on the motion to its adoption without       intervening motion.        Sec. 2.  Upon adoption of this resolution it shall be in       order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 4667) making       further supplemental appropriations for the fiscal year       ending September 30, 2018, for disaster assistance for       Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria, and calendar year 2017       wildfires, and for other purposes. All points of order       against consideration of the bill are waived. The amendments       printed in the report of the Committee on Rules accompanying       this resolution shall be considered as adopted. The bill, as       amended, shall be considered as read. All points of order       against provisions in the bill, as amended, are waived.       Clause 2(e) of rule XXI shall not apply during consideration       of the bill. The previous question shall be considered as       ordered on the bill, as amended, and on any further amendment       thereto, to final passage without intervening motion except:       (1) one hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the       chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on       Appropriations; and (2) one motion to recommit with or       without instructions.        Sec. 3.  On any legislative day of the first session of the       One Hundred Fifteenth Congress after December 21, 2017--         (a) the Journal of the proceedings of the previous day       shall be considered as approved; and        (b) the Chair may at any time declare the House adjourned       to meet at a date and time, within the limits of clause 4,       section 5, article I of the Constitution, to be announced by       the Chair in declaring the adjournment.        Sec. 4.  On any legislative day of the second session of       the One Hundred Fifteenth Congress before January 8, 2018--         (a) the Speaker may dispense with organizational and       legislative business;        (b) the Journal of the proceedings of the previous day       shall be considered as approved if applicable; and        (c) the Chair may at any time declare the House adjourned       to meet at a date and time, within the limits of clause 4,       section 5, article I of the Constitution, to be announced by       the Chair in declaring the adjournment.        Sec. 5.  The Speaker may appoint Members to perform the       duties of the Chair for the duration of the periods addressed       by sections 3 and 4 of this resolution as though under clause       8(a) of rule I.        Sec. 6.  Each day during the periods addressed by sections       3 and 4 of this resolution shall not constitute a calendar       day for purposes of section 7 of the War Powers Resolution       (50 U.S.C. 1546).        Sec. 7.  Each day during the periods addressed by sections       3 and 4 of this resolution shall not constitute a legislative       day for purposes of clause 7 of rule XIII.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Georgia is recognized for  1 hour.    Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to my friend from Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern),  pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During  consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose  of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to my friend from Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern),  pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During  consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose  of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Georgia?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Georgia?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, most of what you just heard from the  Reading Clerk you could have heard during the previous 4 hours of  testimony that we have been taking in the Rules Committee this morning.  I understand there was no other game in town going on this morning, so  if folks were tuning in to C-SPAN, they were treated to my friend from  Massachusetts, our ranking member from New York, our chairman from  Texas, and all the gang there on the Rules Committee as we worked  through this.   But forbid the thought if someone else had something else on their  mind this morning, I want to go through just briefly what you heard  from our Reading Clerk.   This is a single rule that provides for consideration of two  measures. The first is the Senate amendment to H.R. 1370. It is  continuing appropriations to make sure the lights stay on and the  checks go out the door. It makes in order a motion to concur in the  Senate amendment with an amendment consisting of the text of this  continuing resolution.   To debate that, Mr. Speaker, we provide an hour of debate divided  between the chair and the ranking member of the Appropriations  Committee. I think every Member of this Chamber understands the nature  of this legislation, but we provided that time nonetheless.   The second measure is H.R. 4667. It is the disaster aid package.   Mr. Speaker, as you know, this House has been working through, in a  bipartisan way, funding our neighbors who have been so dramatically  affected by disasters, whether in the Virgin Islands, in Puerto Rico,  in Florida, in Texas, or the devastating wildfires in California. This  has been a national focus, and billions of dollars have already gone  out the door to meet the initial emergency needs. This is an additional  appropriations measure.                                time  1230    It comes under a closed rule, Mr. Speaker, but it does self-execute  two amendments that had been offered: an amendment by Mrs. Mimi Walters  and an amendment by Miss Gonzalez-Colon.   It also provides for an hour of debate, equally divided between the  chair and ranking member of the Appropriations Committee, and it  provides for a motion to recommit for the minority.   The rest of what you heard from the Reading Clerk, Mr. Speaker, was  that typical language that you hear at the end of the year when Members  are going to be traveling, to allow for the housekeeping that takes  place here, to allow the House to continue to function as the  traditional authorities provided in December and January during the  district work period.   With that, Mr. Speaker, again, I think we have exhaustively debated  these issues. I urge my colleagues to support the rule. Let's get on to  the underlying measures.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   (Mr. McGOVERN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, we are strongly opposed to this rule.   Mr. Speaker, I have to say to my colleagues that this is really a sad  day, not only for the institution, but for the United States of  America.   It is frustrating that we are here today doing a third continuing  resolution. For those who are watching these proceedings, we should be  actually passing appropriations bills that fund the government for an  entire year. We shouldn't be funding the government week to week, month  to month.   Yet my Republican friends have ended up doing just that. They can't  seem to get their act together, notwithstanding they are in control of  the House of Representatives, they are in control of the United States  Senate, and they are in control of the White House. They simply cannot  govern. They are lucky that the American people can't sue them, because  they would be sued for political malpractice.   The one thing that they are supposed to do is to keep this government  running and to keep the lights on, yet we lurch from one crisis to  another crisis to another crisis to another crisis.  [[Page H10350]]    Today, what they are saying is: Let's kick the can down the road  until January 19. You know what will happen then?   Another crisis. Then we will be in the same situation, and we will  probably kick the can down the road another few weeks.   That is not the way government is supposed to run. People need  certainty, and this Congress has delivered anything but certainty. It  has to stop. It is frustrating.   A solution, if I can be so bold as to suggest a solution to dealing  with some of the problems that the Republican leadership is  confronting, might be a little bipartisanship, might be opening up this  process a little bit, might be a little bit more deliberation on the  floor of the House of Representatives.   There are a couple of ways they can govern. One is, they can govern  in a way where they respect all points of view, where they actually  respect the viewpoint of the minority, where they open the process up  so the minority can, every once in a while, offer some amendments and  offer some alternatives, where they negotiate on spending bills in good  faith, where they know they are not going to get everything and the  minority knows they are not going to get everything, but they end up in  a compromise that is good enough to get bipartisan support.   That is the way things used to be done around here. I don't know why  it is so difficult to get back to those days, but if they want the  government to run better, that is what they need to do. They have to  stop this my-way-or-the-highway approach to every single piece of  legislation that comes before this body.   My friends have had more closed rules than any other session of  Congress. This is the most closed session in the history of the  Congress. That is what this session will go down in history as being:  the most closed session in the history of Congress.   They have used martial law, they have used closed rules, they have  had emergency meetings, all to try to get us to this point where we are  kicking the can down the road for a couple of weeks. That is it.   What we should have been doing is working together not only to keep  the government open, but we ought to have been working together to  raise the caps.   Democrats want a strong national defense. We also need an equal  increase in our domestic budget, which includes critical national  security functions and commitments to hardworking families.   My friends ought to know that one-third of the nondefense domestic  budget goes to national security, veterans, homeland security, and the  State Department's and the Justice Department's counterterrorism  initiatives.   I would also say that supporting housing initiatives and investing in  education and environmental protection so that our fellow citizens  don't have to drink water that is contaminated with lead is also a part  of our national security.   We ought to have been working in a bipartisan way to resolve all of  these issues together.   We need to work to fund the opioid epidemic. What we have done in  this Congress is given lots of speeches about how terrible this opioid  epidemic is. We have talked about the need to support our local  communities.   We have done a lot of talking, but what we need to do is appropriate  the necessary money so that local communities can implement the  strategies to effectively deal with the opioid crisis in their areas.  We ought to have been focusing on that.   We need additional veterans funding. Democrats are urging Republicans  to join us to provide urgently needed resources to veterans facing a  dire shortfall at the VA, meeting our responsibility to ensure that no  veteran is left behind or denied the care and opportunities they  deserve upon return from the battlefield.    CHIP, the Children's Health Insurance Program, and community health  centers are incredibly important to us and people throughout this  country. We are calling for immediate reauthorization of these vital  initiatives, one that doesn't rob Peter to pay Paul, one that doesn't  say we are going to fund CHIP by taking money away from the prevention  program that provides moneys for immunizations and dealing with issues  like lead paint and other issues that affect our kids.   We need emergency disaster relief that is adequate to meet the needs  of all the States and localities and territories that have been  impacted by these terrible natural disasters.   We need to save Americans' endangered pensions. Millions of  hardworking Americans' pensions are at risk, and we are calling for  bipartisan action to enact a responsible reform plan to ensure that  these struggling pensions will keep on going.   We also believe that we ought to pass the bipartisan Dream Act that  we spent a lot of time in the Rules Committee talking about today.  Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi; Minority Whip Steny Hoyer; and the head  of the Hispanic Caucus, Michelle Lujan Grisham, spent many hours at the  Rules Committee today. Leader Pelosi was there for 2\1/2\ hours  testifying on the need to pass the bipartisan Dream Act.   We ought to do that before we go home for Christmas. There are  800,000-plus people whose lives are in the balance because, on  September 7, Donald Trump decided to end protection for the DREAMers.   Here is what the President I don't think appreciates and what some of  my colleagues I think don't appreciate, but we learned about this today  in the Rules Committee: we don't have until March to deal with the  Dream Act. Each and every day, people are losing their status. On  average, about 122 a day, we are told.   So there are people who are here who had the protections under DACA  who are losing their status, losing their jobs, losing their  livelihoods, and their lives have been thrown into turmoil.   Why in the world would we do that?   The majority of Americans, overwhelmingly Democrats and Republicans  and Independents, all believe we should protect the DREAMers.   We heard in the Rules Committee: Well, we need more committee  deliberation. Again, the President took their protections away on  September 7. It is now December 21.   What have you been doing?   They said: Well, the Judiciary Committee needs to do more hearings.  Well, what have they been waiting for?   The Judiciary Committee recently set up a bill, the concealed carry  reciprocity bill, which allows people from States that have almost no  standards to issue permits for people to carry concealed weapons to be  able to go to any State in this country, no matter what those States'  standards may be, basically endangering my constituents.   They brought that to the Rules Committee. They had time to bring that  before the Rules Committee and before the House. There was not a single  hearing. None.   We had this tax scam bill that we just voted on where 83 percent of  the tax breaks go to the top 1 percent of the wealthiest in this  country. Remember that bill that the President just celebrated with all  my Republican friends?   That came before this House, and there wasn't a single hearing on it.  But now we need to have hearings when it comes to protecting the  DREAMers.   It is outrageous. These DREAMers are contributing to the betterment  of our communities. We should celebrate them. We should value them.  They have served in our military. They are out front leading disaster  relief efforts, saving lives. They are working in Fortune 500  companies. They are going to school. They are valued members of our  community. And we treat them like this?   Come on. If we brought the Dream Act to the floor, it would pass with  Democratic support and a big chunk of Republican support. There is  absolutely no reason to continue to stall on this issue. All that will  happen as a result of our stalling is that more people will lose their  status, more lives will be thrown into turmoil.   I would just say to my colleagues: It is the Christmas season. This  is a time, if ever, where the spirit ought to take over, and we ought  to do something good for the American people, not just for the donors,  but for the people.   Giving a tax break to corporations and wealthy people will help with  the fundraisers, but what we need is to help these people, these  DREAMers whose lives are in the balance. We can't wait.  [[Page H10351]]    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this rule, allow  us to bring up a standalone Dream Act or an amendment that would allow  the Dream Act to be made in order, and I hope that we can get back to  regular order.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this time of year folks get rightfully exorcised about  the issues of the day.   We all came here to do something for the men and women whom we  represent back home. Every time we get to the end of a year, we think:  I have got to get it done; I have got to get it done; I have got to get  it done. I recognize those passions are going to exist.   I actually don't believe for a minute that my friend from  Massachusetts believes my vote in favor of the tax bill had anything to  do with fundraising or my donors. He might believe that about somebody  in this Chamber--I hope that he does not--but I know he doesn't believe  it about me. It just isn't true.   I have been fighting for tax reform since the day I was elected. In  fact, I ran for this job to fight for tax reform. We do the American  people a disservice when we suggest something nefarious is going on.  Sometimes we just disagree, Mr. Speaker, and those disagreements are  okay. In fact, those disagreements are expected. Our Founders intended  them, and they created this institution to sort those disagreements  out. So I hope we won't sell either ourselves or the American people  short in that regard.    But I do want to agree with my friend that this is frustrating. It is  frustrating to be here for a continuing resolution, Mr. Speaker.  Remember that we passed the National Security and Defense  Appropriations bill in July of this year. We have waited patiently for  the Senate to be able to take it up, and it has not.   We passed all of the appropriations bills, Mr. Speaker, before the  end of the fiscal year, back in September, and we have been waiting for  the Senate to take those up. It has not. It is an incredibly  frustrating time.   Now, my friend suggested a solution would be bipartisanship. I could  not agree with him more. It takes 60 votes to move something through  the Senate. I just barely have over 50 Republicans. The only way these  funding bills are going to move through the Senate is with bipartisan  support. For anyone in this Chamber to deny that is going to be to deny  the reality of math. Bipartisanship is the solution.   I remember, Mr. Speaker, when my President invited the Democratic  leadership down to the White House to work on exactly this issue a  month ago. Folks got frustrated with the tweet he sent out that morning  and decided they were going to stay home.   I understand the frustrations. What I don't understand is missing out  on an opportunity to build this bridge. It happens above my pay grade,  I am going to confess. To the 700,000 people I represent back home, Mr.  Speaker, let me go ahead and confess this deal is taking place way  above my pay grade.   But it is probably right there at the pay grade of the President of  the United States, the Speaker of the House, and the minority leader.  When folks don't show up to the table for the conversation, it makes it  harder to get there.   Is there always a good reason to stay home?   I am sure there is.   Are there more good reasons to be there?   I think the answer is: Yes.   Mr. Speaker, I will advise my friend from Massachusetts that I don't  have any speakers remaining this morning. Folks have been exhaustibly  elucidated by the 4 hours of discussion we had this morning, and I am  prepared to close when he is.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1245    Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I have a lot of concerns about the way this process is  unfolding.   And, yes, the gentleman is right. I am exorcised. I am exorcised that  we have gone through all of these gyrations, including being on hold  trying to figure out what we were going to bring to the floor all night  last night, and we end up with this: basically kicking the can down the  road for a few weeks and not dealing with some essential emergency  priorities that are a concern to most people in this country.   Again, going back to this tax bill, that is an example of where  bipartisanship might have been helpful. I don't recall a tax reform  package--I don't even want to call it reform because, basically, it is  a giveaway to big corporations and to wealthy special interests--that  has been rammed through Congress purely on a partisan basis.   But maybe it had something to do with the fact that Democrats weren't  welcome to the table.   Maybe it had to do with the fact that Democrats were locked out.   Maybe it had something to do with the fact that this so-called  conference committee was a sham and, when Democrats showed up, a deal  had already been struck.   That is not bipartisanship.   And maybe we are a little bit exorcised because, time and time again,  when people go before the Rules Committee looking to offer legitimate,  germane amendments to try to improve legislation, rather than being  able to have the opportunity to offer those amendments on the floor and  have a debate, we are shut out all the time.   Again, this Congress, this Republican Congress, this session, has the  distinction of being the most closed session in the history of our  country. That is the distinction.   So, yes, we are exorcised. And we are exorcised over the fact that,  as we are about to adjourn for Christmas, hundreds of thousands of  people, DREAMers in this country, their lives have been thrown into  turmoil. These are people who have served in our military. They have  led rescue efforts during these recent hurricanes. They contribute  greatly to our community. A majority of people in this country want  them to remain here, and we can't even get a vote on the House floor,  notwithstanding the fact that we all know that, if we brought it to the  floor, we would pass it.   Mr. Speaker, the Republican majority has prioritized their tax scam  bill over reauthorizing the Children's Health Insurance Program,  community health centers, helping DREAMers, and even funding our  government, which brings us to where we are now, days before Christmas,  scrambling to fulfill our most basic responsibilities.   But we should be doing more here than just trying to keep the lights  on. We also have a responsibility toward the hundreds of thousands of  young Americans--they are Americans in every way except on paper--who  have been betrayed by this administration. We need to pass the Dream  Act, and we need to do it now. Thirty-four of my Republican colleagues  have already spoken up and urged Speaker Ryan to help these young  people. The majority of this House is ready to do the right thing.   Mr. Speaker, here is our chance to do just that. If we defeat the  previous question, I will offer an amendment to the rule to bring up  H.R. 3440, the Dream Act. The bipartisan, bicameral legislation has the  support of the majority of this House and would pass if it were brought  up for a vote.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Massachusetts?   There was no objection.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Doggett).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, here, in these cold days outside, it is easy to create a  lot of rhetorical heat on the inside. I would argue that legislative  light is what we need more often than not.   We brought the Children's Health Insurance Program bill to the floor  that my friend from Texas just referenced, Mr. Speaker. We didn't just  bring it to the floor; we brought it through committee. We brought it  through committee, and we passed it. We brought it to the House floor,  and we passed it. We sent it to the Senate, and there it sits.   But when it passed the House floor, my friend from Texas voted  ``no.'' He voted ``no.''   Now, do I believe for a moment that is because he hates children? I  do not.   Do I believe for a moment that it is because he doesn't want folks to  have access to healthcare? I do not. I believe he had legitimate policy  reasons for deciding not to reauthorize the program then that he has  just taken to the floor and talked about the merits of reauthorizing.   It is okay to disagree on those issues, and it is even okay to  highlight those differences. What is not okay is to describe this  Chamber as a Chamber that doesn't care. What is not okay is to describe  this as a Chamber that doesn't act.   My friend was absolutely right: it is a bipartisan priority to fund  the Children's Health Insurance Program, and we did. The Senate has not  acted. It hasn't gotten the full reauthorization done. If we pass the  continuing resolution today, that funding will continue.   Let's disagree on those things that we disagree about, but let's be  honest with ourselves about the legitimacy of those disagreements.  Let's try to find more light than heat in this new year.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Hastings), my colleague on the Rules Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   My friend from Florida is a good accountability partner up on the  Rules Committee. I have learned from his intellect, and I have learned  from his experience in this Chamber. I value that, and I value his  friendship.   When he says that more closed rules have been passed in this Congress  than any other, he is absolutely right. He is absolutely right. And  that is worth talking about, as my friend does regularly in the  committee.   Unfortunately, we usually just have that half of the conversation.  What we don't talk about is that many of those closed rules were for  bills that were so well worked out in a bipartisan way in committee  that there were no amendments offered, that we had already come  together in such a collaborative, productive, admirable way that we  ought to be bragging about instead of denigrating that we didn't have  amendments that were offered.   Other bills, Mr. Speaker, were bills that might not have been so  generally agreed upon. But when my friend the chairman of the Rules  Committee sends the call out to all 435 Members of Congress and says:  If you have any ideas, bring them to the Rules Committee. For many of  those bills, Mr. Speaker, there wasn't one idea suggested, not one idea  suggested to change the underlying bill.                                time  1300    So did it come under a closed process?   Well, of course, it did, if closed means we ask everybody for all of  their ideas and no one had one, so there was no idea to debate on the  floor.   Mr. Speaker, there are so many ways that we can do better with one  another, but I would suggest to my friends that the way to do better  with one another is to build that on a foundation of trust, not a  foundation of recriminations.   We have an opportunity in this new year, Mr. Speaker, to turn a page  in this institution. I want to say, in my time on the Rules Committee,  Mr. Speaker, I have never had a chairman who worked as hard to open the  process and hear from Members as the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Sessions), the current chairman.   Time and time again, where other folks would have walked away from  the table, the chairman has stayed there to get input, to hear ideas.  Time and time again, when the process would have been truncated, he has  extended it to make sure folks had a chance to have their voice heard.   I am grateful for that, Mr. Speaker. I am grateful to the chairman  for that model that he sets in that committee.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Sessions) to speak on this rule.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, we talk a lot about what isn't in the bill today, and we  could actually talk a lot longer about what isn't in the bill. It is a  fairly narrowly focused bill, but what is in there, in addition to  funding to keep the government operating, is funding for our community  health centers that we all care so much about; is funding for the  Children's Health Insurance Program--that is a bipartisan issue across  this Chamber--is funding for the Special Diabetes Program. Mr. Speaker,  that is so important to so many families. I can go on and on and on.   Are there things that are not in this bill?   Of course there are, and I look forward to coming back with my  colleagues to address each and every one of those, but there is so much  good that is in this bill, Mr. Speaker. If we conclude this debate to  pass this rule, we can get on and make those things a reality.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Barragan).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, you likely did, as I did yesterday, get a wonderful  Christmas card from our friend from California, which I very much  appreciated. She was there with her beautiful family. I appreciate the  sincerity of her words today.   I will just remind this Chamber that we are having that conversation  for  [[Page H10356]]  one reason and one reason only. That is because, when Democrats had the  White House, the U.S. House, and the U.S. Senate, but--much like  Republicans today--didn't have 60 votes to get around the filibuster,  instead of President Obama and the Democratic leaders in the House and  the Senate trying to find a bipartisan pathway forward that could get  60 votes, they chose to craft an administrative solution, one that I  thought was illegal, one that I thought was unconstitutional, but chose  to go it alone.   Mr. Speaker, that is not a blame statement. It is an explanation of  some systemic challenges that exist in this place.   I can assure my colleagues, and I am happy to have someone disabuse  me of the notion, but I have yet to see the issue that we have solved  by blaming each other more for it. I have yet to see that pathway to  success.   The pathway I have seen is when folks turn the cameras off, when they  roll up their sleeves, when they decide they don't much care who gets  the credit for a solution, they just want to solve it.   I will put another one on my colleagues' plate, because, again, I  don't doubt their sincerity. Raju is one of my constituents. He is here  on an H1-B visa. His wife, Manju, is here on an H-4 visa. He came to  this country legally 11 years ago. Every few years, he has to renew his  visa, which costs thousands of dollars. When his visa expires, when his  driver's license expires, he has to go back and do it. He is not  complaining. That is what the law of the land said. When he agreed to  come here, he agreed to follow the law of the land. He can't start his  own business. He can't change employers. He is a captive of the visa  program that he came in on. There is no pathway, Mr. Speaker, for Raju  and Manju to get the same benefits that my colleagues are arguing so  passionately for for 800,000 additional people.   Mr. Speaker, the human stories don't begin and end with the DACA  program. Again, a problem that President Obama created; not solved, but  created.   I can go line by line by line of folks who are facing similar  challenges, and I question where the justice is when I can name  constituent after constituent after constituent who has done everything  right, who has paid every dime the government has asked, who has  applied for every piece of paperwork that the government has asked, who  has stood in every line that the government has asked, and there is no  pathway forward for them.   Let's not pretend that there is not common ground that we can come  together on. Let's confess that perhaps we haven't spent enough time  trying to do it.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky).    Mr. Speaker, I would advise the gentleman from  Massachusetts that I have no further speakers and I am prepared to  close when he is.   I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I would inquire if the gentleman has any  time to share.    Mr. Speaker, I would advise the gentleman from  Massachusetts that I have no further speakers and I am prepared to  close when he is.   I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I would inquire if the gentleman has any  time to share.    Mr. Speaker, I would advise the gentleman that it  appears I have committed all of my time.                                time  1330    Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, this has been a painful season for so  many of us, from California to Texas to Florida, Louisiana, to Puerto  Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, and so I am still here begging my  colleagues for those who are begging in Texas.   Right now, my local officials are letting my constituents from  Kashmere Gardens share in the public view how desperate they are for  housing money. So this CR and this emergency supplemental should be  separated. But the CR, on the other hand, should be funding CHIP  completely. And DACA, the DREAMers, should be protected completely.   I introduced a bill when Hurricane Harvey came for $164 billion. That  is where we should be, and I know that because of the sacrifice and  loss and devastation. But also, a DREAMer lost his life trying to  rescue my constituents, so, you see, we have a situation that should be  corrected across the board. Fix the DREAMers, but provide for the  hurricane victims.   I will say that we are going to keep on pushing beyond the $81  billion. I am glad the $1 billion that I pushed for for small  businesses is in this bill.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.   Mr. McGOVERN. I yield the gentlewoman from Texas an additional 30  seconds.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, we have 300,000 homes underwater.  Puerto Rico has no lights in homes; U.S. Virgin Islands, none, no  homes. Key West still needs debris picked up.   What my constituents are saying is, because the lights are out, we  are forgotten; because DREAMers don't have rights, they are forgotten.   So I am not going to stand here and ignore our children, 9 million of  them who need CHIP, or our DREAMers. But I am also going to say that,  whatever is in this for us, which is not a lot, I am going to keep  pushing and fighting for my constituents. And the money that we are  getting, get it to us now--now.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, it is the Christmas season, so I do want to begin by  thanking the gentleman from Georgia and the distinguished chairman of  the Rules Committee, Mr. Sessions, for always being so polite to me and  to other Democrats on the committee.   But I want to say, in all candor, that, in spite of that, we are  disrespected each and every day when our ideas are shut out and, in  turn, our constituents are disrespected. I represent the same number of  people as the Speaker of the House, as any Republican and any other  Democrat in this Chamber, and yet, routinely, we are told that our  ideas are not welcome.   I believe, Mr. Speaker, that every Member of this House, Democrats  and Republicans alike, are entitled to basic respect. We have just gone  through the most closed session in the history of our country, more  than 58 closed rules in this session. Over 1,500 amendments, both  Democratic and Republican amendments, were blocked. That is not what we  were promised by the leadership of this House.   We are disappointed with what we are dealing with today. We are  disappointed with the inaction and lack of support for the CHIP program  and the community health centers funding. We think that is inadequate.  We are disappointed that more funding isn't provided to deal with the  opioid crisis.   I could go on and on and on, but today, we are asking the Speaker to  allow a vote to help the DREAMers, men and women who came here as  children, who have served in our military, who have been first  responders saving lives in these disaster relief efforts, 91 percent  who work and pay taxes. They are important. They are valuable. We  should celebrate them.   I would say to my colleagues this is a matter of decency. The right  and decent thing to do is to help them, not rationalize inaction.   Please, please, for the sake of all that is good about our country,  join us in  [[Page H10357]]  defeating the previous question so we can have an up-or-down vote on  the Dream Act, so we can actually help these 800,000 people, these  young individuals who are giving so much to our country. It is the  right thing to do.   This is the Christmas season. I hope you are all moved to joining us  and to helping these people because, as we have learned, each and every  day that we wait, more and more of them lose their status. They lose  their jobs. Their lives are thrown into deeper turmoil.   It is wrong for us to go home and not deal with this. The decent  thing to do is to vote on the Dream Act.   Vote ``no'' on the previous question.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   There has been a lot of productivity this week. There has been a lot  of work that has gone on this week. I am looking around up there at the  dais with you, Mr. Speaker. I see a lot of unshaven faces. I'm not just  taking about Josef. I am talking about folks who intended to shave and  might not have made it home last night to get that done.   It takes an incredible amount of staff time to do this. So what Mr.  McGovern and I do up in the Rules Committee, our staffs have been there  past midnight time and time again this week and then back in at dawn.   I wish that more of the American people, Mr. Speaker, could see the  hardworking, dedicated staff, the team that goes into making all of  this possible, because I think it would make them proud. I think, in a  season like this, it would lift them up and make them feel better about  who we are as a people and the things that we could accomplish  together.   One of those young people, Mr. Speaker, is Nate Blake on the Rules  Committee. He is sitting right here behind me. He is leaving us after 5  years of service. I want to put that into perspective, Mr. Speaker.    There is not a staff member up here that can't leave today and get  better hours and more money going anywhere else in town. You will work  on Capitol Hill for one reason and one reason only, and that is that  you believe, if only you work hard enough and long enough, you would  make America just a little bit better.   Mr. Blake is one of those believers. We will miss him on the  committee. It is a great honor for me that his very last rule is to be  one of mine, and I thank him for his service.   Mr. Speaker, they often say everything's been said but not everyone  has said it. We don't need to go down that path today. This House has  done its job. It has done its job in a collaborative way. It has done  its job in a way that the American people can be proud of.   If we pass this rule, we will not only fund the government, send  money to the troops, send money to community health centers, send money  to education, send money to courts, send money to the environment; we  will not only take care of those funding responsibilities; we will also  provide those dollars needed for those men and women spread out from  Florida to Texas to California to Puerto Rico to the Virgin Islands.  There is a real human being behind each and every one of these dollars  that will go out the door today.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues, vote ``yes'' on this rule so  we can get to that underlying legislation.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak on the Rule, and H.R.  4667, one of the two underlying bills made in order.   H.R. 4667 provides $81 billion in aid to respond to the damage caused  by Hurricanes Irma and Maria, and the wildfires in California.   I thank the Speaker and Rules Committee Chairman Sessions for acting  favorably upon my request to bring this emergency disaster supplemental  to the floor for debate and vote as a stand-alone measure.   Ever since the widespread and catastrophic destruction of Hurricane  Harvey, I have been working closely with the Texas Governor and the  Hurricane Harvey Taskforce to secure the help necessary for the region  to rebuild.   I have witnessed firsthand the pain of storm-weary Houstonians who  lost their homes, their belongings, and in many cases their jobs.   They are struggling and hurting.   So this is personal to me.   The amount of funding provided in the disaster relief package is very  disappointing because it is not nearly sufficient to ameliorate the  suffering still being experienced by the people of the communities in  the areas affected by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria.   Congress has had more than three months to develop an aid package  that is commensurate to the challenge faced by the affected states and  territories in rebuilding their devastated communities.   Much of this time has been squandered by the Republican congressional  leadership's all-consuming focus on ramming through the Republican Tax  Scam legislation that gives 83 percent of its benefits to the top 1  percent, raises taxes on working and middle-class families, takes away  health insurance from 13 million Americans, explodes the deficit by  $1.5 trillion and the national debt by $1.7 trillion, and will be paid  for by 5.4 trillion in cuts to vital programs Americans depend on,  including an imminent $25 billion reduction in Medicare funding.   Mr. Speaker, on September 6, 2017, ten days after Hurricane Harvey  struck and joined by 44 of our colleagues, I introduced H.R. 3686, the  ``Hurricane Harvey Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2017,'' which  provides $174 billion in disaster relief for the areas affected by  Hurricane Harvey, the worst superstorm ever to strike the mainland  United States.   The $174 billion in funding provided by H.R. 3686 represents a  comprehensive response commensurate to the challenge; specifically, my  legislation provides relief in the following amounts:   1. Housing and Community Development Fund: $50 billion   2. FEMA Disaster Relief Fund: $35 billion   3. Army Corps of Engineers--Construction: $15 billion   4. Flood Control and Coastal Emergencies: $13 billion   5. Public Transportation Emergency Relief Program: $33 billion   6. Small Business Disaster Loans Program: $2 billion   7. Emergency Conservation Activities: $650 million   8. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration: $321 million   9. National Aeronautics and Space Administration: $50 million   10. Legal Services Corporation: $10 million   11. Army National Guard: $10 million   12. Army Corps of Engineers--Civil Investigations: $150 million   13. Coast Guard: $450 million   14. National Park Service Historic Preservation Fund: $800 million   15. EPA Environmental Programs and Management: $2.5 billion   16. EPA Hazardous Substance Superfund: $7 million   17. Leaking Underground Storage Tank Fund: $15 million   18. State and Tribal Assistance Grants: $600 million   19. Employment and Training Services: $100 million   20. Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund: $2.5 billion   21. Airport and Airway Trust Fund: $90 million   22. Federal-Aid Highways Emergency Relief Program: $6.5 billion   And that is just for Texas and the areas affected by Hurricane  Harvey; the damage wrought by Hurricane Irma in Florida, and Hurricane  Maria in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands was nearly as great in  dollar terms and equal in the level of misery and suffering inflicted  on the residents.   Mr. Speaker, on September 20, 2017, Hurricane Maria made landfall in  Puerto Rico, along the southeastern coast, near the small town of  Yabucoa.   The devastation wrought on that beautiful Caribbean oasis and its 3.5  million inhabitants, our fellow citizens of the United States, is  unimaginable, except perhaps to those of us who have lived through and  survived similar natural disasters, like Hurricanes Harvey and Katrina.   At least 48 people have died as a result of the storm as rescue and  recovery operations proceed, a number likely to rise, especially with  so many elderly, sick, and very young persons at risk.   Much of Puerto Rico's population is still without potable drinking  water and large swaths of the population still lack electrical power.   Hurricane Maria destroyed 80 percent of Puerto Rico's agricultural  industry, including banana, plantain and coffee crops, which translates  into lost income of approximately $780 million.   On August 30, 2017, Hurricane Irma struck, inflicting horrific damage  on the U.S. Virgin Islands of St. Thomas, St. Croix, and St. John, the  Caribbean nations of Barbuda, St. Maarten, Cuba, and Anguilla, before  making landfall in the Florida Keys.   In Florida alone, 6.4 million people were told to evacuate to safety,  leading to days of jammed highways and frantic searches for gasoline  amid one of the nation's largest ever emergency evacuations.   At least 124 persons are known to have lost their lives in Hurricane  Irma, more than  [[Page H10358]]  200,000 Floridians took refuge in shelters, and nearly 6.5 million  homes and businesses were without power.   Mr. Speaker, we do not yet know the full extent of the damage and  devastation suffered by our fellows Americans in Florida, the U.S.  Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico in the wake of Hurricanes Irma and  Maria.   But what we do know is that the costs of recovery and reconstruction  will be extensive, best estimates place the cost in the range of $50- $100 billion.   This puts in perspective the inadequacy of the amount of disaster  relief provided under H.R. 4667 and why more, much more, must be done.   Mr. Speaker, right now, at this very moment, approximately 300,000  Texans--in Port Arthur, in Port Aransas, in Houston and Harris County-- remain homeless or are living in substandard homes with blue tarp roofs  and infected with mold.   Today, residents of the Cashmere Gardens community are meeting with  local government officials to highlight their plight and those of other  residents in the northeastern part of Houston.   They are angry and frustrated and anxious, and who can blame them?   Mr. Speaker, this is personal to them; and it is personal to me.   That is why right now my highest priority is to ensure that funding  that has been made available expeditiously gets in the hands of local  governments so that relief can deliver the resources and services so  desperately needed.   And I will be working with the Texas General Land Office and HUD  Secretary Carson to relieve the emergency housing crisis in my  congressional district and state.   Mr. Speaker, I wish to commend the bipartisan leadership of both  Chambers, and my colleagues in the Texas congressional delegation for  their diligence and commitment in bringing this package to the floor  for debate and vote.   I thank Chairman Frelinghuysen and Ranking Member Lowey, and Speaker  Ryan and Democratic Leader Pelosi, and their Senate counterparts for  the work that has been done thus far and for their assistance in the  work that lies ahead.   I also thank Chairman Frelinghuysen and Ranking Member Lowey, and T- HUD Appropriations Subcommittee Chairman Diaz-Balart, and Energy and  Water Appropriations Subcommittee Chair Simpson and Ranking Member  Kaptur for including in the legislation before us the following  beneficial measures that I requested, including:   1. Authority to establish and implement a $1 billion pilot program to  provide small business disaster recovery grants, modeled on H.R. 3930,  the ``Hurricane Harvey Small Business Recovery Grants Act,''  legislation I introduced on October 3, 2017 and co-sponsored by 16 of  our colleagues.   2. $75 million for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' Investigations  account, which is to be used in areas affected by Hurricanes Harvey,  Irma, and Maria, and can be used to finance the $3 million Houston-Area  Watershed Assessment Study I have worked to secure and previously  approved by the House.   3. The bill also includes helpful legislative language to ensure that  in awarding CDBG-Disaster Relief funds to states, the Secretary of HUD  should to the maximum extent practicable award grants to units of local  government and public housing authorities that have the financial and  administrative capacity to manage a grant awarded under the program.   Let me describe briefly some of the major provisions contained in the  Disaster Relief Supplemental:   1. FEMA Disaster Relief Fund: $27.5 billion to provide critical  funding to assist the ongoing federal disaster response. Allows up to  $4 billion to be provided for Community Disaster Loans (CDLs).   2. Community Development Block Grants Disaster Recovery (CDBG-DR):  $26.1 billion for housing and infrastructure needs, $13.56 billion for  grants to states, tribes, and territories for unmet housing needs and  business losses.   3. $12.5 billion for mitigation efforts to help communities protect  against future disasters.   4. This funding can provide for housing elevation, buyouts in the  flood plain, water/sewer infrastructure enhancements, public  infrastructure hardening (e.g. stormproofing public buildings).   5. Federal Highway Administration's Emergency Relief: $1.4 billion to  address all current damages to federal highways caused by designated  disasters.   6. $12.11 billion for the Army Corps of Engineers to repair existing  damages by natural disasters and for studies and projects to reduce the  risk of future natural disasters, $75 million to expedite studies to  help mitigate future disaster damage.   7. 2.9 billion to help displaced students get back to school. Funding  can be used for both public and private schools.   8. $3.8 billion for agriculture assistance.   9. $1.66 billion for Small Business Administration Disaster Loans to  assist small businesses and homeowners repair or replace real estate,  personal property, machinery and equipment, and inventory and business  assets.   Mr. Speaker, there is much more work to be done in my city of  Houston, and across the areas affected by the terrible, awesome storm  that will be forever known simply as Hurricane Harvey, and by  Hurricanes Irma and Maria.   That is why I am disappointed that only $81 billion is being provided  at this time.   That is why it must be emphasized and understood that this can only  be understood as a partial response because much more funding will be  needed to provide our fellow Americans in Texas, Florida, Louisiana,  Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands the help and support they need  to restore their communities to their previous greatness.   The material previously referred to by Mr. McGovern is as follows:            An Amendment to H. Res. 670 Offered by Mr. McGovern         At the end of the resolution, add the following new       sections:         Sec. 8. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the       Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare       the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on       the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R.       3440) to authorize the cancellation of removal and adjustment       of status of certain individuals who are long-term United       States residents and who entered the United States as       children and for other purposes. The first reading of the       bill shall be dispensed with. All points of order against       consideration of the bill are waived. General debate shall be       confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on the Judiciary. After general       debate the bill shall be considered for amendment under the       five-minute rule. All points of order against provisions in       the bill are waived. At the conclusion of consideration of       the bill for amendment the Committee shall rise and report       the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been       adopted. The previous question shall be considered as ordered       on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without       intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or       without instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and       reports that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then       on the next legislative day the House shall, immediately       after the third daily order of business under clause 1 of       rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further       consideration of the bill.        Sec. 9. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 3440.                                   ____           The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a       vote about what the House should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to       a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to       yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first       recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no       substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''       But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the       Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in       the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,       page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous       question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally       not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member       controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule . . . When the       motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the       time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering       the previous question. That Member, because he then controls       the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for       the purpose of amendment.''  [[Page H10359]]         In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on       Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further       debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:       ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a       resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control       shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous       question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who       controls the time for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools for those who oppose the Republican       majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the       opportunity to offer an alternative plan.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous  question.   The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that  the ayes appeared to have it,   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
