 Mr. Speaker, I rise today because I believe this  Congress has a chance to do what is right.   I am an unflinching optimist, and I believe that we can come together  to make our communities safer and more just for all.   As the first woman and mother in history to represent my district in  Congress, and as an attorney that has worked for our Nation's top law  enforcement agency, keeping our communities safe is a top priority of  mine because violence, of all kinds, takes a massive toll on the people  we represent.   Just 2 years ago, a friend of mine, Romito Jones, was shot and killed  in our neighborhood on the southeast side of Grand Rapids. He was a  father of five and a friend to my family.   Just last month, a recently elected member of the Muskegon Heights  school board, Julius Muhammad, was shot and killed in his home. He was  a dad and a public servant. He was loved and admired by his community.   Today I honor their lives as I strive for safer communities for all.   We must come together to enact commonsense reforms to keep our  neighborhoods safe, support our law enforcement, and support fair and  equitable enforcement of the law.   I am ready to get to work, and I invite all of my colleagues to join  me.                            ____________________
