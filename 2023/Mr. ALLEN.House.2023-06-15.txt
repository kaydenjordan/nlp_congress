 Mr. Speaker, this week I was proud to vote in support of  the REINS Act to curb extreme executive overreach.   President Biden and his administration have made a constant habit of  sidestepping Congress, the people's House, to enact their radical  agenda, costing the American people billions of dollars of their hard- earned money.   Let's take a look at the list: President Biden's student loan  bailout, shutting down the Keystone pipeline, banning oil and gas  leases, mandating climate risk disclosures, and a radical ESG rule that  jeopardizes Americans' retirement returns, all done without the consent  of Congress.   In year one of the Biden Presidency, the administration finalized  more than $200 billion in new regulatory costs; $200 billion. Even  worse, in 2022, the administration proposed more than $1 trillion in  new regulations. It is no wonder why we are fighting inflation.   The REINS Act will put an end to the insanity by requiring the House  and Senate to approve any major rule before going into effect. It is  high time to end the era of Federal overreach in Washington, and this  bill does just that.                            ____________________
