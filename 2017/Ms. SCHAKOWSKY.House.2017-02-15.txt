 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding and  her leadership on the Working Families Agenda.   Get this: Americans over 44 years of age are more afraid of running  out of income in retirement than they are afraid of dying. Median  retirement savings in the United States of America is only $2,500. We  have a retirement crisis. Only my Republican colleagues haven't gotten  the message.   The New York Times asked: ``Who'd Want to Limit Retirement Plans?''  and answered with two words: ``House Republicans.''   It isn't just that Republicans haven't made retirement security a  priority; they are actually working against it. They oppose the rule  that saves retirees up to $17 billion a year, lost to bad investment  advice, a rule that simply requires financial advisers to give advice  that is in the client's best interest, not their own.   Today Republicans are trying to prevent States and cities from  expanding private retirement savings. Nearly 1.3 million workers in my  State, Illinois, lack job-based retirement savings options. State  Senator Daniel Biss won passage of the Illinois Secure Choice Savings  Program that creates a retirement plan with automatic deductions that  has proven successful in increasing individual retirement savings. Last  summer, the U.S. Department of Labor acted to move this plan forward  for Illinois and other States.   Today we face Republican efforts to block action, to overturn the  Department of Labor rule and jeopardize the financial security of 1.3  million Illinois workers and millions of others across the country  without access to job-based retirement plans.   There is a saying: ``Lead, follow, or get out of the way.'' If my  Republican colleagues won't lead or follow, at least they should get  out of Illinois' way.   I urge a ``no'' vote.
