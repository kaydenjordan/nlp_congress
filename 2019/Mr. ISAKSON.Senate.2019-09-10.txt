 Madam President, we have a second to certify our growth  in the VA by nominating James Byrne and approving his appointment. We  have all worked hard to see that the VA is responsive. We get good news  in the papers, not bad news. We are helping our veterans get back to  work. The VA is working. We have some problems, but we have a lot fewer  than we used to have. A lot of that is because of James Byrne. He has  been working already, and we need to make him permanent. Please help us  to confirm James Byrne.   I yield to the Senator from Montana, Mr. Tester.    I yield the floor.                            ____________________
