 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Paycheck  Fairness Act, legislation that I have introduced in every Congress  since 1997.   Since then, we have pushed and battled to strengthen the Equal Pay  Act of 1963. We launched, side by side, into the fray to elevate pay  discrimination, to emphasize how central its impact is to working  families.   I cannot tell you how difficult it has been to break through on  something so simple; so simple. Men and women in the same job deserve  the same pay. It is a principle that we adhere to in this Congress, and  I don't believe anyone would challenge it. The same is true of the U.S.  military.   Last month, we recognized Equal Pay Day on March 24, which is the day  into the current year that women must work to meet the wages earned by  men in the previous year.   The National Committee on Pay Equity tells us, at its lowest point in  1973, full-time, working women earned a median of 56.6 cents to every  dollar that full-time working men earned. Today, women who work full- time, year-round are paid, on average, only 82 cents for every dollar  paid to men.   The gap exists in every State, regardless of geography, occupation,  education, or work patterns. And it is worse for women of color.  Latinas are typically paid 55 cents; Native American women 60 cents;  Black women 63 cents; Asian American and Pacific Islander women are  paid as little as 52 cents.   This wage disparity costs the average American woman and her family  an estimated $400,000 to $2 million, impacting Social Security benefits  and pensions.   Today, the issue and the environment have collided. This pandemic has  brought out the depth of our problem, exposed existing inequalities,  and threatened women's economic security at a disproportionate rate.  Women have lost more than five million jobs; and as we seek to rebuild  our economy, let us remember that the pay gap hurts not only women, but  also the families who depend on them.   The Paycheck Fairness Act is a bipartisan piece of legislation, which  has the support of every member of the Democratic Caucus, as well as  three Republicans. It would toughen the remedies in the Equal Pay Act  of 1963 to give America's working women the opportunity to fight wage  discrimination and receive the paycheck they have rightfully earned.   It would require employers to prove that pay disparities exist for  legitimate, job-related reasons; ban retaliation against workers who  discuss their wages; it facilitates a wronged worker's participation in  a class action suit; and it prohibits employers from seeking the salary  history of prospective employees.   And by now, we are all familiar with the case of Lilly Ledbetter. Her  bosses said: ``Their plant did not need women; that women did not help,  and, in fact, they caused problems.''   Well, a jury found that, yes, Lilly Ledbetter had been discriminated  against, and awarded her $3.8 million in back pay and damages, which  the Supreme Court eliminated. She received nothing, as it closed the  courtroom door to all women.   We, the Congress, reopened that door with the Lilly Ledbetter Fair  Pay Act. It reversed the Supreme Court's decision. It was a court  access case, but it  [[Page H1804]]  did not address the underlying issue of pay discrimination.   President Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1956, in his State of the Union  address, said: ``Legislation to apply the principle of equal pay for  equal work without discrimination because of sex is a matter of simple  justice. I earnestly urge the Congress to move swiftly to implement  these needed labor measures.''   When President Kennedy signed the Equal Pay Act into law nearly 58  years ago, he said: ``It is a first step. It affirms our determination  that when women enter the labor force, they will find equality in their  pay envelopes.''   The Paycheck Fairness Act is the next step. It simply brings the  Equal Pay Act into line with the remedies already available for those  who are subject to other forms of employment discrimination. That is  it, pure and simple.   We have passed paycheck fairness through this House in 2008, 2009,  2019. But, now, in the 117th Congress in which we welcomed the most  women in our history, we must get it into law. We have the opportunity  to make good on that promise that Presidents of both parties have made.  We need to seize that moment.   It is time for us to say that the work that women do in our society  today is valued and respected, and the contribution that we make, if it  is good enough for the women in the House of Representatives, then it  is good enough for women all over the United States.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter supporting the Paycheck  Fairness Act by a broad coalition of organizations that promote  economic opportunity for women.                                                  February 3, 2021.     Co-Sponsor and Support Swift Passage of the Paycheck Fairness Act         Dear Member of Congress: As members of a broad coalition of       organizations that promote economic opportunity for women and       vigorous enforcement of antidiscrimination laws, we strongly       urge you to co-sponsor and push for swift passage of the       Paycheck Fairness Act as a top priority of the 117th       Congress. Despite federal and state equal pay laws, gender       pay gaps persist, and earnings lost to these gaps are       exacerbating the financial effects of COVID-19, falling       particularly heavily on women of color and the families who       depend on their income. This legislation offers a much needed       update to the Equal Pay Act of 1963 by providing new tools to       battle pervasive pay gaps and to challenge discrimination.        The COVID-19 pandemic and systemic racism have exposed how       the work performed primarily by women, and particularly Black       and brown women, has long been and continues to be       undervalued and underpaid, even as the rest of the country is       newly recognizing the essential nature of this work. Black       women, Latinas, and other women of color are especially       likely to be on the front lines of the crisis, risking their       lives in jobs in health care, child care, and grocery stores;       they are also being paid less than their male counterparts.       At the same time, women in this country lost more than 5       million jobs in 2020; indeed, women accounted for 100% of the       jobs lost in December 2020. The unemployment rate for Black       women and Latinas remains exceptionally high. These high       jobless numbers threaten to exacerbate gender wage gaps when       women regain employment. We cannot build back an economy that       works for everyone without ensuring that all women can work       with equality, safety, and dignity, starting with pay equity.        There is no more fitting way to begin this session than by       making real, concrete progress in ensuring all women receive       fair pay. The Paycheck Fairness Act updates and strengthens       the Equal Pay Act of 1963 to ensure that it provides robust       protection against sex-based pay discrimination. Among other       provisions, this comprehensive bill bars retaliation against       workers who voluntarily discuss or disclose their wages. It       closes loopholes that have allowed employers to pay women       less than men for the same work without any important       business justification related to the job. It ensures women       can receive the same robust remedies for sex-based pay       discrimination that are currently available to those       subjected to discrimination based on race and ethnicity. It       prohibits employers from relying on salary history in       determining future pay, so that pay discrimination does not       follow women from job to job. And it also provides much       needed training and technical assistance, as well as data       collection and research.        Women are increasingly the primary or co-breadwinner in       their families and cannot afford to be shortchanged any       longer. Women working full-time, year-round are typically       paid only 82 cents for every dollar paid to men. But for       every dollar paid to their white, non-Hispanic male       counterparts, Black women only make 63 cents, Native women       only 60 cents, and Latinas only 55 cents. While Asian       American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) women make 87 cents for       every dollar paid to white, non-Hispanic men, women in many       AAPI communities experience drastically wider pay gaps.       Furthermore, moms are paid less than dads. And even when       controlling for factors, such as education and experience,       the pay gaps persist and start early in women's careers and       contribute to a wealth gap that follows them throughout their       lifetimes. These pay gaps can be addressed only if workers       have the legal tools necessary to challenge discrimination       and employers are provided with effective incentives and       technical assistance to comply with the law.        We recently commemorated the twelfth anniversary of the       enactment of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. That vital law       rectified the Supreme Court's harmful decision in Ledbetter       v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company. The law helps to ensure       that individuals subjected to unlawful compensation       discrimination are able to have their day in court and       effectively assert their rights under federal       antidiscrimination laws. But the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay       Act, critical as it is, is only one step on the path to       ensuring women receive equal pay for equal work. It's time to       take the next step toward achieving equal pay. We urge you to       prioritize the Paycheck Fairness Act in the 117th Congress by       co-sponsoring and urging swift passage of this legislation,       taking up the cause of Lilly Ledbetter and all those who have       fought for equal pay.

Madam Speaker, the gender pay gap is a pervasive problem  that demands thoughtful, multipronged solutions. The Paycheck Fairness  Act represents a comprehensive response to the shortcomings of existing  law and addresses the holes that have emerged over time.   Representative Stefanik's substitute, the Wage Equity Act, is exactly  what the Paycheck Fairness Act has been fighting over the years. It  purports to offer protections, but, in reality, it creates loopholes  that give a wink and a nod to discrimination. Not only would it offer  empty protections, it would erode existing protections already in  place.   The substitute includes inadequate protections for workers who  discuss or disclose wages. While ostensibly protecting employees who  disclose or discuss that pay, it allows employers to place limitations  on when, where, and how employees may do so, negating the point of the  provision.   Madam Speaker, you cannot remedy pay discrimination if you have no  idea that you are making less than the man across the hall. When  workers fear retaliation for talking about their pay, any wage gap they  face is likely to continue to grow undiscovered in the shadows.   More egregiously, there is no mechanism for enforcement, as it would  allow employers who conduct self-designed pay audits to escape  accountability for unlawful pay disparities and deny a worker a remedy.   I think it bears repeating that corporations do not feel free to sell  us spoiled meat, lock our daughters up in ninth-floor sweatshops with  no fire escapes, employ our underage sons in coal mines, force us to  work 13-hour shifts without overtime or a break because corporations  experienced a moment of Zen and decided to evolve.   No. They were forced into greater accountability and social concern  by the legitimate actions of a democratic government. In other words,  if we depend on goodwill or a self-audit, then we are all screwed.   This amendment seeks to destroy the entire purpose of the bill and  allows companies to evade accountability for violating the law.   Madam Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment and a ``yes''  vote for the Paycheck Fairness Act.
