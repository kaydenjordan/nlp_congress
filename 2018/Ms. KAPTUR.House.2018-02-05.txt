 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the bipartisan  Ukraine Cybersecurity Cooperation Act of 2017. Let me first thank the  hard work of Representative Brian Fitzpatrick, fellow Ukraine Caucus  chair and Representative Brendan Boyle, as well as Chairman Ed Royce  and the Ranking Member Eliot Engel for their support.   As we know all too well, Russian aggression towards Ukraine is not a  new threat. Russia's hostile behavior continues to threaten Ukraine's  freedom and destabilize its critical infrastructure and institutions.  Since Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014, over 10,000 people  have been killed and two million people have been uprooted, internally  displaced. Ukraine finds herself on the front lines of hybrid war and  an assault on her sovereignty--this time in the form of cyber warfare.   We as Americans have also been attacked by this insidious form of  hybrid warfare. It is our duty to help other nations resist threat to  liberty. To this day, the fallout of Russian interference in our sacred  electoral process continues to plague our political landscape. At least  21 states, including Ohio, reported Russian hacking attempts in the  2016 election. Experts in the intelligence and defense communities have  all warned that this threat is not going away. In fact, cybersecurity  threats tested in Ukraine will likely be turned on the U.S. in  elections this year.   By supporting this bill, we provide Ukraine with critical upgraded  safeguards she needs to protect herself, her institutions, and her  liberty. Upgrading Ukraine's current technological infrastructure  grants her freedom from Russian technology. It gives her the ability to  share sensitive information on an international level. And, we will  strengthen our own cybersecurity through lessons learned from increased  cooperation with Ukraine.   Ukraine and her people have every right to sovereignty and self- determination as they seek a more democratic future. It is paramount  that the United States uphold our longstanding commitments to our  allies, as hybrid threats loom. This measure will provide the citizens  of Ukraine with the support they need to defend themselves. That's why  I strongly support this measure, and I urge my colleagues to do the  same.
