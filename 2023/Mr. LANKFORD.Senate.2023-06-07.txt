 Madam President, the White House and the Department of  Homeland Security released a press release yesterday to talk about what  is happening on the border currently, especially on our southwest land  border. I wanted to read just one line from the press release that was  put out by Homeland Security yesterday, where they state in their press  release:         The administration's plan is working as intended. [The       administration's plan is working as intended.]    Now, what they were referencing was what is happening on the  southwest border and the number of people who are crossing our border  that are being ``encountered'' at the border. That is the new term from  Homeland Security for the number of people who cross our border  illegally. They are ``encountered.''   In the past, those individuals--and what I mean ``in the past,'' I  mean the past 2 years. Those individuals crossed our southern border  and asked for asylum because they were told by the cartels what to say.  The cartels would say to each individual as they crossed and paid the  fee to the cartel: Tell them you are afraid in your country.   They would cross the border. They would say the words, ``I am afraid  in my country.'' They would be given an asylum hearing date in the  future. That date is anywhere--depending on where they go in the  country--between 3 years and 7 years in the future. And they are told  they can go anywhere in the United States they want to travel during  that time period.   Now, that is what it used to be. The administration came forward and  said: We have a whole new plan. Our new plan post-title 42--that is the  end of the pandemic restrictions--our new plan is that we are going to  tell people there is a rebuttable presumption that you don't qualify,  so don't come.   So here is what has happened. Now you cross the border--and there are  two ways you can cross the border. Now, this is the new plan: You can  either fill out the paperwork before you come or, when you cross, we  will fill out the paperwork for you.   If we fill out the paperwork for you, it will take longer for you to  come into the country and cross the border or you can fill out the  paperwork before. What is that called? It is called CBP One. It is an  app that now you can download from anywhere in the world, fill out your  paperwork ahead of time, and when you cross, they will quickly expedite  you into the country for your asylum hearing anywhere between 3 and 7  years in the future or, if you cross between ports of entry, then it is  going to take you probably another 8 hours or so for them to get all  the paperwork filled out for you, and then you will still be released  into the country and have a hearing 3 to 7 years in the future.   What does the administration mean when they said the administration's  plan is working as intended? They have now split up the numbers, and  they have announced: Look, our numbers are less than 4,000 people now  who are crossing the border illegally.   It was just 10,000 people 2 weeks ago. Of course, what they didn't  say was the week before that, it was right at 5,000. But what they are  not saying is they have actually taken--if you fill out on the app  ahead of time, they don't count those numbers anymore.   Here is what has happened. We have the same number of people  illegally crossing our border this week that we had 3 weeks ago and  that we had 3 weeks before that.   The administration now has just split up the numbers, how they are  counted. If you fill out the app in advance or we fill it out for you  when you cross the border, those are now two separate sets at the  border, but they are still the same exact people who are crossing into  the country. Except when I was at the border just 2 weeks ago and asked  how all of this is working, I asked a very simple question: What are  you noticing that is different now than what was different before?   The response from CBP was: Well, it is the same. People are still  moving in. They are allowed to be able to come into the country between  ports of entry or at ports of entry, that is the same. But what has  changed is a dramatic increase in the number of non-Spanish speakers  who are coming.   And the first words that I had from several different individuals I  spoke with, both from nongovernmental organizations and from our  Federal law enforcement when I was there last, was that we are worried  for our national security. In fact, Federal law enforcement used the  exact term. We have military-age, single adult men coming into our  country from non-Spanish-speaking nations in the Middle East, West  Africa, Russia, and China now in much higher numbers than we had  before.    Just to set the context of what is happening now while the  administration is saying the plan is ``working as intended,'' here is  what has happened: In the first 2 weeks of the end of title 42, we had  1,000 men from Mauritania, West Africa, come across our border--1,000.  Exactly none of them do we have criminal background information on-- none of them.   Let me just compare 2 years ago to this year. So far this year, and  this year is not over--if I look at Mauritania, we had 90 people 2  years ago from Mauritania; so far this year, 4,300--so far this year.  By the way, that doesn't include the May number that I was just saying.  That is 1,000 more. So we are well in excess of 5,000 this year so far  from Mauritania.   From Iran, it has gone from 62 to almost 300.  [[Page S1998]]    From Syria, and we have no background information on any of the folks  coming in from Syria, we have had right at 200 people come in from  Syria so far this year.   From Pakistan, we have had over 500.   From Somalia, we have had over 1,600.   From China, we have had right at 10,000 people this year. If I go  back 2 years ago, from China, it was 450.   Yes, there is a huge shift that is actually occurring of Middle  Eastern men, North African men, men from Russia and from China who are  accelerating across our southern border, because right now apparently  the administration's plan is ``working as intended,'' and we have  thousands of people who are still crossing our border.   I have heard even some recent reporting in the news on this that the  numbers are way down. The numbers are way down. But apparently the  press doesn't take the time to be able to look and see that the numbers  have actually been split out into two different categories. The numbers  are not down. In fact, the numbers right now would average somewhere  around 450,000 a month--right now.   The highest month during the peak of the immigration surge under the  Obama administration, the highest month that happened during that time  period when there was chaos and cameras that were focused on the  Southwest border--the highest month was 69,000. The administration is  now saying ``Our plan is working'' when there are 150,000 a month  coming across the border.   It is not working. It is fudging the numbers. It is trying to tell  the American people: Look away. It is trying to say ``We are doing a  whole new set of enforcement on the border'' when really what is  happening is that people are being released into the country the same  as they have always been released into the country for the last 2  years. The difference is, they are told: Hey, if you show up for your  hearing 3 years from now, we may be more strict to you. But at the  border, they are moving through just the same, being waved through.   I bring this up to this body to ask a simple question: Have we  learned nothing from 9/11? Thousands of Americans died because a group  of individuals overstayed their visas here in the United States. No one  went to check on them. No one went to track them and just ignored the  realities of what could be there.   We have a huge national security risk, and God forbid we have a huge  terrorist attack again just because we want to tell everyone ``The plan  is working as intended. Look away. The numbers are down'' when we  literally have people coming in from all over the world who may be  coming to work here or may be coming in for nefarious reasons. We don't  know. We literally don't know if these folks are fleeing poverty or  fleeing justice because we have no criminal history on these  individuals coming in from around the world--none.   In fact, as frightening as it may seem, right now the current policy  happening at the southwest border is if someone shows up without any  identification or with a photocopy of an ID that they say is theirs, it  is being accepted as real.   They can literally come in and say, I am from Mauritania or Somalia  or Syria or Iran or China or Russia, and this is my name, and they have  no ID. We are creating for them a new ID card that is an American ID  card and handing them a new identity and saying ``Show up at your  hearing 3 years from now, in the future. Travel anywhere you want in  the country. You can use this card to fly, to travel, or to show as  ID'' when we literally have no idea if that is what their name is or  that is the country they are from. That is the plan that is ``working  as intended'' right now on our southwest border. I think it is a huge  national security vulnerability.   We need to talk about asylum. We need to talk about how we are going  to define the national security risks of the United States. This body  needs to have a real conversation about what legal immigration looks  like and what we are going to say to the world about illegal  immigration.   If any of these individuals were to travel into Canada right now, the  Canadians already have a clear law dealing with asylum. These folks  would not be accepted into Canada because it would violate their basic  asylum rules on how they handle it. But they are being literally waved  into our country with no ID, with no criminal background check, and  released into the country under the promise that they will show up at a  hearing 3 to 7 years in the future. Can somebody explain to me why that  is logical?   If these same folks moved into Germany and said they wanted to claim  asylum, Germany would put them in what they call a humanitarian center,  where they would stay. They wouldn't be released into Germany. Germany  would never do that. They would stay in that one humanitarian area  while they process through their asylum claim, and if they didn't  qualify for asylum, they would be sent back to their original country,  and that is usually within about 2 to 3 months. We are instead handing  them a brandnew ID, which we have no idea is their real name, releasing  them into the country, and saying: We hope you show up 3 to 7 years  from now at your hearing. Can somebody tell me that is wise?   I am not asking for something crazy or something, quite frankly, the  rest of the world doesn't already do, but for some reason, this body is  locked up to talk about what everyone sees as obvious, and we refuse to  even debate the issues of asylum and national security.   This is not caustic and hard; this is reasonable, where most  Americans are. But we are not even talking about it on the floor right  now, but we should because it matters. The national security of our  country is counting on us having adult conversations about the  direction of our country, and I would encourage us to get started on  this sooner rather than later for the sake of our future as a nation.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
