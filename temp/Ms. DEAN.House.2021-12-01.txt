 Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to introduce H.R. 5677, which  makes technical amendments to the United States Code to ensure clarity  and accessibility of our laws.   As Members of Congress, we have a duty to oversee the revision and  codification of our laws, making these types of bills incredibly  important. My bill edits titles 2, 50, and 52 of the United States  Code, the Americans with Disabilities Act, War and National Defense,  and Voting and Elections, respectively.   Though it is important to introduce new laws in Congress, it is  equally important to look back and ensure existing laws keep up with  our times. That is why my bill will ensure there is uniformity in our  code, making necessary technical updates to ensure accuracy.   The updated code must be maintained in a bipartisan manner. These  discrete changes are important in maintaining order in these three  important codes, for example, and order and justice in this country  under the law, allowing for clearer and more accessible laws for all  Americans.   This seemingly routine process is nothing less than urgent and  essential. We are ensuring our laws are accurate and clear. It is  required in the pursuit of justice.   I thank our committee for the work in maintaining our laws, and I  especially thank the Office of the Law Revision Counsel for their work.  I ask everyone to vote in favor of this bill.    Madam Speaker, 2 weeks ago, Lower Merion, Pennsylvania, and  the entire Montgomery County community lost a distinguished educator  and community leader, Lower Merion High School Principal Sean Hughes.   Coming from Harleysville, Principal Hughes dedicated himself to  Montgomery County throughout his life, serving as a teacher and  athletic director, and last serving as principal for 14 years.   As a teacher, Mr. Hughes taught with compassion, personality, and an  open-door policy, shaping thousands of students' lives with his  kindness and leadership. One student called him ``the light of the  school.''   His trademark phrase was: ``Character counts.'' If the outpouring of  love and support from the Lower Merion community, from students past  and present, is any indication, Mr. Hughes' character was one to  emulate.   His life was taken too soon. May his memory and light continue in the  hearts and minds of his students, peers, and family.   Though it is profoundly difficult, I pray for his family, especially  his wife, Kristi, and their children, Jack, Nolan, and Kate, and the  Lower Merion High School to find solace in the thousands of lives he  has touched.   Rest in peace, Principal Hughes. Your character has counted and will  continue to. May your memory be a blessing.                            ____________________
