 Reserving the right to object, Madam Speaker.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        May 28, 2019, on page H4173, the following appeared:  Reserving the right to  object, Madam Speaker.    ========================= END NOTE =========================       I was seeking recognition.                            Parliamentary Inquiry     Madam Speaker, I have a parliamentary inquiry.    Madam Speaker, I asked to be recognized before the  gentleman objected. Do I not have precedence of recognition?    Madam Speaker, reserving the right to object. I, of  course, will not object, and I urge my friends in this body not to  object.  [[Page H4174]]    I urge them not to object because millions of people are at risk.  This bill, passed in January to the Senate, which we passed some 3 or 4  weeks ago, needs to be passed as soon as possible for the welfare of  our people in this country who have been attacked by natural disasters.   Madam Speaker, I urge my friends on the other side of the aisle not  to object.
