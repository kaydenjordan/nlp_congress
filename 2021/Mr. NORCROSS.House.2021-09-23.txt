 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairwoman for yielding, and I  appreciate her bringing this important bill to the floor in such a  timely manner.   I rise today in speaking of the importance of defending innocent  lives from indiscriminate attacks, because that is exactly what Iron  Dome does. It is a purely defensive system that safeguards lives and  thousands of civilians living in Israel, many of whom have friends and  family right in my south Jersey district.   This shouldn't be a partisan issue, and I hear that right before they  start blaming the other side. My God, the reason why it didn't come up  before is because they wouldn't vote for it. We couldn't count on them.  Just like we can't count on them on so many issues.   This saves lives. 300,000 of them are American citizens living in  Israel. You heard the number, 4,000 shots. Very few people lost their  lives. Still too many. Imagine how many would have died if this system  were not in place.   This is just so important for our relationship with Israel. If we  fail to stand by our closest allies what message are we sending to  others?   So protecting civilian lives through this defensive system is a  nonpartisan issue, and we must support it. I urge all my colleagues to  support this measure.
