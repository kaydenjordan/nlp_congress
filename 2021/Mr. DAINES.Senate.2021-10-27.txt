 Mr. President, today I have the honor of  recognizing Madison County commissioner Jim Hart for his 15 years of  service to the citizens of Madison County, MT.   Jim was sworn in on January 1, 2007, and never looked back. He  tackled a variety of tough issues impacting a large county in southwest  Montana. From the Barney Bridge to the Ennis-Big Sky Airport, local  infrastructure was critically important to Jim and his constituents.   Fellow Madison Commissioners Dan Allhands and Ron Nye shared a quip  that Commissioner Hart often told them and fellow Madisonians after  local projects were completed. They said, ``You done good.'' And I  agree. Jim's calm demeanor was an effective tool in his toolbox that  allowed him to be especially effective serving his constituents and  rise in stature across our great State.   Commissioner Hart became only the second commissioner in the history  of Madison County to be elected president of Montana Association of  Counties, otherwise known as MACo. Commissioner Jason Strouf from  Custer County and MACo's current president said, ``Commissioner Hart is  a truly honorable and kind leader who has been steadfast in his service  to Madison County as well as all counties in Montana. Our members,  through Jim's tenure as MACo President, quickly became familiar with-- and learned from--his quiet yet resolute governing skills. It has been  an honor and a privilege to know Commissioner Hart.''   I am grateful for Jim's dedication and passion to serving Montana. He  has surely left Madison County with large shoes to fill.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I have the distinct honor of  recognizing Daniel Hutchinson of Roosevelt County as Montanan of the  Month for his acts of heroism and leadership following the tragic  Amtrak derailment that occurred in Joplin, MT, last month.   Daniel and his son Joshua were two of the 141 passengers on board the  Empire Builder train headed to Seattle on September 25, 2021. That  afternoon, tragedy struck. The train derailed in rural Montana between  Joplin and Chester. After the crash, Daniel didn't hesitate to jump  into action and help fellow passengers aboard the train.   His years of military training prepared him to act swiftly and  selflessly to identify injured passengers and help others off the  train. Daniel immediately took control of the situation, making his way  through the train and calling out to locate trapped or injured  passengers.   After the accident, Daniel stated that he said a prayer thanking the  Lord for putting him in the right place at the right time. He did  everything he could to get others out of harm's way, and I believe the  passengers Daniel helped are also saying a prayer of thanks for his  heroic actions.   His kindness and leadership extend far beyond that fateful day.  Daniel's son, Joshua, describes him as a good neighbor, an avid  outdoorsman, and an advocate for veterans. Joshua says his dad is a  true Montanan in every sense of the word, and I couldn't agree more.   It is my honor to recognize Daniel for his quick and decisive actions  on the day of that horrific accident and for his everyday acts of  service that make Montana a better place.                            ____________________
