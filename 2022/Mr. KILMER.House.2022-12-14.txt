 Mr. Speaker, most people knew Grant Wahl as a leading  soccer journalist. I knew him as a classmate and as someone I admired.   Sadly, we lost Grant this past weekend, and I join the many people  here in America and around the world who are celebrating his life.   Grant and I went to college together. Before he covered soccer for  worldwide news organizations, he was the sportswriter for our school  paper.   As an undergrad, Grant visited South America and fell in love with  soccer. While he was there, he watched clubs train, watched games, and  developed the passion of a convert.   By 1998, he was covering the World Cup for Sports Illustrated. How  cool is that?   His love of soccer was infectious. He made others appreciate this  sport because he did. In one commemoration of Grant, Christian Stone  wrote: ``Wahl became the definitive chronicler of the sport in North  America, a world traveler who applied rigor, depth, and passion,  without being pedantic or precious, to his coverage. He visited six of  the seven continents several times over, introduced the world to a  generation of U.S. woman rock stars . . ., coaxed private audiences out  of some of the planet's most reclusive stars . . . , and led a life of  globetrotting freedom, adventure, and pleasure that was Bourdain- like.''   But Grant's greatest passion was not the sport he loved. It was the  woman he loved, Celine, who he met at Princeton and married in 2001.  Celine is an extraordinary doctor in her own right, an infectious  disease expert who so many have looked to throughout the COVID  pandemic.   In Celine, Grant found a spouse who matched him as someone at the top  of their field in a career dedicated to improving the world.   Grant was accomplished and yet humble. He was driven and yet kind. He  was a champion for social justice. He was a strong advocate for pay  equity for women players.   On November 21, when World Cup security detained Grant for wearing a  shirt with a pro-LGBTQ+ equality message, people saw Grant's name in  news headlines everywhere.   Grant's refusal to change his shirt offered a glimpse of the  integrity he displayed throughout his life, both in journalism and  toward those that he loved.   Many of us were fans of Grant when he worked for Sports Illustrated,  when he published books, when he developed amazing podcasts. We  marveled at his documentary, ``Exploring Planet Futbol,'' where he  traveled the world exploring the glory of the sport he loved.   I admit, over the last few days, I have spent time diving into the  Sports Illustrated vault, listening to his podcast. Like many of his  classmates, colleagues, and friends, I have come away with a feeling of  just being proud of him.   But Grant wasn't just an extraordinary journalist. He was an  extraordinary person. He was a good and generous and kind man. He had a  phenomenal smile that made people feel welcome in his presence.   Going forward, when I watch soccer, when I read amazing  sportswriting, when I see someone show courage or kindness, I will  think of Grant Wahl.   Mr. Speaker, please join me in offering sincere condolences to  Celine, to all of his loved ones, and to all who cared for him.                            ____________________
