 Mr. Speaker, Louie Gohmert is just as popular  among my constituents in Virginia as he is among my esteemed  colleagues' constituents from Texas.   Louie was one of the first Members of Congress to come and support me  in my district when I started this journey 3 years ago. He literally  drove through the night to come down to Virginia to help a fledgling,  aspiring Congressman down in the Fifth Congressional District of  Virginia.   Louie since I have gotten here has been an example of courage. As a  freshman, I quickly observed him being willing to go to the microphone  time and again, not only to challenge the other side but even to  challenge our side when he felt they were wrong or weren't living up to  the ideals that we promised to live up to for our constituents.   I have admired him for his character and testimony on a personal  level, his love for our Lord, his love for our Savior, Jesus Christ.   Louie Gohmert is one of those people you meet here in Congress who is  the same here in person as he is on TV when folks watch him. I am proud  to learn from and serve with this true courageous, conservative  warrior.   I am proud to call Louie a friend on a personal level. He will be  missed. Even in his leaving this Congress, he is leaving in a  courageous, selfless act, because he could have stayed here as long as  he wanted to, to represent his district. But he loves his beloved State  of Texas, and in a tremendous act of courage he took personal risk in  leaving this body.   He has had a lifetime of service. He was an Army Captain, a Texas  district judge, Chief Justice of the Twelfth Court of Appeals of Texas,  and has spent 18 years of courageous, conservative service here in  Washington.   Thank you, Louie. I admire you, love you, and I am proud to call you  a friend. God bless you.
