 Mr. Speaker, on National Teacher Appreciation Day, I  rise to acknowledge the outstanding achievements of Virgin Island  teachers and bring attention to the educational crisis occurring in the  U.S. Virgin Islands.   Ms. Michaelrose Ravalier, a teacher at Ivanna Eudora Kean High  School, represented the Virgin Islands at the 2018 National Science  Teachers Conference and was awarded the Maitland P. Simmons Memorial  Award for New Teachers.   This is the first Virgin Islander to be a recipient of this award,  yet she and her incredible colleagues, including Margot Oyake and  Alenia Buncome Murraine of St. Thomas, and the other St. Croix  teachers, do not have adequate funding to support their duties. The  Virgin Islands Department of Education reported nearly 150 personnel  vacancies and 12 shuttered schools following the hurricanes last year.  Virgin Island students attend school in 4-hour shifts each day.   I urge my colleagues to work with me to ensure the educational system  of the Virgin Islands receives the necessary funding to allow students  to learn and prosper. The best way to support our teachers is by giving  them the resources they need to teach our children.   Take time today to thank every teacher who supports our children.                            ____________________
