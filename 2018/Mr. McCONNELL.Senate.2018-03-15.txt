 Mr. President, this week marks an important  anniversary for an exceptional American. Forty-five years ago  yesterday, our friend and colleague John McCain was released after more  than 5\1/2\ years as a prisoner of war in Vietnam.   The ``Hanoi Hilton'' was the site of unspeakable brutality, but it  was also a crucible of character, where a brave patriot was tested and  grew into a generational leader.   Here in the Senate, we are not only grateful that John McCain was  welcomed home, we are especially grateful that he answered yet another  call to serve, bringing that leadership to this body for more than 30  years. His leadership and his example are as important today as they  have ever been.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on another matter, yesterday the  President named Larry Kudlow as the next head of the National Economic  Council.   Larry is well known as a happy warrior for pro-growth economics and  widely respected for his expertise in fiscal policy. The country will  be lucky to have Larry serving in this role. I look forward to  continued engagement with the White House team that will now benefit  from his insight.   Speaking of highly qualified personnel, here in the Senate yesterday  afternoon, we voted to advance Kevin McAleenan's nomination to serve as  Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection. This is an  essential post, and Mr. McAleenan is an excellent nominee.   I urge everyone to join me in voting for his confirmation when we  return on Monday.                            ____________________     Mr. President, yesterday, the Senate took a big step  forward for community banks, credit unions, and other small lenders on  which communities across America rely for access to credit.   On a strong bipartisan vote, we passed Senator Crapo's legislation to  streamline the Dodd-Frank Act so regulations intended for Wall Street  place less of a crushing burden on Main Street.   Next up is legislation to combat sex trafficking. Debate on this  issue will begin today.   It might be easy to imagine sex trafficking doesn't happen here. It  would be easy to pretend it is only a problem in other parts of the  world, but that is dead wrong.   Trafficking is a crisis right here in the United States. From 2010 to  2015, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children saw  reports of suspected child sex trafficking increase more than  eightfold--an eightfold increase. Last year alone, more than 8,500  cases of human trafficking were reported to the National Human  Trafficking Hotline.   As Senator Portman has been informing us throughout his tireless work  on this issue, sex trafficking has moved from the street corner to the  smartphone. That is, in large part, because a 1996 law meant to protect  online speech is now misused as a shield to stop sex traffickers and  those who profit from their crimes from facing the rightful  consequences.   I am as strong a defender of the First Amendment as you will find. I  was in the Congress in 1996. I voted for the Telecommunications Act  that included this provision, as did the vast majority of my  colleagues. Let me assure you, not one of us intended to create a  special protection for platforms that knowingly allow sex traffickers  to exploit children.   The legislation we will consider would ensure that institutions that  knowingly facilitate sex trafficking can be held accountable for their  actions.   There is a reason why 67 Senators have joined Senator Portman in  support of legislation to accomplish this. There is a reason why the  White House  [[Page S1742]]  is strongly supportive. American children should not be sold--online or  anywhere else. America's families should not be victimized by such  evil, and America's laws should not be misused to protect those who  perpetrate these crimes or those who, according to the stunning  subcommittee report, knowingly give them space and tools to operate  while profiting in the process.   Several of us have worked hard on this issue for a number of years.  It is now past time to take this additional step. When we vote next  week, that time will have come.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on one final matter, few subjects are  closer to the heart of parents than their children's education. That is  why Republicans made sure the historic tax reform we passed last year  included a provision, championed by Senator Cruz and others, that will  help parents choose an education for their children that makes sense  for their family.   A recent article in the Courier-Journal in Louisville, KY, shared the  story of one family whose second grade son had struggled with an  undiagnosed learning disability. He had trouble keeping up with his  public school class. So like many parents facing similar challenges,  his family decided to send him to a private school with smaller classes  and more individual attention, but that was a tough financial decision.  Even though both parents worked, affording tuition was a struggle.   Families like this are why Republican tax reform gave parents more  flexibility in paying educational expenses. The law builds the  foundation for important expansions of the tax-advantaged college  savings accounts known as 529 plans. As a result of tax reform, we are  empowering families to use these tax-exempt accounts not only for  college expenses but also for tuition at private and religious schools,  K-12.   The philosophy here is simple: More choice is better than less. That  really is the moral of the story on tax reform--getting government out  of the way, letting families keep more of their own income, and  empowering Americans to make the economic choices that make sense for  them.   Parents know best what works for their children. So if we can get  government out of the way so the IRS takes less from families and  parents, and parents get more control over their kids' education, we  ought to do it.   The young man from Louisville is in the fifth grade now. His new  private school was able to properly diagnose and approach his dyslexia.  He is thriving. Now, thanks to tax reform, school choice will soon  become more affordable for families like his.   Historically, helping families save for schooling costs has been a  bipartisan priority. In 1996, I worked with Senator Bob Graham and  other friends across the aisle to create section 529 in the first  place. Five years later, I sponsored legislation to let families tap  into 529 plans tax-free. It ended up in the 2001 tax cuts--again, a  bipartisan affair, but this time was different.   No Democrats in the House or the Senate--not a single one--voted for  this historic tax reform law. They tried to block this law to help  families across America afford schooling of their choice. This time,  Republicans had to do it all by themselves. Fortunately, we got it done  for American families.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.
