 Madam Speaker, it is unusual, but look at this  bipartisan effort together here. This is an amazing moment.   As mentioned, our colleague, Jose Serrano, has been a champion on  this cause for many years, and I miss him dearly, and I look forward to  seeing him very, very soon.   There are more than 58 million reasons why we need a National Museum  of the American Latino:   Since the founding of our great Nation, Latinos have been largely  invisible and excluded from the history books.   Our community has been used as scapegoats for the problems America  faces.   We are looked at as ``others,'' and have been made to feel like  outsiders in our own country.  [[Page H3868]]                                     time  1015    The root of this problem stems from a lack of knowledge of and  appreciation for Latino contributions to America's success.   Now, more than ever, when Latinos are being vilified and spoken of as  ``less than,'' the American people deserve to learn the truth of our  history and our heritage. The American Latino Museum is essential to  sharing the stories and the journey of Latinos in America. From  America's original sin of Native American genocide, the American Civil  War, and through the civil rights movement, to the horrors of the  deadly El Paso shooting, where 23 people were killed at the hands of a  murderer who drove hundreds of miles with the sole intent of killing as  many Mexicans as possible; we must teach our entire history, the  beautiful, the glorious, and the horrors and the injustices. Our story  is the story of the United States of America.   If we truly want to build a country that works for everyone, we must  start by including everyone. We owe it to ourselves and our children to  learn about Latino history in America. That is exactly what museums are  for: To teach and inspire. And for years, I, along with Congressmembers  Serrano, Hurd, Sanchez, Roybal-Allard, Aguilar and many others have  worked tirelessly to gain bipartisan support in finally establishing a  Latino Museum. We understand its symbolic and historical significance  for our country.   Latinos make up 17 percent--more than 58 million people--of the  United States population, and they are the largest and fastest growing  ethnic group in America. Hispanic Americans contribute more than $2.3  trillion to the United States economy every year. That GDP would make  itself a country of the eighth largest economy in the world. People  like my brother-in-law who was born in Mexico, served in the United  States Army, and was shot and wounded while fighting for our country in  Vietnam. His story deserves to be heard. Today, there are more than  200,000 Hispanic Active-Duty servicemembers serving in the United  States Armed Forces. Sixty Hispanic Americans have received the  Congressional Medal of Honor, the highest award for valor in action  against an enemy force that can be bestowed on an individual serving in  the Armed Forces of the United States of America.   Our story is America's story, and Latino history is American history.  Latino leaders were key players during the U.S. civil rights movement.  Historical movements like the Chicano civil rights and labor movements,  which included some of the largest student walkouts in American  history, are not taught in our classrooms. Americans like Dolores  Huerta, who was beaten within an inch of her life, and Navy veteran  Cesar Chavez, have been instrumental in securing American workers'  rights. In the face of relentless brutality and adversity, Huerta and  Chavez remained committed to nonviolence while fighting for  farmworkers' rights, workers who were maimed or died while working in  the fields and cast aside like forgotten fruit by farmowners. Dolores  and Cesar prevailed by establishing the first farmworkers union in the  United States, forever changing the course of this Nation for the  better.   There are countless stories of American Latinos; stories of  perseverance, dedication, and beating the odds to achieve their dreams;  like the story of my friend and astronaut Jose Hernandez. Jose grew up  in a poor farmworker family. As a child, he would work in the fields  before sunrise and look up at the stars, dreaming of going to space.  Jose followed that dream through his college career as a scientist and  engineer. His journey took him from the fields of California as a  farmworker to the NASA space program. Jose applied to the NASA space  program 13 times, to be rejected 12 times. After his thirteenth  attempt, he was finally accepted into the program and fulfilled his  childhood dream, becoming the first astronaut to communicate back to  Earth in Spanish from space. Jose's story is a story of perseverance,  dedication, and unshakeable will. Jose's inspiring story deserves to be  heard and shared so that every child, regardless of race or personal  circumstances, can achieve his or her dreams. Like little Joaquin, or  Jimena, or little Sky, or little Sage; they deserve those inspirations  to see somebody who looks like them achieve their dreams.   A National Latino Museum is a fitting and appropriate way for all  Americans to celebrate and learn the truth about how Latinos have  contributed to our great country; to honor Latinos who are on the  frontlines and who, literally, gave their lives in service of our  Nation. A Smithsonian museum dedicated to Latino history and culture  would educate the American public on the stories of American Latinos  that are excluded from our museums, schools, and history books.    Madam Speaker, it is time we establish a national  museum devoted to American Latino history and culture. We are a great  Nation, but this Nation is incomplete without giving the honor and  respect that every single community deserves.   I thank my colleagues for this opportunity to share this beautiful  moment with all of America so that we can make this museum real.
