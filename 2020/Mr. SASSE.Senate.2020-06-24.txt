 The Senator from Maryland was first. I have 40 seconds to  comment, but thank you.   I respect the Senator from Virginia, but I would like to note for the  Record, as somebody who spent a lot of time in the working group under  Senator Scott's leadership, that Senator Kaine repeatedly said it was a  ``my way or the highway'' approach. I just think it is really important  for the Record for us to admit that this is an open amendment process  that has been proposed, and that some of the Democrats who came to some  of the meetings to negotiate were frankly stunned when Mr. Scott went  from 5 amendments to 20 amendments, to whatever number you want. That  is the opposite of a ``my way or the highway'' approach. That language  isn't true. An open amendment process where dozens have been offered is  not a ``my way or the highway'' approach.    Yes.    One of the most dysfunctional committees in the Senate--I  am.    There are so many different procedures in the Judiciary  Committee. You defined yourself as a rookie who has been here for 7  years. I am a rookie to your rookie, and I am new on Judiciary. So  there are a lot of ways. The way you are defining it is usually the  model, but there is a whole bunch of stuff that happens. You asked for  the question that falls into that, but perhaps there is another comment  that you can make.    I thank the Senator for his question. I told the Senator  from Maryland I would get out of his way, and I thank him for the time.
