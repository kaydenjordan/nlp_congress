 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   When I led marines in Iraq, they asked me a lot of questions. Some  were simple, like: How do I send a letter home to my parents? Some were  more difficult, like: What kind of rocket do I need to use against this  building?   But the single hardest question I got was: Sir, why are we here? It  came from marines of all backgrounds, all political stripes. And it was  rooted in the fact that we got to Iraq care of a President who used  false intelligence and a Congress that failed to do its job.   Too many Americans died in Iraq because we did not fulfill our  constitutional responsibility.  [[Page H722]]    Now, nothing in this amendment takes away the Commander in Chief's  ability to defend ourselves; in fact, it cites the War Powers  Resolution. But it does make it very clear that Congress has not  authorized the President to go to war with Iran. That is a message that  we need to send today.
