 Madam Speaker, I was speaking to one of our  colleagues who indicated that he held a town hall meeting where he was  explaining, as a civics matter, the Constitution of the United States  and the role of the United States Congress in holding the executive  accountable. He said his constituents relished the opportunity to  understand the process.   I am going to remind our colleagues that any time we move toward a  process that is constitutionally based, it is somber and respectful,  detailed and efficient.   So I want to read from Article I, Section 2, Clause 5, which  indicates that the House of Representatives ``shall have the sole power  of impeachment.'' Article II states that the President ``shall be  removed from office on impeachment for, and conviction of, treason,  bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.'' Article II also  requires that the President ``take care that the laws be faithfully  executed.''   With that in mind, I believe it is important that this Congress  recognizes its duty to work in an efficient manner; that all committees  work and investigate, and all committees do their work in a somber  manner; and that we continue to educate our constituents about the  value of the Constitution, the beauty of this Nation, and the rule of  law. That would mean that we are doing our job as Members of the United  States Congress.   The Constitution governs the order of our nation and it dictates the  work of the Congress. Article I details the powers of the House and the  exercising of these powers as they relate to the coordinate, coequal  branches of government, codified in Articles II and Articles III: three  equal branches of government coexisting and cohesively working to  provide oversight to the respective actions of the Congress, the  Executive and Judiciary. This has worked, with challenges of course,  since 1789, and the situation which we are now currently facing is  directed by three provisions of the Constitution.         Article I, Section 2, Clause 5 indicates that the ``House       of Representatives . . . shall have the sole power of       impeachment.'' Article II states that the ``The President . .       . shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and       Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and       Misdemeanors.; Article II also requires that the ``President       take care that the laws are faithfully executed.''    That language is stark and clear--and throughout our history it has  been used in varying periods where the assessment was that the law has  been breached. Sometimes Congresses are concerned that the weight and  view of the American people should be considered. Sometimes they are  moved by the urgency of the matter. We now have an urgent matter: that  matter involves the President of the United States speaking to a  sovereign foreign nation and conspicuously and overtly asking for an  investigation of his opponent in a presidential election, forthcoming  in 2020. In addition to this request for an overt investigation of an  American citizen, within close proximity to this, the president  directed a staff member to deny the directives of the United States  Congress to provide foreign aid to this sovereign nation--Ukraine--an  act that is without comparison in our knowledge in the history of the  United States, and an act that falls within the language of the law of  the Constitution, abuse of power and certainly one that violates  Article II's dictate that the President ensure that the laws are  faithfully executed.   Let us be very clear: monies were stalled, denied and delayed to a  sovereign nation in the backdrop of a directive of Congress to issue  funds to a sovereign nation as leverage in order to investigate a  private citizen of the United States. Further, the series of acts of  obstruction involving Congress has been bold and continuous. The House  Judiciary Committee effectively has brought forth witnesses, and sought  witnesses that were then directed by the President to not appear, in  violation of the three equal branches of government. In spite of that,  the committee has meticulously continued its work in building a case  for impeachment.   Last week, we prepared extensively for the testimony of Corey  Lewandowsky, who is not and has never been a federal employee, was not  employed by the White House at any time, and not employed by the  federal government at any time and also who was directed by the  President to rebuff, stall and thwart; and who also was, in essence,  directed to stain the constitutional process, by his responses, and the  authority of the Congress.   Article I gives the Congress, and the House of Representatives in  particular, its authority to proceed to hold the President of the  United States accountable. There is no room for any other process.  There is no other action. There is no other time. With a heavy heart,  it is imperative that the impeachment inquiry begin and that the  Articles of Impeachment are filed expeditiously; and that the  Constitution works with the full authority of the United States  Congress. That the Article I works with Article III courts to ensure an  orderly response and respectful approach to this somber, sacred and  high calling of the Congress and the Nation.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague, Congresswoman  Plaskett for anchoring this Special Order on support of the  Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.   I want to express my significant concerns with the U.S. Department of  Agriculture's proposed rule to change the determination qualifications  for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.   Currently, nearly 36 million people receive monthly SNAP benefits.   To be eligible for assistance, gross monthly income must be at or  below 130 percent of the poverty line.   44.4 percent of residents in Houston live at or below 185 percent of  the federal poverty line.   In the Houston metropolitan area households with children, 19.3  percent struggled against food hardships in 2014-2015.   In February of 2018, SNAP served 304,542 households in Houston,  bringing in $82,374,563 of 100 percent federally funded benefits,  generating approximately $147.5 million in economic activity.   In Harris County alone, 599,928 people are eligible for SNAP  benefits.   In August of 2019 Harris County received a total of $70.9 million in  totally SNAP payments.   As a result of the proposal 3 million people may lose their  eligibility for food assistance.   States currently have the flexibility to not cut off benefits as soon  as a family's gross income exceeds a certain level, but to more slowly  phase out the food aid.   This is to ensure that those who are at or slightly above the poverty  line do not risk falling below that line.   Additionally, these benefits reduce food insecurity and help  alleviate poverty.   The proposed changes would limit this and cause many families to be  abruptly cut off.   The new proposal jeopardizes access to free school meals for 500,000  low-income students.   Not only does this significantly affect families but also retired  populations that rely on a fixed income.   This would adversely affect food banks around the nation as people  look for food elsewhere.   Forcing families to choose between placing food on the table and  covering other important expenses is unacceptable.   This proposal shows the Republicans' special interest agenda that  gives billion-dollar handouts to big corporations and the wealthy few,  and then steals from children, veterans, seniors and working families  to make up the difference.   It is both cruel and counterproductive, ignoring the positives that  SNAP puts into the economy by creating $1.79 for every dollar in  benefits.   This proposed rule change does not help and support low-income  individuals and families meet their basic human needs.   The current Administration is rejecting the overwhelmingly bipartisan  passage of the 2018 Farm Bill, which made smart improvements that  strengthened the safety net for food-insecure families.   This Administration must commit to implementing the bipartisan  agreement to make anti-hunger initiatives more effective.   House Democrats will always stand firm for the health, well-being and  dignity of America's working families, and will continue to advance our  For The People agenda to deliver lower health care costs, bigger  paychecks and cleaner government that fights for the public interests,  not the special interests.   Thus, I urge the administration to reconsider this proposal and look  at the adverse effects that it will have on our society.                            ____________________
