 Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the  ``Twenty-First Century Dams Act,'' which I introduced today. I would  like to thank Senators Padilla, Wyden, Stabenow, Peters, Gillibrand,  and Bennet, who have joined me in introducing the bill.   This bill represents a remarkable and historic coalition of groups  that are often at odds: environmentalists, the hydropower industry, and  dam safety advocates have come together to advance this proposal to  modernize our nation's more than 90,000 dams. This breakthrough  agreement is the result of a process launched three years ago and led  by Stanford University's Woods Institute and Steyer-Taylor Center for  Energy Policy and Finance, with additional direction from the Energy  Futures Initiative.   Our Nation's dams serve many important public purposes, including  water supply, flood control, recreation, and, where appropriately  mitigated, clean energy generation that will help slow climate change.  But the dams also block off key habitat for fish, and can reduce flows  needed for the health of rivers.   As a result, conservationists have often fought proposals to upgrade  older hydropower facilities or construct new water-powered energy- storage projects, undertaking lengthy regulatory disputes over  environmental safeguards.   The historic coalition advocating for this bill has agreed to try a  different approach by working together. They jointly support three  principles for modernizing dams known as the ``3 Rs'': rehabilitate,  retrofit, and remove.   1) First, rehabilitate. Our bill increases investments in  rehabilitating dams to improve their safety. Many of our nation's dams  were built more than 50 years ago to safety standards that are  insufficient today, all the more so because climate change is  increasing the extreme weather events, like super storms, that dams  will have to withstand to avoid catastrophic failures.   2) Second, retrofit. Hydropower provides the United States with more  than seven percent of its electricity and over 90% of its current  electricity storage capacity. Both the private and Federal hydropower  fleet generate electricity, and hydropower facilities can complement  variable solar and wind power sources and provide long-duration energy  storage, critical to decarbonizing the grid. DOE estimates that by  maintaining and retrofitting existing powered dams, U.S. hydropower  electricity output could reduce carbon emissions by 5.1 billion metric  tons by 2050 while supporting nearly 200,000 clean energy jobs.  Retrofitting dams also includes measures to make them less ecologically  damaging.   3) Third, removal. There are ample opportunities to remove  unnecessary dams that no longer provide benefits to the population,  have safety issues that cannot be mitigated in a cost-effective way,  and/or have significant environmental impacts that cannot be addressed.  Dam removals can improve public safety, restore the natural functions  of rivers, help endangered fish species, create jobs, protect important  environmental and cultural resources, and increase the climate  resilience of U.S. rivers.   I would like to now talk about how the bill would advance each of the  ``3 Rs:'' rehabilitations, retrofits, and removals.   Rehabilitations of dams to improve their safety has long been a goal  of mine. As Ranking Member of the Senate Energy and Water Development  Appropriations Subcommittee, last year I funded for the first time the  Army Corps of Engineers' loan program under the Water Infrastructure  Finance and Innovation Act, or WIFIA. This program focuses on dam  safety, and will use $14 million in federal appropriations to back  loans supporting approximately $1 billion in dam safety projects.   Dam safety has been underfunded at Federal, State, and local levels  for many years. There are nearly 6,000 non-federal high hazard  potential dams, which are at high risk of failure with probable loss of  human life if they were to fail. The Association of State Dam Safety  officials has estimated that the total cost of rehabilitating these  dams exceeds $20 billion.   The bill proposes a series of investments to meet this critical need:  [[Page S4928]]    FEMA's grant program for non-Federal high hazard potential dams would  be funded at $1 billion over 5 years, up from $10-12 million per year  in recent years.   2) USDA's Watershed Protection and Flood Prevention Act would provide  another $500 million for rehabilitating non-Federal dams over 5 years,  up from just $10 million in the most recent appropriations bill.   3) The Army Corps' WIFIA program, which I mentioned earlier, would be  funded at $250 million over 5 years, a 250% increase over the most  recent appropriations bill. This could support as much as $15 billion  in loans for non-Federal dam safety projects.   4) The bill would also authorize funds to building existing state  regulatory oversight capacity, mapping the potential consequences of  dam failure, and modernizing the National Dam Safety Program.    Dam safety funding in the bill totals $2.405 billion over five years,  plus $15 billion in lending capacity to rehabilitate dangerous non- Federal dams.   While public safety is paramount, it is also critical that we manage  our dams as part of a comprehensive strategy to address climate change.  As I mentioned before, hydropower facilities can ``firm up'' variable  solar and wind power sources, critical to decarbonizing the grid, by  both producing 24/7 electricity and providing substantial electricity  storage capacity for variable resources.   The coalition proposal has a two-part strategy to advance the second  ``R'' of retrofitting dams. First is investing in existing Federal  dams, which make up roughly 50% of all U.S. hydropower generation.  Federal dam investments are essential to maintain this energy resource.   The bill authorizes $11 billion over five years to improve the safety  and renewable energy generating capacity, and reduce environmental  impacts of federally owned dams across the United States. These  investments are focused on the largest Federal dam-owning agencies,  including:   1) $8 billion for the Army Corps of Engineers;   2) $2 billion for the Bureau of Reclamation;   3) $650 million for the Bureau of Indian Affairs; and   4) $350 million for the Forest Service.   The bill also authorizes $200 million for the Department of Energy  for research, development, and deployment to support innovative  waterpower technologies, technologies to improve retrofitting and  rehabilitating hydropower dams, and furthering the contribution of  hydropower to grid resilience.   The coalition has also proposed establishing a 30% tax credit for  investment at qualifying facilities in dam safety, environmental  improvements, grid flexibility, and dam removals, with a direct pay  alternative. Due to Senate rules regarding committee jurisdiction, it  makes sense to move this tax credit provision separately. Senators  Cantwell and Murkowski have introduced separate bipartisan legislation  regarding this tax credit proposal, which they are actively discussing  with the Senate Finance Committee.   Let me now turn to the third ``R''--removal of unnecessary dams.  Around the nation there are thousands of dams, in many cases built a  century or more ago, which no longer provide significant societal  benefits, but block fish passage to critical habitats and otherwise  harm river ecosystems.   A twenty-first century dam strategy would be wholly incomplete  without provisions to remove these unnecessary dams. The bill creates  an interagency council and a stakeholder advisory committee to help  administer funding to remove dams where appropriate. Identifying  candidates for dam removal will follow these guiding principles:   1) The dam owner must give consent;   2) The priority is to remove dams that pose a significant public  safety hazard, or non-powered dams whose removal would provide  significant ecological value; and   3) Consideration of the extent to which the dam provides critical  beneficial uses, the magnitude of public benefits from dam removal, and  the cost-effectiveness and technical feasibility of dam removal.   Because dam removal can be a difficult issue, I believe it is  critical to establish the framework in this bill for identifying which  dams are appropriate for removal, and which are not. Within this  framework, the bill authorizes $7.5 billion in funding over 5 years for  multiple Federal agencies with dam removal authorities, including the  Army Corps of Engineers, the Bureau of Reclamation, the Fish and  Wildlife Service, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration,  the Forest Service, and the Natural Resources Conservation Service.   The broad goal of these provisions is to reconnect 10,000 river miles  through the removal of 1,000 dams. In addition to ecological benefits  that could transform the prospects for many endangered fish  populations, these projects would also create over 100,000 jobs.   I want to again congratulate the hydropower industry, environmental  community, and dam safety advocates that have come together in the  coalition proposing this bill. This is an historic coalition, and the  coalition's proposal gives the Senate a remarkable opportunity to  advance three critical goals:   1) Rehabilitating aging dams that pose public safety risks and need  major investments to withstand the extreme flooding events that are  coming with climate change;   2) Retrofitting our Federal and non-Federal dam fleets to increase  clean energy generation and slow climate change, while reducing the  dams' environmental impacts; and   3) Removing unnecessary dams to open up critical habitat for  endangered fish populations and restore the health of our precious  rivers.   Our colleague, Representative Annie Kuster (NH-02), has introduced  this legislation in the House of Representatives together with  Representatives Don Young (AK-AL), Kim Schrier M.D. (WA-08), Julia  Brownley (CA-26), Jared Huffman (CA-02), Debbie Dingell (Ml-12),  Emanuel Cleaver (MO-05), Nanette Diaz Barragan (CA-44), Bonnie Watson  Coleman (NJ-12), and Scott Peters (CA-52). I look forward to working  with these House members to advance this important bill.   I hope my colleagues will join me in support of this legislation.  Thank you, Mr. President, and I yield the floor.                                  ______                                         By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mrs. Gillibrand, Ms. Klobuchar,          Mr. Padilla, Ms. Rosen, Mrs. Shaheen, and Ms. Smith):   S. 2357. A bill to fight homelessness in the United States by  authorizing a grant program within the Health Resources and Services  Administration for housing programs that offer comprehensive services  and intensive case management for homeless individuals and families; to  the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.    Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the  ``Fighting Homelessness with Services and Housing Act,'' which would  establish a new Federal grant program to increase support for  comprehensive services paired with housing to address our Nation's  current homelessness crisis.   As we have seen with the growing diversity of our homeless  populations--families with children, veterans, individuals with mental  health conditions and struggling with addiction, people who simply  could not keep up with increases in rent--our Nation's homelessness  crisis is not going to simply resolve itself on its own.   According to the most recent data available from the U.S. Department  of Housing and Urban Development, there are more than 580,000 homeless  individuals and families in the United States. More than 25 percent of  this population is in California, with approximately 161,548 homeless  people sleeping on the streets on any given night.   In a Nation as prosperous as ours, we can and we must do better,  especially as we address this crisis in the aftermath of the  coronavirus pandemic. Our city, County, State, and Federal governments  must work hand-in-hand with the non-profit and private sectors to  establish collaborative efforts to significantly address the issue of  homelessness.   The good news is that we have seen a model that works: supportive  housing, which helps meet homeless individuals and families where they  are. This approach can help stabilize an individual or family and  change their life. Supportive services such as mental and physical  health care, substance abuse  [[Page S4929]]  treatment, education and job training, and life skills such as  financial literacy are critical components. Paired with intensive case  management, supportive housing models make a difference.   One success story is the Downtown Women's Center in Los Angeles. This  shelter allows homeless and formerly homeless women to transform their  lives through a combination of permanent, supportive housing and  workforce development. This would not be possible without the Center's  partnerships with the City of Los Angeles, the Los Angeles County  Department of Health, and other critical stakeholders. I've visited the  Center and encourage my colleagues to do the same to see why this model  works.   It is imperative that we support State and local efforts, as well as  nonprofit service providers, as they work to get people into housing to  both mitigate the spread of the coronavirus and address their long-term  needs.   Without a doubt, it will take a significant investment to solve the  current homelessness crisis. That is why I am introducing the  ``Fighting Homelessness with Services and Housing Act,'' which would  authorize a new Federal funding stream of $1 billion per year, subject  to annual appropriations. Grantees must serve individuals or families  who are homeless or at risk of becoming homeless by providing housing  paired with a comprehensive set of services and must provide a 25  percent match for any Federal funds received.   Because each individual and every community is unique, the grant  program created by this bill would be flexible in order to work in any  region or for any homeless population.   This bill supports the great work already being done across the  Country, allowing local governmental entities and non-profit  organizations to expand their capacity and ensure a greater reach by  putting Federal dollars where they will make the most effective impact.   This legislation is supported by a wide coalition of local  governments, housing, health, and child welfare organizations,  including the Mayors and CEOs for U.S. Housing Investment, National  Alliance to End Homelessness, Corporation for Supportive Housing,  National Association of Counties, National League of Cities, National  Low Income Housing Coalition, and the NETWORK Lobby for Catholic Social  Justice.   I hope my colleagues will join us in supporting the bill and moving  it through the Senate, especially as we continue to contend with the  increase in homelessness amid the coronavirus pandemic.   Thank you, Mr. President, I yield the floor.                                  ______                                         By Mr. REED (for himself and Ms. Collins):   S. 2361. A bill to reauthorize the budget-neutral demonstration  program for energy and water conservation at multifamily residential  units, to establish a green retrofit program, and for other purposes;  to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.
