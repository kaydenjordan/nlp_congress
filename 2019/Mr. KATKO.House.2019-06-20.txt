 Mr. Speaker, June is Alzheimer's and Brain Awareness  Month, and I rise today to share with this Chamber the impact that  Alzheimer's disease has had on this country and my family.   Today, 5.8 million Americans live with brain disease. I have  witnessed firsthand the burdens of these illnesses because my father,  Andrew Katko, lived with Alzheimer's for nearly a decade before  succumbing to the disease a few months ago.   My family was faced with the difficult decision on how to care for  our father during this time in his life. This is not uncommon among  families across our great Nation.   Often, family and friends are primary caretakers for those suffering  with Alzheimer's and dementia. My mother, Mary Lou, served as my  father's primary caregiver, joining 16 million Americans who provide  unpaid care. This year, unpaid caregivers will provide 18.5 billion  hours of care valued at $234 billion.   The BOLD Infrastructure for Alzheimer's Act was signed into law last  Congress proudly and is now being implemented. This legislation  authorizes the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to research  prevention methods for dementias and establish local treatment  facilities.    I am committed to passing additional policies that improve the lives  of those living with dementias.                            ____________________
