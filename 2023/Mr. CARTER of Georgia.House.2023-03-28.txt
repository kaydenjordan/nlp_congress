 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Coach  Brandon Jernigan, the athletic director at Pierce County High School.   Brandon has been named the Georgia High School Association's Region  2A athletic director of the year. He has been a coach for 24 years and  has spent the last 15 years at Pierce County High School. For the last  6 years, he has served as Pierce County High School's athletic  director.   During his time as athletic director, Pierce County has achieved many  notable athletic accomplishments, including the school's first State  football championship. He has also overlooked large expansion projects  for the football, baseball, and softball fields.   Brandon is much more than just an athletic director. He is a pillar  of his community and someone who has made a lasting impact on everyone  around him. His impact on our young men and women will be felt for  generations to come.   Congratulations on this wonderful accomplishment.                            ____________________
