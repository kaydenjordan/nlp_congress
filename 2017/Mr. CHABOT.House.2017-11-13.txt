 Mr. Speaker, as former chairman of the Foreign Affairs'  Subcommittee on the Middle East and having traveled to Yemen myself a  couple years ago, I rise in support of H. Res. 599, a resolution that  calls for an end to the conflict in Yemen and denounces the targeting  of innocent civilians and the use of civilians as human shields.   It has become painfully evident that Iran's Islamic Revolutionary  Guard continues to transfer increasingly sophisticated weapons systems  to the Houthis in Yemen. These weapons are now being used to target  civilians as well as one of our regional allies, Saudi Arabia.   There is an urgent need for a political solution in Yemen, with  growing famine, 500,000 new cholera cases, and the death of 10,000  Yemeni civilians since 2015.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill and I urge my colleagues  to join in condemning Iranian activities in Yemen. I call on our global  partners to take appropriate measures against the Government of Iran,  including the banning of Iran's weapons to the Houthis, and condemning  targeting of civilians.
