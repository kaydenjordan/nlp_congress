 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I want to remind us today of President Lincoln's words  to Congress. He said this: ``The dogmas of the quiet past are  inadequate to the stormy present. The occasion is piled high with  difficulty, and we must rise with the occasion. As our case is new, so  we must think anew and act anew.''   So said President Abraham Lincoln. So it is today.   This occasion is piled high with difficulty, but we must rise to the  occasion. Our challenges are piled high, and this House must rise to  meet them.   We find ourselves in new and unprecedented circumstances, so, Mr.  Speaker, we must think anew and act anew.   The House has a duty to the American people to do its job, even in a  crisis like this one that nobody on this floor has ever experienced.  The House has a duty to the American people to do its job, especially  in a crisis like this.   Let me say at the outset, Mr. Speaker--I want my colleagues to hear  me on this--that there is no substitute for personal interaction of  Members in a committee room or on the House floor. I share that view,  Mr. McCarthy shares that view, Ms. Pelosi shares that view, Mr.  McConnell shares that view.   But when that is not possible because it poses a mortal danger-- 86,000 plus of our fellow citizens have died because they contracted  COVID-19. It poses a mortal danger to the health of Members, staff,  press, and the public, and therefore, we must provide an alternative  way to do the people's business.   Now, let me say that we had a bipartisan task force. At the first  task force meeting, Rodney Davis, Republican from Illinois, said, ``We  want the Congress to be able to work.''   My colleague said that, cynically, we could observe that perhaps for  those who may not be able to garner a majority for what we pass,  perhaps they don't want us to work.   I hope that is not the case.   I know the administration does not want us to do oversight, but that  is our responsibility.   This resolution will enable the House to conduct its work in full  without risking the health and safety of Americans and communities  across the country from which Members come and to which they will  return.   It allows committees to use remote technology to conduct hearings and  mark up legislation, technology already in use safely and effectively  by millions of Americans, including the Supreme Court, nine people who  have decided they ought to be separated and are therefore doing what  has never been done in history. It is not a revolution. They are using  technology to do the same thing they could do in the hearing chamber of  the United States Supreme Court, period.   The United States Senate, as so many of my colleagues have observed,  held a virtual hearing. The chairman was not there. He was quarantined.  The witnesses were not there. They were quarantined.   Now, there were, as Mr. McCarthy has suggested, Members in the  hearing room. So it is what Mr. McCarthy refers to as a hybrid hearing.  This rule provides for that.   It will also permit the use of proxy voting on the House floor and  takes steps toward adopting remote voting once a platform has been  deemed secure.   I had hoped that Democrats and Republicans could move forward with  such changes on a bipartisan basis.   I absolutely reject any theory that the character of the House is  being changed by this rule, absolutely reject it. My friend is shaking  his head, ``No, it is.''   Nothing changes. The same people vote, the same issues will be  considered, the same witnesses will be heard, the same committee rules  will be followed. The only thing that changes is the technology that is  available to us.   By the way, when that board was lit up, there were some who people  thought that was a radical change: ``I ought to be able to stand on the  floor and say `aye' or `nay.' '' And when C-SPAN was introduced: Oh,  my. How radically that would change the House.   I reject, I say again, that this is any kind of radical change. What  it is is the use of technology to accommodate the crisis we confront.   We had many productive discussions through our bipartisan task force,  and, Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Cole, I thank Mr. Davis, I thank Minority  Leader McCarthy. I congratulate  Jim McGovern, the chairman of the  Rules Committee, for his fairness and for his attentiveness to  everybody's position.    We didn't reach agreement. I am sorry that we didn't reach agreement.  But we took a lot of the ideas that our friends on the Republican side  of the aisle suggested. They were good suggestions, and we incorporated  them in what we are doing.   We are including in this resolution the requirement that any software  platforms are to be approved by the chief administrative officer, so  some technology that is not accepted or proved to work would not be  used, and allowing committees to hold hybrid hearings, which I just  referred to, with both remote and in-person participation  simultaneously.   However, Mr. Speaker, we were unable to reach a consensus on adopting  21st century tools that would allow the House to meet its  constitutional responsibilities during this emergency, which is why  Democrats are bringing this resolution to the floor today.   I hope, however, with this resolution now on the floor, that  Republicans will join us in voting for it, and I urge them to do so.   If, in fact, you want the Congress to be able to act and exercise our  responsibilities, you will vote for this rule, because it simply  enables us to do what we have historically done: held hearings, voted  on bills, brought them to the floor, had amendments, and passed them,  the only difference being that there will be some people, maybe many  people, who will be doing so, as technology enables us to do,  virtually.   We know that remote technologies work, because the committees have  already been using them to hold meetings, host forums, and engage in  discussions about legislation.   Many State legislatures, Mr. Speaker, and foreign parliaments have  already adopted these technologies successfully. By the way, one of  them is Kentucky, for what it is worth.   The Washington metro area is still experiencing a high rate of  infections, which has not yet peaked.   So our doctor, on whom we have relied for some of our health needs,  says the best practice would be not to come together in one room,  whether it be a committee room or the floor of the House, but would be  to have people have the opportunity to vote remotely.   That is why the Capitol physician has cautioned us against bringing  Members to Washington.   At the same time, more than half of those employed here as staff or  support  [[Page H2036]]  workers commute to the Capitol complex on public transit, and they are  concerned. We have an obligation to protect them and their families as  well.   This change is not permanent. This is to meet a temporary catastrophe  that confronts our country which we have not seen the likes of for over  a century.   It will not advantage or disadvantage either party. There is no  partisan advantage in this rule; none, zero, zip.   It does not fundamentally alter the nature of the House or how it  operates. Let me repeat that. It does not fundamentally alter the  nature of the House or how it operates.   There is no dangerous precedent here, only a commonsense solution to  an unprecedented crisis that demands our ingenuity and adaptability as  an institution.   Now, I said it hasn't happened for more than a century. 1918, during  the Spanish flu, they passed many, many pieces of legislation with two  or three people on this floor.   Perhaps my colleagues on the other side of the aisle think that is  better than the 432 others by technology saying, ``I vote aye,'' ``I  vote nay,'' whether it is in committee or, frankly, on this floor.   Indeed, to paraphrase Lincoln: This is how to think anew and act  anew. That is all we are doing.   We need to have a system in place not only to deal with the current  crisis, but future emergencies, including the possibility that another  surge of COVID-19 is going to happen this fall.   If we fail to act now, as we failed to act after 9/11, we may be in a  lot of trouble come September, without the capacity to join us all  together in this Chamber, but still with the capacity to join us all  together and participate pursuant to the rules of this House, even  though we do so virtually.   This resolution isn't just about adopting remote working tools for  the House. It is about ensuring that the House of Representatives, the  people's House, conducts its constitutional duties of policymaking and  oversight effectively and safely.   I am not sure the executive department is shedding any tears that we  are not here.   Hear me: It is about making sure that our system of checks and  balances remains fully in place by keeping the House functioning to the  full extent of its abilities even, as I said, it does so virtually.   Frankly, when I say something to people on some of this technology,  whether it is Zoom, FaceTime, Teams, WebEx, or any other technology of  that type, very frankly, when I am looking at   Tom Cole on that, as we  did a couple of times, I see him on the screen, I know it is   Tom  Cole, and when   Tom Cole says something, I know that that is what    Tom Cole is saying.   There is no secrecy here. There are no smoke and mirrors. There is no  advantage to either party by this. That is why I do not understand why  this isn't a bipartisan piece of legislation enabling this body to work  in an effective way, albeit virtually.                                time  1400    Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairwoman Lofgren from the House  Administration Committee and Chairman McGovern from the Rules Committee  for their tireless efforts on this resolution, and I want to thank all  of the Members who have been patient while we negotiated with  Republicans through the bipartisan task force, hoping to produce a  resolution that was bipartisan in its authorship.   Having said that, there is a very fundamental difference. I  understand that.   Mr. Cole, at the hearing, offered a scholar's opinion that it would  be unconstitutional to do this. Mr. McGovern offered another scholar's  opinion that it was fully constitutional to do this.   If that is the fundamental difference, I understand. But it is not  because it radically changes the way this House works or radically  changes the votes of the majority or the minority, or radically in any  other way changes this House of Representatives to a body that is not  represented. This resolution remains bipartisan in its ideas, and I  hope it will be bipartisan in its adoption.   Once it has passed, I would ask my colleagues to familiarize  themselves with its new proxy voting requirements and to adhere  strictly to them. That will allow the Clerk's office to more  effectively fulfill its role of recording and counting Members' votes  with utmost accuracy.   Again, Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to join me and many  others in supporting this resolution and permitting the House to do its  work safely and in compliance with social and physical distancing  practices urged by all of our medical personnel.    Mr. Speaker, there has been a lot of talk about how there  was no consultation on this bill. One of the reasons was because  Senator McConnell, of course, said: Let the States go bankrupt. We are  not going to meet. We will wait. We will see. Let the municipalities go  bankrupt.   There was no energy on the other side of the aisle to engage once  more. However, the President, Secretary Mnuchin, and others said when  they signed the last bill that we needed another bill.   So all this talk about not cooperating, I think, is correct, but I  think it is incorrect as to who didn't cooperate, who didn't come to  the table, who said let's wait, who said let the States go bankrupt. So  let's not try to change the scenario here as to who wouldn't come to  the table.   Today, more than 85,000 Americans have died from COVID-19, and that  number grows every day. Wait, delay, pretend that this crisis has  abated--that is not what the American people expect of us.   More than 36 million Americans have applied for unemployment  insurance over the past 8 weeks, which is more than one in every five  workers in America. That is why we need to act. This is a public health  and economic crisis like no other this Nation has faced.                                time  1745    The people who are being hurt were not at fault. As one of the  Republican Members said, and I agree with him, the economy was shut  down. It didn't go into recession or depression; we shut it down.   When I say that ``we shut it down,'' the President of the United  States said we needed to stay at home. He was a little late to that,  but he finally said it.   It is clear, therefore, that Congress has a duty to act. We have  already enacted four major laws to address the impacts of this  pandemic, and today, the House is moving forward with its next major  legislative package.   By the way, when Secretary Mnuchin called Senator McConnell, he  didn't have a conference with us. He put a $250 billion bill Mr.  Mnuchin wanted on the table. We said: Fine. Let's talk about it. But by  the way, the hospitals need money; we need more testing; and we need to  take care of some other people.   Finally, after offering the bill and having it fail on the Senate  floor, then, and only then, was there a bipartisan discussion.   The HEROES Act will dedicate $1 trillion toward assisting our  frontline heroes by providing grants to States, cities, counties,  territories, and Tribal areas. If you talk to any one of them, they  will say they are hemorrhaging revenues and need help now.   As State and local government revenues decline sharply, this will not  only directly support first responders and healthcare workers, but it  will also keep teachers from losing their jobs as they contribute to  this great national effort by blazing trails in virtual learning.   Our bill would provide an additional $75 billion to ramp up a  national, coordinated effort for testing and contact  [[Page H2243]]  tracing, which we should have had 3 months ago and, indeed, perhaps  before that. That will be critical to any effort to reopen our economy  so that we aren't back here over and over again, confronting the  fallout from this pandemic.   It would also require the Occupational Safety and Health  Administration, or OSHA, to establish a clear and enforceable standard  within 7 days to require workplaces to develop and implement plans to  keep workers safe on the job. We admire and thank all those who showed  up so we could stay home to try to defeat this virus. But we need to  prevent employers from retaliating against people who say, ``It is not  safe, Mr. Employer. Make sure it is,'' which is what we are doing on  this floor.   The HEROES Act allocates $175 billion to help renters and homeowners  afford their monthly payments and utility bills as they deal with lost  incomes.   Why did they deal with lost income? Because we shut the government  down. I mean the Governors and the President shut it down to try to  defeat this virus. Very frankly, we are wearing masks to try to defeat  this virus. It is a different environment.   It increases SNAP benefits by 15 percent to help those facing hunger.  All of us have seen these long lines in our districts of people who are  fearful that they won't have food to put on their tables. It is time to  act today for those people.   It protects our democracy by allocating additional resources to  protect the 2020 Census and secure our elections as well as ensuring  the Postal Service provides its essential service.   Mr. Speaker, as this crisis continues, the HEROES Act will provide  direct payments to give additional help to those who, through no fault  of their own, are struggling to pay their bills and support their  families now--not tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow but now. It  extends for 6 additional months the unemployment compensation program  created under the CARES Act, including its additional $600 per week and  expanded eligibility to the self-employed, contract workers, and gig  workers, while providing needed funding to State agencies to handle the  historic influx of new unemployment claims. They are overwhelmed, and  they need help now.   It strengthens the Payroll Protection Program by making sure it can  benefit underserved communities and nonprofits of any size as well as  provides $10 billion toward small business loans through the EIDL  program.   This bill protects the independence of inspectors general. That is an  important aspect for the American people, so they can still strengthen  oversight without the fear of reprisals from this administration. Mr.  Fine was fired, essentially, because they feared his neutrality and  fairness.   The HEROES Act also protects healthcare coverage by expanding COBRA  subsidies so people have their health insurance by allowing a special  open enrollment period in the Federal and State health insurance  marketplace created under the Affordable Care Act.   Mr. Speaker, this is the legislation that the American people need as  they face this crisis. It is a bold response to an unprecedented  challenge.   So far, up to this time, we have demonstrated unity in responding to  those people who have been hurt so badly. I tell my Republican  colleagues, with all due respect, it is not time to abandon them now.  So, hopefully, we will reestablish that unity. Again, I point out it  was not us who didn't come to the table. It was our Republican friends  who said: Not now. Let's wait. Let's let some time go by.   In the HEROES Act, we can say in one voice to the American people: We  are in this together, you and us, you and the Congress of the United  States.   When the House passes this bill, I urge the Senate to work with us  and with the White House. Some people say this bill won't pass in this  fashion. I think that is probably right. But we have set forth  proposals. It is time, and hopefully, we will do it quickly, negotiate  our differences, and pass legislation to help those people without  their jobs, faced with rent, faced with mortgage payments, and faced  with paying their bills. Let's make sure they know that we are in this  together with them.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.'' Vote for the  American people.    Madam Speaker, I am going to be yielding to the Republican  whip in just a second, but I will announce the schedule for the weeks  to come.   As we face the crisis of the COVID-19 pandemic, the House must do its  duty in full and do so in a way that contributes to the safety and  welfare of our people and not in any way that harms it.   I want to thank each Member of the House for returning to D.C. today  to vote on this important legislation.   Madam Speaker, Members are advised that no votes are expected in the  House next week. Members are further advised that the House will be in  session on Wednesday, May 27, and May 28.   As everyone knows, the Senate has amended the House-passed FISA bill,  a very important piece of legislation that will require the House to  act again. I expect that to be considered on the 27th.   I also expect conversations to continue on additional legislation  addressing the COVID-19 pandemic. The House could vote on COVID-19- related bills on May 27 and 28.   I am pleased that the House has adopted a resolution to allow the  committees to work remotely. I look forward to getting our committees  back  [[Page H2256]]  up and running so they can begin having hearings and markups on  critical legislation.                                time  2130    Clearly, the House, as it moves forward, needs product. I have talked  to the appropriators. I know that the WRDA bill is also a bill that we  are looking at moving forward.   The National Defense Authorization Act is a bill that we want to see  marked up. I talked to Mr. Smith tonight so, hopefully, we will be  moving ahead, getting product, and we will be considering that.   We have adopted some rules, not only for committees but for the  floor, that will facilitate not only working on legislation but also  the safety of our Members and staff.   As the gentleman knows, we have a number of must-pass bills that I  have just mentioned. I think I did not mention the surface  transportation bill, but I did mention WRDA. As committees begin  consideration of these bills, I will be in touch with Members about  when they will be scheduled.   Beyond May 27 and May 28, I want all Members to know that they will  be given 72 hours' notice of when they would need to be returning to  Washington, D.C., for any additional votes.   I would simply say one of the reasons that we are not meeting next  week, we are going to give the staff, not only of the committees but of  the House, the opportunity to determine exactly how the new rules can  be carried out--not in any way to adversely affect either our  Republican side of the aisle or the Democratic side of the aisle--and  to reflect accurately the votes of Members, whether they are able to  get to Washington during this pandemic or not.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Scalise),  my friend.    Madam Speaker, I apologize for not mentioning that. There  will be pro forma sessions, and at the pro forma session on Tuesday, we  will swear in the two new Members.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman.    Madam Speaker, reclaiming my time, the gentleman is  correct. We expect a good turnout of Members on both sides of the aisle  to be in the Chamber when we meet. We do know, however, there are  Members who, for health reasons--either their own health or the health  of one of their family members--transportation issues, as you know, are  more difficult now with the pandemic going on, but our expectation is  there will be a good number of Members.   We do not expect there to be 20 Members here. We expect there to be  many more. And as the gentleman knows, when asked to come to the House  to pass critically important legislation, Members on both sides of the  aisle have been here in large numbers.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman.    Madam Speaker, I would tell the gentleman, May 27 and 28.    I have already said, but I will repeat it.   We will be considering FISA legislation, I believe, on May 27, and we  will be considering other COVID-19-related bills, if they are ready.   We have not specifically identified those bills, but on May 27 and  28, we will be meeting 2 days on that week. It is, as you know,  Memorial Day on Monday of that week.    Reclaiming my time, what I think, Mr. Whip, is that we are  showing that we intend to do our work and we intended to do it with  concern for the safety of our Members, with the safety of our staff,  the safety of witnesses who appear before our committees, and the  safety of committee members as they proceed.   I will tell you that Mr. Smith and I had a discussion, as I said a  little earlier, and he is going to be talking to his ranking member. I  expect them to have a markup, and I expect that markup to be in person.    We are in session now, of course, and I expect us to be in  session on May 27 and 28. I expect, in the interim, committees will be  considering legislation so that we will have product to do.   We are behind schedule. I still want to accomplish much of the work  that we need to do as a regular order of business in the near term.    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
