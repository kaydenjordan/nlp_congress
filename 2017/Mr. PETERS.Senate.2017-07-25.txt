 Mr. President, I intend to move to commit the bill H.R.  1628 to the Committee on Finance with instructions to report the same  back to the Senate in 3 days, not counting any day on which the Senate  is not in session, with changes that,   No. 1, are within the jurisdiction of such committee; and, No. 2,  would ensure that the bill does not increase costs, reduce benefits, or  eliminate health coverage for any veteran or dependent of a veteran  enrolled in traditional Medicaid, expanded Medicaid, or a qualified  health plan offered through an exchange.   I am offering this motion because the legislation as written could  harm millions of veterans and their dependents currently enrolled in  traditional Medicaid, expanded Medicaid, and ACA exchange plans. The  following Senators support my motion to commit: Duckworth, Stabenow,  Carper, Whitehouse, Shaheen, Blumenthal, Hirono, Reed, Durbin and  Baldwin. I ask unanimous consent that the full text of my motion to  commit be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:         Mr. Peters moves to commit the bill H.R. 1628 to the       Committee on Finance with instructions to report the same       back to the Senate in 3 days, not counting any day on which       the Senate is not in session, with changes that--        (1) are within the jurisdiction of such Committee; and        (2) would ensure that the bill does not increase costs,       reduce benefits, or eliminate health coverage for any veteran       or dependent of a veteran enrolled in traditional Medicaid,       expanded Medicaid, or a qualified health plan offered through       an Exchange.
