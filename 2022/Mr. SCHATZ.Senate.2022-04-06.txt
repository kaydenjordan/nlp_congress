 Madam President, reserving the right to object.   This is not the right way to get at the fentanyl problem. This gives  the Secretary permission to shut down all asylum seekers from a country  on the basis of any type of drug, no matter how much is in possession,  how frequently that drug is possessed, what country they are coming  from. We are calling for essentially a complete shutdown of the asylum  program because there might be fentanyl somewhere. But it also gives  the Secretary authority to stop asylum seekers coming from any country  for any drug at any scale.   Now, title 42 authority is a serious thing. It is a blanket authority  to block anyone presenting themselves for asylum. We have seen the  horrific images in Ukraine. We know between 4 and 5 million people are  already refugees, and we know that the United States, as the  indispensable Nation, wants to take a leadership role in accommodating  these refugees in Europe and, if necessary, in the United States.   People presenting themselves for asylum, escaping their dangerous  home country--that is actually part of the American dream. That is, in  a lot of ways, how many of us arrived, right? There may not have been  this statutory framework, but the principle involved was not just that  you came from some other place far away to make a better life for  yourself--sometimes it was that, but sometimes it was to escape the  pogrom, as was the case with my grandparents, from Kyiv to Odesa,  actually to Canada, and then to Hawaii.   And so this authority is no small thing. And to give the Secretary of  HHS this blanket authority to essentially shut down all asylum seekers  because we are afraid--appropriately afraid--of a specific drug is just  a little ham-fisted.   And I appreciate the Senator's remarks. I think there are better ways  to work on this, and therefore I object.
