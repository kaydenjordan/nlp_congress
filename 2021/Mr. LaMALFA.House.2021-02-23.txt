 Madam Speaker, I rise tonight in sadness to acknowledge  and commemorate the loss of an American icon, Rush Limbaugh, who, since  1985, extolled the virtues of conservatism on radio.   Starting in Sacramento, California, for the first 3 years, 1985 to  1988, he was within range of my tractor and my pickup out in the  fields, where I was working at the time. He was really a breath of  fresh air for radio, for a different type of talk and a different  style.   I know he inspired millions around the country during his many years  on radio. With his loss, he won't be replaced. He surely led the way  for many others to take on that mantle, but nobody will do it quite  like Rush Limbaugh. He did so well at it, and he touched so many that  he was even recognized about 1 year ago right here in this Chamber by  President Trump with the Medal of Freedom, one of the highest honors  anybody can receive.   Mr. Limbaugh may be controversial to some, but he was always coming  from truly a humble heart to try to get a message out to what America  was about, his love for this country, and a love for its ideals.   So I know that many will miss him, and I am glad to be honored to  help touch on his legacy here tonight.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, the Equality Act's supporters claim it  will protect students from discrimination, but in reality it makes  schools more dangerous and unfair for everyone.   By expanding the definition of ``sex'' to include self-declared  gender identity, it requires schools to allow biological males into  girls' restrooms, locker rooms, showers, and sport events usually  reserved for women.   And by incorporating sexual orientation and gender identity into  Title IV of the Civil Rights Act, which appropriately mandates the  desegregation of public education, this bill could order the  incorporation of radical gender ideology in sex education or other  aspects of curriculum, far outside the original law's scope. Activists  are already pushing graphic, age-inappropriate content on these topics  on students in places like Arlington, Virginia.   This bill puts teachers and administrators at risk too. Those who  ``misgender'' a student or fail to use the individual's preferred  pronouns could be accused of harassment and subject to discipline or  even lose their jobs.   Girls would also face unfair competition in sports. The Equality Act  would force schools to allow biological males to compete on female-only  teams.   We have already seen consequences of this. One transgender MMA  fighter has broken the skulls of two female opponents (and counting),  and transgender runners and basketball players are dominating female  competitors, leaving many females' long ambitioned goals of trophies  and scholarships dashed.   For years, supporters of Title IX have fought to encourage and  empower girls through athletic competition. Democrats would like to  erase those gains, shattering countless girls' dreams and dignity, to  appease the woke mob.   Americans of faith would suffer too. Religiously affiliated colleges  and universities that maintain student codes of conduct, hiring  practices, or housing rules reflecting their faith's sincerely held  belies about marriage and sexuality would lose federal funding under  the Equality Act, as such policies would be deemed discriminatory and  open them to countless lawsuits to threaten their very existence.   All-female universities, whether religious or secular, would be  required to accept male students identifying as female students, and  male students identifying as males, since this bill provides no  exemptions for female-only institutions. Is that a policy Americans  want?   The misnamed Equality Act erases opportunities for girls and women  and harms all students and teachers. It must be opposed.
