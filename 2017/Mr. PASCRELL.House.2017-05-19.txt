 Mr. Speaker, as we just heard from my good friend, the  gentleman from Washington (Mr. Reichert), as co-chairs of the Law  Enforcement Caucus, this is an important piece of legislation for us.   Mr. Speaker, as the lead Democrat sponsor of this bill, the Probation  Officer Protection Act, I rise in strong support of closing a gap in  the current law to help Federal probation officers more safely and  effectively carry out their duties.   Despite the fact that assaulting, resisting, or otherwise preventing  Federal probation officers from performing their official duties is  against the law, current law does not provide the same officers the  authority to correct or restrain an interfering third party. This act  simply expands the authority of the Federal probation officers to  arrest a third party with probable cause in cases where a third party  tries to physically obstruct or harm the officer.   I understand that some of my friends worry about the implications of  expanding arrest authority for law enforcement. I have to say there are  a lot of trumped up arguments being made against this bill. For  starters, Federal probation officers are fully trained and sworn  Federal law enforcement officers. They have a tremendous training  program in Charleston, South Carolina, the Law Enforcement Training  Center. They understand that this training is a continuing process as  well.   These officers receive extensive, ongoing, nationally standardized  training to safely arrest individuals on supervised release with  probable cause without a warrant. This training is also applicable to  the limited arrest authority granted by this bill.   The idea that expanding probation officers' arrest authority to third  parties will somehow lead to probation officers going on an unwarranted  arresting spree, violating individuals' civil rights with impunity, is  nonsense.                                time  0930    The bill includes language to ensure that the Director of the  Administrative Office of the United States Courts would issue national  guidelines to implement this new, limited authority. The authority will  not give Federal probation officers plenary law enforcement powers or  general arrest authority. Probable cause still must exist to carry out  an arrest. That is very clear in the legislation. The bill does nothing  to alter Federal probation officers' scope of responsibility. To  suggest so undermines the training these officers receive and the oaths  that they take.   Secondly, I understand that constitutional concerns have been raised  by my colleagues about the due process and rights of these third  parties. Nothing in this bill, Mr. Speaker, alters the due process or  rights of third parties. Nothing in the bill.   If a third party agrees to house an individual on supervised release,  they consent to the Federal probation officer having access to common  areas and any part of the home to which the offender has access.  Additionally, Federal probation officers build a relationship with the  third party housing the individual on supervised release in order to  manage their expectations on what it means to have a supervised  probationer living under their roof.   Finally, Mr. Speaker, Federal probation officers conducted a total of  1,060 searches pursuant to a court-ordered search condition or with  consent last year. More than half of the searches had at least one  third party present. Despite relying on other law enforcement agencies  for support and assistance during 493 of these searches, Federal  probation officers encountered uncooperative third parties on 39  occasions.   So, Mr. Speaker, as my colleagues have acknowledged, we are not  talking about a significant number of instances where this additional  authority is needed--remember, only 39 instances last year. Opponents  claim these numbers are low, making this a solution in search of a  problem. But in these 39 instances, a third party threatened,  intimidated, refused to cooperate, and denied officers entry into  residence to prevent an officer from doing their job.    Mr. Speaker, opponents claim, that is their claim that  they have.   This is against the law, plain and simple. The probation officer in  these instances did not have the authority they needed to remedy the  situation.   No one wants to increase the number of arrests. That is not the  purpose of the legislation. In a perfect world, everyone wants a  situation to be deescalated before an arrest or a detention happens.  Ideally, Federal probation officers would have the resources to visit  their probe with a law enforcement officer.   However, we don't live in a perfect world. Oh? These resources are  not always available. Third parties sometimes intentionally interfere  to prevent a Federal probation officer from performing their official  duties.   I urge my colleagues to support the Probation Officer Protection Act  to ensure Federal probation officers are able to do their job safely  and more effectively by giving them third-party arrest authority when  probable cause exists.
