 Madam Speaker, Joanne Reagan of Joanne Reagan Dance  Studios in Cold Spring, New Jersey, celebrated her 50th year teaching  dance over the weekend. She started training at only 8 years of age.   Joanne Reagan Dance Studios is founded on belief in the philosophy  and mission to build character, discipline, and responsibility through  the creative and performing arts.   They aim to give students the ammunition and the armor they need to  pursue a professional career, if they desire to do so, or in whatever  endeavor they choose to pursue in their lives.   Students are encouraged to aspire towards their own personal goals in  a manner which celebrates the individual and promotes self-esteem, and  it also promotes a positive body image.   I celebrate Joanne Reagan's service to our community and commend her  for passing on these invaluable life skills to southern New Jersey's  youth.   Madam Speaker, we are really lucky to have her.                            ____________________
