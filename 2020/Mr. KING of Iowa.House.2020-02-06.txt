 Madam Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman from  Texas yielding to me.   I rise in opposition to this rule. And I have a whole stack of things  that I will raise, but in the time that is available, I will say this:  We watched as the Medicaid program was opened up more and more under  President Obama. And when that happened, it caused a significant amount  of turmoil in my State and many States across the country.    And so President Trump has stepped in and decided that he is going to  offer an opportunity to have the equivalent of block grants going back  to the States and let them make the decision, let them write the  regulations because the States know best.   This great experiment in Federalism that we have, where the closer to  the people that the decision can be made, the more effective that  decision is and the more effective the resources of our taxpayers are.  That is the attempt and the endeavor on the part of President Trump,  and I regret that so much politics have been churned into this, we have  a hard time focusing on the policy.   When I see what happened at the prayer breakfast, and when I listened  to the statement that has been made by the Speaker publicly in a  conference a little earlier today, it spills forth upon this. Some of  her words essentially show up in this document.   Madam Speaker, it is time for us to take a deep breath. Impeachment  is over. Let's focus on policy.
