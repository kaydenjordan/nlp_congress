SEC. 4. LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT SECURITY TRAINING.         (a) In General.--The Secretary of Homeland Security, in       consultation with public and private sector stakeholders, may       in a manner consistent with the protection of privacy rights,       civil rights, and civil liberties, develop, through the       Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers, a training program       to enhance the protection, preparedness, and response       capabilities of law enforcement agencies with respect to       threats of terrorism and other threats, including targeted       violence, at a surface transportation asset.        (b) Requirements.--If the Secretary of Homeland Security       develops the training program described in subsection (a),       such training program shall--        (1) be informed by current information regarding tactics       used by terrorists and others engaging in targeted violence;        (2) include tactical instruction tailored to the diverse       nature of the surface transportation asset operational       environment; and        (3) prioritize training officers from law enforcement       agencies that are eligible for or receive grants under       sections 2003 or 2004 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6       U.S.C. 604 and 605) and officers employed by railroad       carriers that operate passenger service, including interstate       passenger service.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on this measure.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1870, the  Strengthening Local Transportation Security Capabilities Act of 2021.   This legislation I introduced seeks to improve information sharing  between the Department of Homeland Security and State and local law  enforcement in areas with high-risk surface transportation assets.   This bill will enhance security in two key ways.   First, it requires DHS to prioritize the assignment of officers and  intelligence analysts to State, local, and regional fusion centers in  jurisdictions with a high-risk surface transportation asset. To  mitigate threats to our critical surface transportation assets, we must  ensure that intelligence regarding threats to surface transportation  are shared with appropriate stakeholders in a timely manner. This  important provision meets that mission, improving the chances of  preventing the next attack.   Second, the bill authorizes DHS to develop a training program to  enhance the protection, preparedness, and response capabilities of law  enforcement agencies that operate at surface transportation assets.  Surface transportation systems are unique in their layouts and use, and  this training would improve law enforcement capabilities in these  settings in a manner that protects civil rights and liberties.   Considering the increase in terrorist attacks in recent years against  mass transit systems, bus stations, and passenger rail systems, it is  crucial that timely information be shared with local law enforcement  and security personnel at transit centers. These surface transportation  systems are critical to our way of life, and an attack against one  could be devastating.   Enactment of H.R. 1870 would be a significant step toward ensuring we  are prepared to mitigate such risk by supplying DHS and State and local  law enforcement with the resources they need to meet this homeland  security challenge.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I have no more speakers, and I am  prepared to close after the gentleman from New York closes.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, H.R. 1870 is a timely measure, as attackers remain  intent on targeting surface transportation systems at this time of  heightened threat.   Enacting H.R. 1870 will improve information sharing among DHS and  State and local law enforcement agencies, increasing our ability to  stop or significantly decrease the harm caused by such attacks.   Madam Speaker, for this reason, I urge my colleagues to support H.R.  1870, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1893) to direct the Transportation Security Administration  to develop a transportation security preparedness plan in the event of  a communicable disease outbreak, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1893         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Transportation Security       Preparedness Act of 2021''.       SEC. 2. SURVEY OF THE TRANSPORTATION SECURITY ADMINISTRATION                     WORKFORCE REGARDING COVID-19 RESPONSE.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to  [[Page H3684]]  revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the  measure.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 1893, the  Transportation Security Preparedness Act of 2021.   Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, more than 8,200 TSA  employees have contracted coronavirus. Tragically, 17 hardworking  frontline workers have lost their lives.   While TSA has taken steps to shield its workers and adjust security  operations during the pandemic, its COVID-19 response was ranked low in  employee surveys. More must be done to make sure TSA is adequately  prepared for future disease outbreaks.   H.R. 1893 directs TSA to apply the lessons learned from the COVID-19  pandemic to protect its workforce and the traveling public during  future disease outbreaks.   To do so, TSA is required to survey its workforce in more detail  regarding pandemic response to ascertain areas for improvement that can  be integrated into a transportation security preparedness plan for  future pandemics. Specifically, the survey will examine TSA's efforts  to communicate clearly with its workforce, protect employees with  personal protective equipment, adjust workplace policies, engage in  contact tracing, and facilitate COVID-19 vaccinations for workers.   TSA is then directed to integrate the information it collects into a  transportation security preparedness plan that sets forth how TSA will  respond to future pandemics, including how it will protect its  workforce, communicate and collaborate with public and private  entities, and adjust checkpoint operations to maintain security without  compromising health and safety.   TSA is also required to assess what barriers remain to its ability to  respond to the next disease outbreak.   H.R. 1893 will ensure that TSA will be able to respond quickly and  effectively to prevent the next disease outbreak.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and  I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1230     Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, as the American people return to air travel in greater  numbers, it is essential that TSA plan for the future and use the  lessons we have learned during COVID-19 to ensure that TSA responds  more quickly and effectively to the next major public health crisis.   H.R. 1893 will allow TSA to reflect on the successes and the missteps  of the past year and a half and create a concrete plan of action to  protect workers and passengers.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1893, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1895) to enhance the preparedness of the Transportation  Security Administration for public health threats to the transportation  security system of the United States, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1895         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

(3) Policies and procedures implemented by TSA and       transportation security stakeholders to protect from public       health threats TSA personnel, passengers, aviation workers,       and other personnel authorized to access the sterile area       through the security screening checkpoints, as well as future       plans for  [[Page H3685]]       additional measures relating to such protection.        (4) The role of TSA in establishing priorities, developing       solutions, and coordinating and sharing information with       relevant domestic and international entities during a public       health threat to the transportation security system, and how       TSA can improve its leadership role in such areas.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include extraneous material on this measure.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 1895, the  Transportation Security Public Health Threat Preparedness Act of 2021.   Protecting our Nation's transportation workforce and the traveling  public is front of mind as we attempt to emerge from the COVID-19  pandemic with the looming threat of new variants of the virus.   H.R. 1895 seeks to ensure U.S. transportation systems are better  prepared for public health threats by having TSA conduct a study on  public health risks in concert with other agencies within the  Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Health and Human  Services, and industry stakeholders.   Specifically, this bill enhances these efforts, requiring TSA to  assess the risk of public health threats to the Nation's transportation  security systems and analyze the agency's preparedness to respond to  them.   The bill also allows TSA to reassign personnel not engaged in  frontline transportation security efforts to other government agencies  to improve intergovernmental coordination and response efforts.   I applaud my colleague from Florida (Mr. Gimenez) for this timely  legislation that prioritizes the health and safety of the traveling  public and frontline transportation workers, and I urge my colleagues  to support this legislation.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, enactment of H.R. 1895 will support our efforts to  mitigate future public health threats to our Nation's transportation  systems.   We have witnessed the daunting effects of the pandemic over the past  year and must be prepared for future public health threats to avoid  repeating the same tragedies again.   Ensuring TSA is equipped with the right information on public health  threats and prepared to combat them with interagency coordination will  be essential to protecting our transportation system, transportation  workers, and the traveling public. This bill furthers that effort.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1895, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1877) to require the Transportation Security Administration  to issue a plan to improve security screening procedures at airports  during the COVID-19 national emergency, and for other purposes, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1877         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Security Screening During       COVID-19 Act''.       SEC. 2. PLAN.         (a)In General.--Not later than 90 days after the date of       the enactment of this Act, the Administrator, in coordination       with the Chief Medical Officer of the Department of Homeland       Security, and in consultation with the Secretary of Health       and Human Services and the Director of the Centers for       Disease Control and Prevention, shall issue and commence       implementing a plan to enhance, as appropriate, security       operations at airports during the COVID-19 national emergency       in order to reduce risk of the spread of the coronavirus at       passenger screening checkpoints and among the TSA workforce.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include extraneous material on this measure.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 1877, the  Security Screening During COVID-19 Act.   This legislation, introduced by my colleague from Missouri (Mr.  Cleaver), directs the Transportation Security Administration to issue a  plan to reduce the spread of the COVID-19 virus at passenger screening  checkpoints and among the TSA workforce.   To date, over 8,200 TSA employees have tested positive for the  coronavirus, and tragically, 17 workers have died from the disease.   As Americans begin to travel again, we must take steps to guarantee  the safety of critical frontline workers and air passengers from the  dangers posed by the virus, including the delta variant and other  variants that could come our way.   Under H.R. 1877, the TSA Administrator would coordinate with the  Department of Homeland Security's Chief Medical Officer, the Department  of Health and Human Services, and the CDC to develop a plan that  identifies best practices among foreign governments, airports, air  carriers, and other Federal agencies regarding COVID-19. Together, they  will pinpoint specific operational challenges that TSA can make to  further reduce the spread of the coronavirus at airports across the  Nation, building on the actions TSA has taken over the past year.   COVID-19 has made it clear that public health is a global issue that  requires a global response. That is why the United States must work  with our international partners on how best to stop the spread of  disease in transportation security settings, end this pandemic, and  prevent future outbreaks.   TSA routinely participates in the international exchange of  information to enhance global aviation security, share its expertise,  and reduce threats across the globe.   Given the unprecedented challenge of the COVID-19 pandemic to today's  air travel environment, TSA must capitalize on its international  partnerships to identify new ways to enhance its security operations  and contain this virus. H.R. 1877 will push TSA to do just that to  protect the workforce and passengers.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, H.R. 1877 received unanimous support in our committee  because it is a commonsense legislation that will keep Americans safe.  The coronavirus pandemic is not yet over, and TSA must work with  national and international partners to implement new strategies to stop  the spread of disease and prepare for the future.   The Security Screening During COVID-19 Act will push TSA to build  upon its current efforts to ensure the agency is doing everything  possible to protect the workforce and passengers.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1877, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1871) to improve the understanding and clarity of  Transportation Security Administration policies, and for other  purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1871         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Transportation Security       Transparency Improvement Act''.       SEC. 2. SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION; INTERNATIONAL                     AVIATION SECURITY.         (a)Sensitive Security Information.--        (1)In general.--Not later than 90 days after the date of       the enactment of this Act, the Administrator of the       Transportation Security Administration (TSA) shall--  [[Page H3687]]         (A) ensure clear and consistent designation of ``Sensitive       Security Information'', including reasonable security       justifications for such designation;        (B) develop and implement a schedule to regularly review       and update, as necessary, TSA Sensitive Security Information       Identification guidelines;        (C) develop a tracking mechanism for all Sensitive Security       Information redaction and designation challenges;        (D) document justifications for changes in position       regarding Sensitive Security Information redactions and       designations, and make such changes accessible to TSA       personnel for use with relevant stakeholders, including air       carriers, airport operators, surface transportation       operators, and State and local law enforcement, as necessary;       and        (E) ensure that TSA personnel are adequately trained on       appropriate designation policies.        (2)Stakeholder outreach.--Not later than 180 days after the       date of the enactment of this Act, the Administrator of the       Transportation Security Administration (TSA) shall conduct       outreach to relevant stakeholders described in paragraph       (1)(D) that regularly are granted access to Sensitive       Security Information to raise awareness of the TSA's policies       and guidelines governing the designation and use of Sensitive       Security Information.        (b)International Aviation Security.--        (1)In general.--Not later than 60 days after the date of       the enactment of this Act, the Administrator of the       Transportation Security Administration shall develop and       implement guidelines with respect to last point of departure       airports to--        (A) ensure the inclusion, as appropriate, of air carriers       and other transportation security stakeholders in the       development and implementation of security directives and       emergency amendments;        (B) document input provided by air carriers and other       transportation security stakeholders during the security       directive and emergency amendment, development, and       implementation processes;        (C) define a process, including time frames, and with the       inclusion of feedback from air carriers and other       transportation security stakeholders, for cancelling or       incorporating security directives and emergency amendments       into security programs;        (D) conduct engagement with foreign partners on the       implementation of security directives and emergency       amendments, as appropriate, including recognition if existing       security measures at a last point of departure airport are       found to provide commensurate security as intended by       potential new security directives and emergency amendments;       and        (E) ensure that new security directives and emergency       amendments are focused on defined security outcomes.        (2)Briefing to congress.--Not later than 90 days after the       date of the enactment of this Act, the Administrator of the       Transportation Security Administration shall brief the       Committee on Homeland Security of the House of       Representatives and the Committee on Commerce, Science, and       Transportation of the Senate on the guidelines described in       paragraph (1).        (3)Decisions not subject to judicial review.--      Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any action of the       Administrator of the Transportation Security Administration       under paragraph (1) is not subject to judicial review.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include extraneous material on this measure.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1871, the  Transportation Security Transparency Improvement Act. This bipartisan  legislation, as introduced by my colleague from North Carolina (Mr.  Bishop), will ensure consistent standards and improve procedures for  designating sensitive security information at TSA.   Sensitive security information, known as SSI, is information that if  publicly released would be detrimental to transportation security. Just  like with classified information, those who are granted access to SSI  have a special obligation to safeguard it and face penalties if they  fail to do so. Given these stakes, it is important that TSA apply  consistent standards when designating SSI. This bill will not only  require TSA to maintain those clear standards, but also develop a  schedule to regularly review its SSI guidelines, develop a tracking  mechanism for SSI redaction challenges, and conduct additional outreach  with aviation stakeholders on SSI guidelines. These reforms will  improve transparency at TSA.   H.R. 1871 has the potential to enhance TSA's work to secure last- points-of-departure airports by requiring TSA to include air carriers  and other stakeholders in the development of security directives and  emergency amendments affecting such airports and to engage with foreign  partners on their implementation.   By including industry and international perspectives in this process,  H.R. 1871 will ensure TSA's efforts to secure flights from foreign  airports are effective.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I have no other speakers, and I am  prepared to close after the gentleman from New York closes. I reserve  the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   The Transportation Security Transparency Improvement Act is a  bipartisan and commonsense bill that will improve TSA's operations.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1871, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2795) to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to enhance  the Blue Campaign of the Department of Homeland Security, and for other  purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2795         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``DHS Blue Campaign       Enhancement Act''.       SEC. 2. DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY BLUE CAMPAIGN                     ENHANCEMENT.         Section 434 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C.       242) is amended--        (1) in subsection (e)(6), by striking ``utilizing       resources,'' and inserting ``developing and utilizing, in       consultation with the Advisory Board established pursuant to       subsection (g), resources''; and        (2) by adding at the end the following new subsections:        ``(f)Web-Based Training Programs.--To enhance training       opportunities, the Director of the Blue Campaign shall       develop web-based interactive training videos that utilize a       learning management system to provide online training       opportunities that shall be made available to the following       individuals:        ``(1) Federal, State, local, Tribal, and territorial law       enforcement officers.        ``(2) Non-Federal correction system personnel.        ``(3) Such other individuals as the Director determines       appropriate.        ``(g)Blue Campaign Advisory Board.--        ``(1)In general.--The Secretary shall establish within the       Department a Blue Campaign Advisory Board and shall assign to       such Board a representative from each of the following       components:        ``(A) The Transportation Security Administration.        ``(B) U.S. Customs and Border Protection.        ``(C) U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.        ``(D) The Federal Law Enforcement Training Center.        ``(E) The United States Secret Service.        ``(F) The Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties.        ``(G) The Privacy Office.        ``(H) Any other components or offices the Secretary       determines appropriate.        ``(2)Charter.--The Secretary is authorized to issue a       charter for the Board, and such charter shall specify the       following:        ``(A) The Board's mission, goals, and scope of its       activities.        ``(B) The duties of the Board's representatives.        ``(C) The frequency of the Board's meetings.        ``(3)Consultation.--The Director shall consult the Board       established pursuant to paragraph (1) regarding the       following:        ``(A) Recruitment tactics used by human traffickers to       inform the development of training and materials by the Blue       Campaign.        ``(B) The development of effective awareness tools for       distribution to Federal and non-Federal officials to identify       and prevent instances of human trafficking.        ``(C) Identification of additional persons or entities that       may be uniquely positioned to recognize signs of human       trafficking and the development of materials for such       persons.        ``(4)Applicability.--The Federal Advisory Committee Act (5       U.S.C.

Such consultation shall be exempt from the Federal       Advisory Committee Act (5 U.S.C. App.).''.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include extraneous material on this measure.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, the Department of Homeland Security's Blue Campaign is  dedicated to raising awareness about the often-concealed crime of human  trafficking. Each year, there are thousands of victims of human  trafficking in the U.S. with numbers steadily increasing over the last  20 years. Traffickers subject their victims to forced labor, debt  bondage, or sexual exploitation by using violence, manipulation, or  false promises.   The DHS Blue Campaign works to combat this crime by educating law  enforcement and the public on how to recognize the signs of human  trafficking. Through outreach to local communities, industry partners,  and law enforcement authorities, the Blue Campaign seeks to build on a  foundation of human trafficking prevention and protection.   The tactics and techniques that human traffickers use are evolving.  It is crucial for the Federal Government to foster awareness in a  sustained way and educate Americans on the indicators of human  trafficking to identify victims.   H.R. 2795, the DHS Blue Campaign Enhancement Act, would build upon  the existing Blue Campaign by focusing on enhancing human trafficking  prevention training opportunities and improving the development of such  trainings and material. Specifically, H.R. 2795 would create an  advisory board which brings together representatives throughout DHS to  provide guidance on recruitment tactics used by human traffickers and  inform the development of awareness tools.   It would also require the Blue Campaign to create web-based training  videos to reach the widest possible audience of law enforcement  officers and correction system personnel, among others. H.R. 2795 has  bipartisan support and was reported out of committee by unanimous  consent.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and  I reserve the balance of my time.                                           House of Representatives,                                      Committee on the Judiciary,                                       Washington, DC, May 18, 2021.      Hon. Bennie G. Thompson,      Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Thompson: This letter is to advise you that       the Committee on the Judiciary has now had an opportunity to       review the provisions in H.R. 2795, the ``DHS Blue Campaign       Enhancement Act,'' that fall within our Rule X jurisdiction.       I appreciate your consulting with us on those provisions. The       Judiciary Committee has no objection to your including them       in the bill for consideration on the House floor, and to       expedite that consideration is willing to forgo action on       H.R. 2795, with the understanding that we do not thereby       waive any future jurisdictional claim over those provisions       or their subject matters.        In the event a House-Senate conference on this or similar       legislation is convened, the Judiciary Committee reserves the       right to request an appropriate number of conferees to       address any concerns with these or similar provisions that       may arise in conference.        Please place this letter into the Congressional Record       during consideration of the measure on the House floor. Thank       you for the cooperative spirit in which you have worked       regarding this matter and others between our committees.            Sincerely,                                                    Jerrold Nadler,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                  Committee on Homeland Security,                                       Washington, DC, May 26, 2021.      Hon. Jerrold Nadler,      Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Nadler: Thank you for your letter regarding       H.R. 2795, the ``DHS Blue Campaign Enhancement Act.'' I       recognize that the Committee on the Judiciary has a       jurisdictional interest in H.R. 2795, and I appreciate your       effort to allow this bill to be considered on the House       floor.        I concur with you that forgoing action on the bill does not       in any way prejudice the Committee on the Judiciary with       respect to its jurisdictional prerogatives on this bill or       similar legislation in the future, and I would support your       effort to seek appointment of an appropriate number of       conferees to any House-Senate conference involving this       legislation.        I will include our letters on H.R. 2795 in the       Congressional Record during floor consideration of this bill.       I look forward to working  [[Page H3689]]       with you on this legislation and other matters of great       importance to this Nation.            Sincerely,                                             Bennie G. Thompson,                                                           Chairman,                                    Committee on Homeland Security.     Madam Speaker, I have no more speakers, and I am  prepared to close after the gentleman from Mississippi closes. I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, DHS is uniquely positioned to address human  trafficking through the Blue Campaign. H.R. 2795 seeks to build upon  the success of the Blue Campaign, which was first established in August  2010, and to bolster human trafficking awareness by ensuring that  public-facing materials remain as current and accessible as possible.  This is a worthwhile endeavor.   Madam Speaker, I urge passage of the bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.
