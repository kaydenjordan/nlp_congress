 Mr. President, it is my privilege to welcome Ron  Cunningham of Lander, WY, to the Wyoming Agriculture Hall of Fame. This  induction is held during the week of the Wyoming State Fair in Douglas,  and it is truly one of the highest honors to receive during one of the  best annual events Wyoming has to offer.   To be inducted into the Hall of Fame is truly an honor, no matter  what profession you are in. When it comes to sports, the Hall of Fame  is traditionally reserved for those who were among the best at their  positions, were an exemplary teammate, treated the game with respect,  and created a lasting legacy for future generations of fans to admire.  While the Wyoming Agriculture Hall of Fame does not take into account  how well an individual may run, hit, throw, catch, or tackle, it  instead considers an individual's commitment and dedication to  agriculture in Wyoming and what they have done to help improve and grow  this essential industry in our State. Needless to say, Ron Cunningham  checks all of those boxes and then some.   Ron has spent his entire lifetime in the industry, beginning with his  early years growing up on a farm in Fremont County. This exposure to  agriculture led Ron to pursue further academic endeavors at Casper  College and ultimately the University of Wyoming. He then discovered  that he had a passion for sharing his knowledge and experience with  others and moved to Nebraska to teach agriculture at a high school.  Fortunately for all of us in Wyoming, Ron decided he wanted to come  home and took a position on a ranch in Ten Sleep. He later accepted a  supervisor position with Weed and Pest. After a couple of years, Ron  took a job with the University of Wyoming Extension in Fremont County,  a position he held for 38 years.   Once Ron was back in Wyoming, he became even more involved in so many  ag-related activities that it really would be impossible to name them  all. He left his impression on just about every person he came across,  whether it was with 4-H and FFA, planning and organizing Fremont County  Farm and Ranch Days, or serving on numerous State boards and local  civic organizations. He takes such pride in his work and his efforts  will help ensure Wyoming agriculture continues to thrive for years to  come.   With his decades of service to our State, as well as the numerous  accolades and accomplishments that he has received, it goes without  saying that he is absolutely worthy of the honor of being inducted into  the Wyoming Agriculture Hall of Fame. I am so pleased that Ron will be  joining the likes of so many others who have done so much for  agriculture in our state. His legacy is something to behold and  appreciate. I tip my hat to him.                            ____________________
