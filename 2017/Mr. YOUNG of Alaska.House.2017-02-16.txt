 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Utah  (Mr. Bishop) for bringing this legislation to the floor.   H.J. Res. 69 is very simple. It overturns an illegal rule by the  Obama administration--an illegal rule.   This House created the State of Alaska in 1959, under the Statehood  Act. It clearly granted Alaska full authority to manage fish and game  on all lands in the State of Alaska, including all Federal lands.   The Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act in 1980 further,  in fact, verified what the Statehood Act did: protecting the right of  the State to manage fish and game.   Mo Udall was chairman of the Interior Committee at that time, and he  agreed that this was the right thing to do. The thing that we had to do  was make sure there was no misinterpretation of the Alaska National  Interest Lands Conservation Act and the Statehood Act.   What occurred under the Obama administration is that--your  administration, on that side--in the wee hours of the night, they  passed a rule that took that away from the State. And it is huge, if  you think about it: 16 refuges, 76.8 million acres. That is bigger than  most of the States in this Union. They took the right away from the  State to manage fish and game.   There has been a lot of interest groups and some Members of Congress  that have been conveying falsehoods, flat out dishonesty on what the  taking back of the management of fish and game will do. They talk about  killing puppies and grizzly bears. That does not happen, nor, in fact,  is it legal in the State of Alaska under our management.   The opposition will claim there was consultation with the State of  Alaska. If that is the case, why did Alaska file suit to overturn this  rule? There was no consultation.   Yesterday, I met with most of the leaders of the Alaskan Native  community that live in this area in the refuges and around the refuges.  Not one of them support the rule passed by the Obama administration.   The other side says they are all for helping the American Indians,  the first people, yet they are supporting a rule that is illegal.  Illegal. I want to stress that.   This rule passed by the Obama administration is opposed by the total  delegation, the Governor, all the elected officials in the State of  Alaska, and it is an infringement upon the State of Alaska, and it  should be an infringement upon your States.   Maybe we ought to go back to every State in the Union, maybe even  Virginia, and see how we might change the right of Virginia when the  Federal lands were involved in the State of Alaska.   You stood up in front of this body and held your hand and said: I  swear to uphold the Constitution of America and laws pertaining to it.  Every one of you took that oath. Every one of you. Yet, you stand on  this floor, and some of you will say: Oh, we have to protect the wolf  puppies. That is not what this is about. It is about the law. It is the  Statehood Act, the right of Alaskans, and the right of Alaska to manage  all fish and game.   If you vote against this resolution, you are saying the Congress does  not count, nor can we keep our word. We will do whatever is popular at  the time. I say: Shame on you. You said you would uphold the  Constitution.   Let's pass this legislation that Mr. Bishop has brought to the floor.  Let's turn back that illegal law that they are trying to impose upon  the people of Alaska and the American people. If you don't believe in  that, then I suggest you resign from the body, because you are not  upholding the law that you swore you would do.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the Members of this House for their support of  the legal aspects of the State of Alaska.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair would remind Members to address  their remarks to the Chair.    Madam Speaker, under the decorum of the House, I  won't call it bull. I will just say it is a lot of misinformation and  outright story tales, the information conveyed to these gentlemen and  the ladies from The Humane Society. That is what it is.   There is no sport hunter who is going to be shooting cubs and sows.  In fact, there is no one in the State who does not support my  resolution of organized hunters, viewers. I have not had any of that.   Yes, you got some letters. And I believe the best way to judge is, if  they don't like what I am doing, don't elect me. I am speaking for the  people from my State, not Virginia, not a used car salesman. I am  speaking for my people.   The second false claim is it allows aerial shooting and gunning of  bears. That is not what this is about. It is about the law, and we will  win it in court. But I don't want to win it in court. I want to  establish the fact that an agency does not have the right to break the  law.   As far as Dan Ashe goes, well, did he have any specialists? No. He  did this because of interest groups, governing by interest groups, not  the hunters, not the Alaskans, not the gunmen of Alaska, but The Humane  Society that put out all of this propaganda.   Denning of wolves--and, by the way, I have to remind people. We used  to den wolves. I have done it myself. I got paid 50 bucks for every  wolf I got. You know who paid me? Uncle Sam did when we were a  territory. And when we became a State, we did not allow that.   So let us do our job as a State, instead of having this Congress try  to stop it with an agency.   So I am asking my colleagues to vote for the law, as you should  uphold as you took your oath for this office, the law.   And if you continue this misinformation, I feel sorry for you, and I  feel sorry for the interest groups.   So, Madam Speaker, I do urge a ``yes'' vote on this resolution.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        February 16, 2017, on page H1267, the following appeared: So,  Madam Chairman, I do urge a      The online version has been corrected to read: So, Madam  Speaker, I do urge a    ========================= END NOTE =========================     The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mrs. Wagner).
