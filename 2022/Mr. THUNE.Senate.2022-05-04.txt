 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, Monday's leak of a draft opinion in the  Dobbs Supreme Court case was an unprecedented and deeply disturbing  breach of confidentiality that almost always surrounds Supreme Court  deliberations. It is difficult to think this was anything but an  escalation in the radical left's campaign to bully the Supreme Court  into delivering decisions in line with the priorities of the Democratic  Party. From Court-packing threats to threats from the Democratic leader  himself that were directed to specific Justices, attempting to  intimidate the Supreme Court has become par for the course for  liberals, but Monday's leak represents a new low.   Almost as disturbing as the leak has been the reaction from my  Democratic colleagues. Their hysterical comments have been focused  almost entirely on the prospect of their getting an outcome they don't  want in the Dobbs case. I have seen almost no concern about how the  leak will affect the integrity of the Supreme Court as an institution,  and their activist base has gone out of its way to praise the leaker.   More than one Democrat has actually called for undermining the  integrity of the Supreme Court by packing the Court with additional  Justices. Yes, that is the result of what happened yesterday among  Democrats. More than one Democratic Senator believes that the proper  response to a Supreme Court decision you don't like is to add  additional Justices to the Court until you can be confident that you  will get the outcomes you want.   Other Democratic Senators have proposed undermining the integrity of  the U.S. Senate by abolishing the Senate filibuster rule--again, in  order to be sure that they can get the legislative outcome they want in  response to this possible decision in the Dobbs case.   Mr. President, regardless of what side you are on in this debate, you  should be willing to stand up for the rule of law and the integrity of  our institutions. That shouldn't be a partisan issue. Our system of  government depends upon the rule of law, which is based upon an  independent judiciary, free of political pressure or partisan  influence.   Do Democrats really want a future in which Supreme Court decisions  are made based on political pressure or bullying rather than on the  Justices' impartial application of the law and the Constitution to the  case before them? Maybe they do. But if they continue to push in that  direction, they will end up sacrificing our system of government in the  process.   Mr. President, I have strong beliefs in any number of issues,  including abortion, but above all, I believe in our system of  government and in the rule of law. While I will fight passionately in  support of the causes I believe in, I will not sacrifice the integrity  of our institutions for what would ultimately be nothing but temporary  political gain. It is starting to seem like most of my Democratic  colleagues disagree with that position. That may possibly be a recipe  for political success, but it is also a recipe for destroying free  government.   I am glad that Chief Justice Roberts has taken steps to investigate  this unprecedented breach of trust at the Court, and I hope that he  will receive the full support of the Department of Justice should this  turn out to be a criminal matter. It is difficult to overstate how much  this breach could erode trust among Justices and Supreme Court staff,  and I hope the damage is minimized by a quick identification of the  party responsible. I hope every one of the Justices will continue to  feel free to do their jobs and follow the facts, the law, and the  Constitution.   At least one Democrat has suggested Republicans are spending more  time commenting on the leak than on the content of Justice Alito's  draft because we are somehow scared to talk about our pro-life  decision. Let me be perfectly clear: We are not. I am proud to defend  the right to life, and I know my colleagues are as well.   I think most of us have refrained from commenting because we don't  yet truly know the outcome. But I will say this. I hope Justice Alito's  opinion ends up being the majority opinion. As I have long believed,  Roe v. Wade was a terrible decision by an activist Court that reached  far beyond the Constitution and the Court's interpretive role to impose  a new abortion regime on the entire country. I hope the Supreme Court  overturns Roe and returns the question of abortion to the American  people and their elected representatives, where it belongs.   The fight to defend life is in keeping with our highest ideals, our  passion for justice, our dedication to human rights, and our compassion  for the innocent and the vulnerable. I am grateful for all the  Americans who have fought to make sure the right to life of vulnerable  human beings is protected and have spent their time and their resources  helping moms in need. I look forward to a day, which I hope is soon  approaching, when innocent, unborn Americans will enjoy the full  protection of the law.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
