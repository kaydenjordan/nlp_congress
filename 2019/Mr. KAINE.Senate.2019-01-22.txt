 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 6, H.J. Res. 1,  making further continuing appropriations for the Department of Homeland  Security. I further ask that the joint resolution be considered read a  third time and passed and that the motion to reconsider be considered  made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.    Thank you.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise to discuss the continuing effects of  the shutdown of part of the government on American workers and the  American public.   I want to begin by discussing the effect of the shutdown on the Coast  Guard. Following that, I will talk about a visit that I actually just  made to a restaurant at 7th and Pennsylvania Avenues that was opened  for the  [[Page S320]]  purposes of offering free food to Federal employees and their families  during the shutdown. Finally, I will address the proposal offered by  the President on Saturday to reach an agreement on border security and  immigration issues.   To begin with, the Coast Guard. The Coast Guard is a branch of the  U.S. military with a proud history. There are 42,000 active members of  the Coast Guard. There are 7,500 reservists, 8,500 civilian employees,  and nearly 50,000 Coast Guard retirees. All are affected by the  shutdown, most working without pay, and others, particularly civilians,  are furloughed without pay. In addition, the shutdown jeopardizes  payments to the 50,000 Coast Guard retirees.   Virginia has a significant Coast Guard presence, especially in  Hampton Roads and Northern Virginia. Virginians perform all of the  missions that the Coast Guard is entrusted to perform--search and  rescues, drug interdictions, military missions, and law enforcement.  The Coast Guard Honor Guard, which covers funerals and ceremonial  occasions all over the world, is based in Virginia, and so is the unit  that provides IT support for Coast Guard functions, including cutters  that are currently at sea, like the USS Bertholf, which deployed out of  Alameda, CA, on Sunday.   As the Presiding Officer knows--sometimes it is a little bit  confusing not just to the public but even to the military--the Coast  Guard is unique in the shutdown because they are a branch of the  military, but they are budgeted through the Department of Homeland  Security, not the Department of Defense.    DOD was funded by the work that this Senate, the House, and the  President did through appropriations bills that were signed earlier in  the year. So every other branch of the military is currently funded;  the DHS, however, is not funded. So the Coast Guard is the one military  branch that is not being paid.   This is creating some enormous--enormous--issues that my Coast Guard  members in Virginia have been sharing with me. Just one, for example,  is the USS Bertholf, which is the Coast Guard cutter that deployed  Sunday out of Alameda, CA, on a military mission as part of PACOM in  the Western Pacific. So the traditional going-away event, where  everyone in the Coast Guard is deploying for multiple months, and their  families are there, and they are saying good-bye to their families--but  for the families who live in and around Alameda, it is not necessarily  cheap. They are going to have to keep paying bills--rent and other  things--while their Coasties, as they call themselves, are deployed.  Yet they are not being paid. Even though this cutter will be involved  in missions together with Navy ships where sailors are being paid, the  Coasties are not being paid.   You can imagine--and this has been described by my Coast Guard  members in Virginia--that there are some sizable equity issues in this.  The Coast Guard likes to recruit among those who want to volunteer to  serve their country, and they have said that they have been able to  recruit even-steven with the Marines and the Navy and the Army and the  Air Force. They can recruit even-steven. They offer a lot of similar  opportunities to serve and similar abilities to advance in rank, so  they feel that in recruiting for IT professionals or others, they can  do their very best. However, something like this really affects their  ability to recruit.   As is well known, in a shutdown, the DOD is likely to be funded. All  of the other branches of the military will be funded, but the Coast  Guard will not be. It affects recruitment significantly, and it affects  retention.   I have heard a number of stories from Coast Guard members in  Virginia. Just this morning, someone who is a young coast guarder in  their first 2 years said this; this is a direct quote:         I skip dinners now so I can buy food for my dogs. I have       dogs. I care about my dogs. To buy dog food is important for       them, and so I will do breakfast and lunch, but I skip       dinners now to buy food for my dogs.    I had two Coast Guard members tell me about challenges with paying  rent--one in the private sector and two, interesting enough, are living  on military bases. Let me describe each.   Northern Virginia is not a cheap place to live. There is a Coast  Guard member in Northern Virginia, and when the shutdown started and he  was not being paid, he went to his landlord and said: Landlord, can you  give me an extension? I am serving my country in the Coast Guard.   The landlord, a regional firm that has many apartments, came back and  said, in an effort that kind of sounded friendly: Listen, we will let  you pay half of the month's rent on the 15th and half at the end  instead of one big rent check a month. We will do that, but you have to  agree to rewrite your lease to allow us to evict you after 15 days  rather than after 30 days.   He said: Look, I am a young guy. I don't know that much, but I have a  grandfather in the real estate business. I showed him this proposal,  and he said ``Hold on a second. It would probably be better if you keep  your current lease and try to even borrow money from family than to  sign an amendment of your lease allowing you to be evicted after 15  days.''   I think the Presiding Officer and I would say: What kind of landlord  would do this? What kind of landlord would take somebody serving their  country and try to accelerate the ability to evict them because of the  shutdown? That is, in fact, happening, and it is not a small landlord  either.   That one surprised me, but I will say there was another one that  surprised me more. Two of the Coast Guard members I had visited with in  Northern Virginia live on military bases. One lives in Quantico in  military housing, and one lives in Fort Belvoir, the Army base in  Fairfax County, in military housing. So you would think that this  landlord would be a more understanding landlord than maybe a private  sector landlord, but when the shutdown happened, in each instance, they  went to their landlord and said: Hey, we are being shut down. We are  not being paid.   The response was: What do you mean you are not being paid? The  Marines are being paid. The Army is being paid. You are living on a  military base, and everybody is being paid. What do you mean you are  not being paid? You have to pay your rent.   The military, which is in charge of military housing on these bases,  was not aware that because the Coast Guard comes up through DHS, they  are not being paid. So they are having trouble with their landlords,  even though their landlords are part of the military and should  understand this.   That same challenge is affecting one of the servicemembers whose  child is in a child development center on the base at Quantico. Not  being able to pay--you would think that a military child development  center might understand, but, in fact, that is not the case.   Other Coast Guard members have told me about an additional challenge.  The Coast Guard relies on civilians, just as all of our other military  branches rely on civilians, and the civilians are hit very hard by the  furlough.   At one facility in Virginia, civilians are in charge of maintaining  more than 40 buildings that are old and need some TLC. Boilers that  need work in January and other physical infrastructure that has needs-- that work is done by private contractors who are furloughed, so that  work, which is critical to their being able to operate the  installations, is hard to get done.   The IT functions of the Coast Guard take advantage of the civilian  expertise of people in Northern Virginia too. One Coast Guard member  described a job offer they extended to somebody to come work for the  Coast Guard. They made the job offer just a day or two before the  shutdown happened, so now they can't hire the individual.   They are trying to convince the individual: Please, hang on; don't  take another job. IT jobs are plentiful in Northern Virginia, but don't  take another job. Wait for us.   Well, wait for how long?   I don't know for how long.   They are worried that they are going to lose a critical employee.   One of the Coast Guard individuals I talked to basically put it this  way: ``It is embarrassing. It is psychologically embarrassing. We  signed up to help others, not beg for charity at food banks or  restaurants for Federal employees''--and just talked about how hard it  is.   In a way, we should all be willing to ask for help. We all need help  in our  [[Page S321]]  lives. But somebody who has signed up and their goal is to help  others--they were just being candid in saying that it is really hard to  go ask others for help, for food.   When the Coast Guard can't do missions or when they can't do some of  the other functions they are supposed to do--the Honor Guard can't go  to funerals at Arlington or other occasions--then those jobs fall  heavier on the other services. So they talk about not just the  degradation of their own work but the fact that others have to pull  extra weight for them.   Here is what a Coast Guard employee said to me: I am paid as an  officer to motivate and to lead. That is what officers do, we try to  motivate and to lead. I shouldn't have to stand before a group of  Coasties and offer a class on how to file unemployment insurance.   Yet that is something that he is now being told that he has to do.   So many of the Coast Guard members mention what other Federal  employees say--almost a cliche line that I am hearing from everybody: I  guess I will figure it out for myself, but I worry about my shipmates.  I guess I will figure it out for myself, but I worry about someone  else. So many of the Federal employees are struck.   Finally, a general question: Why would anyone sign up if they knew  they would be treated this way?   Some of the Coast Guard members authorized me to use their names and  let me tell a few of their stories with their first names attached  before I move into talking about my visit to the pop-up restaurant just  seven blocks from here.   Katherine from Fairfax County:         I am directly affected by this senseless government       shutdown. I retired from the U.S. Coast Guard in 2006. Since       the U.S. Coast Guard is an organization of the Department of       Homeland Security, all U.S. Coast Guard personnel (active       duty, civilian employees, reservists, and retirees) are being       inflicted with undue financial hardship and stress. Today, I       went to my local [credit union] branch office to enroll in a       0% APR Government Shutdown Assistance Program. Admittedly, I       was embarrassed and saddened to have to take this action to       maintain some sense of personal financial health and       security. My heart goes out to my brothers and sisters of the       [U.S. Coast Guard] that are currently on active duty, working       without pay, and supporting a family. This is our reality       today.    Lisa from Ashburn:         My husband works for the Coast Guard and is required to       work without pay. We suffered a house flood during Hurricane       Matthew that wiped out our savings and have a daughter in       college. Not sure how we can manage if we miss more than one       paycheck, as we also assist my mother, who has had a stroke.       Praying that this is over sooner than later.    Sue from Loudoun County:         My Coast Guard son and his family live in Kodiak, Alaska,       and are not getting paid.    Senator Murkowski gave a speech about Kodiak and the Coast Guard  presence in Kodiak on the floor on Saturday.         Risking his life as a rescue pilot with no pay is       unpatriotic as well as dangerous for the country. These men       and women work for us, to protect our country. They should be       paid and not told to have a yard sale to make due.    Mary from Williamsburg:         My husband has worked tirelessly as a member of the all-      volunteer Coast Guard Auxiliary. He teaches Safe Boating       classes and has used his boat as a vessel to assist in search       and rescue in Sector Hampton Roads. Now with the shutdown, he       cannot do any of the boat safety activities to help the Coast       Guard keep our waters safe. It is ridiculous to shut down the       federal government--but it is dangerous to have curbed the       lifesaving activities of the Coast Guard and their invaluable       volunteer auxiliarists!    He cannot volunteer. He cannot volunteer because of the shutdown.   Trinity from Suffolk:         My father works on the US Coast Guard base in Portsmouth,       VA. Even though my father hasn't gotten a paycheck, Hampton       University still wants the payments for my tuition. Just       because his paychecks have stopped doesn't mean our bills       have.    Gary from Chesapeake:         My son is a Chief in the Coast Guard. For the past 19       years, he went to sea to protect our coastline, enforce our       laws, and rescue those in need. Over the years he missed       countless holidays, birthdays, and anniversaries with family       and friends. Now, there's no respect for his sacrifices and       service.    Finally, Samantha from Herndon:         My husband is a civilian employee of the Coast Guard. We       are having to pull money from savings and significantly       change our spending habits just to make sure we can make it       through the month. We worry about paying our mortgage and       keeping the heat and lights on. A wall will not help border       security, and everyday working people are paying the price       for a pointless standoff over it.    These are just a few of the stories I have heard from Guard members.  There are many, many more.   I want to talk about a visit that I just paid, and I would encourage  everyone in Congress to do this--in the Senate. We are here this week.  There is a pop-up restaurant at Seventh and Pennsylvania--just seven  blocks from here--that was opened by an organization called Chefs for  Feds. Chefs for Feds is an organization started by Jose Andres to deal  with emergencies. They went to Puerto Rico and served millions of meals  to people affected by hurricanes there. They have done similar work in  California to deal with the communities affected by wildfires and in  Indonesia to deal with communities affected by earthquakes and  tsunamis. This is an NGO that focuses on helping people in the midst of  disasters.   Now they have opened a restaurant at Seventh and Pennsylvania. This  is the first manmade disaster in which they are trying to figure out a  way to help. The restaurant opened last Tuesday. Any Federal employee  or family member can come. Six to eight thousand people have come every  day. It is open from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Today, they expanded services.  They have also opened, broadly, a coat closet, a food bank, a place  where moms can go to get diapers, which aren't cheap, feminine  products, which aren't cheap, and basic pharmaceutical things that  aren't cheap. So it is a combination of a restaurant and sort of a  broader social services ministry.   Chefs for Feds is an interesting group. They have other nonprofits  that are involved--DC Diaper Bank, Martha's Table, which is an  effective, faith-based ministry to hungry and homeless people.   I showed up there at about 11:45. It is cold today. I showed up to go  thank people and work as a volunteer. There was a line like you see in  pictures of the Depression of hundreds of people waiting outside. The  restaurant is actually kind of short. You go in, get in a line, and you  are offered a sandwich or soup and some fruit and maybe an iced tea and  utensils. People are coming in and eating quickly and leaving. You can  take a sandwich for a colleague at work or for somebody at home if you  need that. It looked like one of those photos you might see from the  Depression.   The volunteers are chefs and restaurant workers around Virginia who  have their own issues and challenges to deal with, but they are there  helping. Many of the volunteers are furloughed Federal employees. If  you are being locked out of your job, you still want to help others,  and so probably the biggest group of the volunteers were furloughed  Federal employees.   I met a Federal employee from Richmond who was furloughed and drove  up just to volunteer today to help others, who lives not far from where  I live. There were other volunteers who are just concerned citizens-- not Federal employees, but they heard about it and came.   I met one of the volunteers, a kind of supervisor of the kitchen. His  name is Tim, and so that was easy for me to remember. He was here from  Ventura, CA. He knew nothing about this group until his house burned  down in California, and they came to his community to offer meals. With  his whole house destroyed, he started to volunteer to help others. When  he heard about the shutdown, even as he is still dealing with his own  issues in California after the wildfire, he came to help run the  kitchen operation.   Today, they not only expanded to the clothes closet and diaper  distribution; they also announced a whole series of other restaurants  and similar pop-up operations they are going to do all over the United  States. They have looked where there is a high density of Federal  employees, and they announced 15 to 20 other locations around the  country where they are now going to start serving.   It was something to see this long line of Federal employees waiting  out in the cold to get into that restaurant. Just the length of the  line made a real impression on me. It was emotional. It was interesting  that so many were law enforcement in uniform--Park Service, people from  the FBI and other Agencies, clearly law enforcement in uniform--waiting  in the cold to come in  [[Page S322]]  and get a sandwich. There were parents with their children, young  children. Being furloughed, it is hard to afford childcare, so if you  are going to come down to get food, what do you do with your 3-year- old? Well, they had their children in their arms.   As I said, it looked like something from the Depression, but we are  not in a depression. Our economy is strong right now. Our stock market  is up right now. It is one thing to see that kind of a line when we are  in a depression, but when we are being told that the economy is great,  to see that kind of line made a huge impression upon me--so  unnecessary.   I thank Jose Andres and the chefs. I thank the volunteers. I thank  Martha's Table. I thank others who are responding. They pointed out to  me--they said: Look, this one is different from all the other ones we  have done because it is the only disaster that is manmade and  unnecessary.   Jose looked at me and said: Shut us down by reopening government. You  guys reopen and then shut us down. We don't want to be open at Seventh  and Pennsylvania. We want to send the volunteers home and have the  government reopen.   The President said he was proud to shut down the government. I defy  any thinking and feeling person in this country to go to Seventh and  Pennsylvania between 11 and 6 and look at that line in the middle of  January and say they are proud. I have a lot of words that I might  attach to it. I don't think anybody could look at that--I don't think  anybody going and talking to people or working the line like I did-- just the faces. The faces of people as they came to the line--all were  grateful. All were grateful that others were there to provide some  help, but many were embarrassed, certainly for their country and  sometimes personally--again, like my Coast Guarder who said: I signed  up to help people. I don't like asking for help. I don't like asking  for charity.    There are people who are there that--yes, they are grateful, but they  are embarrassed and some are angry at how they are being treated, and  who can blame them for that?   As I conclude, there is a way out. There is a way out, and I think  the way out has two steps: First, reopen government ASAP, and second,  treat the President's proposal from Saturday seriously. I do believe  the President's proposal--and we have talked about this--I do believe  it is a proposal that deserves to be treated seriously.   The proposal he has made, if it were offered for a vote now, with no  opportunity to study it and improve it, I probably would vote against  it, but it is a proposal that deserves to be treated seriously because  it deals with four issues. It deals with the right investment in border  security; that is an important issue. It deals with how to deal with  Dreamers; that is an important issue. It deals with how to deal with  the TPS program; that is an important issue. There is a fourth issue in  the proposal that the President didn't speak about Saturday--the  standards and processes for applying and potentially receiving asylum  in the United States. He didn't mention that during the speech. It is  in the proposal. It is an important issue.   What does it mean to take the President's proposal seriously? Even if  I have some points of difference on each of the four elements, I would  not disagree with the assertion that each of the elements is very  important. We should be dealing with them.   What does it mean to take the President's proposal seriously? If he  means it seriously, then he should want us to address it seriously.   I understand that the bill is 1,200 pages. I understand that it might  be introduced today. I haven't seen it. I don't think it has been  introduced yet. Maybe it has and I was down serving lunch and haven't  had a chance to read it. But 1,200 pages is a big bill, and these are  big and important topics.   What would be the way we would engage, Democrats and Republicans,  with this proposal to show the President we are taking it seriously? We  would put it in a committee--the Judiciary or Appropriations Committee.  The Parliamentarians would determine where it would go based upon how  it is drafted, but it would likely be one of those two committees. The  relevant committee obviously has a Republican chair in a Republican  majority body; that is fine. There is a Republican majority on the  committee; that is fine. But you would put it in the committee, and the  first thing you would do is you would ask the administration to come up  and explain each point.   They put a proposal on the table. OK, $5.7 billion--how do you want  to spend it? What does your TPS proposal mean? What does your Dreamer  proposal mean? How do you propose to change the asylum laws? The  administration would explain their proposal and answer questions about  it.   Then promptly--especially with a Republican committee chair with some  power over timing--promptly, the committee could take up the matter and  have a normal committee process, with members able to make amendments.  I am not on either of the relevant committees, so this is easy for me  to say, but if a Democrat had an idea about, here is a way to improve  it, there is no chance that idea is getting passed without some  Republican votes because the Democrats are in the minority. But a  Democrat and a Republican should be able to offer ideas for how the  proposal should be improved, and that can be done promptly.   With a Republican majority, the chances of the President's proposal-- hopefully with some improvements--being reported out to the floor is  very high. If it is reported out to the floor, we could have a similar  process here, with Members being able to make amendments. Again, no  amendment is going to be accepted from a Democrat without some  Republicans saying it is a good idea. No amendment would be accepted  without a majority or a supermajority of this body saying: That is a  good idea; that improves the proposal.    That would be how we would show President Trump that we take the  proposal seriously.   I have heard--and I know it is not yet completely decided, though-- that there is an effort that we want to have a vote on it this week. We  don't want to have a committee process. We don't want to have  amendments. We just want to have a vote on it this week.   That would suggest that the proposal was not offered in seriousness  and the Senate was not being serious about addressing it.   I think the Senate, on this proposal, should just be the Senate, and  we should count on committees, which are helmed by Republicans, to try  to promptly move this through a process where they all get to put their  thumbprints on it and make it better.   Let me address quickly, as I conclude, the elements of the proposal.   How much to spend on border security? For this Senator, the dollar  amount that the President proposed does not trouble me as long as it is  used right. I have voted for proposals to try to advance to the White  House that had more than $5.7 billion of border security. Our 2013 bill  had $40-plus billion over 10 years. The bill we voted on in February  had $25 billion over 10 years. The dollar amount is not the challenge  for this Senator. The challenge is that I want to make sure we use it  the right way.   When every Member of Congress who represents the border--all nine-- say that just using the money to build a big wall is a bad idea, that  should tell us something. When our border professionals say there are  higher priorities than using all the money to build a wall, that should  tell us something.   But if the administration goes to the committee and presents their  case, and they have border professionals saying, ``Here are the ways to  spend it, and physical barriers are really important in this place or  that place,'' they would really help us. I am very open to that. I just  don't want to waste the money, but the dollar amount is less important  to me than the way money should be spent. That is the kind of thing we  can negotiate and find an accord on.   Dreamers. The President terminated protection for about 1.7 million  Dreamers two Septembers ago. He then challenged us to find a  congressional resolution.   His proposal is to restore protections to about 700,000 Dreamers for  a period of 3 years. Well, I am curious--700,000. Why not the full 1.7  million whose protections you pulled. Three years--why not four? But  these are issues we could debate. These are issues where amendments  could be offered, and we could find--again, I believe--a compromise.  [[Page S323]]    The President is terminating TPS programs for about 400,000 people  from 10 countries. He is proposing, actually, to restore about 300,000  of the individuals with rights under the Temporary Protected Status  Program. I want to know: Why not all 400,000? What is it about some  countries that you want to restore the protections you took away but  you don't want to restore protections to the other countries? Maybe  there is a reason. Maybe there is a good reason. But maybe there isn't  a good reason, and we ought to have that discussion and offer Democrats  and Republicans the ability to take some sandpaper to it and try to  make it better.   Finally, asylum. This was the issue that the President did not speak  about in his speech, but apparently the bill, which I haven't seen, has  dramatic changes to the processes for applying for asylum and possibly  the standards for getting asylum.   That is an important issue. We want to make sure that we do it right.  There are international legal ramifications, and there are also  ramifications in terms of this ``Statue of Liberty'' Nation. We want to  make sure we get it right, but is there an openness to having  discussions about asylum procedures? Of course there is.   So I would say that when President Trump put a proposal on the table  on Saturday that dealt with border security funding, TPS, Dreamers, and  asylum, each of those issues are issues on which we ought to be having  a discussion, and we ought to be able to find some accord.   Frankly, if we can't find a pretty significant bipartisan accord  here, the chances of there being one in the House is slim. So we ought  to take the time to find it here. We ought to take the time to do that  and do it promptly without people being needlessly hurt.   That is why I return to my original request. I hope we will take a  step that will shut down the pop-up restaurant at 7th and Pennsylvania,  as the chefs asked me to do today. Let's reopen government and shut  down the restaurant that has popped up to serve those 6,000 to 8,000  people a day who are being punished unnecessarily.   I thank the patience of the Chair and those in the Chamber.   I yield the floor.
