 Madam Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 1053, I call  up the bill (H.R. 7327) making additional supplemental appropriations  for disaster relief requirements for the fiscal year ending September  30, 2020, and for other purposes, and ask for its immediate  consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I am pleased to offer H.R. 7327, the Child Care for  Economic Recovery Act, which I introduced with our exceptional Labor,  Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies Subcommittee  chairwoman, Rosa DeLauro; our esteemed Appropriations Committee  colleague, Congresswoman Clark; and our Ways and Means colleagues,  Chairman Neal, Chairman Davis, and Congresswoman Sanchez.   It is no secret, with quality childcare, children enter kindergarten  ready to learn; hardworking families have better job security, knowing  their children are healthy and safe; and our communities thrive.   But even before COVID-19, millions of hardworking families,  disproportionately families of color, struggled to find and afford  quality care that matched their work hours and ZIP Codes.   At the height of the pandemic, more than half of childcare  providers--many of them women, minority-owned small businesses  operating on razor-thin margins--closed their doors. We risk losing  more permanently.   Every single industry counts on childcare. In order to save our  economy, we need to save childcare.                                time  1245    The Child Care for Economic Recovery Act would:   More than triple mandatory funds for the childcare entitlement to  States;  [[Page H3914]]    Invest $10 billion in new infrastructure grants so providers have the  resources to address hazardous conditions like broken heaters, mold,  and lead paint, as well as necessary modifications to protect our  children and caretakers from the risk of coronavirus;   Reimburse child and dependent care costs incurred by essential  workers who have sacrificed so much to keep us safe;   Make the child and dependent care tax credit fully refundable for the  first time; keep the lights on and doors open with a new tax credit for  childcare providers to help cover costs for rent, mortgages, and  utilities; and   Recognize childcare workers as essential.   What is good for our babies is good for our budget. With this bill,  we can do what is good for our babies and the budget.   Madam Speaker, I urge support, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentlewoman from New Mexico (Ms. Haaland).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Massachusetts (Mr. Kennedy).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, I am enthusiastically supporting this bill. Childcare  is essential for every woman who has ever raised children with the  struggling days that she manages to work and take care of the children,  so I am a very strong supporter of this bill.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
