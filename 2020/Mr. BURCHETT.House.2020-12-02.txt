 Madam Speaker, late last week, east Tennessee said  goodbye to a beloved member of our community, Wanda Moody, a close,  dear friend of mine, and mentor, who led incredible careers in the  field of public service and education. She passed away on Sunday at the  age of 91.   Wanda was a strong, tough leader who spent her entire life making  east Tennessee a better place, Madam Speaker. Wanda was a lifelong  educator and early advocate for special education.   In the late 1980s, after leaving the city school system, she fought  to expand special education initiatives as an assistant commissioner of  education under then-Governor Lamar Alexander. She later served a  similar role developing special education programs for the City of  Knoxville under then-Mayor Kyle Testerman.   Wanda's success compelled her to run and win a seat on the Knox  County Commission in 1986. She was one of the first women to serve on  that legislative body.   During her three decades as a Knox County Commissioner, Wanda asked  tough questions and painstakingly reviewed budgets and financial  documents. She wasn't shy of speaking up for increased government  accountability and transparency, Madam Speaker.   Wanda led the charge on many reforms that continue to influence Knox  County government to this day. Even after leaving public office in  2006, Wanda remained active and influential in our community.   Wanda was one of my oldest friends, and her mentorship will forever  influence my public service career. Although she will be greatly  missed, I am  [[Page H6041]]  proud to celebrate Wanda's life and recognize her many contributions to  our community.   My friend, Wanda, will be missed.                            ____________________
