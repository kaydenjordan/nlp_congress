 Mr. Speaker, thank you for the opportunity to begin  discussion on the floor for issues that, I think, against the backdrop  of Mother's Day, the desire to be family friendly in this Nation, and  really to answer the question of Americans: Can our government do well  by them?   So I raise to the body how we can be more constructive, and I do it  on the basis, as we all do, when we go home and interact with our  constituents, and so I did as I went home this past weekend a couple of  days in the midst of the exciting graduations that we all had a chance  to go to and to make remarks, and I want to congratulate those students  that I had the privilege of being and speaking at their graduations,  the  [[Page H3987]]  Historically Black College Texas Southern University, the Lone Star  Community College, what an amazing group of graduates. There were large  numbers of people who are adults and veterans, and students who were  what we call early college graduating. And then, of course, to the  system, the Houston Community College, I spoke there.   It looks like I was going to graduations and celebrating with their  families. That was good.   Mr. Speaker, they were diverse, all backgrounds, religions. That is  what Houston is all about.   At the same time, I visited with and had a press conference with a  collective body of humanitarians, Sister Rogers, a Catholic Sister, and  many others, about the unfortunate circumstances of where we are with  the Dreamers and why we haven't addressed that question and why would  Dreamers, who need to be statused, who are lawyers and doctors, and  some are serving in public service--we had a paramedic standing with  us--why we can't get them statused. Why can't the Nation do what is  right? Why can't the President stand up and work with us and sign the  bill?   And then I indicated that I am going to introduce the restatusing of  TPS statused persons, some who have been here for 20 years with  mortgages and people in college, young people in college, and to status  them for 2 years to allow the Congress to fix it and that their status  be tied to the laws and requirements that they be in sync with those  who would get citizenship so they would not be, if you will, awry of  the law, that they would be in step with the law, as most of these  families are from El Salvador, Honduras, and Haiti, and beyond.   And then I went to stand with mothers at public housing and indicated  to them that it is long overdue in all of our communities that we  introduce an infrastructure bill of $150 billion to fix our public  housing. Because as I was standing with these mothers at Cuney Homes,  their air conditioning was out.   But we stood there the day before Mother's Day to salute them and say  they deserve to live in quality housing. They are raising their  children. Some of their children go off to the United States military.   Finally, I think it is important to acknowledge, Mr. Speaker, maybe  this is a confused statement by the administration, but I have to speak  against, and these are my friends, we want to work internationally--I  was here for the permanent trade agreement that was done with China-- but it is important to know that our economy is based on innovation.  Why would the administration support the Chinese firm of ZTE that our  intelligence community has taken note that they have interfered with  our innovation and our technology and suggest that he wants the Chinese  workers to have their jobs again?   I certainly want the best for any country, but I do know it is  important to restore the jobs of the American people, and there are  many call center American companies that would make a great infusion of  energy and dollars in various communities across the Nation.    It is important to note that the House Intelligence Committee report  of 2012 indicated and concluded that ZTE cannot be trusted to be free  of foreign state influence and thus poses a security threat to the  United States and our systems.   Well, it is odd that this President, who has put extensive sanctions  on Iran and North Korea, is now willing to overlook a House  Intelligence report indicating, of course, that ZTE cannot be trusted.   So I started, Mr. Speaker, by congratulating my graduates, but I  indicated throughout that I am baffled by these policies of the  administration, but I do say that I have a faith in this institution,  and I ask my colleagues: Stand with me on the restoration of a 2-year  status for TPS so we can get it right. Let us not separate mothers from  their children in the immigration structure, and let's pass a Dreamers  bill, and let's work to introduce funding for our public housing that  exists and that mothers are living in across America.   Mr. Speaker, your kindness is appreciated.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I was honored just a few minutes ago to  be on the floor of the House with the chairman of the committee, Mr.  Goodlatte; the ranking member, Mr. Nadler; the proponent of this bill,  Mr. Rutherford; and our Democratic proponent, Mrs. Demings, to honor  those fallen officers with a moment of silence in the most powerful  lawmaking body in the world, to acknowledge to the Nation and to the  world that we stand united in honoring those who have fallen in the  call of duty.   I would like to express my deepest gratitude during National Police  Week to all the brave men and women who continue to give of themselves  selflessly. I also acknowledge my own hometown leadership: Sheriff  Gonzalez, and, of course, our distinguished chief of police; all of the  assistant chiefs, deputy sheriffs, and leadership; constables and their  deputy constables; Texas rangers; and, of course, our Federal officers,  over which this committee has jurisdiction. We thank not only them for  their service, but also the families whose loved ones have fallen in  battle.   This is not a discussion of the respect and admiration we have for  officers, and there is no argument regarding the difficulty, danger,  and stress associated with being a police officer. We all have seen the  reports that show, in 2017, 129 police officers died in the line of  duty; 46 of those brave men and women were shot, while 140, tragically,  committed suicide. That says a lot about the toll this type of  profession takes on a person physically, psychologically, mentally, and  on their families.   The risks inherent in policing resulted in numerous statutes that  deal with protecting our law enforcement officers via Federal and State  law. Our law enforcement officers are most protected under our laws,  and, in some instances, the statutes give life and the death penalty  for such crimes. Even crimes against the broadly defined category of  first responders are well addressed under Federal and State law.   My State of Texas has several criminal statutes addressing attacks on  law enforcement officers; therefore, this legislation may be deemed to  be a duplicate legal framework. But I want to propose to my colleagues,  as I did when we sat together at the Rules Committee, that we can work  together in moving forward.   I do want to say on this legislation that it does frame itself on the  focus of the targeting of law enforcement. As well, it recognizes that  the first prosecution level will be State and local laws to protect or  bring to justice those who have shot police officers.    Mr. Speaker, I want to be clear that I respect the  bill that is moving forward but recognize that we really need to do  more.   One of the points that I want to make is this new law does not have  mandatory minimums. It does allow the discretion of the judge, but I  believe that there are issues that our civil rights groups have raised  that are legitimate.   This bill is being contemplated during a time when our country is in  need of a new look at the Nation's 18,000 law enforcement agencies. I  hope my colleague, Mr. Rutherford, as we have honored those together  who have fallen, will join us in the Law Enforcement Trust and  Integrity Act that will provide for the opportunity for credentialing,  professional development training and counseling, deescalation training  that is necessary for our officers, and join in the enhancements of  police-community relations. This will be a true tribute to our officers  and, as well, provide a framework of protecting their lives as we  engage the community in more coming together between police and  community.   I hope, again, that we move together as a committee and that the  police working group will produce this kind of legislation. I support  the Protect and Serve Act of 2018.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to express my deepest gratitude during this  National Police Week, to all the brave men and women that continue to  give of themselves selflessly.   There is no argument regarding the difficulty, danger and stress  associated with being a police officer.   We have all seen the reports that show in 2017, 129 police officers  died in the line of duty. 46 of those brave men and women were shot,  while 140 committed suicides. That says a lot about the toll this type  of profession takes on a person both physical, psychologically and  mentally.   The risk inherent in policing resulted in numerous statutes with vast  protection via federal and state law. Our law enforcement officers are  most protected under our laws and in some instances life and the death  penalty are imposed for such crimes.   Even crimes against the broadly defined category of first responders  are well addressed under federal and state law.   For example, my state of Texas has several criminal statutes  addressing attacks on law enforcement officers.   Therefore, this legislation is duplicative in nature and does not  improve current legal framework for crimes against law enforcement  officers.   I want to be clear about the respect that we have for the difficult  work undertaken by our law enforcement professionals. However, as Mr.  Chairman said at Rules yesterday in agreement with my concerns, we  cannot ignore the danger in taking such a one-sided approach to the  issue of police practices.   Many of the civil rights groups have raised legitimate concerns. For  example, this bill is being contemplated during a time when our country  is in the throes of a national policing crisis, with a never-ending  stream of police shootings of unarmed African americans captured on  video.   While I support protection for our officers, I am also troubled by  the message this may send to all those impacted daily by the violence  perpetrated by the bad apples within law enforcement.   We should focus on real reform measures like the Law Enforcement  Trust and Integrity Act that will protect law enforcement, first  responders, and their communities.   Over the years, well-documented, unconstitutional policing practices  in communities of color across the United States have eroded trust  between these communities and the law enforcement officials sworn to  protect them.   Almost 1,000 people were killed by police in 2017 according to the  Washington Post. Another outlet estimates over 1,100 police-related  fatalities last year, with people of color representing more than 50  percent of those unarmed during fatal encounters with police.  [[Page H4012]]    In the two years since the creation of the Judiciary bipartisan  Policing Strategies Working Group, the Committee has advanced no police  reform legislation.   The country's interests would be better served by working to foster  law enforcement reforms aimed at helping local jurisdictions meet their  constitutional obligation of fair and unbiased policing. Repeatedly  pursuing legislation, such as H.R. 5698, will sow seeds of division by  ignoring the realities of police accountability issues, thus ultimately  undermining public safety.   We should care equally about harms by and against police officers and  their impact on local communities.   Out of respect for all who have lost their lives over the last year-- both law enforcement and civilian--we must dedicate ourselves to  engaging the difficult issues in reforming police practices to make  lasting change in our communities.
