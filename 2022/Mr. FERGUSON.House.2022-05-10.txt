 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Mrs. Ann Thomas, a  dedicated educator, who will be retiring after 43 years as a math  teacher at Springwood High School.   Mrs. Thomas is someone who challenges her students to look beyond the  pages of the textbook and to become problem-solvers and critical  thinkers. Every day her tenacity, her passion, and dedication impact  each and every one of her students.   As a math teacher, she ensured that young people would have the  knowledge and skills to not only help them succeed in the classroom,  but to be empowered to become productive members of society.   Mr. Speaker, I am a proud alumnus of Springwood High School in many  ways because of her. In honor of her 43 years of remarkable service, I  thank and commend Mrs. Thomas for her relentless commitment to  mathematics education and for helping the next generation of young  students succeed.                            ____________________
