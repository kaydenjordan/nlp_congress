 Madam Speaker, I rise today to discuss the crisis  along our southwest border during the ongoing public health emergency.   Last year, the Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector  General released a report titled ``DHS Needs to Enhance Its COVID-19  Response at the Southwest Border.'' The DHS OIG findings highlight what  Republicans have been saying for 7 months, that U.S. Customs and Border  Protection does not conduct COVID-19 testing for migrants who enter CBP  custody and is not required to do so.   Further, the report notes that without stronger COVID-19 prevention  measures in place, DHS is putting its workforce, support staff, border  communities, and all communities and migrants at greater risk of  contracting the virus.   It is our responsibility in Congress to ensure that our frontline  workforce, including the brave men and women of CBP, who put their  lives on the line daily, are adequately protected.   More than 6 months ago, I introduced my first piece of legislation,  the REACT Act, which would require the Department of Homeland Security  to test all migrants illegally crossing our border who they plan to  release into our communities. In March, I offered to bring the REACT  Act to the floor for a vote, but it was rejected by the majority.   Simultaneously, we are seeing the majority prepare to spend $3.5  trillion, mortgaging our children's and grandchildren's futures.   Let's be clear that none of the money in this tax-and-spend package  would go to CBP. This is while the DHS OIG heard from CBP officials  that they do not have the necessary resources to conduct COVID-19  testing. Yet, many on the other side remain unconcerned about the lack  of testing along our southern border.   In August, more than 208,000 migrants were encountered along the  southwest border. This means each day  [[Page H4871]]  approximately 6,700 individuals were encountered.   To put this in perspective, President Obama's Secretary of Homeland  Security, Jeh Johnson, stated in his tenure that 1,000 apprehensions a  day was considered a bad day. We are more than six times that now, and  on top of it, we face a global pandemic.   We are currently watching a debacle unfold in Del Rio, Texas, where  this weekend alone there were estimated to be approximately 15,000  migrants crossing the Rio Grande. This surge is overwhelming an already  overburdened system, and the agents and officers of CBP need Congress  to focus on this crisis.   While it is promising that CBP will be surging resources to the area,  it remains extremely worrisome to me that, as the OIG found, CBP is not  required to test these migrants. And I understand there is also a  measles outbreak at Fort Bliss.   Moreover, we will continue to see the border crisis of varying scales  until we institute policies that will deter illegal immigration.   Programs such as the Migrant Protection Protocols and Title 42 health  restrictions should be utilized to stem the flow of illegal migration  and help keep our communities safe during the pandemic.   Notably, the DHS OIG report also states that the ``erosion of Title  42 authority has had a significant negative impact on CBP's COVID-19  mitigation measures and creates increased risk.''   I encourage this administration to continue to implement these health  restrictions for migrants crossing illegally, especially while we see  new variants emerging.   As the former director of the Iowa Department of Public Health, I  know we must ensure that any individuals the Biden administration  insists on releasing into our communities do not have COVID-19 or other  infectious diseases. In fact, the Biden administration is recognizing  the need for COVID-19 testing and vaccinations for another group of  individuals, those who are being paroled in from Afghanistan.   I cannot comprehend how we can vaccinate those individuals for not  only COVID-19 but also measles, mumps, rubella, polio, and any other  age-appropriate vaccinations that are required by the CDC but not those  coming across our border illegally.   It is clear that this administration is creating a double standard  not only for U.S. citizens and migrants but also for individuals they  are bringing into this country.   If I may, I will also add a boisterous happy birthday to my husband,  Curt.                            ____________________
