 Mr. President, today I would like to honor a constituent  of mine who was recently awarded one of the highest honors in his  industry.   Jack Salzman, owner of Lake Norman Chrysler-Dodge-Jeep-RAM in  Cornelius, NC, was named 2018 TIME Magazine Dealer of the Year, a  national award that recognizes new-car dealers who exhibit exceptional  performance in their dealerships and perform distinguished community  service.   The TIME Magazine Dealer of the Year award is held in partnership  with Ally Financial and the National Automobile Dealers Association,  NADA. Representatives from TIME and Ally Financial presented the award  at the 2018 NADA Show in Las Vegas, NV. He dedicated his award to his  wife, Robin Smith-Salzman.   Mr. Salzman was recognized for his exceptional commitment to giving  back to his community focusing his philanthropic time and attention in  three areas: animals in need, children in need, and women in need.   To this end, he is a contributor to the Humane Society of Charlotte,  NC, as well as a founding board member of Lake Norman Humane Society.  He also supports Lake Norman Lucky Cats, which provides trap-neuter- return services, as well as Holly'z Hope, an organization that helps  unchain dogs by building fences for homeowners in need.   To assist women and children in need, Mr. Salzman is a longtime  supporter of the Dove House Children's Advocacy Center in Statesville,  NC, Pat's Place Child Advocacy Center in Charlotte, NC, Amy's House in  Lincolnton, NC, and the Shelter of Gaston County in Gastonia, NC. Mr.  Salzman has stated, ``We believe these organizations serve a critical  need in our community.''   Other national groups Mr. Salzman contributes to include Make-A-Wish,  Big Brothers Big Sisters, Habitat for Humanity, Susan G. Komen, and the  American Cancer Society.   Mr. Salzman is also an accomplished swimmer in the 200-meter  backstroke and competed in the U.S. Olympic trials for the summer games  in Moscow.   He was nominated for the TIME Magazine Dealer of the Year award by  Robert Glaser, president of the North Carolina Automobile Dealers  Association.   On behalf of all the constituents of North Carolina, please join me  in congratulating Mr. Salzman on being named the 2018 TIME Magazine  Dealer of the Year. I wish him and his family continued success and a  prosperous future.                            ____________________
