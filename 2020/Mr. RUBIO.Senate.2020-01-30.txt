 Mr. Chief Justice, I send a question to the desk on behalf  of myself and Senators Capito and Scott of South Carolina--with all due  respect.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The question from Senators Rubio, Capito, and  Scott of South Carolina is directed to both parties, and we will begin  with counsel for the House managers.   The question reads:         If I understand the Managers' Case: The President abused       his power because he acted contrary to the advice of his       advisors, but he is guilty of obstruction of Congress because       he acted in accordance to the advice of his advisors.    Mr. Manager SCHIFF. That is not our argument at all. The President is  impeached on article I not because he acted contrary to the advice of  his advisers. That is a red herring offered by the President's legal  team. We are not saying that the President is not free to disregard the  advice of his counsel. He is. He is entitled to disregard even really  good advice. What he is not free to do is to engage in corruption. What  he is not free to do is to withhold military aid--not for a valid  policy disagreement. They have conceded Rudy Giuliani was not doing  policy. What is not permitted is for a President to withhold  congressionally appropriated money for a corrupt purpose--to secure  help, to illicit foreign help, and cheat in an election. That is no  policy disagreement.   Now, are we arguing in article II that he should be impeached for  following his lawyers' advice? No. They were following his advice. His  advice was to fight all subpoenas. They were giving  [[Page S729]]  the legal window dressing to that. They were going to court and arguing  one thing and coming before you and arguing another. He was not  following their advice; they were following his. You can say a lot  about Donald Trump, but he is not led around by the nose by his legal  counsel. Ask Don McGahn about that. Don McGahn stood up to the  President.   Bob Mueller--if we are going to talk about the Mueller report--found  several instances--and this goes to the pattern of the President's  misconduct--in which he sought to obstruct that investigation,  including telling the President's lawyer that he should fire the  special counsel and then that he should lie about that instruction.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, Mr. Manager.   Mr. Counsel CIPOLLONE. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the  Senate.   You are right. That is yet another way in which the House managers'  theories of impeachment are incoherent and dangerous.   With respect to article II--and again, I won't respond to the ad  hominem attacks that keep coming. I will say, just for the record, you  are right--I haven't been elected to anything, but when I say ``with  the greatest respect,'' I mean it.   Article II: The President has been impeached for exercising  longstanding constitutional rights. He is looking out for  constitutional rights in the face of a House process that violated all  of them against all precedent, and he is looking out for future  Presidents and for the executive branch. How? If he had said, ``OK.  Fine. No rights. No counsel. No witnesses. No right to cross-examine.  Here is everything you asked for,'' what sort of precedent would that  set? That would irreparably damage the separation of powers.   Again, all you need to look at are the Articles of Impeachment. The  Articles of Impeachment do not allege a crime. They do not even allege  a violation of law. They are purely partisan. They were opposed by  Democrats in the House.   It is an election year, and they are here, saying: Instead of an  election, let's confront very consequential, constitutional issues that  have never really been confronted, and let's do it in a week. Let's  destroy executive privilege. Maybe let's destroy speech and debate  privilege.   Let me point out one other thing. It is not right to accuse somebody  falsely of something and then say: Unless you waive your constitutional  rights, you are guilty. That is not right. We shouldn't accept that in  this country. These are the longstanding privileges. They have been  respected for hundreds of years, and we should continue to respect  them.   Thank you.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, counsel.   The Senator from West Virginia.
