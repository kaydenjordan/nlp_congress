 Madam Speaker, I have the honor today to recognize a living  hero, a person who served our Nation at the shores of Normandy on D- Day, June 6, 1944.   Mr. Tam Cato is 104 years old and hails from Alachua, Florida. Mr.  Cato was born on March 14, 1915, and raised in the town of Alachua on a  653-acre farm, which he still calls his ``Daddy's farm.''   Mr. Cato was drafted into the U.S. Army in February 1941 and trained  at Camp Blanding in Starke, Florida. He was in Normandy during the  invasion, where he served and aided in the liberation of France and  Great Britain from Nazi Germany.   Recently, I had the extreme privilege of sharing in an event for Mr.  Cato in his hometown, where the French Government, through their  council general and French generals, presented Mr. Cato the highest  military and civilian honor France can offer: France's Legion of  Honour.   This award recognizes the American veterans who fought on French soil  during World War II, risking their lives in the name of freedom. This  medal is in honor of that courage and bravery.   Madam Speaker, I thank Tam Cato, and my family and country thank him,  as do the people of France. The world was made safer by him and others  like him who served.                            ____________________
