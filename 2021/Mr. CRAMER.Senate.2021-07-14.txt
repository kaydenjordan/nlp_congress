 Mr. President, I want to congratulate the newest  recipients of the North Dakota Theodore Roosevelt Rough Rider Award,  who are being honored in their hometown of Grand Forks today. They are  Monique Lamoureux-Morando and Jocelyne Lamoureux-Davidson, better known  as the Lamoureux Twins.   Before the rest of the world knew them, these identical twins made a  name for themselves in North Dakota. Those of us with children their  same age who competed with them on soccer and hockey teams were well  aware of their talents.   Monique and Jocelyne grew up in a hockey family. Their father was a  goaltender for the University of North Dakota team, and they joined  their four older brothers in learning the sport at an early age. Girls'  hockey was not well developed in the 1990s, so they played on boys'  teams, leading one of those teams to a State championship when they  were 12 years old.   While playing hockey at Shattuck-St. Mary's Prep School in Minnesota,  they were named to the U.S. Four Nations team as high school juniors in  2006. Three years later in 2009, the hockey world became more aware of  these twin powerhouses from North Dakota. While playing collegiate  hockey for the University of Minnesota, they made the World  Championship team that won the Gold Medal in Finland. They then  transferred to the University of North Dakota to finish their college  hockey careers and that December were named to the 2010 Olympic team.   They have played on three Winter Olympics women's hockey teams, the  first two in Vancouver, Canada, in 2010 and Sochi, Russia, in 2014,  where the U.S. team won Silver Medals against Canada. It was on  February 18, 2018, in PyeongChang, South Korea, when the sisters were  at the center of what is considered one of the greatest moments in U.S.  Olympic history.   With 21 seconds remaining in regulation play, Monique scored the  tying goal--again against the Canadian women. Jocelyn then sealed the  win in the sixth round of the tie-breaking shootout. Her now famous  ``Oops, I did it again'' shot scored the goal and brought the women's  Olympic Gold Medal home to the United States for the first time in 20  years.   After 14 years as members of Team USA hockey, in February they  retired from their golden careers. While on Team USA, Monique skated in  135 games and scored 143 points, and Jocelyne skated in 137 games and  scored 138 points. From 2009 to 2018, they played in every major  International Ice Hockey Federation event. They have brought home an  impressive number of medals, including one Olympic Gold, two Olympic  Silver, six World Championship Gold and one World Championship Silver.  They made history in North Dakota in 2014 for being the first State  athletes to win multiple Olympic medals.   The Lamoureux Twins have been widely praised by teammates and coaches  for their perseverance and adaptability. Often noted when describing  them are their work ethic, focus, grit, determination, attention to  detail, class, respect, and integrity. They have been called humble,  tough, and generous. They have a clear sense of right and wrong and are  always challenging each other to be better. One sportswriter described  the Lamoureux Twins as ``having work ethics that would put a combustion  engine to shame.''   These young women have been witness to and instrumental in the growth  of women's hockey on and off the ice. Today, with women's hockey much  more prominent than it was 20 years ago, they sponsor and conduct  hockey camps to better train girls and women players. In 2017, they  were among those on the U.S. national team who threatened a boycott  before the Women's World Championship to highlight the need for better  financial support and benefits for women team players.   Today, Monique and Jocelyne live in Grand Forks with their husbands  and young families. They published a book, ``Dare to Make History,''  earlier this year, and they have established a charitable foundation to  support underprivileged children through education and by promoting  gender equality and internet access for low income families.   The North Dakota Theodore Roosevelt Rough Rider Award was established  in 1961. It recognizes North Dakotans who have been influenced by the  State in achieving national recognition in their fields of endeavor,  thereby reflecting credit and honor upon North Dakota and its citizens.  It was named after President Theodore Roosevelt, who credited his time  living in North Dakota for influencing his success later in life. We  can only imagine what his reaction would be to the accomplishments of  Monique and Jocelyne. As only the 45th and 46th recipients, at age 32,  they are the youngest to be honored with this highest award given by  the State, and they have a lifetime ahead of themselves for even more  impressive achievements.   Mr. President, on behalf of the citizens of North Dakota, I  congratulate Monique Lamoureux-Morando and Jocelyne Lamoureux-Davidson  on receiving the North Dakota Theodore Roosevelt Rough Rider Award  today. You are true champions.                            ____________________
