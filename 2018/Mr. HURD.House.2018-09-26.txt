 Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman from Oklahoma  yielding.   Since the birth of our Nation, brave, selfless, and patriotic  individuals have committed to putting their lives on the line to keep  America safe, including along the border. No matter which side of the  aisle you are on, there is no debating the fact that our selfless  Border Patrol agents play a vital role in our national security. We, as  lawmakers, owe a debt of gratitude to ensure our Border Patrol agents  are treated fairly.   As a Member of Congress who represents a district with over 800 miles  of the southern border, I am all too aware of the day-to-day dangers  and obstacles our Border Patrol agents face. As a result of  bureaucratic inefficiencies, many Border Patrol agents are not  receiving the pay they have rightfully earned and, in some cases, are  being forced to work dangerously long shifts to make up for the onerous  and arcane regulations handed down to them from OPM. The purpose of the  Border Patrol Agent Pay Reform Amendments Act of 2018 is to fix this  broken system and allow our agents to receive the pay they have earned.   I want to thank my colleagues on the House Oversight and Government  Reform Committee for recognizing the urgency of these problems and  passing this bill with a voice vote in May.   Additionally, I appreciate the willingness of Customs and Border  Protection, the Office of Personnel Management, and the Border Patrol  Council to sit down and work out an agreement on these pressing issues.   I have to thank my colleagues Martha McSally and Filemon Vela for  their support and work on this piece of legislation.   I strongly urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan bill.
