 Mr. Speaker, this week Speaker Pelosi and House Democrats  are continuing their 3-year-old quest to overturn the 2016 election and  tear down President Donald Trump.   Recently, Speaker Pelosi said the current impeachment farce is not  rushed because it has been going on for 2\1/2\ years. That seems to me  to be admission of what we have known for a long time: that the  Democrats do not care how or why they impeach the President, so long as  they do so.   This impeachment sham is a result of a quest that began the moment  President Trump descended the escalator at Trump Tower in 2015 to  announce that he was running for President.   It is also the result of career bureaucrats, some in the intelligence  community, and House Democrats trying to prevent or stop President  Trump from taking power out of their hands and returning it to the  people.   Just this week we have seen evidence that the FBI has been weaponized  against the Presidential candidate; Chairman Schiff abusing his power  by releasing phone records of Members of Congress and reporters, and  his refusal to defend a one-sided report crafted by him and his staff.   Again, enough is enough. Let's stop this sham and get back to the  work of the American people.                            ____________________
