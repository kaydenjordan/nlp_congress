 Thank you, Mr. President.   President Ronald Reagan used to say that people are policy. Attacking  a new President's policies, therefore, often includes undermining his  or her ability to appoint men and women to lead his or her  administration.   The Constitution gives to the President the power to appoint  executive branch officials. The Senate has the power of advice and  consent as a check on that appointment power.   In the early months of the Obama administration, Senate Democrats  were clear about how we should carry out our role in the appointment  process. Less than 2 weeks after President Obama took office, the  Judiciary Committee chairman said he wished that the Senate could have  put the new Justice Department leadership in place even more quickly.  Just 3 months into President Obama's first term, the chairman argued  that, ``at the beginning of a presidential term, it makes sense to have  the President's nominees in place earlier, rather than engage in  needless delay.''   Well, actions speak much louder than words. With a Republican in the  White House, Senate Democrats have turned our role of advice and  consent into the most aggressive obstruction campaign in history.   This chart is an illustration.   Democrats complained about obstruction when, during the first 6  months of the Obama administration, the Senate confirmed 69 percent of  his nominations. Today marks 6 months since President Trump took the  oath of office, and the Senate has been able to confirm only 23 percent  of his nominations.   I ask my Democratic colleagues: If 69 percent is too low, what do you  call a confirmation pace that is two-thirds lower?   Democrats do not have the votes to defeat nominees outright. That is  why the centerpiece of their obstruction campaign is a strategy to make  confirming President Trump's nominees as difficult and time-consuming  as possible.   Here is how they do it. The Senate is designed for deliberation as  well as for action. As a result, the Senate must end debate on a  nomination before it can confirm that nomination. Doing so informally  is fast. Doing it formally is slow.   In the past, the majority and minority informally agreed on the  necessity or length of any debate on a nomination, as well as when a  confirmation vote would occur. The first step in the Democrats'  obstruction campaign, therefore, is to refuse any cooperation on  scheduling debates and votes on nominations. The only option is to use  the formal process of ending debate by invoking cloture under Senate  rule XXII. A motion to end debate is filed, but the vote on that motion  cannot occur for 2 calendar days. If cloture is invoked, there can then  be up to 30 hours of debate before a confirmation vote can occur.   The Democrats' obstruction playbook calls for stretching this process  out as long as possible. While informal cooperation can take a couple  of hours, the formal cloture process can take up to several days.   The late Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan once said that you are  entitled to your opinion, but not to your own set of facts. I would  state, then, to let the confirmation facts do the talking.   President Trump and his three predecessors were each elected with the  Senate controlled by his own political party. This is another  illustration right here. At this point in the Clinton and George W.  Bush administrations, the Senate had taken no cloture votes--nothing,  none whatsoever--as you can see, on nominations. We took just four  nomination cloture votes at this point during the Obama administration.  So far in the Trump administration, the Senate has taken 33 cloture  votes on nominations. Think about that. If that isn't obstruction, I  don't know what is. It is not even close.   There is one very important difference between cloture votes taken in  the beginning of the Clinton, Bush, or Obama administrations and those  taken this year. In November 2013, Democrats effectively abolished  nomination filibusters by lowering the vote  [[Page S4099]]  necessary to end debate from a supermajority of 60 to a simple  majority. It now takes no more votes to end debate than it does to  confirm a nomination. In other words, the Senate did not take cloture  votes during previous administrations, even though doing so could have  prevented confirmation.   Today, Democrats are forcing the Senate to take dozens of cloture  votes even though doing so cannot prevent confirmation. At least half  of these useless cloture votes taken so far would have passed even  under the higher 60-vote threshold.   Earlier this week, 88 Senators, including 41 Democrats, voted to end  debate on President Trump's nominee to be Deputy Secretary of Defense.  We have seen tallies of 67, 81, 89, and even 92 votes for ending  debate. Meanwhile, these needless delays are creating critical gaps in  the executive branch.   A clear example is the nomination of Makan Delrahim, a former Senate  staffer whom everybody on both sides knows, is a wonderful guy, and who  everybody knows is honest. But this clear example is the nomination of  Delrahim to head the Antitrust Division at the Department of Justice.  Antitrust enforcement is a critical element of national economic  policy. It protects consumers and businesses alike, and, without  filling these important posts, uncertainty in the market reigns. This  is a particular problem at a time of common and massive mergers and  acquisitions. Yet Mr. Delrahim, like dozens of others, has been caught  in the maelstrom of delays. Mr. Delrahim was appointed out of the  Judiciary Committee on a 19-to-1 vote. Everybody there knows how good  he is, how decent he is, how honorable he is, and how bipartisan he has  been. He is supremely qualified and enjoyed broad support throughout  the Senate as a whole. Yet his nomination, like so many others,  languishes on the floor because of Democratic obstruction. Indeed, it  has taken longer to get Mr. Delrahim confirmed than any Antitrust  Division leader since the Carter administration. Keep in mind that this  is a former staffer of ours who served both Democrats and Republicans.   Regarding the delay of Mr. Delrahim's confirmation, I ask unanimous  consent to have two news articles printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                     [From www.wsj.com, July 12, 2017]                Senate Fight Over Trump's Nominees Heats Up                   (By Brent Kendall and Natalie Andrews)         Washington--A congressional battle over President Donald       Trump's nominations for a range of influential positions is       escalating and becoming more acrimonious, creating additional       uncertainty over when some notable government vacancies might       be filled.        Mr. Trump has been slower than recent presidents to roll       out nominees. But for an array of people the president has       selected, Senate Democrats are using procedural tactics to       slow the confirmation process to a crawl--at least in part to       object to the lack of open hearings on health-care       legislation, Democratic leaders say.        More than 30 nominees are sitting on the sidelines while       they await a final Senate confirmation vote. Those include       several picks for the Justice and Treasury departments, as       well as new commissioners for a federal energy regulator that       has been unable to conduct official business because of its       vacancies.        If the currept pattern holds, many of these people may not       be confirmed for their jobs before the Senate takes a break       in mid-August. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D.,       N.Y.) in most circumstances has been invoking Senate       procedures to require up to 30 hours of debate per nominee,       an amount of Senate floor time that means lawmakers can't       confirm more than a handful of nominees each week.        The minority party often waives a requirement for lengthy       debate, but Democrats are generally declining to do so. In       response to GOP complaints, they cite what they call       Republican obstructionism under President Barack Obama,       including Republicans' refusal to hold a hearing or vote on       Mr. Obama's Supreme Court nominee, Merrick Garland.        In the current environment, even noncontroversial nominees       can take up several days of Senate time. For example, the       Senate spent much of the first part of the week considering       the nomination of David Nye to be a federal judge in Idaho.       Mr. Nye was originally nominated by Mr. Obama and Mr. Trump       renominated him after taking office.        Senators took a procedural vote Monday on Mr. Nye, but he       wasn't confirmed until Wednesday afternoon, on a 100-0 vote.        Raw feelings on both sides of the aisle erupted this week.       Republicans accused Democrats of unprecedented obstruction,       saying it would take the Senate more than 11 years at the       current pace before Mr. Trump could fully staff a government.        White House legislative affairs director Marc Short, in a       press briefing Monday, accused Mr. Schumer of being an       irresponsible champion of the ``resist'' movement. Senate       Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) cited the issue as       a top reason for his decision to push back the Senate's       planned August recess by two weeks.        On the Senate floor Wednesday, Mr. McConnell said Democrats       were ``bound and determined to impede the president from       making appointments, and they're willing to go to       increasingly absurd lengths to further that goal.''        Democrats dismiss such characterizations given what they       see as unprecedented Republican tactics toward Mr. Obama's       nominees, especially Judge Garland. In February 2016,       Republican Senate leaders said they wouldn't consider a       Supreme Court nominee until after the election.        Democrats also note that Mr. Trump has yet to name people       for hundreds of vacancies and say there have been paperwork       problems with a number of people he has chosen.        ``Our Republican friends, when they're worried about the       slow pace of nominations, ought to look in the mirror,'' Mr.       Schumer said on the Senate floor on Tuesday. The GOP       complaints about the pace of confirmations, he added, ``goes       to show how desperate our Republican leadership is to shift       the blame and attention away from their health-care bill.''        Mr. Schumer has said Democrats will generally insist on       lengthy Senate debate time for nominees until Republicans       start using traditional Senate procedures for advancing their       health legislation, including committee hearings and bill       markups.        Mr. McConnell has said Republicans have held numerous       hearings on ACA issues in the past and it isn't necessary to       do so for the current legislation.        Unlike the political fights earlier in the year over some       of Mr. Trump's cabinet picks and his Supreme Court nomination       of Neil Gorsuch, the current nominees at the head of the       queue aren't high-profile, and some have bipartisan support.        Those awaiting Senate floor action include Makan Delrahim,       in line to lead the Justice Department's antitrust division.       Mr. Delrahim, a deputy White House counsel who served as a       government antitrust lawyer in the George W. Bush       administration, was approved by the Senate Judiciary       Committee five weeks ago on a 19-1 vote.        Among its current pending matters, the antitrust division       is deep into its review of AT&T Inc.'s proposed $85 billion       deal to acquire Time Warner Inc., a transaction announced in       October.        Also pending are two picks for Republican seats on the       Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which usually has five       members but currently has just one. Since February, the       commission has lacked a quorum to conduct official business       such as approving energy infrastructure projects. The       nominees, Neil Chatterjee, a McConnell aide, and Robert       Powelson, each were approved on a 20-3 vote by the Senate       Energy and Natural Resources Committee last month.        Mr. Trump may have made a tactical misstep by not moving to       fill an open Democratic FERC seat at the same time he       announced the GOP nominees in May. For government commissions       made up of members from both parties, presidents usually look       to pair Democratic and Republican nominees, which gives both       sides an incentive to move forward with the nominations. Mr.       Trump in late June announced his intention to nominate       Richard Glick, a Democratic Senate staffer, for an open FERC       seat, but he hasn't done so yet.        Other pending nominees include Boeing executive Patrick       Shanahan to be deputy secretary of defense, the No. 2 slot at       the Pentagon, and Kevin Hassett to be the chairman of the       Council of Economic Advisers.        Dozens of other nominees have been working their way       through Senate committees and could be in line for full       Senate consideration in the coming weeks. Those include       Christopher Wray for FBI director as well as two nominees for       the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.                                   ____                    [From Law360, New York, July 14, 2017]        Wait To Confirm Trump's Antitrust Chief Longest In 40 Years                               (By Eric Kroh)         It has taken longer for the administration of President       Donald Trump to get its top antitrust lawyer in place at the       U.S. Department of Justice than any since President Jimmy       Carter, leaving the division running at a limited clip some       six months into Trump's tenure.        As of Friday, it has been 175 days since Trump's       inauguration, and his nominee for assistant attorney general       in charge of the DOJ's antitrust division, Makan Delrahim,       has yet to be approved by the full Senate despite pressing       matters such as the government's review of AT&T's proposed       $85 billion acquisition of Time Warner.        After taking office, Trump's five predecessors had their       nominees to head the antitrust division confirmed by June at       the latest. In the last 40 years, only Carter has taken       longer to get his pick permanently installed after a change       in administration. Carter nominated John H. Shenefield to be       assistant attorney general on July 7, 1977, and he was       confirmed on Sept. 15 of that year.  [[Page S4100]]         On the rung below, only two of five deputy assistant       attorney general positions are currently filled at the       antitrust division. Though the division is largely staffed by       career employees and has been humming along under acting       directors, the lack of a confirmed head and the vacancies at       the deputy level could be a sign that the administration       doesn't place a high priority on antitrust matters, according       to Christopher L Sagers of the Cleveland-Marshall College of       Law at Cleveland State University.        ``It doesn't seem like this particular White House has been       as interested in the day-to-day administration of government       as it has been in political issues,'' Sagers said. ``I don't       think that bodes particularly well for antitrust       enforcement.''        Trump did not take especially long to nominate Delrahim. It       had been 66 days since his inauguration when Trump announced       his choice on March 27. Former President Barack Obama was       relatively speedy with his pick, naming Christine A. Varney       to the position a mere two days after taking the oath of       office. On average, though, the six presidents before Trump       took about 72 days to announce their nominees.        However, it has taken an unusually long time for Delrahim       to make it through the logjam of nominations in the Senate.       As of Friday, it has been 109 days since Trump announced       Delrahim as his pick to lead the antitrust division. Of the       past six administrations, only President George W. Bush's       nominee took longer to confirm when the Senate approved       Charles A. James on June 15, 2001, 120 days after he was       nominated.        Popular wisdom holds that the antitrust division is       hesitant to launch any major merger challenges or cartel       investigations when it is operating under an acting assistant       attorney general, but that is largely a canard, Sagers said.        It's true that the division has been mainly focused on       addressing litigation and deal reviews that were already       ongoing when Trump took office and continuing probes begun       under Obama. However, past acting assistant attorneys general       have not been afraid to take aggressive enforcement actions,       such as the DOJ's challenge to AT&T's acquisition of T-Mobile       in 2011 under acting head Sharis A. Pozen, Sagers said.        Nevertheless, the lack of permanent leadership is likely       being felt at the division, Sagers said.        ``At a minimum, it's a burden on the agency's ability to       get all its work done,'' he said.        For example, the DOJ asked the Second Circuit on two       occasions for more time to file its opening brief in a case       involving the government's interpretation of a decades-old       antitrust consent decree that applies to music performing       rights organization Broadcast Music Inc. In its request, the       DOJ said it needed to push back the filing deadline because       of the turnover in leadership at the antitrust division.        ``Given the context of decrees that govern much of the       licensing for the public performance of musical works in the       United States, this is an important issue,'' the DOJ said in       an April court filing. ``In the meantime, there is still an       ongoing transition in the leadership in the Department of       Justice, and this is a matter on which the newly appointed       officials should have an opportunity to review any brief       before it is filed.''        The Second Circuit ultimately declined to grant the DOJ's       second request for an extension.        The setting of big-picture policies at the antitrust       division such as in the BMI case is exactly the kind of thing       that can fall by the wayside under temporary leadership,       Sagers said.        Depending on the industry, companies may also be waiting to       see the direction the DOJ takes on merger reviews under the       Trump administration before deciding to follow through with       or pursue large deals, according to Andrea Murino, a partner       with Goodwin Procter LLP.        ``I do think it is something you have to factor in,''       Murino said.        Dealmakers may be watching to see how the DOJ acts on       blockbuster transactions such as the AT&T-Time Warner merger.       The antitrust division also has to decide whether to       challenge German drug and chemicals maker Bayer AG's $66       billion acquisition of U.S.-based Monsanto Co.        The antitrust division's tenor will in large part be set by       who will serve under Delrahim in the deputy assistant       attorney general positions. Following Delrahim's       confirmation, current acting Assistant Attorney General       Andrew Finch will serve as his principal deputy. Last month,       the DOJ named Donald G. Kempf Jr. and Bryson Bachman to two       of the deputy assistant attorney general openings, leaving       three vacancies remaining.        While it's preferable to have a full slate of officials and       enforcers in place, the antitrust division will continue to       review deals, go to court and police cartels until those       seats are filled, Murino said.        ``They've gone through this before, maybe just not for this       length of time,'' she said. ``There is a slew of really       talented career people that do not change with the political       administration.        As long as those people are in place, they will keep the       trains running on time.''     Mr. President, Mr. Delrahim's appointment is just one  example among many. This particular example serves an important case in  point. Democrats are deliberately slow walking dozens of confirmations  in a cynical effort to stall the President's agenda and hurt the  President, but they are hurting the country, and they are hurting the  Senate. They are hurting both sides.   I don't want to see Republicans respond in kind when Democrats become  the majority and when they have a President.   It won't surprise anyone to hear that they are not limiting their  obstruction campaign to executive branch nominees. In fact, looking at  the judicial branch shows that this is part of a long-term obstruction  strategy. In February 2001, just days after the previous Republican  President took office, the Senate Democratic leader said they would use  ``any means necessary'' to obstruct the President's nominees. A few  months later Democrats huddled in Florida to plot how, as the New York  Times described it, to ``change the ground rules'' of the confirmation  process. And change the ground rules is exactly what they did.   For two centuries, the confirmation ground rules called for reserving  time-consuming rollcall votes for controversial nominees so that  Senators could record their opposition. Nominations with little or no  opposition were confirmed more efficiently by voice vote or unanimous  consent.   Democrats have literally turned the confirmation process inside out.  Before 2001, the Senate used a rollcall vote to confirm just 4  percent--4 percent--of judicial nominees and only 20 percent of those  rollcall votes were unopposed nominees.   During the Bush Administration, after Democrats changed the ground  rules, the Senate confirmed more than 60 percent of judicial nominees  by rollcall vote, and more than 85 percent of those rollcall votes were  on unopposed nominees.   Today, with a Republican President again in office, Democrats are  still trying to change the confirmation ground rules. The confirmation  last week of David Nye to be a U.S. district judge was a prime example.  The vote to end debate on the Nye nomination was 97 to 0. In other  words, every Senator, including every Democrat, voted to end the  debate. Most people with common sense would be asking why the cloture  vote was held at all and why the delay.   But Democrats did not stop there. Even after a unanimous cloture  vote, they insisted on the full 30 hours of postcloture debate time  provided for under Senate rules. To top it off, the vote to confirm the  nomination was 100 to 0.   I don't want anyone to miss this. Democrats demanded a vote on ending  a debate none of them wanted, and then they refused to end the debate  they had just voted to terminate--all of this on a nomination that  every Democrat supported. That is changing the confirmation ground  rules.   Only four of the previous 275 cloture votes on nominations had been  unanimous. In every previous case, whatever the reason was for the  cloture vote in the first place, the Senate proceeded promptly to a  confirmation vote.   In 2010, for example, the Senate confirmed President Obama's  nomination of Barbara Keenan to the Fourth Circuit 2 hours after  unanimously voting to end debate.   In 2006 the Senate confirmed the nomination of Kent Jordan to the  Third Circuit less than 3 hours after unanimously ending debate.   In 2002 the Senate confirmed by voice vote the nomination of Richard  Carmona to be Surgeon General less than 1 hour after unanimously ending  debate.   The Nye nomination was the first time the Senate unanimously invoked  cloture on a U.S. district court nominee. This was the first time there  was a unanimous vote to end debate on any nomination on which the  minority refused to allow a prompt confirmation vote.   Here is another chart that shows the percent confirmed by rollcall  vote during the Clinton administration, the George W. Bush  administration, and the Obama administration. Here we have the Trump  administration, and, as you can see, they are not confirming his  nominees even if they are qualified and the Democrats admit it. No  matter how my friends across the aisle try to change the subject, these  facts are facts.   While the Senate used time-consuming rollcall votes to confirm less  [[Page S4101]]  than 10 percent of the previous three Presidents' executive branch  nominees, under President Trump, it is nearly 90 percent.   I admit the Democrats are bitter about the Trump win. I understand  that. Everybody on their side expected Hillary Clinton to win. Many on  our side expected her to win as well. But she didn't. President Trump  is now President, and he did win, and he is doing a good job of  delivering people up here to the Senate for confirmation.   This is not how the confirmation process is supposed to work.   The Constitution makes Senate confirmation a condition for  Presidential appointments. This campaign of obstruction is exactly what  the Senate Democrats once condemned. Further poisoning and politicizing  the confirmation process only damages the Senate, distorts the  separation of powers, and undermines the ability of the President to do  what he was elected to do.   I hope our colleagues on the other side will wise up and realize that  what they are doing is destructive to the Senate, harmful to the  Senate, and it is a prelude to what can happen when they get the  Presidency. I don't want to see that happen on the Republican side.
