 Madam Speaker, in 1886, a product was brought online, Coca- Cola, and it remained one of the most popular products of all time  until 1985, 99 years later, when they came out with a great idea, New  Coke.   The problem is, New Coke was a terrible idea, and 3 months later,  they brought back what they call Classic Coke because of this terrible,  terrible idea that had to be fixed.   Making our military be vaccinated against their will is a terrible,  terrible idea that needs to be fixed.   Let me be clear. I have been vaccinated, and I have encouraged  everyone to talk to their doctors and see if the vaccine is right for  them. But ultimately, vaccination is a choice that shouldn't be  mandated on our fighting men and women.   As of yesterday, 30 percent of our total force remains completely  unvaccinated. Are we prepared to lose 30 percent of the total force?  How do we think that is going to impact military readiness? The  Pentagon, when they came out with this program, said it was for  military readiness. Come on.   Some branches of the military offer waivers for religious reasons,  but what if a breastfeeding mother isn't comfortable getting the  vaccine? I have heard from several breastfeeding mothers.   This needs to be fixed. I ask all my colleagues to join me in this  effort. New Coke is not working.                            ____________________
