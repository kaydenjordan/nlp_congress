 Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member for yielding me  the time and for all those wonderful compliments. I don't know that I  have ever had that said about a bill that I have submitted, so I am  very happy to be here today and to be able to support the Veterans Fair  Debt Notice Act.   Mr. Speaker, as you heard, this bill offers a commonsense fix to  frustrations that veterans in my district and across the country have  experienced with VA's debt management system.   Veterans in Maine have called my office shocked to find out that they  owe VA money. Some are confused by the letters they receive. Others are  told by VA that they have missed important deadlines to dispute, to  seek forgiveness, or to create a payment plan for the alleged debt.   Regardless of whether the debt is real or a mistake by VA, we  shouldn't make it so hard for veterans to know their rights and  obligations.   We have seen single mom veterans who can't get a home loan and newly  transitioned servicemembers who struggle to reintegrate with garnished  pay, recouped tax returns, and reduced disability payments, all because  of assigned debts they knew nothing about after notifications got sent  to the wrong place or ``lost in the mail.''   In response, H.R. 3705 directs VA to work with veterans service  organizations to develop standard notification letters that are written  in plain language. It also directs VA to explore how to inform veterans  of debts more quickly by sending notifications electronically, like an  email, in addition to standard mail.   It requires VA to study why so many veterans have not received  notifications in the mail, as well as steps VA can take to improve its  address database and the costs using certified mail.   I thank Chairmen Roe and Bost and Ranking Members Walz and Esty for  bringing this legislation to the House floor, and I urge its passage.
