 MALONEY of New York asked and was given permission  to address the House for 1 minute.)    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, yesterday, a  terrorist tried to attack the lifeblood of New York City: our subway  system. It is another somber reminder that New York City, a beacon of  hope and freedom, remains a target for terrorists.   We had the first World Trade Center bombing in 1993, another one on  9/11 in 2001, the Chelsea bombing last year, the truck attack earlier  this year, and another bombing yesterday.   In addition, the New York Police Department openly talks about 27  other attempts to harm New Yorkers, which were thwarted. By now, it  should be clear that we cannot play politics with Federal funding for  local law enforcement and homeland security. The funding for States and  cities, especially high-threat areas, must not be delayed, diminished,  or cut off.   While we are still learning more about this latest attack, one thing  is clear: the terrorist wanted to strike fear into the hearts of every  New Yorker, but he failed. New Yorkers will always persevere in the  face of diversity. Our trains are running. Our people are back to work.   I wish the three people injured yesterday a swift and speedy  recovery. I want to express my gratitude to the law enforcement of New  York City and the heroic response of our first responders. We are all  very grateful to them for what they do for us every day.                            ____________________     MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend  and colleague for yielding and for his incredible leadership as the  ranking member on this important committee. I also thank Chairman Royce  for his work on this issue, bringing the bill to the floor, and truly  being a visionary legislator in shining a spotlight on the systematic  persecution of Christians around the world. It is frightening, it is  wrong, and we need to do everything we can to stop it.    Freedom of religion is a core American principle and a key component  for peace and stability around the world. There are too many examples  of Christian persecution. Congress must clearly condemn those  atrocities.   As cofounder and co-chair of the Hellenic Caucus, I have long  advocated for reforms in Turkey to respect the rights of the Ecumenical  Patriarchate and reopen the Halki seminary.    MALONEY of New York. Boko Haram has wreaked havoc in  Nigeria, killing innocent Christians and Muslims alike.   Coptic Christians in Egypt and elsewhere face the constant threat of  violence, and we have seen some tragedies for this community just in  the past year. The number of Coptic Christians that have been killed is  truly astounding. They have laws now that, if a wall falls or any  church needs repair, you cannot even repair the church.   These are just a few examples of spots around the world where  Christian persecution is rampant.   Persecution against Christians and other religious minorities around  the world is a security crisis, and the United States Government must  remain vigilant in monitoring and response. It should be a unanimous  vote in support of this important resolution.   I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for bringing this to  the attention of Congress and, hopefully, the world.
