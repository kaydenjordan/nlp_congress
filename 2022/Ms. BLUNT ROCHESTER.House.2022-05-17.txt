 Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman Scott for his  leadership.   I am proud to have my amendments to H.R. 7309 before the House today.  In particular, I am proud of amendment No. 3, which gained the support  of 42 of my colleagues. This amendment would establish grants to help  break the cycle of violence in communities by providing job and  workforce development opportunities to youth in communities  disproportionately affected by gun violence.   With this broad support, I call on my colleagues to support this  amendment, which helps reduce community violence the best way we know  how--by building pipelines to good-paying, high-quality jobs for youth  that are disconnected from school and the workforce--to create  opportunity, to improve lives, and to provide for the future.   Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman, again, for his leadership.
