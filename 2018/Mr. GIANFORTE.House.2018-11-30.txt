 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge farm bill  negotiators to include critical forest management reforms in the new  farm bill.   I am encouraged that the new farm bill is forthcoming, but it should  include reforms on how we manage our forests.   Mr. Speaker, the Camp fire in California has tragically claimed the  lives of 88 people and hundreds remain missing. It has left more than  13,000 families without homes.   Last year in Montana, more than 1.2 million acres burned, creating  dangerous air quality. Congress must act now. Our communities can't  afford to wait any longer.   Senate Democrats should put the health and safety of our communities  first and include commonsense forest management reforms in the farm  bill. Meaningful forest management reforms will reduce the severity of  fires, improve air quality, boost the health of our forests and  wildlife habitats, as well as create good-paying jobs.   Mr. Speaker, with devastating wildfire seasons over the last couple  of years, it is urgent that Congress act now.                            ____________________
