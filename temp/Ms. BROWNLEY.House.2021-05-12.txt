 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 958, the  Protecting Moms Who Served Act, which I was proud to co-lead with  Congresswoman Underwood, Congressman Bilirakis, and Congressman  Fitzpatrick.   Madam Speaker, this bill will ensure that veterans get the high- quality maternal care they have earned by codifying the Maternity Care  Coordination Program. Additionally, this bill will require the GAO to  report on maternal mortality and morbidity among veterans.   I thank the chairman for his support on this issue, and I am proud  that this bill passed the committee with broad bipartisan support.   Madam Speaker, as you may know, among developed countries, the United  States has one of the highest maternal mortality rates in the world,  with an average rate of 17.2 deaths per 100,000 live births.   For women of color, the rates are even higher. For Black women, the  maternal mortality rate is 41.7 deaths per 100,000. And for American  Indian and Alaska Native women, it is 28.3 deaths per 100,000 live  births. More than 50 percent of pregnancy-related deaths happen after  delivery.   Today, there are 2 million women veterans living in the United  States, and women comprise the fastest growing subpopulation of both  the military and veteran populations, yet many of their health needs go  unaddressed in a VA system that has not evolved to equitably serve a  rapidly changing population.   As the chairwoman of the Women Veterans Task Force and chair of House  Veterans' Affairs Subcommittee on Health, I am proud to join  Congresswoman Underwood, who has truly,  [[Page H2217]]  truly been a champion--she is the founder and co-chair of the Black  Maternal Health Caucus--in fighting to end disparities in maternal care  for women veterans. Our veterans have sacrificed so much for our  country. It is past time that we address this inequity.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support our women veterans and  vote ``yes'' on H.R. 958.
