 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Franklin High  School student and Burien resident, Abigail Batinga, as the winner of  the Washington's Seventh District Congressional App Challenge.   My office this year received a record number of submissions,  highlighting the incredible work of teachers across my district in  advancing STEM education for all students.   Abigail's app, which is called Climate Now, is a collaborative  platform that helps users create, facilitate, and participate in  environmental projects in their communities.  [[Page H646]]    Abigail recognized the need for a tool to increase the efficacy,  organization, and participation in efforts to solve our climate crisis  locally, due to her involvement in sustainability and environmental  justice issues in Burien and South Seattle.   Abigail's focus on addressing a public goal serves as a model for all  of us to use our creativity, skills, and knowledge to benefit the  greater good.   I am so proud of Abigail, and I congratulate her.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for her  incredible leadership. It has been wonderful working with her not just  here in this body and in the Congressional Progressive Caucus, which I  am proud to co-chair, but for years we have known each other and worked  together. It is wonderful to have her here to talk about this issue and  her leadership on this issue, really the kind of leadership that  America needs to show by passing the NO BAN Act.   Three years ago, I had just been elected to Congress, and it was  within my first weeks here that Donald Trump issued his first Muslim  ban. When that happened, I thought back to after 9/11--that is actually  when I started becoming very involved in politics as an activist. We  faced some similar situations of Muslims, Arab Americans, and others  being targeted simply for their religion, their ethnicity, their place  of origin.   The good news is that I knew what to do, which is that I immediately  rushed to the airport. That Muslim ban created irreparable harm on  Muslim families, here at home, but also around the world.   We had generals in our military testify that we desperately need to  have our allies and that some of those allies are, in fact, Muslims who  help us in other countries.   When I heard the news and rushed to SeaTac Airport, I saw absolute  chaos, chaos that was caused by an administration that put forward a  Muslim ban with no preparation, no notification, no planning at all for  the kind of harm, irreparable harm, that would be caused for American  citizens, for lawful residents, and for international visitors.   Today, families remain separated from their loved ones, American  businesses, and research institutions. I have many of those research  institutions in my district and many American businesses in my district  that are not able to recruit the best minds from abroad.   Our Nation's doors are closed to people seeking safety from violence,  war, and persecution.   But it wasn't just then. The chaos has not stopped.   Earlier this month, up to 200 Iranian Americans--almost all the ones  that we know of are U.S. citizens, legal permanent residents, green- card holders--were unjustly detained at the U.S.-Canada border in my  own State of Washington.   In the days after the Muslim ban, I had introduced the Access to  Counsel Act, an act that once again was so important as we watched  these detentions of Iranian Americans, who, by the way, travel across  the border regularly. In fact, some of them travel across the border so  much that they have expedited processing.   What that means is that you go through additional security screening  so that you can get a card that you hold up at the northern border as  you cross the border. You don't need anything else other than that  expedited screening, that extra security screening in order to cross  the border.   But that day, we believe over 200 Iranian Americans were stopped at  the border, U.S. citizens, legal green-card holders, simply because  they were of Iranian descent.   The Access to Counsel Act, which we hope to mark up and bring to the  floor at the same time as the NO BAN Act, just says that if you were  here as a U.S. citizen, a legal permanent resident, or have any legal  status and you are put through this unjust secondary screening, that at  least you can have access to counsel, not counsel paid for by the  government, but just counsel provided either through your own pocket or  through nonprofits that provide that service, because people are being  deported in an expedited manner.   In fact, that is what happened in Seattle 3 years ago when I rushed  to the airport when the Muslim ban was first introduced. We actually  were able to, at the airport, get a temporary injunction from a judge  that allowed us to essentially go and stop a plane on the tarmac that  was ready to take off with some people who should not have been  deported.   We were able to stop that plane from taking off, thanks to the courts  and the incredible speed of attorneys and nonprofit organizations that  came together and filed for a temporary injunction. That allowed us to  stop the plane and to stop people from actually being deported.   It is not right that we are seeing U.S. citizens detained by CBP for  up to 9 hours without a chance to speak to a lawyer simply because they  weren't born here, even though they are United States citizens.    It is not right that students with visas have increasingly been  rejected at our airports and deported without a  [[Page H711]]  chance to speak to a lawyer, when people have legal status in the  United States.   It is not right that they are subjected to a second loyalty test  simply because of their religion or their place of birth or their  ethnicity.   Madam Speaker, I am one of only 14 immigrants in the United States  Congress, out of 535 naturalized citizens, who have the great honor and  privilege of being a United States citizen. I don't want us to think  that we have separate loyalty tests that we have to go through. We have  examples of that--the Japanese internment, 123,000 Americans of  Japanese ancestry who were put into internment camps simply for being  Japanese American.   The reality is we need the NO BAN Act to repeal President Trump's  Muslim ban and stop any future President from implementing future  discriminatory bans.   I am very grateful to my colleague, Congresswoman Judy Chu, chair of  the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, for introducing and  championing this critical bill to send an important message to our  Muslim brothers and sisters here and abroad that America believes in  religious liberty and that we remain committed to welcoming people  regardless of their faith, regardless of the country in which they were  born.   In recent weeks, we have heard that an expanded Muslim ban may be  coming from the Trump administration this week. Let me be very clear:  Each iteration of these bans sends a terrible message to Muslims, to  those who are targeted, that our foundational value of freedom of  religion does not apply to them.   An expanded Muslim ban will only worsen our relationships with  countries around the world, and it will not make our country safer. It  will harm refugees. It will isolate us from our allies. It will give  extremists propaganda for recruitment. It will be a different Muslim  ban pushed by the same xenophobic administration, and it will have the  same negative ramifications as past versions of the Muslim ban.   Madam Speaker, I just had the opportunity to come back from a codel  to Sudan with a number of our Members, Republican and Democrat. This is  a country that is transitioning from a 30-year dictatorship to a  democracy, a civilian-led government. That was powered by a people's  revolution in the streets that inspired us here in the United States  and around the world, people who sat and peacefully protested a brutal  dictatorship. Over 200 people were shot and killed in those peaceful  protests on June 3.   Madam Speaker, Sudan has been supposedly added to this next round of  countries that may be added to the Muslim ban. The people of Sudan said  to us, Republican and Democratic Representatives of the United States  Government: ``Doesn't America believe in democracy, in transition?''   Why would Sudan, with a people's revolution that led to a democratic  government through the overthrow of a dictator who has been in power  for the last 30 years, why would Sudan be on a list of countries that  have these restrictions and be part of this ban? That sends the totally  wrong message.   As the vice chair of the Committee on the Judiciary's Subcommittee on  Immigration and Citizenship, I will do everything in my power to resist  the Muslim ban and demand liberty and justice for all, without any  caveats.   We must pass the NO BAN Act to end not just the Muslim ban but other  anti-immigrant policies pushed by this administration. Most  importantly, we must pass the NO BAN Act to remind ourselves again of  who we are as a country, a country that has welcomed people from all  over the world, including myself.   I came here as a 16-year-old with nothing in my pockets, by myself,  and to now be standing here in the United States Congress, my  responsibility--our responsibility as a body is to preserve those  foundational values of freedom and justice and religious tolerance.   Madam Speaker, I look forward to passing the NO BAN Act. I thank  Representative Tlaib for her friendship, for her leadership, and for  all that she does to advance justice. On behalf of the Progressive  Caucus, 100-members strong, we are so glad to have her in it.
