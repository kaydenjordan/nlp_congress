 Madam President, today, I want to acknowledge and       honor the work of Maine's Taxpayer Advocate Service office in Augusta.       The Taxpayer Advocate Service is an independent office of the Internal       Revenue Service that is dedicated to ensuring that every taxpayer is       treated fairly. While the Taxpayer Advocate Service does focus in part       on making critically important observations and recommendations       regarding the taxpayer experience in their annual report to Congress, I       want to focus my remarks on the individual assistance they provide to       taxpayers--helping Maine people resolve problems that they have not       been able to resolve on their own with the IRS.        The Augusta staff is a tightly knit group of dedicated public       servants whose contributions to the lives of individuals across Maine       far outweigh their size. My staff works with them almost daily to help       constituents work through IRS issues that can often be very stressful       for individuals, couples, families, businesses, and organizations. This       kind of work makes a huge impact, and the professionals who work in our       Maine office are among the best at what they do. They continuously put       their expertise to work for us and do not rest on a case until every       ``i'' is dotted and every ``t'' is crossed.        TAS's Augusta office stands out to us as an example of excellence in       congressional casework. The challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic and the       unprecedented workload and unique problems associated with the pandemic       challenged the Federal workforce in a brand-new way. This group rose to       that challenge with attention to every case even when we knew they were       simply overwhelmed with the sheer volume of inquiries. Their dedication       to TAS's mission has shined more brightly than ever since the spring of       2020.        Constituent service work is noble and impactful. My office relies       heavily on dozens of Federal office staff to assist in bringing       meaningful results to the people of Maine. The Maine Taxpayer       Advocate's office has stood out by consistently rising to each       challenge with compassion and professionalism. The Maine office of the       Taxpayer Advocate Service and its staff exemplifies public service at       its best. Myself, my staff, and all those in Maine who work with the       office benefits greatly from the interaction. The work immeasurably       improves the lives of people facing IRS issues that are often dramatic       and daunting. Further, we consider them an integral part of our ability       to resolve problems, and I thank them for their hard work, their caring       nature, and their exceptional dedication to excellence.                                      ____________________
