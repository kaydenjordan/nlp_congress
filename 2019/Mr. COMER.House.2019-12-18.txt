 Madam Speaker, since the beginning of this impeachment  inquiry, it has been extremely troubling to see the partisan, divisive  way in which Democrats have carried out this entire process.   I guess we shouldn't be surprised, though. They promised they would  unseat this President since the day he took his oath of office. From  the start, this has been a baseless attempt to undo the will of 63  million Americans who voted for President Trump.   I can tell you the people I represent in Kentucky, the very people  who voted for this President to enact change and fight for this  country, are appalled at the charade they have seen in the House in  recent months. They are appalled at the actions from House Democrats  who have failed to even come close to proving their case.   I hope all of my congressional colleagues carefully consider the  precedent they are setting by voting in favor  [[Page H12151]]  of this sham process and these illegitimate Articles of Impeachment.  These articles were written and built on a report that was drafted with  biased presumptions, cherry-picked witnesses, and vastly disputed  facts.   The President did not commit any impeachable offense, and it is clear  for all of us to see through the now very well-known transcript. This  rigged process sets a concerning precedent for impeachable offenses  moving forward, and I wholeheartedly oppose these baseless Articles of  Impeachment.
