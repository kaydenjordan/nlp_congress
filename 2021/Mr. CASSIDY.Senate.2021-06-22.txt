 Madam President, Emmanuel Larryn Slack, age 17,  entered into eternal rest on Friday, June 4, 2021, at Oschner LSU  Hospital in Shreveport, LA. Emmanuel was born on January 18, 2004, to  Melvin G. Slack, Jr., and Bridgette L. Wililams in Shreveport, LA.  While attending Union Spring Baptist Church under the leadership of  Pastor Roosevelt Seaberry, he was an active member of the youth choir  and the drill team. Upon changing residences, he later accepted the  Lord Jesus Christ as his Savior under the leadership of Pastor Joey  Ketchum at the Western Hills Baptist Church. He was a faithful and  active member in the ministry. Gifted with reaching young people, he  became active with Bible studies, Vacation Bible School, and Youth  Group activities under both leaders. Emmanuel attended Huntington High  School, where he was a member of the Yearbook club and participated in  JROTC. When thinking of career choices, he was originally certain he  wanted to be a police officer or an FBI agent, but it was after he took  an interest in politics and the Republican Party that he began to  thrive. He became active with the Texas Young Republicans and  Republican Women of Bossier, where he expressed his beliefs in American  individualism, rule of law, the Constitution, and the Holy Bible, which  guided him to greatness and continual self-improvement. Emmanuel  expressed his views across Louisiana and Texas lines and considered  himself to be bipartisan, a conservative Republican, a proud soon-to-be  Texan, upholding traditional values like bravery, courage, leadership,  and principle, and above all, a follower of Christ. Emmanuel was  actively working on an internship with Rhonda Anderson of Longview, TX.  He was embraced by Governor Greg Abbott's office; Tarrant County Young  Republicans of Fort Worth, TX; attorney general of Louisiana Jeff  Landry's office; Caddo Parish Commissioner Jim Taliaferro; Commissioner  Mario Chavez of District 10; Congressman   Mike Johnson of the Fourth  District of Louisiana; Lieutenant Governor of Louisiana Billy  Nungesser; Republican Women of Bossier; and Ouachita Parish Republican  Women. His hope was to become a Governor, Senator, or President.   Preceding Emmanuel in death were his maternal grandmother Marel D.  Williams, grandfather Larry N. Williams, Sr., and paternal grandfather  Melvin Slack, Sr., a veteran of the U.S. Marine Corps. He leaves to  celebrate his life parents Bridgette L. Williams and Melvin G.
