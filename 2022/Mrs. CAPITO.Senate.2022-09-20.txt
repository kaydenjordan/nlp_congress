 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up  to 15 minutes prior to the scheduled rollcall vote.    Mr. President, since the Biden administration really  likes to celebrate things, I rise today on the 1-week anniversary of  their party last Tuesday for their so-called Inflation Reduction Act.   Last Tuesday, most Americans and, certainly, most West Virginians  weren't in a celebratory mood. West Virginians started their day with  news that inflation rose to 8.3 percent in August, while President  Biden and his party and climate activists began setting up for their  Inflation Reduction Act party at the White House.   Meanwhile, that same day, the U.S. stock market had its worst day  since June 2020, as the White House and its fellow Democrats celebrated  their green spending bill that would only extend inflationary pain, but  it does expand U.S. and IRS enforcement on Americans who are struggling  to afford basic necessities.   Days after the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office published an  analysis that the Inflation Reduction Act would actually not reduce  inflation, particularly in the short term, President Biden announces  that he will do student debt cancelation that would add another  trillion dollars to the deficit.   Today and tomorrow, the Federal Reserve, which is our U.S. monetary  watchdog, is meeting to set new interest rates in a bid to tame  inflation. The body has had to raise interest rates aggressively by  three-quarters of a point. In June, Chairman Powell, who is the  Chairman of the Fed, admitted that the rate increase is ``unusually  large'' and would not be ``common.'' The Fed will likely raise interest  rates again by the same amount tomorrow, for the third consecutive time  in a row. These are the most aggressive rate increases since the 1980s,  when my mortgage was way into the teens, that Chairman Powell has  plainly stated will bring ``pain to households and businesses.''   We can't forget that the Democrats alone passed a bill last year that  they called the American Rescue Plan, which rescued nothing and,  instead, endangered our fragile economy coming out of COVID by  hypercharging inflation. Democrats alone drafted and pushed forward  their most recent bill, bypassing the normal committee process, and  Democrats alone passed it, rejecting every Republican amendment along  the way.   In short, these policies continue to destabilize every single corner  of our economy. Well, how do we know this? We see some of the  statistics that I talk about. Well, I know it because West Virginians  have lived it, and I hear from them frequently about their legitimate  concerns. A retiree from Clarksburg, WV, wrote to me recently saying  that she and her husband are ``struggling every month'' despite having  done their due diligence to save well for their retirement. She says  they are trying not to dip into their 401(k)s or their TSP retirement  accounts but that it is getting ``harder and harder'' not to do that.    As inflation drags on, the lifespan of retirement savings will  continue shrinking for our seniors in West Virginia, and those seniors  account for 41 percent of our population.   Another West Virginian wrote to me about the tough choices her family  is making:         The economy has crumbled in the blink of an eye. My husband       and I have full-time jobs and two children. I'm tearful       because I sit here looking at upcoming bills and I'm having       to decide to pay a bill or buy groceries.    A resident from Weston, WV, told me that his insurance premiums  recently increased and, when he asked the company why that happened,  they told him pointblank it was due to inflation. In the same letter,  the constituent wrote:         This crazy spending has to stop.    But it is not just West Virginians who are experiencing this  inflationary problem. The National Defense Industrial Association,  authored in part by former Deputy Defense Secretary David Norquist,  released a white paper recently that indicated inflation has cost the  Department of Defense $50 billion and estimates that it will cost an  additional $110 billion to our Nation's defense from fiscal year 2021  through fiscal year 2023.   Think about this in the face of what we are talking about in terms of  trying to help Ukraine overcome this terrible invasion by the Russians.   Residential real estate has skyrocketed 43 percent in the past 2  years. In fact, this year, mortgage rates have risen from 3.2 percent  to 6.3 percent, which is the highest they have been since 2008--setting  all kinds of records here. So some are going so far as to predict an  additional 17.8 percent rise in home prices over the next year.   A recent paper released by Goldman Sachs, aptly titled ``The Housing  Downturn: Further to Fall,'' warns that higher mortgage rates and  reduced affordability will continue well into 2023. For first-time home  buyers, that spells a death knell for their dream of owning their own  home.   Again, what we are seeing in realtime are direct consequences of  inflation fueled by spending. The increase in the price of groceries is  unbelievable. It is unbelievable when you go to the grocery store. Over  the past year, the price of basic pantry staples has continued to  increase. The cost of eggs has gone up 40 percent; butter, 24.6  percent; luncheon meats, 18.2 percent. Fresh milk has increased 17.7  percent. Sugar, flour, bread, pasta, peanut butter, and cereals have  increased between 15 and 23 percent. These are the things that families  buy weekly to meet their grocery bill and to provide their children's  breakfast, lunch, or dinner.   Simply put, elected Democrats in the Biden administration celebrated  the so-called Inflation Reduction Act on a day when the Consumer Price  Index on inflation increased. For the many constituents whom I talk to  on a daily basis, inflation remains the No. 1 concern.   So this irony is not lost on me nor is it lost on the American  public. It is not lost on millions of Americans making tough choices  because of these policies, and it is painful; it is hard to watch; and  in many of my constituents' opinion, it is as if the President and his  party are not paying attention.   I yield the floor.
