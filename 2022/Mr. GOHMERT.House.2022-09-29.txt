 So, Mr. Speaker, we are hearing that we have got to give  DOJ and FTC all this authority to supervise and make sure that Big Tech  is properly investigated. But our committee has oversight over the  Department of Justice, and we have not done oversight as a committee to  stop what has been going on.   I understand Heritage Foundation and some of these others, they  haven't seen the whistleblower complaints that   Jim Jordan and I have  been seeing. I have gotten double-digits now myself that were not  counted in the 14 that the committee got.   It sounds like Sodom and Gomorrah up there. We have gotten complaints  this week about sexual harassment and about sexual improprieties on the  top floor, the seventh floor--where the headquarters of the FBI is--and  all the favors and all the intimidation that goes along with sexual  improprieties.   Then you want the DOJ--the people who told the Big Tech that story  about Hunter's laptop, that is Russian disinformation, which they are  good at saying because they passed that on about Russian collusion, and  any time that President Trump or people in his administration said  anything, here came the DOJ whispering in people's ears: That is  Russian disinformation.   These are the last people whom we need to trust with reining in the  Big Tech because we have seen the techniques. I have got to give them  credit. Although there is apparently a tremendous amount of corruption  at the FBI and the DOJ that has not been reined in, I have to give them  credit. When it comes to intimidation and manipulation, they are right  there--and I don't say this lightly--they are right there with the  gestapo.   I have had FBI agents talk to me about, remember when we used to call  the attorney of people whom we knew were not violent?   Even though they committed very serious felonies, we would tell them  when to report, and they reported.   We didn't use the gestapo tactics of going in in the dark, beating  down doors, and dragging them out in their underwear to parade in front  of cameras that they inappropriately leaked information.   Mr. Speaker, this is a different DOJ. They don't need more money.  They need less, until they are made to and until they are helped to  eliminate their corruption and they start cleaning up their own act  which Christopher Wray and, unfortunately, Merrick Garland have not  done.    Mr. Speaker, it is a bit of a segue here between things  you were talking about earlier in the last half hour and all three of  you have been mentioning, and that is when you talk about the $70  billion that has been provided to Ukraine for the war with Russia, if  you look at the amount of increase in fuel costs that this  administration caused, it drove up the price of oil, the price of  natural gas so much that Russia made, last I saw, over $60 billion more  than they had before.   This administration is really responsible for funding both sides of  the war between Russia and Ukraine: The $60-plus billion that Russia  got because Biden's actions increased the cost of fuel, and then the  $70 billion that we appropriated to Ukraine. You go, this is nuts that  they would be doing that.   Then you look at who is getting hurt, and you mention the Strategic  Petroleum Reserve. It is down to its lowest point in decades because  this President was trying to cover for his disastrous energy policy. So  the millions of barrels that the Trump administration put in there so  we would have it for an emergency, like a hurricane and other things,  that is all gone, trying to cover for Biden's own disastrous policies.   The American public, they see the price of gasoline coming down some,  but people need to understand what this is all about. It is what it has  always been about, power in the hands of a small group of elitists and  everybody else, like in the Middle Ages for many ages. The wealthy  ride, the poor walk. That is what this energy policy of theirs is  really all about.  [[Page H8311]]    I saw a picture just before I came over, John Kerry on his private  plane flying, using that energy, because he is important, because he is  the elite. But everybody else is going to need to give up their cars.   As our friend   Thomas Massie has pointed out, plugging in a car  overnight is like plugging in 17 refrigerators.                                time  2000    And everybody won't be able to do it, but if everybody would go to an  electric car, then people aren't going to have power. And then they  will have to rely on their buddy, their Big Brother Government to say,  Okay, some of you can plug in these times.   What about when we were independent, and we didn't need the  government to tell us when we could move about?   This is where it is headed. The green is really a brown policy, and  it is going to be really unpleasant.
