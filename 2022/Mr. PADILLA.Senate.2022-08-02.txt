 Madam President, I rise to celebrate the life and  mourn the passing of Rodrigo ``Rod'' Garcia, a man who dedicated his  life to empowering and advocating for the next generation of young  Latino STEM students and professionals.   Born in 1943 in Los Angeles, CA, Rod learned early on the importance  of higher education and public service. After graduating from the  California State University in Los Angeles with a bachelor's degree of  science in engineering, he worked for the city of Los Angeles as a  civil engineer.   As one of the few Hispanic engineers at the time, Rod saw the need to  diversify California's booming tech and STEM fields. Beginning in 1973,  he gathered fellow Hispanic engineers in his own garage to create  fellowship and determine how to expand opportunities  [[Page S3860]]  for their community. In 1974, the Society of Hispanic Professional  Engineers, also known as SHPE, was officially founded and incorporated.  As the founder, Rod had a vision to advance networking and education  opportunities for other young Latino students and professionals in the  engineering field. And almost 50 years later, the SHPE has grown to  include over 13,000 members and 286 chapters nationwide. Through Rod's  leadership and vision, SHPE has impacted the lives of thousands of  Latinos, including myself.   I first met Rod as a young mechanical engineering student at the  Massachusetts Institute of Technology. As a young Latino from Los  Angeles, joining SHPE gave me a sense of belonging. Rod always took the  time to engage with students, hear their unique stories, and encourage  them to complete a STEM degree. Rod dedicated his life to ensuring that  fellow Latinos had opportunities and understood the value of a STEM  degree in the real world.   Rod left behind an incredible legacy that will continue to live on.  He will be remembered for his devotion and advocacy and for his ability  to empower the Latino community. I am eternally grateful for Rod's  impact on my own life. The American dream endures because of leaders  like Rod Garcia, who don't shut the door to opportunity as they walk  through it, but who open it wider for those who come next.   My wife Angela and I send our deepest condolences and prayers to his  wife Cynthia Cathy Wong, his children Marlene Tomasina Zamora, Marianne  Pilar Garcia, and Rodrick Fitzgerald Garcia, and the rest of his family  and friends.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the Airport  Energy Resiliency and Renewable Energy Act, which I introduced today.   While some airports are already using renewable energy systems to  enhance the energy efficiency of their power sources, our Nation's  airports still have incredible opportunities to lower emissions and  improve energy resiliency by further investing in renewable energy  sources and energy storage solutions.   For example, commercial solar panels are bigger and more efficient  than residential ones and can generate substantially more power without  presenting a threat to aviation operations.   Furthermore, battery storage and microgrids would allow energy to be  stored and used later during peak demand, when it is most needed. In  the event of a power disruption or outage as a result of a natural  disaster or other emergency, deploying solar generation coupled with  battery storage would allow airports to power essential facilities  using renewable resources instead of generators, which often run on  fossil fuels.  [[Page S3864]]    In concert with the resources being delivered by the bipartisan  infrastructure law, providing new dedicated funding would help  kickstart existing interest in reducing carbon footprint and improving  the energy resiliency at airports.   That is why I am proud to introduce this bill to create a new FAA  grant program to help airports invest in renewable generation resources  such as solar panels, battery storage systems, and microgrids.   I hope my colleagues will join me in support of this bill to unlock  the opportunity to leverage our Nation's airports to modernize our  electric grid and implement clean energy technologies.                                  ______                                         By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mr. Booker, Mr. Wyden, Ms.          Duckworth, Mr. Markey, Mr. Padilla, and Ms. Warren):   S. 4740. A bill to amend the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 and  the Animal Welfare Act to prohibit the taking, importation,  exportation, and breeding of certain cetaceans for public display, and  for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and  Transportation.
