 I thank the gentlewoman for her  extraordinary leadership on the life issue.   Madam Speaker, subsidized by over $500 million taxpayer dollars each  year, Planned Parenthood dismembers or chemically poisons a baby to  death every 2 minutes, killing over 7 million innocent children since  1973.   Undercover videos in 2015 exposed, in numbing candor, several high- level Planned Parenthood leaders nonchalantly talking about procuring  children's organs for a price. They describe altering gruesome  dismemberment procedures to preserve intact livers, hearts, and lungs  from freshly killed babies.   All of this begs the question, Madam Speaker, why are U.S. taxpayers  giving half a billion dollars each year to Planned Parenthood?   H.J. Res. 43 simply allows States to redirect funds away from  abortion clinics and does not reduce funding for title X by so much as  a penny. Those funds are just redirected to other health clinics that  provide women's health care and don't engage in abortion.   In mid-December, on his way out the door, former President Obama  finalized a rule that coerces States to fund Planned Parenthood with  their title X money.   Prior to the Obama rule, States had chosen, five of them, to award  title X funds to non-Planned Parenthood entities. These five States,  Tennessee, Kansas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, and Ohio, account for nearly $16  million in annual title X funding and serve over 279,000 individuals a  year. These five States redirected those funds to other health clinics.   But under the Obama rule, these State recipients are threatened with  losing all--I say again--all of their title X support if they do not  comply. This is the definition of coercion.   The Obama administration essentially told States: You must use your  family planning dollars to support abortionists, or we will take away  your family planning dollars.   I thank the gentlewoman for her courage, for her insight, and for  offering this rule for our consideration today.
