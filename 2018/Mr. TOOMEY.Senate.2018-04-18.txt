 Mr. President, I want to briefly address an issue that  has been raised in the context of the vote we will have later today. As  you know, later today we will be using the Congressional Review Act to  repeal a very ill-conceived regulation imposed by the CFPB. Some of our  colleagues and some outside this Chamber have suggested that it is  somehow problematic to use the Congressional Review Act--to use this  device--for the repeal of a regulation that is promulgated by guidance  as opposed to those regulations promulgated in accordance with the  Administrative Procedure Act, which we usually refer to as a rule, or a  rulemaking.   The reality is that the applicability of the Congressional Review Act  to a guidance, in my view, is very obvious and very well-established  and should not be controversial. I understand that people might like  the CFPB's rule, which I don't, but to suggest that because they issued  it through a guidance rather than through the appropriate rulemaking  process, we shouldn't be using the Congressional Review Act, I think,  is completely mistaken.   First of all, there is the CRA's definition of a rule. It is very  broad and intentionally so. I will quote in part that definition. It  says: ``The whole or a part of an agency statement of general or  particular applicability.''   The text says nothing about limiting the Congressional Review Act  procedural device to formal rulemakings that follow from the  Administrative Procedure Act. It is much broader than that. Instead it  says: ``The whole or a part of an agency statement.''   You don't have to just take my word for this. You could go back to  the statements of the authors of the Congressional Review Act itself,  the legislation that makes this vote today possible. One of the authors  was none other than Harry Reid, the former Senate majority leader and  Senate minority leader. Senator Reid was very clear about the  intention. He and Senator Nickles, at the time, and Senator Stevens put  out a joint statement, which I will quote. It is brief, but it is  important. It says:         The authors are concerned that some agencies have attempted       to circumvent notice-and-comment requirements by trying to       give legal effect to general statements of policy,       ``guidelines,'' and agency policy and procedure manuals. The       authors admonish the agencies that the APA's broad definition       of ``rule'' was adopted by the authors of this legislation       [the CRA] to discourage circumvention of the requirements of       [the] chapter.    Here is the irony implied by the position of those who suggest we  can't use the Congressional Review Act to repeal a guidance. What they  really are suggesting is that the regulators and the agencies ought to  be able to circumvent the very public process that is established in  law--the Administrative Procedure Act--for rulemaking. They ought to be  able to avoid the need to collaborate with other regulators to  [[Page S2229]]  issue a proposed rule to the public for an extensive comment period and  to make it subject to scrutiny--all of the things we demand of a proper  rulemaking so that we end up with a better rule--right?--one that has  been vetted, one that has been fully considered.   What you are saying is that the CRA is not applicable. When this is  done by a guidance, you create an incentive for the agency to  circumvent this very public scrutiny so that they can impose their will  directly without it. That would clearly be a terrible outcome.  Fortunately, the authors of this legislation wrote it precisely so that  it could apply to a guidance, and they made it clear that was the  outcome they wanted.   It doesn't end there, though. There have been more than a dozen  instances already when Members of the Senate have asked the GAO to  review guidance to determine whether that guidance rises to the level  of importance and has the nature of a rulemaking so that it would be  subject to the Congressional Review Act. As a matter of fact, within a  single year of the passage of the Congressional Review Act, Congress  asked GAO to review a guidance for this purpose. This has been done  many times. In fact, it is our Democratic colleagues who set the  precedent for attempting to overturn a guidance after the traditional  CRA time window had expired because the guidance was not in the nature  of a formal rulemaking.    In 2008, there was an effort by Senators Rockefeller and Baucus to  overturn a CHIP guidance and to use the Congressional Review Act to do  it, exactly as we are going to use today the Congressional Review Act  to overturn a different guidance. That effort by Senators Rockefeller  and Baucus had 41 cosponsors, including then-Senator Obama, Senators  Biden, Clinton, Schumer, Durbin, Brown, and many other Democratic  Senators who are still serving today. Senator Baucus, a Democrat, laid  out the case. He said:         One agency attempted to ignore its obligations and       circumvent the process established by the CRA. And the agency       should not be rewarded.    I couldn't agree more. He is exactly right. Here is more from Senator  Baucus:         This resolution is a way for Congress to send the message       that it expects agencies to comply with the law. Congress       should stand up for itself and disapprove of this rule,       because it was not promulgated properly.    It makes perfect sense to be able to overturn a guidance that has the  force of a rule, which is to say--really, let's be honest--the force of  law was always contemplated as part of the CRA, and our Democratic  colleagues attempted to use it for that very purpose. To do anything  else would be to encourage the agencies to sneak around the  Administrative Procedure Act, to avoid the public scrutiny and  disclosure requirements, and promulgate rules through guidance  routinely.   There is another more fundamental issue that I think we should be  acknowledging; that is, the use of the Congressional Review Act is a  really important--a modest but important step in the direction of  restoring accountability to Congress.   As the Presiding Officer understands very well, the Constitution is  completely unambiguous. It is very clear. Legislative authority is  vested in Congress. It is supposed to be our responsibility to write  the laws, but we delegate a huge amount of authority and power to the  executive branch. We say: Well, you write these rules. Maybe, it is too  complicated or, maybe, we don't want to be held accountable for the  outcome. It happens all the time. There has been a huge shift whereby  the permanent bureaucracy, the administration, has an enormous amount  of power to effectively write laws. We call them rules, sometimes  guidance, but they have the power of law. They have the force of law.  They are not optional. They are imposed on whatever industry or  individual is subject to them. At a minimum, I think, Congress ought to  be reviewing this. This is a mechanism for holding Congress accountable  for the rules that we tolerate the agencies to promulgate. I think it  is a really important step in that direction.   Again, to summarize, the use of the Congressional Review Act to  repeal a guidance is well established. It is consistent with any plain  reading of the law. It is consistent with the intent of the authors at  the time. Congress has attempted to do so in the past. Democrats have  attempted to do it, and it is a modest but important step in restoring  the accountability of Congress with respect to the regulations that we  encourage the executive branch to promulgate. There is no evidence that  this somehow opens a floodgate of repeal, as some have suggested. But  any guidance--in fact any rulemaking, I think, ultimately should be  subject to congressional review because, after all, it is our authority  in the first place that is used to generate it. I am pleased that we  were able to agree to the motion to proceed yesterday. My understanding  is that we will be voting sometime around noon or so on this. I urge my  colleagues to vote in favor of repealing this ill-conceived regulation  and restoring some modicum of congressional accountability to the  rulemaking process.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to recognize and  celebrate with my Sikh friends, my constituents, and friends from the  Sikh community of Pennsylvania and beyond.   I start with the acknowledgment that my pronunciation of certain  words may be off, and I hope I will be forgiven.   I am delighted to have so many wonderful representatives of the Sikh  community here with us in Washington. I thank them. I thank Raj Singh  and all of the members of the Sikh community of Pennsylvania who made  this trip down to Washington, DC, to participate in a celebration for  an important holiday and to raise awareness about the Sikh community.   Sikhism has been around for nearly 600 years and originated in the  Punjab region of India in the 15th century. Today, there are about 30  million Sikhs who live in countries all around the world, making it one  of the world's largest religions. Sikhism is rooted in the belief that  every single person--every individual--regardless of race, gender, sex,  or creed, is equal before God. Sikhism was introduced in the United  States in the 19th century. Today, there are about 700,000 Sikhs who  live in the United States, and a large number of Sikhs reside in  Pennsylvania. In fact, there are several Sikh places of worship, known  as gurdwara, and they are located throughout Pennsylvania--in  Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Allentown, and Erie.   In my many travels across Pennsylvania, I have had an opportunity to  meet with and get to know hard-working Sikh constituents. I can tell  you they are close-knit, vibrant communities, deeply committed to their  families--fully American while, at the same time, preserving some  wonderful and often very old traditions. The Sikhs constitute a part of  the rich, cultural fabric of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and I am  grateful to them for what they add to my State.   A few years back, I was proud to join the American Sikh Congressional  Caucus. As a member of this caucus, we honor and recognize the Sikh  holiday of Vaisakhi. The holiday itself is usually celebrated on the  first day of the month of Vaisakhi, which just occurred last week on  Saturday, April 14. Vaisakhi is a special occasion for Sikhs to  remember the founding in 1699 of the Khalsa Panth. The Khalsa were a  fellowship of devout ``saint-soldier'' Sikhs who played an important  role in shaping the religion's history and its identity.   The holiday also recognizes the spring harvest. Sikhs recognize this  important holiday with parades, with dancing, with singing, and with  other festivities, as well as with volunteer service, especially  volunteering meals to those in need and other forms of community  service.   This year, the Sikh Coordination Committee East Coast, with the  support of the U.S. Congressional Sikh Caucus, has organized a parade  in Washington on May 19 to commemorate Vaisakhi as National Sikh Day.  The theme of the parade is the Sikh identity, the Sikh culture, the  Sikh way of life, and thousands of Sikhs from all over the United  States will be participating.   I am proud of the Sikh communities of Pennsylvania, and I wish the  Sikh community much luck in the parade and a very joyous Vaisakhi.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I have long  advocated for profound reform of the Export-Import Bank. My preference  has long been that the U.S. administration--in fact, this was an  obligation of the previous administration which it chose to ignore--but  that the U.S. administration negotiate among our trading partners a  mutual phaseout of these taxpayer-subsidized export entities.   My objection to this is the embedded taxpayer subsidy, the embedded  taxpayer risk in every transaction the Ex-Im does. The special interest  I am defending here today is the American taxpayer.   Now, I am pretty sure I am not going to change anyone's mind on the  floor tonight, so let me just make clear about where we are with these  nominees. During the Banking Committee hearings, I and other colleagues  made it clear. I would support the nominees to fill the vacancies on  the Board provided that a reformer such as Scott Garrett was included  among them. I would have supported restoring the quorum with the  confidence that there would have been at least a good-faith effort to  begin the kind of reforms we need. Unfortunately, the committee chose  not to advance Scott Garrett, who would have done, I think, a very good  job bridging the gap between the opponents and proponents of Ex-Im  Bank, but that was not to be.   Instead, Ex-Im supporters are now asking to confirm the remaining  nominees but not include Scott Garrett, who has taken himself out of  the running at this point, nor would it include any other person as  President.   What would the consequences of this be if this unanimous consent  request were agreed to? The Ex-Im Bank would constitute a quorum, would  resume doing multimillion- and multibillion-dollar deals, all which  would put taxpayers at risk and there would be no prospect of any  meaningful reform.   I remain open to finding a new candidate who can lead Ex-Im and  implement the kind of reforms that are needed, but that is not what is  on the table at the moment, and until that time comes, I cannot support  the confirmation of these additional Board members, which would  reconstitute the quorum; therefore, I object.  [[Page S2255]]     Mr. President, I would like to point out that included in  the list of nominees who my colleague from Ohio asked unanimous consent  for confirmation, was the inspector general for the Export-Import Bank.  That is a different function. That is a function I supported in  committee, and I would support today. As far as I am aware, there is no  objection whatsoever on this side of the aisle and no objection to  confirming the inspector general to this post. Therefore, I ask  unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the consideration of  Executive Calendar No. 585; that the Senate vote on the nomination with  no intervening action or debate; that if confirmed, the motion to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table; that the  President be immediately notified of the Senate's action; that no  further motions be in order; and that any statements relating to the  nomination be printed in the Record.
