 Mr. Speaker, I would like to acknowledge the Joint  Explanatory Statement to the Conference Report to accompany H.R. 6157,  the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2019, and Senate Report  115-290 which provide an additional $30 million in funding for Defense- Wide Manufacturing Science and Technology Program's Advanced  Manufacturing within the Research, Development, Test and Evaluation,  Defense-Wide Account. These funds will allow the Department of Defense  to establish a Microelectronics Cybersecurity Center.   Microelectronics support nearly all Department of Defense activities,  enabling capabilities such as the global positioning system, radar,  command and control, and communications. Ensuring secure access to  leading-edge microelectronics, however, is a challenge. The changing  global semiconductor industry and the sophistication of U.S.  adversaries, who might target military electronic components, require  us to update our domestic microelectronics security framework.   Defense-Wide Manufacturing Science and Technology is an investment  mechanism that allows the Department of Defense to advance state-of- the-art, defense-essential, manufacturing capabilities through the  development of technologies and processes necessary to produce defense  systems. This funding increase will allow the United States to achieve  a rapid modernization of domestic state-of-the-art foundry operations,  through the use of not-for-profit public-private-partnerships, to  produce trusted microelectronics.   I support rapid modernization of domestic state-of-the-art foundry  operations that produce trusted microelectronics and thank the  conference committee for all their work on the issue.
