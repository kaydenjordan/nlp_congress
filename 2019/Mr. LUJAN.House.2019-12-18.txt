 Madam Speaker, no one came to Congress to impeach a  President.   We came here to solve the mighty issues that impact the lives of the  constituents we pledged to serve.   I am here because too many families in my district still rely on  water trucked in from dozens of miles away.   I am here because too many New Mexican children still go to school  hungry.   I am here because too many women in New Mexico drive for hours to  find a doctor able to care for them.   But this moment has found us. We have reached a point in time where  our love of country compels action, where our duty to this republic  mandates that we do what is right.   The President's behavior is so blatantly wrong that ignoring his  abuses of power would be abdicating the oath we made to protect this  country and uphold our Constitution.
