 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the rule and the bill for  which it was made, the Resilient Federal Forests Act. The rule makes in  order several needed amendments, but, more importantly, it allows for  much-needed debate and consideration of a bipartisan bill to address  the growing economic and environmental threats posed by catastrophic  wildfires.   This bill will give Federal agencies immediate tools to increase the  effectiveness of our forest management projects while preserving  environmental protections.   While of immense benefit to preserving our national parks, the bill  also supports the private sector by addressing obstructionist  litigation against management activity, and rewarding collaboration by  local governments and local stakeholders when they work together to  foster more effective management projects.   Mr. Speaker, North Carolina's Fifth District is home to pristine  national parks, including the scenic Blue Ridge Parkway, otherwise  known as America's favorite drive.   I am an unwavering supporter of our Nation's national parks, and I  look forward to equipping better our park managers to protect our  forests from wildfires and other threats to their environmental  integrity.
