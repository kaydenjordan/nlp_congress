 Mr. President, I thank my colleague for mentioning and  honoring Chris Allen, and our sympathies to the Grassley family. Thank  you so much for talking about the hard work that so many of our staff  do around the Capitol that people don't realize. While we have lost  some on our side, too, it is important to remember those who give so  much of their time and energy to make our country better.                                  H.R. 5430    Mr. President, I rise to support the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement we  are going to be voting on tomorrow, and I want to thank all the people  who worked on it, including Senator Grassley, Senator Wyden, Senator  Brown, Speaker Pelosi, and many other people to get us a final product  that I think we all believe should move forward.   It is very important to me, coming from one of the most trade- dependent States, that we continue to open up trade markets, but I hope  my colleagues will also realize that the world economy has reached a  tipping point. Over half of the world is now either middle class or  wealthier. So that means that we have more people to sell more U.S.  products to. That means bigger market opportunities for U.S.  manufactured goods, for agriculture products, and a way for us to  continue to compete in some of our most important industries. That is  why I have always supported making sure that we continue to open up  trade markets in a fair way. And for us in Washington State, the North  American Free Trade Agreement was a positive move. In the context,  prior to the NAFTA agreement for Washington, in Mexico, there was $300  million of Washington exports. Now there is more than $2 billion, and  they are our largest export market for Washington apples.   Today, Canada, you can see a similar story. Prior to the North  American Free Trade Agreement, our products into that country were  roughly about $2 billion; today, they are more than $9 billion. So  continuing to modernize the North American Free Trade Agreement is an  important step for Washington and for our economy. The important  aspects of this deal help us open and get a fair playing field for  wheat, for making sure that digital trade continues in a fair way, and  that dairy products are accessed into Canada in a fair way and that our  wine industry--believe it or not, Canadians drink a lot of wine,  particularly in British Columbia, and they have not always given us  fair access to that market. So it is very important that it will  increase access to Washington wines into Canada, which is the largest  market for Washington wines, buying about $10 million in exports a  year. But as I mentioned, USMCA will maintain a duty-free access for  our dairy products to Mexico; it will certainly make sure that our  wheat products are on a level playing field and continue the access to  digital trade.   I want to thank my colleagues Senator Brown and Senator Wyden and  Speaker Pelosi and all those in the labor movement who worked hard with  getting an enforcement and capacity-building provision in this  legislation. But what we are doing here that I know of for the first  time is business and labor coming together and saying ``we need to  build the capacity within a country so that they can enforce trade  agreements.'' This is a positive step, not just for Mexico, but a  positive step for what we need to do around the globe. I wish we could  just say to every country, ``Yes, put up the regime to enforce these  laws, and make it happen tomorrow, and we can help you and your  economy.'' But it just doesn't work like that. And when you retreat  from trade--and, trust me, I believe this administration has retreated  from trade when it starts with a tariff-first approach. You cannot  start the discussion with throwing out tariffs and then penalizing our  farmers and then thinking that we are going to get the door open. So I  am all ears to hear how we are going to get a real agreement with  China.   But I thank my colleagues who did the hard work on this USMCA  agreement to make enforcement and capacity building real for the first  time. Why? Because as we look at that world economy outside the United  States, it is one of the biggest economic opportunities we will see.  That is, we know how to grow things. We know how to make things. We  should make sure we are opening up markets in a fair trade regime to  those products. So I will continue to work with our colleagues here to  make sure that that is achieved. I hope the President will stop the  tariff-first approach, stop the continuation of the tariffs and the  impacts that we are seeing now, and get down to continuing to  negotiations with our being a leader for opening up markets.  [[Page S234]]    The United States can't lose shelf space to very, very competitive  markets and then come back years later and try to regain it. Let's be a  world leader in establishing the rules for fair trade and pushing for  provisions like we see in the USMCA agreement so we can move forward,  making sure Washington products, U.S. Products, American-made products,  get delivered to a growing, wealthier world.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota.
