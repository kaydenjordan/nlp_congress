 Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Takano for yielding me the time.   It is my honor today to rise in support of H.R. 4673, the Ensuring  Veterans' Smooth Transition Act.   I appreciate the leadership of Chairman Takano to advance this  critical legislation that will require the VA to automatically enroll  individuals who are separating from the military into the VA system.   Our brave members of the military put their lives and health on the  line every day to keep our Nation safe, defend our democracy, and  protect our freedoms.   We have a responsibility to make it as easy as possible for them to  transition from military service to civilian life, and I am pleased  that this legislation does just that.   My life experiences have afforded me the opportunity as a former  township trustee in northwest Indiana to work every day with the  veterans community. I was able to initiate a veterans services  roundtable and bring together veteran organizations to discuss,  coordinate, and streamline much-needed resources to our veterans.  [[Page H262]]    In many instances, it was not that the resources or the benefit was  unavailable, but rather, the individual was unaware of the existing  benefit, or unable to access, for whatever reason, the very resource  they needed.   Today, I am thinking of those countless discussions and individuals  as I will vote to support the EVEST Act. It is an effective proposal to  help ensure that veterans access the valuable healthcare services  available to them during this transition process from active to veteran  status.   Today, I want to make sure we meet our veterans' mental health needs  and increase veterans' access to healthcare. I again thank Chairman  Takano and my fellow members of the Veterans' Affairs Committee for  your commitment to supporting veterans and bringing this measure to the  floor today.   I urge my colleagues to support this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my support for  Congress to complete the consideration of the fiscal year 2022  appropriations measures prior to the current deadline of February 18. I  remain grateful that a transparent process was established for all  Members to include eligible projects in these measures.   Notably, for the first District of Indiana, there are projects  included that will allow for dredging and improvements at the Port of  Indiana-Burns Harbor. This incredible facility is essential to the  functions of the northwest Indiana steel and manufacturing industries  and supports thousands of steelworker jobs and longshoreman jobs along  the way.   Appropriations measures are not just funding numbers and direction  for Federal programs and projects. They are a testament to the  government's investment that create jobs and grow our economy.   I appreciate the ongoing communications of our appropriations  leaders, and I look forward to doing all I can to ensure that these  important measures are signed into law as soon as possible.                            ____________________
