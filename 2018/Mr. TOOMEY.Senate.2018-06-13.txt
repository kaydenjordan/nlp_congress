 Mr. President, I rise to address the national defense  authorization bill that is under consideration and that we will  probably be wrapping up this week.   First, I will address an amendment that Senator Corker and I have  filed. It is an amendment that is related to the topic at hand, which  is our security, because it is an amendment that would restore to  Congress the authority to have the final word on the deployment of  tariffs--taxes on American consumers--when purchasing goods that  originate overseas, tariffs that are implemented, imposed, with the  justification that our national security depends upon it. These are  often referred to as the ``section 232 tariffs'' because of the section  of trade law that authorizes these tariffs.   The short version is that I think we ought to be having a debate and  a vote on whether this responsibility that the Constitution clearly  gives to Congress should be restored to Congress. It is my view that it  should be. Senator Corker and I have sought a vote on this. At this  point, it appears that despite bipartisan support for this amendment,  we may not be able to have a vote, but I think we should. I also think  we should seriously consider continuing debate on the national defense  authorization bill until such time as we are able to address this  important amendment.                              Amendment No. 2700    The other amendment I will discuss is an amendment I have offered  which will get a vote. It will get a vote tomorrow, and I urge my  colleagues to support this. Let me start by reminding my colleagues of  something that I  [[Page S3893]]  hope we all learned a long time ago, and that is the very first  provision of the U.S. Constitution after the preamble, the very first  operative portion of our Constitution.   Article I, section 1 states: ``All legislative Powers herein granted  shall be vested in a Congress of the United States, which shall consist  of a Senate and House of Representatives.'' I can't think of a more  clear, succinct, straightforward, and unambiguous way to make the point  that writing laws is in Congress's domain, is Congress's  responsibility.   In the course of writing laws, sometimes we delegate some of that  authority. Sometimes we delegate it to our staff members. We ask them  to do the drafting. We are still responsible because we are Members of  Congress. Sometimes we delegate it to the executive branch, and we call  that rulemaking. We authorize the relevant agencies or Cabinets to  develop the rules that will implement the legislation, but I would  argue strenuously that that is still part of the legislative function.  As such, it is a delegation, but it should not be an abdication of our  responsibility. Congress should accept the responsibility for this  rulemaking, and we should be accountable for it because that is part of  our job.   That brings me to the Defense authorization bill, specifically to  title XVII. There is a section called the Foreign Investment Risk  Review Modernization Act. This is a dramatic expansion of the authority  given to CFIUS under existing law. CFIUS is an acronym that stands for  the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. There is this  big expansion of authority that CFIUS gets. Part of the way in which  this underlying bill, the National Defense Authorization Act, expands  CFIUS's authority is by the huge delegation of legislative authority it  grants the administration. It grants the administration enormous  discretion to develop the rules by which this expansion of power will  be implemented.   Let me explain briefly what CFIUS is all about. CFIUS--this Committee  on Foreign Investment in the United States--is charged under existing  law with reviewing foreign investments in America, foreign-based  companies that choose to or wish to invest in an American company. If  there is a national security concern involving the investment, if there  is a risk that is identified, then CFIUS--this committee--is charged  with recommending that the President block the transaction if it is  considered to be a threat to our security.   Under existing law, the President has the authority, in fact, to  block such a transaction. For instance, if a Russian company were  attempting to purchase Lockheed Martin, which is a big defense  contractor and a big supplier of very important, sensitive, and  advanced military equipment to our armed services, our Armed Forces, in  such a case, CFIUS would take, I think, a pretty quick review of that  and recommend a no. The President would almost certainly block such a  transaction.   We understand there is a sensible need for this committee to exist  and to do its work. So let's get back to the underlying legislation  before us.   Under existing law, under current law, the range of transactions that  CFIUS can review for this purpose of determining whether it is a threat  to our national security is pretty narrow. It is fairly narrow. I think  there are legitimate concerns that it is too narrow, especially  considering aggressive and even hostile acts that are taken under the  auspices of the Chinese Government to acquire sensitive American  technology. As I say, there is this delegation of authority to broaden  that.   I would argue that this rulemaking--the decisions that CFIUS will  make as it implements and develops these rules that we are going to  empower it to develop--is really going to decide which kinds of  transactions will be permitted to go forward and which ones will not.  The rulemaking--not so much the legislation itself but the subsequent  rulemaking--is going to really set the scope of CFIUS's review and its  process.   There are many rulemakings required of the CFIUS committee through  this legislation. Here are a couple of examples.   A passive investment by a foreign-based entity--a passive investment  in a U.S. company--is meant to be excluded from a CFIUS review. That  would be allowed. That would not be subject to a review. Yet, guess  what, CFIUS gets to define what constitutes a passive investment. That  is a pretty big power.    A second example is that of critical infrastructure and technology  companies. Those are the companies that we are concerned about, right?  Critical infrastructure and technology companies are the ones that have  sensitive technology that we might not want to have fall into hostile  hands. That is the category in which there is an automatic trigger for  a CFIUS review.   Guess what. CFIUS is going to write the rules to decide what  constitutes a critical infrastructure and technology company. I don't  know what it is going to conclude. I am pretty sure that if you are the  manufacturer of a chip that goes into a very cutting-edge military  application--that almost certainly would be a technology company we  would want on the list. Yet it says critical infrastructure. What about  a power company that produces electricity that feeds into our grid?  What about a company that provides a municipal water supply? What about  a supplier to one of those companies or a consultant to one of those  companies? I think you could ask a lot of interesting questions about  what kinds of companies ought to qualify, and we have delegated that.  That will be decided by someone else. That will be in the rulemaking  process.   Then there is the case of who must submit a form to CFIUS for a  transaction, who must go under CFIUS review, and there is some criteria  in the legislation.   The final catchall is that CFIUS will have the authority, as it sees  fit, to require these reviews for other transactions. What could be  more broad and sweeping than that? Basically, CFIUS can itself decide  to write the rules in such a way that it will have the power to review  any transaction it wants.   This is really remarkable in terms of how much power is being  delegated to the executive branch to write these rules.   The rules could be written in a way that they are written too  broadly, and if they are too broad, it could have a chilling effect on  foreign direct investment in the United States. It is a huge source of  jobs and economic growth when foreigners bring their capital to the  United States and invest it here because America is one of the most  attractive places in the world to invest.   On the other hand, if they write these rules too narrowly, it could  be that CFIUS will not have sufficient authority, and transactions that  we ought to be blocking will not get blocked because the rules will  have been written too narrowly.   There is no Member of the Senate who can know in advance whether the  rulemaking is going to strike the right balance. That is what we need  here. That is what we want. What we want is the right balance so that  we are stopping the transactions from bad actors but permitting the  transactions from harmless sources that will help our economy.   Since we can't know in advance whether this rulemaking will be done  in the appropriate fashion, why wouldn't we insist on the  responsibility of overseeing this and, in fact, on having the final say  to make sure that this is done properly, that the right balance is  struck? In fact, isn't that our responsibility under the constitutional  authority and responsibility given to us?   This is what my amendment is all about. My amendment would simply  require Congress to approve the major rules--not every last rule but  all of the important, major rules that CFIUS would develop--pursuant to  this legislation that we are probably going to pass later this week.  Congress would have to approve it before it could go into effect. It  would be approved by a simple majority vote, and it would not be  subject to a filibuster. There would be a strict time limit so that  Congress would have to respond quickly when the rules are finished, and  if Congress were to reject one of the rules, CFIUS could modify it so  we could get to a conclusion.   My amendment does not give Congress the power to consider individual  transactions--that shouldn't be in our domain--and it doesn't authorize  Congress to review every rule, as I say, only the major rules, which is  to say  [[Page S3894]]  those which would have a big impact on our economy.   So what are the practical consequences if my amendment were to be  adopted? It would simply ensure that the administration would work with  us as they were adopting the rules. Knowing that they needed to pass  these rules in the House and the Senate, they would consult with us and  say: Hey, this is what we are thinking in terms of how we define  critical infrastructure and sensitive technology, and here is what we  are thinking about what would constitute a path of investment. In all  of the other cases in which they were making big decisions they would  run them by us. We would have a dialogue, and we would get to a place  where there was an agreement. That is what would happen, and, actually,  that is exactly what should happen.   I have heard some concerns expressed about my amendment. Some have  said: Well, wait a minute. If you get your amendment passed, Congress  will never approve of these rules.   I couldn't disagree more. Congress is about to vote overwhelmingly.  We voted in committee unanimously to grant CFIUS this broad new  authority. The Members of this body overwhelmingly think that we should  broaden the range of transactions subject to CFIUS review. Why wouldn't  we support sensible rulemaking that would allow CFIUS to do what we  have asked them to do? So I think it is extremely implausible that  Congress wouldn't support this.   Others have suggested: Well, you don't really need this because you  have the CRA, or the Congressional Review Act, as a mechanism that  allows you to repeal a rule if Congress doesn't like it.   The CRA wouldn't work in this case at all because the CRA requires  the President to sign a bill repealing a recently passed rule. What  President is going to sign a bill repealing a rule or regulation that  his administration just passed?   The CRA works when there is a change of administration. When the  Trump administration came in, working together with Congress, the  President and we repealed a number of regulations from the previous  administration. But a President isn't going to sign a law repealing his  own regulations.   So I want to appeal to my colleagues, maybe for different reasons, to  support this legislation. For my Republican colleagues, 39 of us are  cosponsors of the REINS Act. The REINS Act would require congressional  review of every regulation throughout the entire government. Every time  a major new rule is passed under the REINS Act, Congress would have to  vote before it would go into effect.   If the REINS Act that 39 of my Republican Senate colleagues have  cosponsored were the law, we wouldn't have this conversation because  this legislation would come automatically under the REINS Act and  automatically require that major rulemakings would come back for a  vote. So I can't for the life of me understand why Republicans who  support the REINS Act wouldn't support this, and I hope all of my  Republican colleagues will.   I would appeal to my Democratic colleagues, as well, for the simple,  fundamental reason that this is our responsibility. We should accept  the responsibility that the Constitution assigns to us. That is No. 1,  first and foremost. But, also, let's be honest. A big majority of our  Democratic colleagues voted against confirming several of the members  of CFIUS. A big majority of Democrats voted against confirming the  Treasury Secretary, Mr. Mnuchin. They voted against confirming Attorney  General Sessions. They voted against confirming Secretary of State  Pompeo. Those three individuals are on CFIUS, and the Treasury  Secretary is the chairman of it. So if my Democratic colleagues have  such serious reservations about the work product that would come from  these individuals that they voted against confirming them, one would  think they would want the opportunity to have some say on their work  product. That is what this is about. So I can't imagine that my  Democratic colleagues would take the position that they must not have  any say over the Trump administration's rulemaking. They have never  suggested so much confidence in this administration that they would  want to forego that opportunity. So I would hope that my Democratic  colleagues could join me in this as well.   What this comes down to is that I think we should accept  responsibility for the work we do and the work we delegate. Let's make  sure that this really important and necessary expansion of CFIUS  authority is done right. The way we do that is that we make sure that  Congress has the final say over the rulemaking.   I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.   I yield the floor.
