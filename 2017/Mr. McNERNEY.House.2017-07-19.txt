 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and work of  Maryam Mirzakhani. Maryam was born and raised in Iran where she was the  first female on Iran's International Mathematical Olympiad team,  winning gold medals in 1994 and 1995, and was the first Iranian woman  elected to the National Academy of Sciences.   She moved to the United States to attend graduate school at Harvard  University and became a 2004 research fellow of the Clay Mathematics  Institute and a professor at Princeton University. In 2008, she became  a professor at Stanford University. In 2014, Maryam was the first woman  ever to be bestowed with the most prestigious mathematical award, the  Fields Medal, for her outstanding contributions to the dynamics and  geometry of Riemann surfaces and their moduli spaces.   The Fields Medals are awarded every 4 years to people aged 40 or  younger. Maryam was an amazing mathematician, socially engaging, and  involved in the local community. Maryam Mirzakhani died last week at  the age of 40, a tragedy not only for her family and friends but for  the additional beautiful mathematics she would have given the human  race had she been blessed with a long career.                            ____________________     Mr. Chair, I thank the gentlewoman from Florida for  yielding.   Mr. Chair, I stand up to oppose H.R. 2883.   Basically, what this bill does is preapproves border-crossing energy  products by making it extremely difficult to put a stop to them on any  grounds.   As a general matter, specifically for oil pipelines, within the  United States, oil pipelines don't need Federal approval. No Federal  reviews or permits on these projects are required. If the pipeline  harms endangered species, the ESA will apply. If the construction  destroys wetlands, a project permit may be needed from the Corps of  Engineers. But generally, neither of these requirements trigger a  broader evaluation of the project. Currently, the only reason to  prepare an environmental assessment or impact for cross-border  pipelines or transmission lines is because the existing Presidential  permit requirement triggers NEPA.   Under this bill, there would be no projectwide Federal environmental  assessment for all these projects. State laws don't substitute for  NEPA. Many States don't have approval authority over pipelines within  their States.    Even those States with some instate authority don't  have the resources or expertise to develop the information provided by  a Federal environmental impact statement. No State has permitting  authority over the portions of a pipeline located in other States.  Without NEPA, there would be no broad Federal environmental review of  cross-border transmission lines.    Mr. Chair, we need these protections, and I ask my colleagues to  oppose H.R. 2883.
