 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the subject of my Special Order.    Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak about the work of  the Select Committee on the Modernization of Congress.   As chair, I am extremely proud of what the select committee has  accomplished in the past year. I am also proud of how we have  accomplished our work.   In addition to unanimously passing 45 recommendations to improve the  way Congress works, the select committee is establishing a new and  meaningful precedent for bipartisan collaboration.   For those watching on C-SPAN, your television is not broken. We are  actually proving that it is possible for Members of Congress from both  sides of  [[Page H1185]]  the aisle to sit down together, engage in tough discussions, listen and  learn from one another, and reach consensus. And I am fortunate and  grateful to serve on this committee with such thoughtful and dedicated  Members, including Vice Chair   Tom Graves, whom we will hear from  later this evening.   The select committee's guiding principle is to make Congress work  better so that the institution and its Members can better serve the  American people. That simple but profound goal guides all of our work.  It helps us identify institutional problems and develop helpful  solutions.   Last year, we held hearings on important topics like improving  transparency in Congress, bettering constituent engagement, cultivating  staff diversity and retention, developing next-generation leadership,  technology best practices used in the States, the congressional  schedule and calendar, and rules and procedures.   We kicked off this year with two hearings on Article I of the  Constitution. The first focused on restoring congressional capacity,  and the second focused on debate and deliberation.   While this may not have set any ratings records on C-SPAN, the  reality is these hearings actually helped us dig deeper into the many  challenges facing Congress and helped us identify innovative solutions  to have this institution function better on behalf of the American  people. As we continue to examine the range of issues in our mandate,  we are going to continue to listen closely to what our colleagues and  staff have to say about making Congress work better for the American  people.   Many Members and staff have generously devoted their time and  knowledge to helping the select committee think about policies to  modernize Congress. We are grateful for their support and thrilled by  the amount of interest our House colleagues have expressed in our work.   If one thing is clear, it is this: The desire to make Congress a more  effective and efficient institution is actually devoid of partisanship.  Modernizing Congress helps all Members to do a better job on behalf of  their constituents.   So far, the select committee has reported three sets of  recommendations containing a total of 45 unanimously approved  recommendations out of committee. The committee reports containing  these recommendations were reported to the House today, pursuant to  section 201(f)(2) of H. Res. 6, and will be made publicly available at  govinfo.gov.    Our first set of recommendations was reported favorably by the select  committee last May and focused on improving transparency in Congress.  Transparency increases accountability and, ultimately, improves the way  Congress serves the American people.   While a lot of legislative information is public, it is often not  made available in a format that is easy to access or to review or to  digest. These recommendations address transparency and accessibility  problems and encourage the continuous public posting of new legislative  information, including bill status, committee votes, program  authorizations, and lobbying disclosures.   Ultimately, it is the people who pay for the data Congress collects,  so they should be able to access basic information about what Members  of Congress do here, whether it is following a bill through the  process, seeing how we vote in committee and on the floor, or tracking  what bills Members of Congress sponsor and cosponsor. Improving public  access to legislative data is wholly consistent with making Congress  work better for the American people.   Our second set of 24 recommendations were reported favorably by the  committee last July. These recommendations fit into four broad  categories.   The first set updates policies governing House human resources and  consolidates the many H.R.-related offices in the House into a one-stop  shop to help Members and staff with questions about recruitment,  retention, diversity, legal counsel, training, and benefits. These  recommendations recognize that attracting and retaining a diverse and  highly qualified workforce requires offering competitive benefits and a  motivating work environment.   The second set overhauls the onboarding process for new Members and  provides continuing education for all Members.   The select committee has heard a lot about how new Member orientation  should be nonpartisan and should include courses emphasizing the  necessity of civility and respect. Rather than divide new Members by  party as soon as they arrive here for orientation, we should encourage  more relationship building.   Whether at the start of someone's service or later, Members should  also have the opportunity to continue learning best practices so they  can better serve those they represent.   The third set of recommendations modernizes House technology  resources and emphasizes quality IT services to reduce reliance on  outside vendors, to leverage bulk purchasing power, and to save  taxpayer dollars.   Congress has been described by one of our colleagues as an 18th  century institution using 20th century technology to solve 21st century  problems. To address that, we also recommend reestablishing and  reenvisioning the Office of Technology Assessment to help Congress  address modern science and technology challenges.   Our fourth set of recommendations establishes that all proceedings  and functions of the House should be made accessible to all Americans.   This year, we celebrate the 30th anniversary of the signing of the  Americans with Disabilities Act. While much progress has been made,  there is still a lot of work to do to ensure that Americans with  disabilities do not face discrimination. Our recommendations seek to  address the equal access challenges persons with disabilities face when  working for, visiting, or interacting with Congress.   Before I continue and dive into some of the other work of the select  committee, I want to invite my colleague and the vice chair of the  committee, the gentleman from Georgia,   Tom Graves, to say a few  words.   Tom has been a terrific partner, and I value the way that he has  approached this committee, approaching these as problems to be solved,  not working to score political points and, like every member of this  committee, has really had his oar in the water trying to move our  effort forward.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Graves),  and I invite him to say a few words.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his kind words  and for his partnership. This has been a true partnership with every  member of the committee, but I particularly appreciate Mr. Graves'  leadership as our vice chair.   Madam Speaker, I want to just dive in a bit on where he ended, which  is we are the first select committee in several decades to propose and  adopt recommendations on a rolling basis. Put simply, when we have  consensus, we move.   We are also the first select committee in recent history to introduce  our recommendations as legislation, to ensure that they actually get  implemented further on down the road.   We introduced legislation in December, H. Res. 756, that incorporates  the first two sets of recommendations passed by the select committee,  and we are expecting a committee markup soon.   The select committee unanimously approved a third set of  recommendations in December, and those recommendations fit into three  broad categories.   The first set emphasizes the necessity of civility and the importance  of bipartisan collaboration in Congress. Select committee members  believe that Congress is stronger when Members find ways to work  together to solve problems, and civility is key to making Congress a  more productive institution that better serves the American people.  That is especially important now. And the select committee intends to  continue pushing for improved civility through further recommendations.   The second set addresses various administrative inefficiencies in  Congress: to update Member cosponsorship powers, procurement and bulk  purchasing policies, the travel card program, and Member emergency  preparedness training.   And the third set, modernize the House Franking Commission on mailing  standards and its regulations governing all Member communications. The  select committee worked closely with the Franking Commission to develop  these recommendations, and we were pleased to see the Commission  implement updated communication standards for Members in January. The  new guidelines modernize franking rules by including digital  communications, improving transparency, expediting the review process,  and allowing for more seamless interaction with constituents across  platforms.   As with our first two sets of recommendations, the select committee  will introduce legislation that incorporates our third set of  recommendations to ensure further implementation. We don't want to just  make recommendations for the sake of making recommendations; we want to  make recommendations that actually improve Congress and its function on  behalf of the American people.   The select committee has accomplished a great deal in the past year,  but there is still a lot more work to do. I believe I speak for all of  the members of the committee when I say we are ready for that  challenge. Our plan is to build on our success thus far and continue  issuing recommendations over the next several months.   Working to build a more efficient and effective Congress that will  better  [[Page H1187]]  serve the American people is a mission I am proud to lead, and I am  lucky to lead this committee alongside Vice Chair   Tom Graves, who has  been a great and steadfast partner in this effort. I am lucky to have a  terrific set of committee members who are working to make Congress  function better on behalf of the American people.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 5 o'clock and 49 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Wednesday, February 26, 2020, at 10 a.m. for morning-hour debate.                                 ____________________
