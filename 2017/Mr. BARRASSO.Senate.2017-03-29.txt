 Mr. President, I would like to add my voice to that of  the Senator from Missouri. I thank him for his leadership and for his  excellent work on the matters that he has been addressing.                          Nomination of Neil Gorsuch    Mr. President, I am here to address the issue, as I have done before  and will again, of the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to be a Justice  of the U.S. Supreme Court. America needs judges who can follow the law,  who have the highest ethical standards, and who value the independence  of our courts. That is the description of Neil Gorsuch. That is him in  a nutshell. We saw it throughout his career, and we saw it again in his  confirmation hearing last week.   Democrats on the committee asked him to talk about issues that are  going to be coming up before the Supreme Court. Well, Judge Gorsuch--we  know what he did. He followed the rules, the ethics rules. These are  the rules that say that judges and nominees should not answer those  kinds of questions.   Following the rules is exactly what he should have done, and it is  exactly what other nominees that both Republican and Democratic  Presidents have placed on the Court have done in the past.   It is what Ruth Bader Ginsburg did at her confirmation hearing in  1993. She said that a ``judge sworn to decide impartially can offer no  forecasts, no hints.'' She said that this would ``display disdain for  the entire judicial process.'' She was confirmed.   That is exactly what Judge Gorsuch said. That is the Ginsburg  standard, and every nominee since then has followed that standard.   Democrats on the Judiciary Committee also tried last week to  criticize Judge Gorsuch for some of his opinions that they didn't like.  They suggested that the Court should have ignored the law--ignored the  law and sided with ``the little guy'' in these cases.   Judge Gorsuch was quick to point out that all judges are absolutely  not supposed to consider who they think is sympathetic. They are to  rule based on the law.   Federal judges actually swear an oath to ``administer justice without  respect to persons, and do equal right to the poor and to the rich.''   It is interesting because the minority leader, Senator Schumer,  himself has spoken about how important it is for a judge to be  impartial. In 2009, at the confirmation hearing for Justice Sonia  Sotomayor, he praised the way that she put the ``rule of law above  everything else.'' He said that she did this even when it led to  rulings that ``go against so-called sympathetic litigants.'' That was  2009.   Fast forward to 2017. It is the identical standard that Judge Gorsuch  has followed. He pointed out that it is his job to apply the law, and  writing the laws is the job of the legislative branch of government.   We are not here selecting the 101st Senator. This is not about who  ought to be another Senator. This is about who should be on the Supreme  Court. We are selecting a Justice for the most important Court of the  land.  [[Page S2082]]    Nearly everyone who has looked at this nominee's record, who has  watched his confirmation hearing agrees that he would be an excellent  Justice. There was one lawyer who wrote an op-ed in The Washington Post  on March 8. He is a board member of the liberal American Constitution  Society. He wrote that ``there is no principled reason'' to vote  against Judge Gorsuch. A Denver Post editorial last week said Judge  Gorsuch would make ``a marvelous addition to the Supreme Court.'' The  American Bar Association has given him its highest possible rating. He  was even introduced at his confirmation hearing last week by a former  top lawyer for the Obama administration. Neal Katyal is a Democrat. He  was the Acting Solicitor General of the United States for President  Obama. He has called Judge Gorsuch ``one of the most thoughtful and  brilliant judges to have served our nation over the last century.''   I think any Democrat who watched the confirmation hearings and looked  at the nominee's record will decide it is an easy decision to confirm  him.   If there is a Democrat who reaches the opposite conclusion, I say:  Come to this floor. Come to the floor of the U.S. Senate. Explain why  you think our judges should go into a case favoring one side or  another. If you think a judge should make promises about how he will  rule just to win the vote of a Senator, go ahead. Come to the floor.  Make your case. If you think that a Justice of the Supreme Court should  ignore the law and rule not based on the law but by that judge's own  preferences, please come to the floor and say so. I don't think that is  what the American people want.    The American people want judges who are smart, who are principled,  who are fair, and who know that their job is to follow the law, not  write the law. The American people know that Neil Gorsuch is exactly  that kind of judge, and that is the kind of judge who we should have on  the Supreme Court and on every court of the land.   Thank you, Mr. President.   I yield the floor.
