 Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition.    Mr. Chairman, Job Corps is meant to be an  outlet to help disadvantaged youth gain the skills necessary to achieve  a good education and the skills needed for the workforce, but the  failures of the program do a disservice to students, staff, and the  American taxpayers who pay for the programs.   For years this federally funded program has struggled to ensure the  safety and security of students. There is ample documentation about the  systemic deficiencies in Job Corps, and over 30 different government  reports and audits have raised concerns over the safety and security of  participants.   The administration's proposed changes to Job Corps are an important  first step in reforming the program so that it actually works for  students and efficiently utilizes taxpayer funds.   The Department of Labor's mission of preparing at-risk youth for  meaningful participation in the workforce and skills development for  career success makes them a better choice for running the 25 Job Corps  Centers that have previously been operated by USDA. The transition of  these Civilian Conservation Centers, or CCCs, will allow USDA to  strengthen its focus on improving our Nation's forests and grasslands  while also remaining a key partner in the DOL-run Job Corps centers  going forward.   In short, the administration's efforts would allow more students to  participate in the Job Corps program at high performing centers and in  doing so protect taxpayer money.   I urge my colleagues to support a Job Corps program that actually  protects and serves students and to vote ``no'' on this amendment.                                time  1715     Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chair, I continue to reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, could I inquire as to how much  time I have remaining.    Mr. Chair, au contraire, to the gentleman  from Oregon. Not only have I visited one of these programs but when I  was president of the Mayland Community College, we had a program very  close by. I am very well aware of these programs.   I doubt the gentleman from Oregon has ever read the report, which  talks about the ineptness, the lack of safety, and the danger in these  programs.   The dangerous place that these programs are, the number of deaths  that have occurred in Job Corps programs, yes, there are phenomenal  results. There are phenomenally bad results in these programs.    Mr. Chair, we have 7 million jobs unfilled in this country right now.  If Job Corps, along with our colleges and universities, were doing  their jobs in this country, we wouldn't have 7 million jobs vacant in  the country. We would have more people prepared with the skills they  need to fill those jobs.   The recommendation made by the administration will allow more  students to get the skills they need at a lower cost for the American  taxpayers and in higher-performing centers. We need to spend the scarce  dollars that we have as wisely as possible.   These programs are more in line with the mission of DOL than in line  with the mission of the Department of Agriculture. We need to allow the  Department of Agriculture to focus on its mission and the Department of  Labor to focus on its mission.   I have all the sympathy in the world for young, disadvantaged people  who do not have skills to get jobs, Mr. Chair. I have worked directly  with those people. I have helped many of them. This is not the way to  go. If we truly want to help them, we will have effective programs, not  dangerous programs and not ineffective programs.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
