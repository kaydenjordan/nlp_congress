 Mr. Speaker, Walstonburg, North  Carolina, a town of 208 residents in my district, is a shining example  of the best of small-town USA.   This past weekend, the Walstonburg American Legion Post 332 hosted  the town's 15th annual Proud to be an American Day, a way this tight- knit community uplifts and honors our country's veterans, Active Duty  servicemembers, and fallen military members.   This Proud to be an American Day was the first, however, without the  late former Representative Walter B. Jones, Jr., and everyone missed  his presence.   Mr. Speaker, this community proves making a difference doesn't  require size, only passion.                            ____________________
