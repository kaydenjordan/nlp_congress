 Madam Speaker, my, my, my, here we go  again--or should I say to my colleagues on the other side of the  aisle--lie, lie, lie.   The United States Supreme Court has dismantled access to legal  abortion giving the very, very personal decision concerning a person's  reproductive health, their life and future to strange politicians.   Now, Republicans across the country and in Congress are moving full  steam ahead toward their dark and extreme goal of a nationwide abortion  ban that will throw doctors into jail, force children to bear children,  lead to tragic deaths, and life-changing hardships for people in our  country.   That is why I rise in support of the Women's Health Protection Act  that will facilitate access to legal abortion care regardless of a  person's ZIP Code.   Let me warn everyone that the Republican agenda includes even more  drastic intrusions into our personal lives--banning legal abortion is  just the start. We will fight back.    Madam Speaker, a Supreme Court, out of  touch with the American people,  [[Page H6655]]  says that State legislatures can ban abortions and give our most  important personal decisions to politicians, and Republicans are on a  mission to do just that.   Madam Speaker, my, my, my, their plans are getting crazier and more  extreme by the minute. Listen to this: National anti-abortion groups  and their allies, Republican allies in State legislatures, are scheming  to stop people in States where abortions are banned from seeking the  procedure elsewhere.   As we speak, there is a proposal in Missouri, a State that bans  abortion, that would allow private citizens to sue anyone that helps a  Missouri resident have an abortion in another State.   They are going to punish doctors, Uber drivers, spouses, and the rest  just for helping a woman who is getting the healthcare that she needs.  We stop that today.
