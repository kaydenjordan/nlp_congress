 Mr. President, I am grateful to join for a few moments  the cosponsors of this resolution--Senator Lee and Senator Sanders.   It is important to pick up on what Senator Lee was just putting  down--the notion that this is a limited resolution that speaks to our  participation in an unauthorized, illegal partnership with the Saudis  to bomb the country of Yemen. It does not affect our partnership with  Saudi Arabia and others in the gulf region to continue to confront  terror, to continue to confront al-Qaida--a specific carve-out in this  legislation that allows for 2001 AUMF authorized activities to go  forward.   It is also important to note that if you care about the priority of  taking on al-Qaida and taking on ISIS in the region, then you should  support debating our resolution because all of the evidence suggests  that the continuation of this civil war inside Yemen is making ISIS and  AQAP, which is the arm of al-Qaida that has the clearest intentions of  attacking the homeland, both more powerful. The AQAP controls much more  territory inside Yemen than it did in the beginning of this civil war.   If you take the time to meet with Yemeni-Americans, they will tell  you that inside Yemen, this bombing campaign is not perceived as a  Saudi bombing campaign; it is perceived as a U.S.-Saudi bombing  campaign. What we are doing is radicalizing the Yemeni people against  the United States. Add to this the new information that suggests that  some of our partners in the coalition, although not directly working  with al-Qaida, are starting to arm some very unsavory Salafi militias  inside Yemen that are filled with the types of people--the types of  extremist individuals--who could take the training they have received  from the coalitions and the weapons they have received from the  coalitions and easily turn against the United States.   If you care about the mission against terrorism, then you should  support debating our resolution.   Just to recap the reasons we are here today, we need to have a debate  on the lack of authorization for military force because it is time for  Congress to step up and do our constitutional duty.   The administration wrote in its letter to us that we do not have the  authority as the U.S. Congress to weigh in on military activity that is  waged by the administration unless there are two armies firing at each  other on the ground in an area of conflict. That is the  administration's definition of ``hostilities,'' and admittedly that is  a definition that has been used by Democrats and Republicans. This is  not exclusive to the Trump administration. The problem with that is  that it would allow for the United States, through Executive decision  only, to wage an air campaign against a country that wipes it out  without there being any say from the U.S. Congress.   Clearly, what is happening in Yemen today meets the definition of  ``hostilities.'' We have shown pictures on this floor before of entire  cities that have been wiped out. More than 10,000 civilians have been  killed in the largest outbreak of cholera in the history of the world  in terms of what we have recorded. Those are hostilities, and the  United States is clearly engaging in those hostilities because we are  helping with targeting and refueling the planes that are supplying the  munitions. If we cede to unlimited Executive authority with respect to  this engagement, there will be no end to that.   Lastly, let me speak to what is happening on the ground. There is  zero evidence that U.S. participation in this coalition has made things  better. Civilian casualties are not getting better. The day after  Christmas, over 60 civilians were killed in a series of airstrikes.  Reports are that last month, the Saudis engaged once again in something  called double tapping, by which they targeted an area in which  civilians lived, waited for the emergency responders to arrive, and  then hit again--something that is not allowed by international  humanitarian law. The humanitarian catastrophe itself is getting worse,  not better.   Maybe most important is that the battle lines inside Yemen are not  changing. The Saudis have been telling us for years: Stick with us. If  you keep on helping us bomb the Yemeni people, we will win this war. We  will get back control of Hudayda and of Sana'a.   That is not happening. At the beginning of this war, the Houthis  controlled about 70 percent of the population inside Yemen. Today, the  Houthis control about 70 percent of the population inside Yemen. If we  continue to support this bombing campaign, nothing will change except  that more people will die, except that more civilians will be hit by  the bombs we help to drop, except that al-Qaida will continue to  control big portions of that country.   While Senator Lee notes that this resolution is actually not on the  merits of our engagement there and that it is whether we have the legal  justification to be there, let's admit that if you do consider the  merits, other than backing the play of our historic ally, there is  nothing to suggest that our participation there is making things better  rather than worse.   I yield to Senator Sanders.    By voting to table the consideration of this resolution,  you are voting to stop a debate, a conversation, from happening in the  Senate about whether proper authorization exists.   Let's be honest about what this first vote is. This first vote is, do  we want to talk about whether there is authorization to perpetuate this  war? By voting to stop debate, by voting to table this motion and  refrain from proceeding to a conversation about this topic, we are, in  a very clear way, signaling to the administration and to the American  public that we are not interested in exercising our article I authority  on the issue of war-making.    It sends a very clear signal to the administration that  we are not interested in even having a debate here about complicated  questions of legal authority for serious military engagements overseas.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators  Coons, Cardin, Lee, Sanders, and I be recognized for up to 5 minutes  each and then Senator Corker be recognized for up to 15 minutes prior  to the vote.    I thank the Presiding Officer.   Mr. President, I just returned from a trip to a major transatlantic  conference in Europe. While the Europeans have spent a lot of time over  the course of the last 12 months hand-wringing about whether the United  States is committed to Europe, committed to NATO, committed to our  common defense, my feeling upon going to Brussels for this particular  conference is, they are kind of over the hand-wringing. They are now  just making plans to move on without us. They are making plans to  protect themselves without us. They are making plans to set the rules  of the road economically, politically, and culturally around the world  without the United States. The evidence of that was very clear.   The Europeans are setting up something called the European Defense  Initiative, in which they are going to start doing military planning  and purchasing outside of NATO because they are just not convinced, not  confident that the United States is going to be seriously engaged in  NATO. That compromises our security as the Europeans start to make  plans for their defense without us, even though we still have an  obligation under the treaty to protect them.   Over and over, you see the world moving on as they watch this massive  withdrawal of America from the world. The President said at a rally in  Alabama a few months ago that the world is starting to respect the  United States of America again. That could not be further from the  truth. The Pew organization charts other countries' opinions of the  United States. It also charts whether other countries believe the  United States is going to act in the best interests of the world. The  numbers are, frankly, startling.   Of the 37 countries they surveyed, only two of them have higher  confidence in the United States under Trump than they did under Obama.  One is a rather statistically significant increase, that being Russia,  which by 42 percentage points is more confident that the United States  is going to act in that country's best interests. South Korea had 88  percent confidence under Obama and has 17 percent confidence under  Trump. Canada had 83 percent confidence under Obama and has 22 percent  confidence under Trump. Germany is 86 to 11. They have come to this  belief because, as my colleagues have mentioned, the Trump  administration had signaled its unwillingness to try to set a moral  tone for the world in the way that it budgets. The budget they  presented to us reduces accounts dedicated to countering Russian  aggression around its periphery by 63 percent. It is a clear telegraph  to Europe that they are on their own, that countries that are trying to  fight back against a country that wants to reestablish a new version of  the Soviet Empire will have no help from the United States.    In this budget, the National Endowment for Democracy is cut by $100  million. It is no secret that countries like Hungary and Poland are  starting to slip away from traditional democratic norms. Countries like  the Philippines are doing the same because there is not a moral force  here in the United States committing to bring them closer to the ideals  of participatory democracy.   There is a $1.6 billion cut in humanitarian aid, telling the rest of  the world: If you want to solve these enormous problems of humanitarian  catastrophe--famine and refugee displacement--you can't look to us  anymore. You are on your own again.   There is a 35-percent cut in overall international narcotics and law  enforcement funding, just at a time when record amounts of fentanyl are  finding their way into the United States.   The moment of panic is over for the world. They have watched this  administration walk away from its traditional obligations to try to  stand up for the rule of law, to try to promote democracy and human  rights, and to try to protect America's interests and our allies. They  are simply making other plans. I hope the next administration will be  able to correct that, but those plans are hard to break once they are  made.   I hope Republicans and Democrats will stand up to make sure that  America does not become any weaker in the world than it already is  today, 15 months into this administration. We are less safe as a nation  because of this wholesale withdrawal from the global stage. It is not  too late to try to turn it around.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, today I wish to honor the life and legacy  of a World War II hero: Lt. Rev. Thomas M. Conway, born April 5, 1908,  in Waterbury, CT. Father Conway, who was born 110 years ago next month,  was an American hero who, after the sinking of the USS Indianapolis,  went from lifeboat to lifeboat in shark-infested waters to care for his  fellow sailors in a manner far above the call of duty.   The courage of the brave men who served on the USS Indianapolis, who  delivered critical parts to the first atomic bomb used in combat,  helped bring about the end of World War II. After their mission was  complete, they were intercepted on their way to join with the rest of  the Pacific fleet for the invasion of mainland Japan. Two torpedoes  from a Japanese submarine struck the Indianapolis on July 30, 1945,  sinking the battleship and immediately killing 300 of the 1,196 sailors  aboard. The remaining 900 sailors were left to fend for their lives in  the shark-infested Pacific, spending 3 days with few lifeboats or  supplies and no way to notify the Navy of their peril.   Father Conway, as chaplain, disregarded his own safety by swimming  back and forth among the men, administering aid, helping to gather  those who had drifted from the mass of survivors, and continuing to  minister and organize group prayers. His heroism gave comfort to the  dying and helped save the lives of the 321 sailors who were rescued  from the sea. Father Conway's acts of bravery took a physical toll, and  he succumbed to the elements shortly before rescuers arrived. As one  surviving sailor said of Father Conway, ``He was the most visible  person keeping the men together, giving them hope and sacrificing  himself to keep his fellow sailors united, calm, and alert.''   The legacy of Father Conway continues to inspire his family, fellow  sailors, and the people of Connecticut. That is why next month, in  recognition of his birthday, we pause to reflect upon and celebrate his  courageous actions. His selflessness and bravery are the epitome of an  American hero.                            ____________________
