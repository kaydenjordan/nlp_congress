 Madam Speaker, as a North Carolinian  and member of the Science, Space, and Technology Committee, I take  great joy today in rising to recognize United States astronaut  Christina Koch.   Christina grew up in eastern North Carolina in Jacksonville and  graduated from the prestigious North Carolina School of Science and  Mathematics. She later earned her bachelor's and master's degrees from  N.C. State.   On December 28, 2019, Christina set the record for the longest  continuous spaceflight by a female. She surpassed the previous record  of 288 days achieved by fellow astronaut Peggy Whitson. She is now at  300 days and counting. In addition, Christina participated in the first  all-female space walk on October 18 alongside fellow astronaut Jessica  Meir.   She is, without a doubt, one of the most accomplished people in North  Carolina's history. Christina has made her country, her State, and all  of eastern North Carolina proud. I wish her luck on her continuous  voyage amongst the stars. We look forward to her safe return to Earth  in February.                            ____________________
