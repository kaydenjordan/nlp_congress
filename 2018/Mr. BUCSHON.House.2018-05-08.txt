 Mr. Speaker, it is with a heavy heart that I rise today  to honor the life and service of Officer Robert Shawn Pitts of Terre  Haute Police Department, who was killed in the line of duty on Friday,  May 4, 2018.   Officer Pitts was born in Vincennes, Indiana, and dedicated his life  to the security and protection of his community. He proudly served with  the Terre Haute Police Department for the past 16 years and with the  Sullivan Police Department for 6 years prior to joining the force in  Terre Haute. He was also a member of the Special Response Team and the  U.S. Marshals Task Force.   I want to extend my deepest sympathies and condolences to the family  and friends of Officer Pitts, especially his three children: Brooke,  Austin, and Dakota.   Law enforcement personnel across this country go to work every day to  serve and protect our communities. These brave men and women risk  everything to keep our cities and our families safe and secure. Events  like these are somber reminders of what heroes who stand on the thin  blue line and their families sacrifice on our behalf.                            ____________________
