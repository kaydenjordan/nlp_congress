 Madam Speaker, Members of Congress have a solemn duty  to work to keep our Nation safe, secure, and more prosperous than it  was yesterday. We are expected to analyze sensitive information to gain  a more in-depth understanding of the needs of the American people and  the threats our country faces on a daily basis.   That role is even more consequential for the members of the  Intelligence Committee, who are entrusted with the privileged  information that other Members cannot access. You would expect them to  focus day and night on securing our Nation and promoting our national  security priorities abroad, but that has not been the case in this  Congress.   Under the Democratic majority, the most basic responsibilities of the  committee have been neglected. Instead, the House Intelligence  Committee is using its time and resources to run a sham impeachment  inquiry in secret.   Members of this Chamber will be asked to take one of the gravest  votes a Member could take before seeing a single transcript from a  witness deposition. The information Members and the public hear is  incomplete or intentionally distorted by selective leaks.   Madam Speaker, at what cost does this impeachment effort come?   As Democrats push forward with this sham partisan process, our Nation  is losing its intelligence edge around the world, particularly against  China. Not only are there significant intelligence gaps in order to  accurately assess the Chinese threat, the Chinese are actually ahead of  us when it comes to technological capabilities that are critical to  national security.   The Intelligence Committee's members are uniquely qualified to  formulate our Nation's response, but they cannot address these  challenges because of the committee's continued distraction over  impeachment.   The larger issue goes beyond what the Democrats are doing in one  committee. It is what they have failed to do as a majority. Their trend  of inaction strikes at home.   They have failed to swiftly pass the United States-Mexico-Canada  Agreement. In fact, they voted to prioritize impeachment over it  earlier today.   They have failed to address surprise medical billing.   They have failed to secure our border or reform our crumbling  infrastructure.   They have failed to lower prescription drug prices in a bipartisan  way.   The House Democrats are failing to pass appropriations bills that  would end the continuing resolution and fund the government. As a  result, pay increases for our troops, disaster recovery funds, and NIH  medical research funding are all at a stalemate.   Each of these failures represent an enormous opportunity cost for the  American people.   Democrats have chosen impeachment over getting anything done, even  though they previously warned of that exact problem.   In August, Congresswoman Slotkin said: ``People in my district are  wanting us to pass bills, and they fear that if we go down this path of  impeachment, we're not going to be working on the things that affect  their lives, their pocketbooks, and their kids.''   In September, Congressman Max Rose said: ``Impeachment will not fix  our roads and bridges or lower the cost of drugs. . . . The truth is  impeachment will only tear our country further apart, and we will see  no progress on the enormous challenges we face as a nation.''   Democrats said their majority would be different. They promised the  American public, if they entrusted them with the majority, they would  act differently, that they would put people before politics.   Madam Speaker, in the polls we see today, more people can tell you  about the investigations but can't tell you anything that has been  accomplished. They have broken their promise to solve problems, work  for all Americans, and focus on passing legislation.   Madam Speaker, there are 22 legislative days left on the calendar-- 22. In that brief time, we have a lot of work to do, but we cannot  fulfill our responsibilities if Members in this Chamber continue to  turn their backs on the promise they made when their constituents sent  them to Washington.   Madam Speaker, how much money was spent? How many ads were made? And  how many promises were given that this majority would be different, how  many things they said they would accomplish?   And how much time have they wasted? We are 13 months from an  election, but we have not accomplished a thing.   We are better than this.   Madam Speaker, if you only listened to what Members on the other side  of the aisle said just in August and September, before the political  pressure forced them to change their mind.   Madam Speaker, if the Speaker had only waited 48 hours, we would not  put America through another nightmare. We would not break the fabric of  democracy of this Nation.   Madam Speaker, this is the people's House. We have got 22 more days.  We ask that you keep the promise you made to the American public and  you stop this sham of an impeachment you call.                            ____________________
