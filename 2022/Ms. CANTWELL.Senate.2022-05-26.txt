 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I come to the floor to talk about  developments this week in trying to fight to make sure that American  consumers aren't paying artificially more for gas to fill up their cars  and trucks and take a vacation for the holiday than they should be  paying.   This is an important issue for everybody in the United States but  particularly my constituents, who all throughout the State of  Washington are paying--well, Seattle, definitely over $5, and many  other parts of the State over $5. And if you are not paying more than  $5 a gallon, you are paying very close to $5 a gallon. So it is  important that Members of Congress do their job in oversight and  policing of these markets to make sure that there is transparency; that  is, a bright light to make sure that no one is taking advantage during  this tight supply and artificially driving up that price for their  benefit.   That is why we introduced the Transportation Fuel Market Transparency  Act that asked the Federal Trade Commission to expand on authority  Congress already gave to them to police transportation petroleum  markets and make sure that the trading that is done on indexes that  have very little oversight--very little oversight--that those indexes  have a brighter light shined on them so that we make sure consumers  aren't being gouged because of the kinds of practices that happen.   Well, lo and behold, just this Tuesday, the Federal Government and  the Department of Justice and the CFTC--the Commodities Futures Trading  Commission--basically gave a statement on the largest settlement in  history, a civil monetary penalty and disgorgement exceeding $1.1  billion on Glencore, one of the largest commodity trading firms.   It is a major participant in the global, physical oil and oil  derivatives market, and for more than a decade, it engaged in a wide- ranging scheme to manipulate oil markets--schemes to defraud other  market participants by manipulating the information going to financial  markets, schemes that created artificially high benchmarks so that  Glencore's derivatives and physical positions would settle or price at  levels more favorable to the company.   (Ms. CORTEZ MASTO assumed the Chair.)   These were some of the same practices that are were uncovered during  the Enron scheme. I know the Presiding Officer knows because she comes  from the State of Nevada, and two of the areas most hard hit by the  electricity crisis were the State of Washington and the State of  Nevada. Why? Because people wanted us to continue to pay on fraudulent  electricity pricing.   That is why we fought, along with the Presiding Officer's predecessor  and others, to make sure that electricity markets were properly policed  for any kind of manipulative practices.   I am very proud that we authored legislation after that scandal that  really has given the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission the tools it  needed on electricity and natural gas.   They, to this date, since 2007, have used that authority to police  electricity and natural gas and have had over a $1 billion of fines and  settlements against companies and their bad practices.   These are the same sort of practices that we are uncovering now in  the commodities market and on oil market manipulation.   I know my colleagues on the other side of the aisle would like to  pretend that this issue doesn't exist. I ask them, go home and face  your constituents and tell them you voted to do nothing--nothing--to  bring more transparency into the gas markets that are affecting them  today and see what their reaction is. I guarantee you they are paying  too much at the pump, and they want to know that we are properly  policing these markets.   They get the dilemma that we are in, particularly given Russia and  Ukraine. They get the issues of a changing economy coming out of COVID.  But they are madder than heck when they read about some company that  has been doing this practice for decades and basically making money off  of the back of their hard earnings.   Consumers could pay as much as $1,000 more for gas this year. They  want to know why. This company raked in over $320 million in improper  gains. And while some of the record settlement involved penalties for  bribes and kickbacks in foreign countries, the company agreed to pay  $485 million in settlements for criminal and civil investigations for  various fuel oil prices.   Various fuel oil products that were manipulated and impacted included  Los Angeles and their Bunker Fuel Oil, New York Harbor Low Sulfur Fuel  Oil, New York Harbor High Sulfur Fuel, and U.S. Gulf Coast High Sulfur  Fuel Oil.   I am not sure how much consumers ended up getting fleeced, but it is  clear that at least hundreds of millions of dollars impacted these  markets.    And as the Presiding Officer knows, because she has been the chief  law enforcement for her State, if you don't have a policeman on the  beat policing these markets, more of these fraudulent activities will  exist.   After the derivative crisis, I also made sure that anti-manipulation  authority went to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. When we  called recently to ask about their use of this authority, they told us  they had put fines and penalties against companies at over $4.5  billion. That was before Tuesday's announcement of clear oil market  manipulation.   Some of my colleagues, as we push this transparency bill through the  Commerce Committee, said: Why, if they caught some people on Tuesday,  [[Page S2728]]  do we need to mark something up on Wednesday? Well, the issue is that  we were talking about the futures market. As I just read, these  companies are very adept at manipulating the futures market and the  physical market to get their best gain. We are asking our colleagues to  vote for transparency in the physical market of indexes traded after  the product is refined.   We know that there is a world oil price. We know that it is refined.  But what we can't figure out is, after it is refined, why--particularly  on the West Coast--is it at exorbitant rates, well over the national  average and paying well over what we think market fundamentals  determine?   We saw, at a hearing that we had before the Commerce Committee,  energy experts testify that some of these fundamentals do not make  sense; that something else is going on in the market. So why turn down  the opportunity for us, as a Federal Government, to get more  transparency in these energy markets? Why would anybody want to say  that more transparency over these indexes is not a good idea?   Well, some of our colleagues--I am not sure, because they offered no  substantive amendments to the legislation before us. In fact, those  that were, what I would say, some improvements around the edges to the  bill, we actually accepted in committee. The rest of the amendments  offered were all about the issues and discussions of more supply, which  were out of the jurisdiction of our committee, and I encouraged my  colleagues to take them up on the Senate floor.   So no substantive changes were offered to this legislation. Nobody  objected on the basis of the idea that transparency is a bad idea. And  yet people are holding on to an idea that they don't want to answer  about this issue of manipulation.   Trust me, I was shocked when I was elected to the U.S. Senate, before  I was even sworn in, to find out that we were in an energy crisis; that  somehow the price of electricity had gone from some of the cheapest in  the United States to the most exorbitant price ever, 3,000 times the  rate. I thought this couldn't possibly be a scheme. This couldn't  possibly be something perpetrated because, obviously, we would catch  that. Obviously, we have a policeman on the beat. Well, it turned out  that the California market, what is called the ISO, really wasn't  catching it, and there really was manipulation by Enron.   Enron manipulated the supply of electricity by cooking up various  schemes to move supply out of California to create artificial shortages  and then drive up the price of electricity. They had traders who lied  on the phone to people buying long-term contracts, telling them: Buy  the long-term contract because the price is going up. And an analyst  saying to a trader, and the trader replying back: That is not true. And  the analyst saying: Tell them anyway. That is the kind of thing that we  need to police.   So I was shocked to find that one of my first tasks being a U.S.  Senator was going to be to spend 2 years policing electricity just so  my State and the State of Nevada would not pay on fraudulent contracts  for more than a decade.   I guarantee you, not only would the lights in Vegas have gone out,  but much of the Washington economy would have been affected.   This is so important now because these high gas prices are affecting  every sector of transportation. It is affecting our airline economy. It  is affecting our trucking economy. I have heard from our railroads on  the diesel engine prices. It is affecting every part of our economy  while we have to pay more.   And even if it is 50 cents--as one of the witnesses testified, it may  be as much as 50 cents a gallon that is artificially being put onto the  consumers--why would you not want to know the answer and simply give  the Federal Trade Commission the authority to make sure that these  markets are properly policed for unfair and deceptive practices?   I know my colleague who is presiding knows because we have even had  suggestions from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission that the  practice is so bad among energy traders that we should consider  legislation to ban energy traders who continue to perpetrate these  schemes. That is right, they go from one company to another company.  They know how the schemes work. They think it is just the price of  doing business. Even if they get caught, they will just pay the fine,  like Glencore is paying now.    If you think about it, this $1.1 billion is one of the largest oil  market manipulation cases ever. People probably aren't hearing about it  this week because of other stories that are in the news. But trust me,  this kind of behavior needs to be rooted out.   So, Madam President, I hope that when my colleagues return, I hope  that they will spend the recess asking their constituents whether they  think there needs to be more transparency in oil markets. I will be  very surprised if they don't say that something is going on, and we  want to know what it is. That is because consumers have felt for a long  time a disconnection between market fundamentals of supply and demand.   And, yes, there have been some changes in supply as it relates to  what we are facing on an international basis. My constituents  understand that. But we have always been an isolated market in the  Pacific Northwest for refineries in my State, most of the supply coming  from Alaska. And yet we pay the highest prices in the Nation. So our  constituents want to know why.   My colleagues, Senator Wyden, Senator Feinstein, and I have  prosecuted these issues. We have asked for more information and  transparency. In both instances, when we were successful with  electricity and natural gas, we did find behavior that needed to be  rooted out. And here, we have proof now in this Glencore case that  there is manipulation in oil markets. We are simply asking that, just  don't leave it to the futures market, because if you want to give law  enforcement, the Department of Justice, our attorneys general, others,  the tools to root out bad behavior--even if it is 5 cents a gallon, it  is worth fighting for. Even if it is a few cents more to uncover and  drive down the cost, it is worth it to our constituents, who are paying  exorbitant prices.   Let's make sure everybody understands in a tight supply, it is a lot  easier to do manipulation, and that is why we need to get this done  now.   I wish that the authority that we had given to the Federal Trade  Commission on this issue in 2007 would have been used, but the point  is, you actually have to have people and the information to prosecute  these cases.   My colleagues at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission built such  a unit. That unit, as I said, has been successful in monitoring  electricity and natural gas. I hope that they will emulate what the  Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has done.   I am proud that the CFTC and our Attorney General, Merrick Garland,  made this announcement on Tuesday of this unbelievable manipulation, of  bribery, of schemes, of all of the work that goes behind the scenes for  people to make billions of dollars of profits when we and our consumers  are being gouged with extra prices.   Let's find the answers. Let's do something as basic as passing a law  about transparency on a product--petroleum--that is so critical to our  economy.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print the  attached letter in the Record.
