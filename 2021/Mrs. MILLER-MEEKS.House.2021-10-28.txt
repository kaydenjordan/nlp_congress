 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize a group  of people from my hometown of Ottumwa for taking part in a great event  for an even greater cause.   On October 23, 37 teams, comprised of 170 participants, took part in  the 2021 Walk to End Alzheimer's in my hometown of Ottumwa.   The annual walk, led by the Alzheimer's Association, is held in over  600 communities across the United States to raise funds for research  and to raise awareness for the disease that over 5.8 million Americans  currently live with, as did my mother prior to her death.   This year, I am proud to announce that the Walk to End Alzheimer's in  Ottumwa has raised $27,636 thus far, with donations still coming in,  exceeding their initial goal of $26,000.   Thank you to the residents of Ottumwa and the over 600 communities  across the United States who have stepped up and stepped forward to put  an end to this debilitating disease.                            ____________________
