 Mr. President, today I recognize the Florida State  University Women's soccer team on securing its second NCAA National  Championship, becoming one of six schools in NCAA women's soccer  history to win multiple championships. Head coach Mark Krikorian led  the Florida State team to the 2018 College Cup for the ninth time in  his 14 seasons at Florida State, including four appearances in the  national championship game. FSU defeated each of the last three  national champions in the 2018 tournament on the way to the title,  delivering a stunning end to Stanford University's 45-match unbeaten  streak in the semifinal game. In the championship game against the  University of North Carolina, Dallas Dorosy scored the game's only goal  on a pass from Deyna Castellanos, in the 60th minute. This NCAA title  complements the team's 2018 Atlantic Coast Conference championship win,  the sixth in the past 8 years.   I extend warm congratulations on their hard-earned national  championship to players Caroline Jeffers, Megan Connolly, Kristina  Lynch, Anna Patten, Jaelin Howell, Dallas Dorosy, Kirsten Pavlisko,  Deyna Castellanos, Gloriana Villalobos, Kaycie Tillman, Taylor Hallmon,  Natalia Kuikka, Olivia Bergau, Gabby Carle, Malia Berkley, Macayla  Edwards, Kristen McFarland, Alexa Orrante, Bella Dorosy, Makala Thomas,  Emily Madril, Clara Robbins, Yujie Zhao, and Brooke Bollinger, as well  as head coach Mark Krikorian, assistant coach Mike Bristol, assistant  coach Morinao Imaizumi, and director of operations Nathan  Minion.                            ____________________
