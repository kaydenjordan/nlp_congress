 Madam Speaker, I rise to wish a happy retirement to Kirkley  Thomas, the vice president of government affairs for Arkansas Electric  Cooperatives, Inc.   Early in his career, Kirkley served as a professional staff member in  the United States Senate and subsequently worked for the Arkansas  Economic Development Commission. Mr. Thomas accepted his leadership  post at Arkansas Electric Cooperatives and served for 8\1/2\ years.   His service to our State and his contributions to the important  progress in building badly needed infrastructure for power and  broadband services is deeply appreciated. Our families have benefited  by his leadership.   Madam Speaker, I thank Kirkley Thomas for his years of service, and I  wish him a very happy retirement.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank my good friend from East Texas,  Judge Gohmert, with whom I have had such a great association over these  past several years and thank him for his leadership in this people's  House.   Madam Speaker, I rise to honor the life of a Vietnam veteran and  leader in our Arkansas community, R.D. Kinsey, a great personal friend  of mine, taken too suddenly last week.   Following Kinsey's honorable discharge from the United States Air  Force, he worked to serve his fellow Vietnam-era veterans by working  alongside them and the VA to ensure that those heroes could obtain the  benefits they had earned during their time in service.   Over time, R.D.'s mission expanded, and he worked with local veterans  and their families to ensure that they had the healthcare and benefits  that they had rightfully earned. R.D. dedicated his life to his fellow  service heroes.   In 2004, R.D. worked to establish the Michael Vann Johnson, Jr.,  American Legion Post 74 of North Little Rock, Arkansas, where he held  the commander position for 14 years. Under his leadership, Post 74  became known for their tremendous work in assisting veterans across the  State. Let me say personally, no one was more shipshape than Post 74.   In 2018, R.D. became the first African-American State commander in  the history of the Department of Arkansas  [[Page H6668]]  when he assumed the leadership of the American Legion's command for  that 1-year term.   While serving in this capacity, R.D. led nearly 15,000 Arkansas  military veterans and their families in serving God and country.   Up until R.D.'s passing, he served the National Legislative  Commission, presenting the National American Legion's agenda to the  United States Congress on behalf of our Nation's beloved veterans.   R.D. dedicated his life to those veterans and to their families.   My sincerest condolences go out to his wife of 37 years, Dianna; his  daughters, Meredith and Allison; and all who were honored to know him  and call him a friend.   R.D. and his life of service had a profound impact on me, our  veterans, our State, and I am honored to recognize him here today on  the floor of the people's House.                       Congratulating Colonel Nate Todd     Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Colonel Nate  Todd, who currently serves as the Secretary of the Arkansas Department  of Veterans Affairs, on his recent appointment to the University of  Arkansas Board of Trustees.   Todd's history of service began as a student at Pine Bluff High  School, where Nate was a member of the Junior Air Force ROTC unit  there.   He would go on to graduate from the University of Arkansas with a  Bachelor of Science degree in industrial technology and a master's  degree from Baylor University. Other achievements include a Chief  Financial Officer Leadership Certification from the National Defense  University and graduation from the Executive Medical Leadership Course  at George Washington University.   Today, Todd is a 37-year veteran of the Army and Army Reserve where  he has served as the director of Health Financial Policy with the U.S.  Army Surgeon General and chief financial officer for Walter Reed Army  Medical Center in Washington.   Those familiar with Colonel Todd's leadership know of his decades- long devotion to the service of Arkansas and our Nation. Most recently,  he has served at the appointment of Governor Asa Hutchinson as our  State's Veterans Affairs Department head since early 2017.   The students, faculty, and broader community of the University of  Arkansas system will benefit from the knowledge, experience, and  integrity that Colonel Todd brings in this new role.   Congratulations to Colonel Nate Todd. I congratulate him for his  continued service to the people of Arkansas.                        The Continuing War in Ukraine     Madam Speaker, today is the 141st day since Putin commenced  his illegal, brutal invasion of Ukraine. Vladimir Putin continues to  direct his gang of thugs to target Ukrainian civilians.   We have seen this play from Czar Putin before, with the mass murder  of 25,000 souls in Grozny and the leveling of biblical Aleppo.   To date, the United Nations High Commission has verified nearly  12,000 civilian casualties across Ukraine since February. This number  is understated.   In the words of Nazar Havryliuk, a 17-year-old from Bucha: ``They  were not able to defeat our Army, so they killed ordinary people.''   Both his uncle and father, innocent civilians, were murdered by  Putin's invading Army.   Russian military strikes continue to target Ukrainian resources,  including grain storehouses responsible for feeding over 400 million  people worldwide. The World Food Programme estimates that 47 million  people across the globe are suffering from acute hunger as a direct  result of Putin's targeting of Ukrainian stores.   Since February, almost 2,300 schools, Madam Speaker, have been  damaged or destroyed, and 290 healthcare facilities have been attacked.  No place in Ukraine is safe for civilians.   Currently, 12.1 million people in Ukraine are estimated to need  health assistance. That is 12 million individuals who are unable to get  the help they need, the help they deserve, all due to Putin's invasion.   Madam Speaker, as my friend from Wisconsin just told this House,  leadership from the United States is essential now more than ever.  President Biden must step up and ensure that Ukraine has the lethal  weapons and supplies to achieve a prompt and decisive victory over the  invaders.    Only America's President can stand in the breach and lead. That  leadership of our transatlantic partners and our critical allies, like  Japan, are essential, essential in assisting the Europeans in crafting  help for the people of Ukraine, including supporting humanitarian and  critical and necessary and essential military support.   The United States can support Ukraine directly also by supporting the  U.N. Secretary General's efforts to open the Black Sea. It is essential  that safely exporting Ukrainian grain, currently trapped, is a must-do.  The world is waiting for that grain. The world is starving without it.  Helping alleviate that hunger crisis requires American leadership.   While Putin's puppets are in Istanbul sitting at a table talking  about opening the Black Sea, his military is systematically bombing and  burning all the fields of wheat across Ukraine.   America must also lead in planning for reconstruction in Ukraine once  the invader has been ejected.   We must also hold Putin and his cronies accountable for the war  crimes that they are committing daily in Ukraine. The targeting of  schools, hospitals, places of worship, and civilians is unacceptable,  illegal, and immoral. Russian leaders will be held accountable.   I was pleased to see the National Defense Authorization Act continued  to set that out as a basic tenet of American foreign policy, that we  will hold these war criminals accountable.   I will continue to voice my support for the brave people in Ukraine  fighting against an illegal invasion to protect their homeland, their  freedom, and their sovereignty.   I urge all my colleagues to join me in working to craft the right way  to support those Ukrainians in the distribution of needed resources  worldwide and holding the Russian leaders accountable for their crimes.  This we must do, and this House must lead. Again, I must close, Madam  Speaker, by saying it is American leadership that unites the world that  can eject Putin from Ukraine.   Madam Speaker, I thank my friend from Texas, and I am grateful for  the time.
