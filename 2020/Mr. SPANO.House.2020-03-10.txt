 Madam Speaker, today I rise to congratulate my friend,  colleague, and fellow Brandon High School alum, Congressman Mark  Meadows, on his appointment to be the next White House Chief of Staff.   Like myself, Congressman Meadows grew up in Brandon, Florida, and  also, like me, spent time at Florida State University and also is an  alum of the University of South Florida. Go Bulls.   As a longtime Representative from North Carolina, he has boldly  served his State and country with pride and honor. There is no doubt  that his constituents have been fortunate to have him as their voice in  Congress.   His legacy will be one of relentlessly fighting for the American  people and the American Dream while working tirelessly to pass and  strengthen conservative policies.   Representative Meadows' resilience, passion, humor, and patriotism  will be missed in committee hearings and on the House floor. However, I  am confident that he will continue to display the same character and  fight for these same values at the White House and always provide our  President his best counsel.   Again, congratulations on your new position, Mark. I know you will  continue to make our Nation proud.                            ____________________
