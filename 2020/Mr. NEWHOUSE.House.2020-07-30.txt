 Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the career of Anita  Monoian, the president and CEO of Yakima Neighborhood Health Services,  who announced her retirement after 41 years of tireless service and  advocacy.   At a time when community health is of the utmost importance, it is a  privilege to honor an individual who has spent her life's work  advocating for the care and well-being of the people of Yakima Valley.   Anita describes her career's work as a labor of love. With that  labor, Anita expanded the scope of Yakima Neighborhood Health Services  from a single clinic to 10 clinics across the Yakima Valley, reaching  92,000 patients, annually.   Anita's voice has influenced State and Federal healthcare policy  through her work on the board of the National Association of Community  Health Centers and the Washington Association of Community and Migrant  Health Centers.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to recognize Anita's legacy of improving  healthcare in central Washington, and I urge my colleagues to join in  me in congratulating her on an impactful career of service.                         Recognizing Dr. James Irwin     Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the life of one of  central Washington's American heroes, James Irwin.   Dr. James Irwin served as chief of surgery at the U.S. Navy Hospital  in Oak Harbor, Washington. Following his service, Dr. Irwin treated  patients in north central Washington for 13 years before opening a  medical practice in Moses Lake. He was named chief medical officer of  Samaritan Healthcare and was an original member of the Moses Lake  Medical Team.   He and his wife, Frances, were active members in their church and  spent many years on medical missions across Africa, where he provided  surgical services and shared his knowledge with local doctors.   At age 62, Dr. Irwin, once again, answered his country's call. He  deployed to Iraq as a naval surgeon before retiring as a captain in  2004 with over 40 years of military service.   In central Washington, Dr. Irwin was known for his kind attitude  toward the patients he cared for. To his fellow brothers in arms, he  was known as a hero. He passed away on June 30, but he has left a  lasting legacy of providing care wherever it was needed.    Mr. Speaker, my prayers go out to his family and loved ones, and I  urge my colleagues to join me in honoring Dr. Irwin's life and service  to our country.               Remembering Brad Fisher of Kennewick, Washington     Mr. Speaker, Brad Fisher of Kennewick was a friend, a  businessman, and a passionate advocate for the Tri-Cities community.   A devoted husband, father, grandfather, and dedicated community  leader, Brad found endless ways to serve others. Over the years, he  served as a Rotarian, a city council member, the mayor of Kennewick,  and a member of numerous community service boards.   One of Brad's many contributions to his community was his role as a  fierce champion of local governance. He helped spearhead the  reconveyance effort in the Tri-Cities to return thousands of acres of  river shore land from the Federal Government and placed it back into  the hands of the local community. His work is not yet complete, but I  look forward to continuing his advocacy in accomplishing this effort to  improve our community.   Mr. Speaker, Brad Fisher is an example of the engaged and selfless  citizenship that we should all strive to emulate. May his family and  our community continue to be blessed by his memory, and may he rest in  peace.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, one in five households with a disabled family member  falls below the Federal poverty line. These families rely on home  healthcare providers who are often family members of the disabled to  care for them and to improve their quality of life. These providers  receive modest compensation for their efforts provided by dedicated  State Medicaid dollars.   For decades, Federal law has required that Medicaid providers be paid  directly and in full for the services they provide. However, some  States, including my own home State of Washington, have been  withholding union dues via payroll deductions from payments to  Medicaid-subsidized home caregivers. In many cases, this is done  without the knowledge or the consent of the caregiver, and it is in  clear violation of the law.   Now, this is no small problem. In 2017 alone, $150 million was  diverted to unions from Medicaid payments to 350,000 caregivers.  Fortunately, last year, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services  finalized a rule to stop this predatory practice that takes money out  of the pockets of in-home providers. However, language in the bill  would defund implementation of this rule and allow States to continue  to circumvent Federal law.   My amendment strikes section 245 of the bill to ensure that CMS can  enforce the law and protect home healthcare providers from having their  Medicaid payments diverted to third parties.   Mr. Speaker, let me be clear: Ending this illegal deduction does not  prevent caregivers from joining unions if they wish; rather, it  empowers them by giving them the choice to do so. My amendment gives  them that choice.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.
