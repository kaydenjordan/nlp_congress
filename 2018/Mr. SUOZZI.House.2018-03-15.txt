 Madam Speaker, I am here to welcome Father Elias to the  Chamber. He is from my hometown of the city of Glen Cove.   Father Elias, as was mentioned, is a canon regular of St. Augustine  from Klosterneuburg, Austria, and he and three of his colleagues from  Klosterneuburg have been assigned to my parish, St. Rocco's, and our  neighboring parish of St. Patrick's since 2011.   He is joined here today by his parents as well as his brother, who is  also a priest, Father Richard from Annandale, Virginia.  [[Page H1616]]    I just wanted to say that we are so honored to have him here today.  He has made such a dramatic difference in our community, along with his  colleagues, Father Daniel, Father Ambrose, and Father Gabriel; and a  great difference in my family's life as well.   We are so grateful to you for your service to our community and to  your faith, and to our faith, and for making such a difference in our  lives.                            ____________________
