 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  retirement of Donna McCloskey, a constituent of mine from Bristol  Borough, Bucks County, Pennsylvania, after a 42-year career of  community service as an employee of the Grundy Foundation. Starting in  1975, Donna worked at the Grundy Library, eventually assisting the  Grundy Foundation's executive director until Donna was appointed the  Grundy Museum administrator, a position which she held for the past 12  years.   As the museum administrator, Donna is credited with updating the  museum's strategic plan, creating best practices for all of the  museum's programs and services, and building up partnerships between  the museum and the community. Under Donna's leadership, the number of  visitors to the museum increased exponentially, and the 40th and 50th  anniversary events were great successes.   I want to express my deep gratitude and the gratitude of our entire  community for Donna's commitment to preserving the history of our  community. While her retirement is well deserved, her exit is already  felt.   Thank you, Donna.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman so much for all  the work he does on the committee and for bringing the bill to the  floor. I thank my colleague from Pennsylvania (Mr. Brendan F. Boyle)  for all of his work on this piece of legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to voice my full support for H.R. 1997, the  U.S.-Ukraine Cybersecurity Cooperation Act.   During my career as an FBI agent, I was assigned to the U.S. Embassy  in Kiev, Ukraine, where I worked closely with our Ukrainian  counterparts on a whole host of issues to include cybersecurity.   Mr. Speaker, one thing is clear: we must strengthen our relationship  with Ukraine wherever possible and by whatever means possible. They  have acted as a steadfast ally to the United States against a hostile  Russia.   Further, there should be no doubt that cybersecurity and cyber  warfare are the rising threats of our time. We have seen plenty of  occasions where bad actors--state-sponsored or otherwise--have executed  cyber attacks against private companies, government entities, and the  very institutions upon which our Nation was founded. These attacks will  only continue to increase both in sophistication and frequency as we  continue into the 21st century.  [[Page H759]]    Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues, Democratic and Republican  alike, to support this crucial and necessary piece of legislation both  for the United States and Ukraine, and for all our allies.   Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes  to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Deutch), who is someone who grew up  a strong Philadelphia sports fan.
