 Mr. Speaker, last year CNN reported that the  U.S. had interfered or attempted to influence presidential elections in  other countries at least 81 times. This is probably a very conservative  estimate.   This report came from a study by Professor Dov H. Levin of Carnegie  Mellon University and apparently was just the tip of the iceberg. His  study covered just years up to 2000, and these activities may have  increased since that time.   Professor Levin defined an intervention as ``a costly act which is  designed to determine the election results in favor of one of the two  sides.'' He said these acts were carried out in secret two-thirds of  the time and included ``funding the election campaigns of specific  parties, disseminating misinformation or propaganda, training locals of  only one side in various campaigning or public announcements on threats  in favor of or against a candidate, and providing or withdrawing  foreign aid.'' He reported that in 59 percent of these cases the side  that received assistance came to power.   In a December 21, 2016, article, the Los Angeles Times said: ``The  U.S. has a long history of attempting to influence presidential  elections in other countries.''                                time  1030    The newspaper reported, that ``the CIA has accused Russia of  interfering in the 2016 Presidential election by hacking into  Democratic and Republican computer networks and selectively releasing  emails.'' But the Times added: ``But critics might point out that the  U.S. has done similar things.''   I am not criticizing our government's activities in this regard. Some  of it has been good, designed to fight communism and promote freedom  around the world. However, some of it has probably been wasteful, and,  at times, has increased hatred for the U.S. We are involved, in many  ways, in almost every country around the world through our State  Department, Agency for International Development, the CIA, the Defense  Department, and just about every Federal department and agency. Most  countries take an active interest and involvement in U.S. Presidential  elections through their citizens and former citizens who now live in  this country.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record this article from the Los  Angeles Times.                [From the Los Angeles Times, Dec. 21, 2016]     The U.S. Is No Stranger to Interfering in the Elections of Other                                 Countries                             (By Nina Agrawal)         Update: President Obama on Thursday slapped Russia with new       penalties for meddling in the U.S. presidential election,       kicking out dozens of suspected spies and imposing banking       restrictions on five people and four organizations the       administration says were involved.        The CIA has accused Russia of interfering in the 2016       presidential election by hacking into Democratic and       Republican computer networks and selectively releasing       emails. But critics might point out the U.S. has done similar       things.        The U.S. has a long history of attempting to influence       presidential elections in other countries--it's done so as       many as 81 times between 1946 and 2000, according to a       database amassed by political scientist Dov Levin of Carnegie       Mellon University.        That number doesn't include military coups and regime       change efforts following the election of candidates the U.S.       didn't like, notably those in Iran, Guatemala and Chile. Nor       does it include general assistance with the electoral       process, such as election monitoring.        Levin defines intervention as ``a costly act which is       designed to determine the election results [in favor of] one       of the two sides.'' These acts, carried out in secret two-      thirds of the time, include funding the election campaigns of       specific parties, disseminating misinformation or propaganda,       training locals of only one side in various campaigning or       get-out-the-vote techniques, helping one side design their       campaign materials, making public pronouncements or threats       in favor of or against a candidate, and providing or       withdrawing foreign aid.        In 59 percent of these cases, the side that received       assistance came to power, although Levin estimates the       average effect of ``partisan electoral interventions'' to be       only about a 3 percent increase in vote share.        The U.S. hasn't been the only one trying to interfere in       other countries' elections, according to Levin's data. Russia       attempted to  [[Page H6269]]       sway 36 foreign elections from the end of World War II to the       turn of the century--meaning that, in total, at least one of       the two great powers of the 20th century intervened in about       1 of every 9 competitive, national-level executive elections       in that time period.        Italy's 1948 general election is an early example of a race       where U.S. actions probably influenced the outcome.        ``We threw everything, including the kitchen sink'' at       helping the Christian Democrats beat the Communists in Italy,       said Levin, including covertly delivering ``bags of money''       to cover campaign expenses, sending experts to help run the       campaign, subsidizing ``pork'' projects like land       reclamation, and threatening publicly to end U.S. aid to       Italy if the Communists were elected.        Levin said that U.S. intervention probably played an       important role in preventing a Communist Party victory, not       just in 1948, but in seven subsequent Italian elections.       Throughout the Cold War, U.S. involvement in foreign       elections was mainly motivated by the goal of containing       communism, said Thomas Carothers, a foreign policy expert at       the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. ``The U.S.       didn't want to see left-wing governments elected, and so it       did engage fairly often in trying to influence elections in       other countries,'' Carothers said.        This approach carried over into the immediate post-Soviet       period.        In the 1990 Nicaragua elections, the CIA leaked damaging       information on alleged corruption by the Marxist Sandinistas       to German newspapers, according to Levin. The opposition used       those reports against the Sandinista candidate, Daniel       Ortega. He lost to opposition candidate Violeta Chamorro.        In Czechoslovakia that same year, the U.S. provided       training and campaign funding to Vaclav Havel's party and its       Slovak affiliate as they planned for the country's first       democratic election after its transition away from communism.        ``The thinking was that we wanted to make sure communism       was dead and buried,'' said Levin.        Even after that, the U.S. continued trying to influence       elections in its favor.        In Haiti after the 1986 overthrow of dictator and U.S. ally       Jean-Claude ``Baby Doc'' Duvalier, the CIA sought to support       particular candidates and undermine Jean-Bertrande Aristide,       a Roman Catholic priest and proponent of liberation theology.       The New York Times reported in the 1990s that the CIA had on       its payroll members of the military junta that would       ultimately unseat Aristide after he was democratically       elected in a landslide over Marc Bazin, a former World Bank       official and finance minister favored by the U.S. The U.S.       also attempted to sway Russian elections.        In 1996, with the presidency of Boris Yeltsin and the       Russian economy flailing, President Clinton endorsed a $10.2-      billion loan from the International Monetary Fund linked to       privatization, trade liberalization and other measures that       would move Russia toward a capitalist economy. Yeltsin used       the loan to bolster his popular support, telling voters that       only he had the reformist credentials to secure such loans,       according to media reports at the time. He used the money, in       part, for social spending before the election, including       payment of back wages and pensions.        In the Middle East, the U.S. has aimed to bolster       candidates who could further the Israeli-Palestinian peace       process. In 1996, seeking to fulfill the legacy of       assassinated Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and the       peace accords the U.S. brokered, Clinton openly supported       Shimon Peres, convening a peace summit in the Egyptian resort       of Sharm el Sheik to boost his popular support and inviting       him to a meeting at the White House a month before the       election.        ``We were persuaded that if [Likud candidate Benjamin]       Netanyahu were elected, the peace process would be closed for       the season,'' said Aaron David Miller, who worked at the       State Department at the time.        In 1999, in a more subtle effort to sway the election, top       Clinton strategists, including James Carville, were sent to       advise Labor candidate Ehud Barak in the election against       Netanyahu.        In Yugoslavia, the U.S. and NATO had long sought to cut off       Serbian nationalist and Yugoslav leader Slobodan Milosevic       from the international system through economic sanctions and       military action. In 2000, the U.S. spent millions of dollars       in aid for political parties, campaign costs and independent       media. Funding and broadcast equipment provided to the media       arms of the opposition were a decisive factor in electing       opposition candidate Vojislav Kostunica as Yugoslav       president, according to Levin. ``If it wouldn't have been for       overt intervention . . . Milosevic would have been very       likely to have won another term,'' he said.                      Supporting Congressman  Jim Jordan     Mr. Speaker, there is greater turnover in  elective offices today than ever before. And in my 30 years in  Congress, I have now served with almost 1,500 other Members. Almost all  have been good, kind men and women. But one of the best, one of the  kindest is my friend,  Jim Jordan.   Now, Congressman Jordan has been attacked with one of the dirtiest,  most low-down political hit jobs that I have ever seen. He has been  accused of knowing about, but failing to report, sexual abuse that  occurred 25 to 30 years ago. This alleged abuse was done not by Mr.  Jordan but by another man, a team doctor, who has been dead for 13  years. And this abuse was not done to little boys or girls. It was  supposedly done to grown adult men, Ohio State wrestlers, none of whom  reported it at the time.   The timing is so suspicious coming out now when Mr. Jordan may be  seeking a leadership post. He is supposed to have known about this  because of locker-room banter.   All the coaches and many of his players have defended Mr. Jordan,  calling him one of the most honest men they know. Surely, Mr. Speaker,  even though politics of hatred is prevalent today, surely we are not  going to stoop to convicting people based on locker-room banter or  gossip.                            ____________________
