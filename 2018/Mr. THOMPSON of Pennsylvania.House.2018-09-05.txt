 Mr. Speaker, the USO was on Capitol  Hill earlier today for a service project where volunteers assembled  care packages for spouses of servicemembers who are currently deployed.   In May, the USO kicked off the Salute to Military Spouses, a 6-month  spotlight on the contributions and challenges of our military spouses.  This campaign aims to raise public awareness of these unsung heroes.   The USO strengthens America's military servicemembers by keeping them  connected to family, home, and country through their service to the  Nation. For more than 75 years, the USO has been by the side of  America's military servicemembers and their families, too.   There are USO centers at or near military installations across the  United States and throughout the world, including in combat zones and  even un-staffed USO service sites in places too dangerous for anyone  but combat troops to occupy.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the USO for its dedication to our servicemembers  and their families. I salute our Nation's military spouses; and I thank  them for their dedication to their family and also this country.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the  opportunity to join my colleagues on the  [[Page H7866]]  floor here to reflect on a piece of legislation. It is a righteous  piece of legislation that is time to be reauthorized that has served so  many. I really rise today to talk about an issue that affects 1 in 4  women and approximately 15.5 million children every year--domestic  violence.   Domestic violence has been cast into the background throughout most  of our history, remaining a hidden problem, one that wasn't talked  about, and one, certainly, that wasn't properly addressed.   Survivors of domestic violence have often tolerated physical, mental,  and emotional abuse in silence, out of fear their spouses or partners  would retaliate.   Former battered women, civic organizations, and professionals began  to open shelters in the 1970s to provide services to abused women and  their children. After seeing the great results from these  efforts, Congress led a series of hearings in the early 1980s to  understand the scope of this violence and explore possible responses.    This led Congress to pass legislation that touched on all facets of  domestic abuse. As part of the Child Abuse Amendments of 1984, the  Family Violence Prevention and Services Act, or FVPSA, was enacted to  support lifesaving services, including emergency shelters, crisis  hotlines, counseling, and programs for underserved communities  throughout the United States, including the United States territories.   This critical legislation has been authorized seven times since its  enactment, most recently in 2010 for 5 years, through fiscal year 2015.  That is why I, along with 102 of my colleagues, introduced H.R. 6014,  which reauthorizes the Family Violence Prevention and Services Act an  additional 5 years through fiscal year 2023.   Congress sets aside funding for three purposes under FVPSA, and I am  going to look at these a little more in depth. But first, I want to  take the opportunity to say I am pleased that I am joined by a couple  of my colleagues this evening.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Wisconsin (Ms. Moore),  my colleague who has been an original cosponsor of this reauthorization  legislation    Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague,  Congresswoman Moore, for sharing Inez's story. It is a story that  occurs in a frightening way so many times, where victims of abuse--but  at the same time, it is an inspiring story because it illustrates how  these important services that we fund through this piece of legislation  can help save lives, saved the lives of this woman and her son, to be  able to change their lives around, you know, really, being caught in  such a long history of abuse and how it makes a difference.   So I thank the gentlewoman for her leadership and for sharing that,  the story of Inez--much appreciated.    Absolutely. So when they make that  courageous decision, they quickly find they are not alone; there is  someone there reaching out.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for being a part of this Special  Order this evening. Again, I want to thank my colleague and commend her  for her leadership on this important issue.   Mr. Speaker, I want to reiterate the importance of FVPSA. This  legislation is at the heart of our Nation's response to domestic  violence services. This program ensures that local domestic violence  shelters and programs are able to keep their lights on and the doors  open to serve more than 1.3 million victims and their children every  year.   FVPSA funds nearly 1,600 community-based programs through State  formula grants, including 60 programs located throughout the  Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, my home State. These programs provide the  necessary resources to local communities that help educate individuals  on healthy relationships, as well as offer legal assistance, crisis  intervention, and counseling.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Walberg), an  esteemed colleague, a good friend of mine. I have the privilege and  honor of serving with him on the Education and the Workforce Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Walberg) for his leadership on issues related to  Education and the Workforce, serving that committee, as you do, and I  am proud to serve there with you, but also for having that heart for  individuals who are facing abuse and those victims that we know are out  there who are struggling as a result of the various types of abuses  that occur. I know the gentleman has a heart of service, of trying to  provide this, so I am certainly proud to work with him on this  important reauthorization of this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, as a part of this, of the Family Violence Prevention and  Services Act, Congress sets aside funding for three purposes under  FVPSA. This includes a national domestic hotline which receives calls  for assistance related to domestic abuse, incredibly important, being  able to, 24/7, reach out for help when finding themselves in these  tragic circumstances.   Another area, another purpose is direct services like housing,  counseling, legal advocacy, and referrals through State grants for  victims of domestic abuse and their children and efforts to prevent  domestic violence through a program known as Domestic Violence  Prevention Enhancement and Leadership Through Allies.   Now, I would like to take the opportunity to highlight one of these  programs, The National Domestic Violence Hotline, more commonly  referred to as The Hotline.   Beginning in 1996, this 24-hour, 7-day-a-week service provides free  and confidential support for individuals who call for assistance  related to domestic violence issues. The Hotline also provides  referrals and connects individuals to the most comprehensive resource  base in the country, with over 4,800 service providers in the United  States, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Guam, all possible  through the continuous support of FVPSA funding.   The Hotline is the only 24/7 center in the Nation that has access to  service providers and shelters across the United States, including our  territories. This service also helps with safety planning and support  related to questions related to healthy relationships.   Not only does The Hotline answer calls from victims, but it also  provides services and support to helpers, who are individuals who  contact The Hotline on behalf of a person who is now or has previously  been the victim of abuse, in addition to abusive partners, service  providers, and law enforcement officials.   One project The Hotline has introduced is the Love Is Respect  program. The purpose of this program is to engage, educate, and empower  young people to prevent and end abusive relationships. This online  resource helps millions of teens and 20-somethings learn about healthy  relationships and dating violence. Providing hotline services to youth  is also authorized as a part of FVPSA, another critical need covered by  this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, in 2017, The Hotline and Love Is Respect answered over  300,000 calls for help, 300,000 calls, texts, and chats from survivors  of domestic abuse on a range of issues, including physical abuse,  emotional and verbal abuse, economic and financial abuse, digital  abuse, and sexual abuse.                                time  1830    The National Domestic Violence Hotline also partners with the  National Indigenous Women's Resource Center's expertise to operate the  StrongHearts Native Helpline.   This important program provides culturally appropriate, confidential  services for Native Americans affected by domestic abuse and dating  violence.   Although The Hotline has made significant strides over its lifetime  offering support to victims, more than 98,000 contacts in 2017 went  unanswered due to a lack of resources and capacity.  [[Page H7868]]    Mr. Speaker, that is unacceptable. It is imperative that we pass this  legislation to continue funding programs like these that have a proven  record of success.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to highlight one of the organizations that  provides great resources on domestic violence issues, the National  Network to End Domestic Violence.   Each year, this organization releases a report entitled ``Domestic  Violence Counts: A 24-hour National Census of Domestic Violence  Services.'' This report revealed that, in just one day, Mr. Speaker,  one day in 2017, more than 72,000 victims of domestic violence received  services.   In my home State and your home State, Mr. Speaker, of Pennsylvania,  in that State alone, 1,278 victims of domestic violence found refuge in  emergency shelters or transitional housing provided by local domestic  violence programs; 1,208 victims of domestic violence received support  through counseling, legal assistance, and children's support programs;  760 hotline calls received that day were answered, which equals about  32 calls answered per hour; and 1,841 individuals, Mr. Speaker,  attended prevention and education training sessions on that day across  Pennsylvania, gaining critical information on domestic violence  prevention, early intervention, and other related services.   Although this report showed the great success of our local community- based programs, more than 11,000 requests for services went unmet that  day because programs lacked the resources and the funding to carry out  these services.   Mr. Speaker, it is clear these programs are working for the American  public. Let us pass this legislation to continue supporting victims of  domestic violence and providing them with all the necessary resources  they need on their way to recovery.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleagues, Representative  Moore and Representative Walberg, for taking time out of their busy  schedule to talk about this important issue with us today. And, Mr.  Speaker, I would like to thank the more than 100 Members of Congress  who have stepped up and stepped forward to put their name on this  legislation as cosponsors of this reauthorization bill. It is a strong  bipartisan bill for a righteous purpose.   FVPSA was the first Federal law to address domestic violence. Since  its enactment in 1984, it has continued to have a primary focus on  providing shelter and services for survivors and has increasingly  provided support to children exposed to domestic violence and teen  dating violence.   It is my hope this legislation will continue to support those who are  facing domestic violence and continue to create healthy and safe  pathways to recovery.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do  now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 6 o'clock and 34 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Thursday, September 6, 2018, at 10 a.m. for morning-hour debate.                            ____________________
