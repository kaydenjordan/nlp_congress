 First off, there are a few people I would like  to thank. I would like to thank the committee chairs. I would like to  thank Chairman Walden, Chairman Brady, Chairman Black, Chairman  Sessions.   I want to thank the members of those committees: Energy and Commerce,  Ways and Means, Budget, and Rules.   I want to thank all the Members who made constructive contributions  throughout this entire deliberative, bottom-up organic process.   I want to thank the President of the United States for his steadfast  leadership.                                time  1345    Mr. Speaker, in his address in this Chamber, he called on Congress to  act; and today we take the next step to repeal and replace ObamaCare.   I want to thank Vice President Pence, Secretary Price, Director  Mulvaney, and all of their teams.   Mr. Speaker, there is a fundamental and urgent choice at the heart of  this debate. We can continue with the status quo under ObamaCare, and  we know what this looks like. It means even higher premiums, even fewer  choices, even more insurance companies pulling out, even more  uncertainty, and even more chaos.   Look at what has happened in Iowa this week. As is the case in so  many areas in this country, Iowa is down to one insurer. That, of  course, is not a choice. But now that one insurer is saying that it  will have to pull out of 94 of the 99 counties in Iowa. This is  happening right now. So tens of thousands of Iowans will go from having  one option to no options. That is not a choice. This is a crisis, and  it is happening right now.   What protection is ObamaCare if there is no healthcare plan to  purchase in your State?   This is the direction ObamaCare is rapidly heading. So we can  continue with this status quo or we can put this collapsing law behind  us and end this failed experiment. Let's make it easier for people to  afford their health insurance. Let's give people more choices and more  control over their care. Let's make insurance companies come in and  compete for your business. Let's return power from Washington to the  States. Let's help give people peace of mind. Let's put the patient,  not bureaucrats, at the center of this system. This bill does all of  those things. This bill delivers the promises that we have made to the  American people.   A lot of us have been waiting 7 years to cast this vote. Many of us  are here because we pledged to cast this very vote to repeal and  replace ObamaCare, to rescue people from this collapsing law.   Are we going to meet this test? Are we going to be men and women of  our word? Are we going to keep the promises that we made? Or are we  going to falter?   No. After all of this--after seeing what is happening in Iowa and  around the country, after seeing this law collapsing while we witness  it across the country and knowing all this turmoil that is coming, we  will not falter. We will replace; and today is the day that we are  going to do this.   Today this House has the opportunity to do more than just fulfill a  promise. We have the opportunity to raise our gaze and set a bold  course for our country. We have the opportunity to show that we have  got the resolve to tackle the big challenges in this country before  they tackle us; to stop the drift of arrogant, Big Government policies  in our lives, and to begin a new era of reform based on liberty and  self-determination, giving people choices and letting them control  their own destinies.   That is the day that is before us right here. So let us pass this  bill to take the next step to put ObamaCare behind us; let us pass this  bill to build a better healthcare system for American families; and let  us pass this bill to leave this country better than we found it because  that is why we are here.   That is what is at stake today. That is why I am going to be so proud  to cast my vote for this legislation, and I urge all of my colleagues  to do the same.
