 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be able to  speak for not more than 5 minutes regarding Shalanda Young.    Mr. President, I am proud to be here on the Senate floor  to offer my strong support for Shalanda Young to be Deputy Director of  the Office of Management and Budget, as I have spoken about her earlier  before the committee.   She has worked on the House Appropriations Committee for nearly 14  years. She has been the House Appropriations staff director since 2017.   It is from my position on the Appropriations Committee that I got to  know her very well. I can tell you, without any reservation, there is  no one better suited for this position. Her deep understanding of,  really, the often arcane Federal budget process, her years of  experience on the Appropriations Committee, her tenacity, and her  dedication to public service will serve the Agency and the American  people.   I think after we had the last closedown of the government--I believe  the longest in history--we ended up, finally, with four of us meeting  for several weeks in my office here in the Capitol. When we forged the  agreement to reopen, Senator Shelby and myself, Congresswomen Lowey and  Granger from the House--we were chair and vice chair of our respective  committees--but, most importantly, Shalanda Young was there for the  House, as was Chuck Kieffer, and she had an opportunity to work for the  Senate. Her knowledge of the intricacies of that and her ability to  help us reach agreement were absolutely essential.   Ms. Young began her career in public service in 2001 at the National  Institutes of Health. She first came to work on Capitol Hill as a  detailee for the House Appropriations Committee in 2005. She came back  as a professional staff member in 2007. She worked her way up in the  committee over the years. She helped develop a budget for and conducted  oversight of key Agencies. That has given her a critical insight into  the operation of some of our Nation's most important Agencies,  including the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of the  Interior, the Environmental Protection Agency, the General Services  Administration. She even served as a staff director for the Legislative  Branch Subcommittee, which covers the budget for Congress.   Ms. Young became staff director of the House Appropriations Committee  in 2017, coincidentally the same year I became vice chairman of the  Appropriations Committee. But she has helped the House navigate some of  the most difficult issues before the Chamber. As I said, she was a  critical player in helping to end the longest Federal shutdown in  history in 2019, and she was instrumental in crafting 2020 bipartisan  COVID relief bills.   She has a reputation as a tough but fair negotiator. That is high  praise on Capitol Hill because she gets it from both Republicans and  Democrats. I can attest to the truth of these statements. I have seen  these skills firsthand.   I have already said that the Office of Management and Budget is one  of the most powerful government Agencies that most Americans have never  heard of. That is true. It wields incredible influence on not just the  Federal budget but over policies that affect people's lives.   We need people like Shalanda Young to help steer the Agency in these  important decisions. That is why I voted yes on the recent motion, and  that is why I want to see her in that position as soon as possible.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I want to pay tribute to one of Vietnam's  highest ranking military officers, Senior Lieutenant General Nguyen Chi  Vinh.   General Vinh, who has served as Vietnam's Deputy Minister of National  Defense since 2009, has played an indispensable role in the  reconciliation between Vietnam and the United States. After more than  four decades of military service, he is finally nearing retirement from  the Ministry of National Defense.   General Vinh was born in 1957. He studied at the Institute of  Military Technology before embarking on his long and distinguished  career in the Vietnamese People's Army. His father, General Nguyen Chi  Thanh, came from a humble family and rose to become a decorated  military officer and politician. Today, one of Hanoi's main  thoroughfares bears his name.   As someone who lived through the Vietnam war era, I remember it a  catastrophe for both countries. The more than 58,000 American soldiers  and other servicemembers who died, whose names are etched in the  granite Vietnam Veterans Memorial, are only part of the story. We  remember their families and the many tens of thousands who returned  home with severe disabilities.   In Vietnam, virtually no family was unscathed. Hundreds of thousands  are still missing among the estimated 3 million Vietnamese who died.  The majority were civilians, whose families suffered grievous losses  and severe hardships as the fighting raged around them. Many of their  stories remain untold.   In the decades since, memories of that time have faded and the  world's attention has turned elsewhere. Yet during the past quarter  century since the normalization of relations with Vietnam, there has  been a sustained effort by both countries to address some of the worst  legacies of the war. By doing so, we have built a new partnership and  set an example for other former enemies.   It began in the late 1980s with the first use of the Leahy War  Victims Fund by the U.S. Agency for International Development, USAID,  to assist people with severe war-related disabilities. That was  authorized by President George H. W. Bush, after he and I discussed the  need to assist Vietnamese who had been injured during the war. It led  to funding by the State Department to locate and destroy unexploded  landmines and bombs, which litter the Vietnamese countryside and have  maimed and killed tens of thousands of innocent people, including  children, since the war ended.   Nearly 15 years ago, those war legacy programs expanded to address  the cruel legacy of Agent Orange, and it is in this that General Vinh  and I became acquainted.   Since then, General Vinh has been my principal Vietnamese counterpart  in working to address the legacy of dioxin contamination at former U.S.  military bases and the needs of Vietnamese with severe physical and  cognitive disabilities resulting from exposure to dioxin. I consider  him a friend and am grateful for the hospitality he has shown me, my  wife Marcelle, and other Senators when we have visited Vietnam.   From 1961 to 1971, the U.S. Air Force sprayed nearly 19 million  gallons of herbicides in Vietnam, of which at least 11 million gallons  were Agent Orange, in an effort to defoliate trees and shrubs and kill  agricultural crops that were providing cover and food to North  Vietnamese soldiers. Decades later, we learned that the Agent Orange  was contaminated with dioxin, which can cause problems with  reproduction, development, and the immune system. Dioxin can disrupt  hormones and lead to cancer. It is also a persistent pollutant that can  remain in the environment for many years.   Millions of Vietnamese were exposed, and hundreds of thousands  suffered severe physical and cognitive disabilities. My wife Marcelle  and I have met three generations of Agent Orange victims, from young  children to their parents and grandparents. Hundreds of thousands of  Americans who served in Vietnam were also exposed, and thousands have  been battling cancers for years.   Fortunately, thanks to studies funded by the Ford Foundation, it was  possible to identify key ``hotspots'' with significant contamination,  and working closely with General Vinh and USAID, we cleaned up the  contaminated soil and sediment at the former U.S. airbase in Da Nang.  Seven years and $110 million dollars later, it is once again a busy  commercial airport. In fact, Air Force One landed there in 2017, when  President Trump visited Vietnam. That project would not have been  possible without the leadership and perseverance of General Nguyen Chi  Vinh, and I will never forget visiting the site with him when we  formally launched the project in 2014.   Since then, we have moved on to Bien Hoa, on the outskirts of Ho Chi  Minh City, the site of the largest U.S. airbase during the war where  Agent Orange was stored and loaded onto airplanes. Today it is a shadow  of what it once was, and it is contaminated with dioxin that has been  leaching into the nearby Dong Nai River for half a century.   In 2019, General Vinh and I, along with Deputy Prime Minister Truong  Hoa Binh and U.S. Ambassador Daniel Kritenbrink, and in the presence of  eight other U.S. Senators, inaugurated a joint U.S.-Vietnam project to  clean up Bien Hoa, including a U.S. commitment to contribute $300  million over 10 years, half from the U.S. Department of Defense and  half from USAID. I had several conversations with Secretary of Defense  James Mattis about Bien Hoa, and the Pentagon's contribution is the  result of his recognition that we have a responsibility and a national  interest in helping Vietnam address war legacy issues.   At the same time, USAID launched a 5-year, $65 million effort to  expand our health and disability programs, which are being implemented  in eight provinces that were sprayed with Agent Orange.   Over more than four decades, the Government of Vietnam has provided  essential access and support in locating the remains of hundreds of  American MIAs. This year, we are embarking on a 5-year, $15 million  program, jointly funded by the U.S. Department of Defense and USAID, to  help the Vietnamese locate and identify some of their own people  missing or killed during the war.   Much has been written, and I suspect more will be, about the  collaboration between our two countries in addressing the legacies of  the Vietnam war. Issues that for years were a cause of anger and  resentment are today examples of how two former enemies can work  together for the betterment of the people of both countries. These  projects opened the door for the United States and Vietnam to cooperate  on a wide array of other issues, from climate change and wildlife  trafficking, to public health and regional security.  [[Page S1703]]  Tens of thousands of Vietnamese students are studying in the United  States, and we are supporting institutions of higher education in  Vietnam.   This has been possible because of the efforts of many people over  many years. Senators John McCain and John Kerry played an instrumental  role in the normalization of relations. By doing so, they set the stage  for both countries to build trust based on mutual respect by addressing  sensitive war legacy issues, which Ambassadors of both countries have  also strongly encouraged.   It is in this that Senior Lieutenant General Nguyen Chi Vinh has  built his own legacy. The partnership that has developed from our  cooperation on war legacies and which today extends to programs jointly  funded and implemented by Vietnam's Ministry of Defense and the U.S.  Department of Defense would not have been possible without General  Vinh's vision, his leadership, and his good will. For that we owe him  our lasting appreciation and respect.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I have 7 requests for committees to meet  during today's session of the Senate.
