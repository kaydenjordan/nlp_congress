 Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I have no  objection to voting on the amendments if we allow all of them. We have  an amendment, and 68 Members of this body said that no American should  be detained without a trial. If you put that amendment, which 68  Senators support, in the package, I will be happy to have consent. If  we don't have it in, I will continue to object. I object.
