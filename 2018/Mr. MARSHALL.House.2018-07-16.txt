 Mr. Speaker, 6 years ago, farmers and ranchers across  Kansas faced drought conditions that crippled crops, dried ponds, and  forced livestock owners to abandon pastures. In the years since, rain  has fallen and conditions returned to normal, but drought conditions  have once again struck Kansas, leaving many counties across my district  dry and worried.   Ranchers in the Flint Hills of Kansas are finding themselves short of  water and grass for their cattle, while farmers in central Kansas watch  corn and soybean plants shrivel under the unrelenting heat. Some  counties are nearly 15 inches behind normal rainfall totals, with many  under extreme drought declaration.   All of this on top of low commodity prices and market uncertainty  strains operating budgets and pushes farmer suicide rates to more than  double that of the general population. That is right, Mr. Speaker, our  farmer suicide rates are more than double that of the general  population.   Unfortunately, the impacts do not stop at the farm gate. When  production agriculture suffers, so do the communities our producers  call home and the  [[Page H6198]]  companies that support the agriculture industry. The drought really  does impact us all.    Earlier this month, I visited Connie and Joe Mushrush's Red Angus  Ranch in Chase County, Kansas. They showed me their vacant pastures and  dry ponds, and admitted this drought was one of the worst their family  has ever endured. They are not alone, as I hear stories of farmers and  ranchers all across the district struggling to find solutions and  options for their crops and cattle.   While I cannot deliver the rain many of us pray for, I can help to  bring a level of certainty and support to my farmers and ranchers  through final passage of the 2018 farm bill. I have worked hard,  alongside my Agriculture Committee colleagues, to write and pass  legislation that continues crop insurance and conservation programs  that help producers operate their farms and ranches more efficiently.   Farmers never want a handout, but in trying times like these, it is  essential that we support those who put food on our table with a safety  net that we can all count on. I will continue to do all I can to  support my farmers and ranchers, and I ask that my colleagues say a  prayer for rain and for the men and women who feed us all.                            ____________________
