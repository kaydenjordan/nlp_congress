 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I commend my colleague Mike Conaway and the  other members of the Agriculture Committee for their work on the farm  bill. I have every intention of voting for the bill and have stated  that on many occasions.   Having been working on a reauthorization of a major bill recently, I  can certainly sympathize with the effort here and say that, overall,  this bill is an improvement on past farm bills because it responds to  the desperate need of work requirements for able-bodied people.   However, there is another piece of this bill that has been around for  a long time, 85 years, that is not corrected, is decidedly bad policy,  and is long overdue to be corrected, and our amendment does that.   This amendment is not new. In fact, this body has debated it in every  farm bill for over a generation. The issue of which I speak is the  issue with sugar and the need for reform of the way we treat sugar,  which is different from all other commodity programs.   It is the only program that provides both loan supports and supply  management. Supply management is the ugly cousin of direct payments. It  rewards inactivity.   Americans are outraged when they hear tales of direct payments to  farmers for not producing something. That same injustice--reward for  inactivity, protection from competition--is what we find in the sugar  program.   Let's be crystal-clear about what the sugar program does. It puts the  government in charge of deciding how much sugar will be produced in  this country, which inflates the cost, and it guarantees the processing  industry a base profit by giving them subsidized loans. We stopped  these practices years ago for other commodities, and only sugar is left  with this sweet deal.   When the government gets into picking winners and losers, American  jobs are at risk. The International Trade Commission has stated that  for every job the sugar program protects we lose three manufacturing  jobs. Congress should not be in the business of defending a program  that is a bona fide job killer.   This amendment has a broad coalition of support. Free market groups,  economists, environmentalists, consumer groups, and manufacturers all  support this amendment.   Let me tell you about the other coalition. It is not very large. It  is made up of 13 vertically integrated sugar processors. That is it.  Our government is transferring wealth to these processors. It shifts  cost onto our Nation's manufacturers and consumers by almost $4 billion  annually.   We are going to hear that the amendment subjects farmers to some new  exposure to foreign imports. What they will fail to tell you is that,  between our government's suspension agreements, import quotas, and  tariffs, our government already regulates every single ounce of foreign  sugar coming into our market. Will our amendment weaken the ability of  the USDA to regulate these imports? Not in the slightest. We simply  give USDA more flexibility.   We are going to hear arguments about candy bars, candy companies, and  lots of other distractions. But it is all brought up to shift your  attention away from the very program we are here to debate, the sugar  program.   In reality, the sugar program hates sunshine. It hates getting the  spotlight. But I am glad we are debating it here today.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.  [[Page H4175]]         Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Wisconsin (Mr. Kind).    Mr. Chairman, not my words, but the International Trade  Commission says that for every job sugar protects, we lose three  manufacturing jobs.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Hensarling).     Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Virginia  (Mr. Goodlatte).    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Oregon  (Mr. Blumenauer).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 30 seconds to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Speier).    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from  South Carolina (Mr. Sanford).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Perry).    Mr. Chairman, I have a parliamentary inquiry.    Mr. Chairman, do I have the right to close or does the  gentleman from Texas have the right to close?    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, in closing, our government's current sugar  program is a job killer. It ensures profits for the connected few at  the expense of the many. It operates at a substantial cost to  taxpayers, consumers, and businesses. It is rooted in supply management  economics that were drafted nearly 90 years ago.   Every other commodity program was subjected to reforms during the  last farm bill except the sugar program. Economists, consumer groups,  environmentalists, manufacturers, editorial boards, and groups on both  the left and right of the idealogical spectrum have all endorsed the  idea of substantially reforming this program.   It is time to end Congress' codification of a special interest  giveaway. It is time to modernize the sugar program. I ask my  colleagues to support our amendment and the farm bill.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
