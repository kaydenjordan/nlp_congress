 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding. I thank my  friend, the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Barr), for his leadership on  this vital issue.   Mr. Speaker, in regulation and in life, one size simply does not fit  all. A requirement that works for one type of business may not work for  another type of business.   Right now, the law treats those who make loans on manufactured houses  similarly to those who are refinancing mortgages on their homes. The  reality is that these are completely different transactions.   Buying a $20,000 manufactured home is simply not the same as  financing a $200,000 home with a 30-year mortgage. The borrower is in a  different position with very different needs. The lender is making a  loan that is often secured differently for a much smaller amount, but  with similar paperwork and similar costs.   The Federal Government, since Dodd-Frank, has been treating both of  these transactions similarly from a regulation perspective. It has hurt  borrowers trying to buy a piece of their American Dream.   In The Wall Street Journal, lenders suggested that they would not  make these loans if they continued to suffer under this faulty  regulation scenario. One lender says that about one-third of its  sales--6,100 homes--would be affected. That is 6,100 American families  who would lose out on homeownership, on building equity, and on making  an investment instead of paying rent.   The bill simply says: Look, the person making a $20,000 loan on a  manufactured home is not the same as a bank or a mortgage broker  originating a 30-year fixed rate mortgage and should not be treated in  the same way. It is a commonsense solution, and that is why it has  gotten bipartisan backing.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support of the bill.
