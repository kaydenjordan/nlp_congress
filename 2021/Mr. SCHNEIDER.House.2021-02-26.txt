 Madam Speaker, I rise today to implore that my  colleagues pass this urgently needed COVID relief for millions of  struggling Americans.   Across the country, families and friends have had to say good-bye to  more than 500,000 loved ones, too often knowing that they have died  alone.   In our communities, large and small, more than 18 million Americans  are receiving unemployment benefits as their only lifeline. Millions of  small businesses are on the brink of permanent closure. Schools are  struggling to reopen.   Meanwhile, the miraculous vaccines offer a light, but it is still at  the end of a long and steep tunnel.   President Biden's American Rescue Plan will get people back to work,  help parents safely send their children back to school, assist our  families in paying their bills and our small businesses in building  their future.  [[Page H768]]    This bill helps people and businesses in every community in Illinois  and in every State in America. That is why it has such bipartisan  support across the country. It deserves the same support here in  Congress.   To truly heal our economy and our Nation, we must pass the American  Rescue Plan. Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.''
