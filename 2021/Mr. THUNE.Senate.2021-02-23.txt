 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, in his inaugural address, President Biden  spoke about his desire to unify.   He said this:         Today, on this January day, my whole soul is in this:       bringing America together, uniting our people, uniting our       nation.    Admirable words, but words have to be met with action, and, right  now, we are not seeing much of an attempt to unify from the President  or his party. In fact, we are seeing pretty much the opposite. The  Democrats have made it very clear they are determined to pass another  COVID bill on a purely partisan basis, which is particularly  disappointing because, up until now, COVID relief has been a bipartisan  process. That is right. To date, Congress has passed five COVID relief  bills, and every single one of those bills has been overwhelmingly  bipartisan.   I might add, last year, when we were in the majority, Senate  Democrats made it very clear that they thought the minority should have  a voice in COVID relief and that any legislation should reflect the  thoughts of both parties. The Democratic leader filibustered the CARES  Act--our largest COVID relief bill--multiple times until he got a  version that he was satisfied with, but now that the Democrats are in  the majority, apparently, they have decided that it is their way or the  highway. Forget the fact that the Senate is evenly divided between  Republicans and Democrats. The Democrats are determined to ensure that  the Republicans and the Americans they represent don't have a voice in  this bill.   The Democrats' move to use reconciliation to force through a purely  partisan COVID bill might be understandable--and I add ``might''--if  the Republicans had made it clear that we opposed doing anything else  on COVID, but that couldn't be further from the truth. The Republicans  have made it very clear that we are willing to work with the Democrats  on additional targeted relief. Just weeks ago, 10 Republican Senators  put together a plan and met with President Biden for 2 hours to discuss  a bipartisan agreement, but while the President certainly listened to  them graciously, it quickly became clear that their efforts didn't  matter. It didn't matter how willing the Republicans were to negotiate;  the Democrats had no intention of reaching an agreement. They wanted to  go it alone, and they were not going to let the Republicans stop them.   In a speech a few days ago, President Biden acknowledged that people  have criticized his $1.9 trillion plan but asked:         What would they have me cut? What would they have me leave       out?   [[Page S796]]     Well, let me offer a few ideas.   For starters, it might be a good idea to cut out the sections of the  Democrats' bill that have nothing to do with combating COVID. The  Democrats are calling this a COVID relief bill, but in actual fact,  much of this bill has little to do with the coronavirus. In fact, less  than 10 percent of the bill is directly related to combating COVID.   If President Biden wants to know what sections of the bill to cut, I  might suggest starting with the bill's minimum wage hike. The  Democratic bill would more than double the Federal minimum wage at a  cost of an estimated 1.4 million jobs--that according to the  Congressional Budget Office. That would be problematic enough at a time  when we are already dealing with substantial job losses, but it is even  worse when you realize that the people most likely to lose their jobs  as a result of this hike would be lower income workers.   I would also suggest that the President cut his $86 billion bailout  of multiemployer pension plans, which has nothing to do with emergency  COVID relief.   The President could also consider cutting his $350 billion slush fund  for States and localities, which would be used mostly to reward States  that shut down their businesses for extended periods and, therefore,  have higher unemployment rates.   It has become clear the majority of States are doing OK financially  despite the pandemic. A number of States actually saw higher tax  revenues in 2020, and a majority of States have the resources needed to  weather the rest of this crisis. Three hundred fifty billion dollars  far exceeds projected State need.    And while we are on that topic, the economic stimulus provided by  President Biden's bill, in general, far exceeds the economic need and  may actually harm the economy.   Even without a dollar more of stimulus spending, our economy is  expected to grow at a robust 3.7 percent in 2021.   The massive amount of spending that the President is proposing to  inject into the economy runs the very real risk of overheating the  economy and driving up inflation, and you don't have to take my word  for it. Even some liberal economists have expressed their concern over  the size of the Democrats' coronavirus legislation and the damage that  it could do to the economy.   Then, of course, there is the money the bill includes for schools.  Now, while children in some places, like South Dakota, are in school,  we need to get all kids back to in-person learning. In-person learning  is important for kids' academic, social, and emotional health, and as  Republicans have demonstrated, we want to ensure that schools have the  resources they need to get back into the classroom safely.   Our previous coronavirus bills contained more than $100 billion for  education, and I think it is safe to say that every Republican would  support additional dollars, if needed, but the fact of the matter is,  schools still have billions of dollars from previous coronavirus  legislation that remains unspent. And the Biden bill would appropriate  an additional $129 billion for schools that schools would get--they  would get--whether or not they get kids back into the classroom.   On top of that, most of that money would go to schools beginning next  year and stretching all the way to 2028; in other words, long after the  pandemic will be over. In fact, less--if you can believe this, less  than 5 percent of the education spending would occur this year.   Ultimately, the Biden bill's school funding ends up looking less like  a plan to get our kids back in schools and more like caving in to the  teachers' unions.   So if President Biden would like to know what to cut, I would suggest  he start with some of the things I have highlighted. And I would ask--I  would ask that he and the Democratic leadership abandon their plan to  shove through a bloated, partisan bill, paid for with all borrowed  money--every single dollar goes on the debt--and to start trying for  the unity that the President has talked about.   The President could show that he really meant what he said in his  inaugural address by sitting down, in a serious way, with Republicans  to develop targeted relief legislation.   We are ready to come to the table. The ball is in the President's  court.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator  from Kentucky (Mr. Paul) and the Senator from Pennsylvania (Mr.  Toomey).    The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator  from Kentucky (Mr. Paul) and the Senator from Pennsylvania (Mr.  Toomey).    Mr. President, I would like to include in the  Record the following obituary for Mel Antonen, a native South Dakotan  and longtime Major League Baseball reporter for USA Today and  elsewhere, who passed away on January 30, 2021. He is honored by  Charles Raasch, also a native South Dakotan, of USA Today with an  obituary upon his death. I extend my deepest sympathy to the Antonen  family.   The material follows:         Mel Antonen, family man, friend to the world, and renowned       sports journalist, died Saturday of a rare acute auto-immune       disease and complications from COVID-19. He was a longtime       USA TODAY Sports and MASN-TV baseball reporter who covered       nearly three dozen World Series. In a half century in       journalism, he reveled and excelled in telling others'       stories.        He was 64.        Mel Richard Antonen's own story became the best of all. It       began in the tiny town of Lake Norden, South Dakota, on Aug.       25, 1956, when he was the third of four children born to Ray       and Valda Antonen.        Lake Norden is 225 miles from the nearest major league       ballpark and has never been populated with more than 550       people, but on soft summer evenings fans from counties away       congregate at Memorial Park to watch a new episode of South       Dakota's storied amateur baseball history. Its pull never       left him even as he walked, as a sports journalist, on       Boston's hallowed Fenway Park with the late Yankees Hall of       Famer Joe DiMaggio, or sat in a pre-game spring training       dugout with another Hall of Fame member, Minnesota Twins       slugger Harmon Killebrew, weeks before Killebrew died in       2011.        The Antonen family has promoted amateur baseball in Lake       Norden for decades. Mel loved to tell how his father, Ray       over the years brought to the tiny hometown a series of       barnstorming pros, including the legendary Satchel Paige and       Cy Young Award winner Jim Perry, to play at Memorial Park. On       the mornings of home games throughout his childhood and       beyond, Mel, his father and siblings would groom the field,       with the rising corn and soybean fields ritually marking the       progression of summer beyond the left-field fence.        ``I love baseball because it always brings me home,''       Antonen said at his induction to South Dakota Sports Hall of       Fame in 2017. ``A baseball park in my mind is a home. It       doesn't matter if it's next to a cornfield, as it is in Lake       Norden, or if it is next to a rumbling subway, in New York.''        At USA TODAY, and later as an analyst for MASN, the network       that covers the Washington Nationals and Baltimore Orioles,       Antonen ``was a very good storyteller who went far beyond       balls and strikes and the score of the game,'' said his       retired USA TODAY Sports editor Henry Freeman.        Dan Connolly was among the reporters in the Washington-      Baltimore area with whom Antonen was close, as they two sat       next to each other in the press box and exchanged good-      natured barbs.        ``He had such an easy way about him with players and media       and staff,'' Connolly said. ``It was one of those things,       everyone liked the guy. Everyone. He had a way about him. He       could relate to anybody. He was really very smart, and being       a South Dakota boy, he was very ease to relate to. I remember       him saying that if he didn't go into baseball writers, he       wanted to be a Lutheran minister. You could tell Mel       anything, he was a pastoral listening-type guy.''        Antonen's journalism career began as a kid, when he called       in scores from Lake Norden's home games to two newspapers       that he ended up writing for: the Watertown (S.D.) Public       Opinion, which paid him as a high schooler 15 cents a copy       inch; and the Sioux Falls Argus Leader, where he got his       first job after graduation from Augustana University,       eventually covering the sports, farm and political beats.        He joined USA TODAY in 1986, where one of his earliest       assignments was covering the Tonya Harding Olympics figure-      skating scandal. Antonen became a MLB reporter and columnist,       covering history from Cal Ripken Jr.'s consecutive games       streak to the Mark McGwire-Sammy Sosa record-breaking home       run race and the steroid scandals that followed. The story he       often said was seared most in his memory came during the       earthquake-interrupted 1989 World Series. There, sitting in a       press box high above San Francisco's Candlestick Park, he       watched as the entire stadium undulated dangerously during       the destructive Loma Prieta quake. Antonen filed a story,       then headed out for days to cover the aftermath, focusing on       the human costs.        Hall of Famer Ripken told USA TODAY Sports' Bob Nightengale       that Antonen ``was a fixture around the game for so many       years, and it was clear that he had a passion for baseball.       He was a thorough and thoughtful reporter and left his mark       on his profession.''        Along with the World Series, Antonen covered three       Olympics, and professional bowling leagues.        ``I can't imagine being anything other than a reporter, an       ink-stained wretch,'' he told his Hall of Fame audience.        Freeman, his editor at USA TODAY's pioneering sports       section, said Antonen's knowledge of baseball, reverence for       its history, and his love of stories, was evident from the       first day.        ``It became clear to me right away the understanding he had       of baseball, and a lot of that was because of his father,''       said Freeman.        Freeman said one of his favorite stories involved Antonen       at the 1988 Olympic Games in Seoul. Canadian sprinter Ben       Johnson won the 100 meters in world-record time, but failed a       drug test, was stripped of his gold medal and ordered to be       sent home. USA TODAY received a tip that Johnson had       reservations on one of several potential flights out of South       Korea, and Freeman immediately sent Antonen to the airport to       find Johnson and to do anything necessary to get an       interview.        Carrying nothing but a walkie-talkie and his reporter's       notebook, Antonen arrived at the airport and quickly       discovered that Ben Johnson was booked on a flight to       Toronto. Antonen bought a ticket, went aboard and found Ben       Johnson--who turned out to be a doctor, decades older than       the sprinter by the same name. Antonen turned failure into a       memorable human interest story about the frantic hunt through       Olympics high-security obstacles that ended with the wrong       Ben Johnson.        ``It was a non-story that he made a good story of its       own,'' Freeman said. ``It also showed the lengths that Mel       would go to get a good story.''        Using persistence and personality, Antonen scored a rare       interview with the notoriously press-shy DiMaggio, late in       the legend's life, after learning that DiMaggio was in Boston       for a special event at Fenway Park. The man considered       ``ungettable'' by many sports journalists talked for several       hours with Antonen, and they finished with a stroll in front       of the Green Monster. DiMaggio ``loved the history of       baseball,'' Antonen years later told the Argus-Leader.        He was a sports broadcaster for MASN's Mid-Atlantic Sports       Report, and radio analyst on Sirius-XM in the last decade of       his career, and also wrote for Sports Illustrated and other       publications. He did a radio interview on the baseball Hall       of Fame voting from his hospital bed less than a week before       his death. He especially loved talking baseball with long-      haul truckers on his late-night satellite radio show.        Antonen's mother died when he was 12. His father, himself       enshrined in the South Dakota Sports Hall of Fame, raised Mel       and his sisters, Kathy and Carmen, and brother, Rusty, with       the field at Memorial Park becoming a refuge.        ``My life reflects the power of baseball,'' he said in that       2017 speech. ``One of my earliest memories of Lake Norden       baseball was the summer of 1969. . . . In March of that year       my mom died after a year-long battle with cancer. But it was       baseball, and Lake Norden baseball, with hot dogs and a 10-      cent glass of pop and chasing batting-practice foul balls on       a beautiful summer night, that created a diversion from       fearful images of three months prior--(of) my mom's tan       casket, crying adults, the hearse in front of Trinity       Lutheran, on an overcast subzero day, when there were piles       of snow in one of South Dakota's worst winters.''        Antonen kept reporting and writing throughout his illness       with COVID-19 and an auto-immune disease so rare that his       doctors told him he may have been the only person on Earth       with that combination.        Months after being diagnosed with both diseases, Mel scored       an interview with Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious       disease expert and big baseball fan, who talked about the       need for caution, but also hope, in a pandemic. ``You've got       to go on with your life, but that doesn't mean you have to       deprive yourself of all the pleasures'' Fauci told him.        Antonen's final column for MASN, written after the Dodgers       won the World Series in October, paid homage to the       comforting and reassuring next-year ritual of baseball. It       ended this way: ``World Series 2021 prediction: The Padres in       six over the White Sox.''        Mel Richard Antonen is survived by his son, Emmett, 14, and       his wife, Lisa Nipp, a photojournalist, whom he married in       2001, along with three siblings and their families. Lisa       embraced the many characters in Mel's baseball orbit, once       holding the phone for Mel with the crusty, late Hall-of-Fame       pitcher Bob Feller by discussing the beauty of hollyhocks.        ``From Joe DiMaggio to Dusty Baker and Bryce Harper, I have       gotten to meet and interview and become friends with people       that baseball fans around the world would love to know,'' he       said in that Hall of Fame speech in South Dakota. ``But those       experiences only happened because I grew up around people       that we should all be lucky to know. The lessons learned       here, and on the prairie, have gone with me and worked       beautifully. And tonight, baseball brings me home once       again.''  [[Page S818]]                                ____________________     Mr. President, today I would like to pay tribute to  Ms. Jane Anne Boorman, a native South Dakotan and dedicated public  servant, who passed away in December. Jane was deeply respected among  her peers and beyond, having earned a superb reputation with her hard  work and integrity. Jane was active and well-known in South Dakota  Republican Party politics, and she was a thought-leader and friend, who  no doubt helped inspire countless leaders and support important efforts  throughout our great State. I extend my deep condolences and prayers to  the Boorman family.   The following is Jane's obituary honoring the life of this great  South Dakotan.   The material follows:         Jane Anne Boorman (1932 to 2020), a retired federal       employee, Congressional aide, and newspaper editor died on       December 11, 2020, at Arbor Place Retirement Home in       Rockville, Maryland. She was 88.        Jane was born in Lemmon, South Dakota to Anne Sutton       Boorman and Lloyd Bruce (LB) Boorman. She graduated from       Lemmon High School and Marquette University.        Jane's life straddled South Dakota and Washington, DC. Born       and raised on the high plains in Lemmon, South Dakota, Jane       embodied the flinty independence of its early settlers. She       was hard to know and always pushed for perfection, but once       you were in her life you had a steadfast, loyal, and loving       friend.        In Lemmon, Jane was editor and held other roles at the       Lemmon Leader--the family-owned newspaper--where she worked       until 1973. She also was named co-editor for ``Dakota       Panorama''--an history of South Dakota published by the South       Dakota Territory Centennial observance in 1961.        Jane's passion for Republican party politics started early       in her life. She was selected Outstanding Young Republican       Woman in South Dakota and represented South Dakota as the       state's Young Republican National Committee woman in 1961. In       1963 she was elected Vice Chairman of the National Young       Republican Federation.        In 1973, she moved from Lemmon to Washington, D.C. to be a       Press Secretary for then Congressman James Abdnor when he was       elected to the U.S. House of Representatives. She followed       Abdnor to the U.S. Senate in 1981 as the Senator's personal       secretary. As the Washington Post noted in 1986, Jane was       ``the embodiment of that Hill legend--the furiously devoted       personal secretary, a combination mother, wife and watchdog,       protecting as she sees best the beloved senator behind the       door.''        Boorman joined the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA)       in 1987 as Director of Communications after President Ronald       Reagan appointed Abdnor as Administrator of the SBA. During       her 28 years at the Agency, Jane held various positions       including managing the agency's relationship with SCORE and       coordinating activities when international delegations       visited the SBA. She retired from the SBA in 2015.        In Washington, she made her home at Riverside Condominium       for 48 years and was active on the condo board, Southwest       Neighborhood Assembly, and was a long-time organist at Fort       Leslie J. McNair, and at St. Dominic Catholic Church.        Although she lived in Washington DC, Jane maintained a       strong foothold in South Dakota through memberships in the       S.D. Newspaper Association, the S.D. Historical Society, and       in championing growth for her hometown of Lemmon. She was       also a lifetime member of the Society of Professional       Journalists.        She is survived by her brother Bruce Boorman, Santee,       California, and numerous nieces and nephews. Jane was       preceded in her death by her parents and a sister, Katherine       Becker, Hartford, Wisconsin.        In remembrance of Jane Boorman's life, the family asks that       any charitable donations be made to WETA, Jane's favorite       classical music station or to Jewish Social Service Agency       (JSSA), her amazing hospice care team.        Memorial services will be held in Washington, D.C. and       Lemmon, S.D after the pandemic threat has diminished.                            ____________________
