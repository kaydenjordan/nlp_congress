 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in  recognition of our strong partnership with Germany. Our partnership  runs deep, with Germany being the third largest foreign employer in the  United States and Germans investing more than $1.8 trillion in the U.S.  from 2020 to 2022.  [[Page H5944]]    Today, there are more than 40 million Americans of German descent  living in the United States, and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania  boasts one of the largest German populations in the country.   As co-chairman of the Congressional German American Caucus, I was  proud to be joined today by my colleague, Congressman Keating, in  introducing the resolution on reaffirming German-American friendship  and cooperation initiative. This resolution reaffirms the importance of  the alliance between the United States and Germany, underscoring our  shared commitment to democracy and freedom.   In addition, this resolution highlights the great connections between  the United States and Germany. Our bond is based on friendship,  historical ties, and shared values. These historical ties include the  Wunderbar Together program as well as the Congress-Bundestag Youth  Exchange program, which is celebrating its 40th anniversary this year.    Earlier this month, we celebrated the 34th anniversary of the fall of  the Berlin Wall. Let's continue our strong bilateral ties and close  cooperation on the global stage.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman  for her leadership with this bipartisan Rural Healthcare Caucus.   It is incredibly important and really defines my life. Prior to  coming to Congress 15 years ago, I spent 28 years working in rural  healthcare as a nonprofit community healthcare therapist, rehab service  manager, a manager within rural hospitals, and a licensed nursing home  administrator. I witnessed firsthand the challenges that individuals  that live in rural America, rural communities face when it comes to  healthcare.   I am acutely aware of the challenges many face when it comes to  obtaining reasonably priced healthcare. It is especially critical for  rural America, much like the 15th Congressional District of  Pennsylvania that I have the privilege of serving today.   As a Member of Congress representing nearly one-third of the land  mass of Pennsylvania, one of the most rural districts east of the  Mississippi, I am keenly aware of the problems my constituents face  when accessing medical services.   I always say that when I see rural hospitals in dire challenges, and  we are struggling with some of that right now in our district, that the  end results in a commute that can mean the difference between life and  death to be able to get the services they need within the time frame  that is required.   I saw that firsthand, quite frankly, as a volunteer firefighter and  emergency medical technician for several decades. The importance of  being able to get from that accident scene or from their home to a  healthcare setting, a hospital setting in a timely manner, especially  for those eventually requiring some type of surgery.   We talk about the golden hour. It is not an hour in many parts of  rural America. We are facing a healthcare crisis in our Nation's rural  areas. These often disadvantaged populations are still struggling to  access affordable, quality care. Many remain uninsured. Most are  underinsured. However, access to quality care remains the largest  challenge.   Even if it is not the bricks and mortar, and we have seen so many of  those closed over the past 15 years, it is the talent, the skill, the  expertise within that bricks and mortar, the physicians, the nurses,  the technicians. It is difficult.   As someone who used to participate in recruiting this talent into our  rural hospitals, it is very challenging to get that, to be able to be  successful with that. That is why I am a big fan of telemedicine.   I am really excited about the advances that we have made in  telemedicine over the past decade or so. There is more that needs to be  done.   Even when people gain access to health insurance, it does not equal  access to healthcare. Rural hospitals across the country are closing,  leaving patients without access to the emergency rooms and long-term  care facilities. Quite frankly, where they are not closing, they are  always struggling for staff. If you don't have access to qualified  healthcare professionals, I don't care how we pay for healthcare, what  kind of shiny package, what ribbon we put on it, there is no access to  healthcare without those qualified, highly skilled providers.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to work with the gentlewoman as a part of  this caucus, and proud to be a founding member of the Rural Health  Caucus. I am proud to work with the gentlewoman as a great member of  the House Agriculture Committee, where under the Rural Development  title, we support facilities like nursing homes and rehabilitation  centers and hospitals and provide communities reasonable funding to be  able to address that need.   This is a problem. It is a multidimensional problem that requires  multidimensional solutions. I think that the formation of this caucus  is one of the first best starts to address this.   This bipartisan group will bring awareness to these unique  challenges, to other members, and actively work to find solutions to  these problems.
