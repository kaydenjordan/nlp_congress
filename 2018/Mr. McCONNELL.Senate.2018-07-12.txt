 Madam President, the President of the United States  made a superb choice. He chose to fill a place on the Nation's highest  Court with one of the Nation's brightest legal minds. Brett Kavanaugh  brings unimpeachable academic credentials as a student at Yale and a  lecturer at Harvard. He carries over a decade of experience ruling from  the Nation's most consequential circuit court. Along the way, he has  earned the admiration and praise of his peers--legal professionals with  all manner of judicial and political philosophies--for his professional  abilities and his experience, as well as qualities that simply go  beyond his resume.   Nevertheless, the instant Judge Kavanaugh was announced, far-left  groups and some of our own Democratic colleagues in the Senate started  pushing the same old scare tactics. More than a week before the  nomination, one Democratic Senator explained on cable news that  President Trump's nominee, whoever it was, would threaten ``the  destruction of the Constitution, as far as I can tell.'' The President  hadn't even named his selection, and already our entire system of  government was on its last legs? Give me a break. This Senator, by the  way, serves on the Judiciary Committee.   One leftwing group had an angry press release all ready to go for  whoever the nominee would be, but after Judge Kavanaugh's nomination  was announced, they forgot to fill in his name. They had the press  release ready with a big blank there, and they forgot to fill in the  name. They wound up decrying all the terrible things that would happen  if we confirmed the President's ``nomination of blank to the Supreme  Court,'' and they sent it out. That kind of says it all--fill-in-the- blank opposition.   Our Democratic friends have learned Judge Kavanaugh's name by now,  but the hysterical attacks haven't gotten any less desperate or any  more sensible. No sooner are these silly attacks launched than they are  beaten back by the facts.   One of the flavors of the week was the outlandish claim that in law  review articles he wrote 10 or 20 years ago, Judge Kavanaugh supposedly  said that sitting Presidents cannot be held accountable under the law.  Some far-left special interests claimed he said that. So did some  congressional Democrats. It was the perfect conspiracy theory, catnip  for their far-left base. The only problem was, it wasn't true. People  who have actually looked at these articles note that Judge Kavanaugh  ``does not reach legal conclusions on issues'' of Presidential  accountability. If anything, he seems to arrive at the opposite  conclusion of what has been alleged.   Professor Noah Feldman of Harvard Law School observed that ``from a  legal and constitutional perspective,'' Judge Kavanaugh ``wasn't saying  that the courts should find that the President shouldn't be  investigated'' or held accountable; ``to the contrary.'' To the  contrary. Professor Feldman observes that Judge Kavanaugh's logic would  seem to imply that any President is open to being investigated and held  accountable under the law. Here is how Professor Feldman finished his  debunking of this unfair attack. This is what he said: ``Trying to  oppose him on logically backward grounds doesn't serve anyone's  interests.''   The Washington Post Fact Checker jumped on the Democrats'  mischaracterization. It explained that Judge Kavanaugh's scholarly  articles actually contained ``a mainstream view'' on this  constitutional question. They blasted the Democratic rhetoric as ``an  extreme distortion of what he has written.''   Let me sum that up. According to the Washington Post, it is Judge  Kavanaugh's analysis that is mainstream. It is the distortions of his  record by congressional Democrats and far-left special interest groups  that are extreme.   We have a word for blatantly misrepresenting the record and character  of a judicial nominee in order to achieve a political objective. We  call it an attempt to Bork the nominee. It refers to how Judge Robert  Bork was  [[Page S4924]]  slandered in the 1980s, when people both inside and outside the  Congress blatantly and shamelessly distorted his record to claim he  would do terrible things if confirmed to the Supreme Court.   It is actually in the dictionary now, literally. Judge Bork's last  name is in the Merriam-Webster Dictionary as a verb. This is what  ``Bork'' means: ``to attack or defeat (a nominee or candidate for  public office) unfairly through an organized campaign of harsh public  criticism or vilification.'' To be Borked is now in the dictionary. It  is completely unfair vilification.   Looking back, most people agree now that this episode was grossly  unfair, insulted the intelligence of the American people, and stained  the history of the U.S. Senate.   Jeffrey Rosen was a Democrat who worked in Senator Biden's office on  the Democrats' side during that episode. Here is what he wrote a few  years ago:         I remember feeling that the nominee was being treated       unfairly. Senator Edward Kennedy set the tone with a       demagogic attack. . . . Bork's record was distorted beyond       recognition. . . . It [was] bad for the country.    This was a man named Jeffrey Rosen--a Democrat--who worked in Senator  Biden's office during this episode.   Here is what a lawyer who helped lead the anti-Bork effort wrote just  last year:         I regret my part in what I now regard as a terrible       political mistake.    He was seized with guilt after all these years of having participated  in this Borking. Because of that episode, he goes on, ``we have  undermined public confidence in the judiciary.''   There is widespread and bipartisan agreement that trying to Bork  judicial nominees is harmful to our Democratic process and to our  judiciary.   Judge Kavanaugh's impressive record, impeccable credentials, and his  enormous, bipartisan fan club of judicial peers and legal scholars all  attest to the outstanding service he would render on the Supreme Court.  I am glad that outside fact checkers are already swatting down  Democrats' desperate attacks on his nomination.   In a breaking-news bombshell report just last night, we learned that  Judge Kavanaugh enjoys America's pastime. Investigative reporters  scoured his financial disclosures and learned that he and his friends  buy tickets to baseball games and that he pays his bills. As you can  see, there is still plenty of silliness to go around.   I urge every one of my colleagues to treat Judge Kavanaugh's record  truthfully and treat the confirmation process with the respect that it  and this institution in which we serve deserve. We need to act like a  responsible United States Senate going through a confirmation process  to the United States Supreme Court.                            ____________________     Madam President, on another matter, while Judge  Kavanaugh's nomination has filled the headlines this week, the Senate  has continued to attend to important business. Yesterday, the Senate  voted to proceed to conference with the House on the first three of  this year's appropriations bills. I understand the conferees are  planning to meet as soon as today. The day before, we voted to go to  conference on this year's Defense authorization bill. Soon, we will do  the same with respect to the farm bill.   I am proud that we are continuing to deliver on our commitment to  bring regular order back to the appropriations process, along with  attending to the needs of our Armed Forces and confirming more of the  President's nominees. Let's keep this momentum going. I hope the  collaborative, bipartisan approach that Chairman Shelby, Senator Leahy,  and our subcommittee chairmen have brought to the appropriations  process will continue to characterize our progress on the floor as  well. With continued hard work and steady cooperation, we can achieve  our shared goal of funding our government through the regular  appropriations process.                            ____________________     Madam President, on one final matter, the evidence  keeps mounting that with Republicans at the helm in the White House,  the House, and the Senate, the American people are enjoying what  amounts to the most pro-worker, pro-opportunity economic moment in  recent history.   Already in 2018, the number of Americans who say it is a good time to  find a quality job has risen to its highest level in at least 17 years  of data on record. The jobs report released last week showed, in June,  that the rate of hire throughout the United States hit an 11-year high.   Interestingly, American workers voluntarily left their jobs at the  highest rate in 17 years. What that means--and I would like to drill  down on that point for a moment--is that during the Obama  administration, we heard a great deal of talk from our Democratic  friends about a phenomenon they called job lock.   The idea was that many workers were trapped in jobs that did not pay  enough or did not take full advantage of their skills because there  weren't enough open opportunities to justify taking the leap and  looking for a better position.   Republicans agreed with our Democratic colleagues that we could build  a better economy for middle-class workers. We just didn't think tax  increases and massive new regulations were the way to do it. Now,  following a year and a half of Republican policies, including historic  tax reform, the voluntary quit rate has hit a 17-year high. Workers now  feel free to climb up the ladder and move on to bigger and better  things.   I have just one more data point: This economy is thriving, and the  Republicans' bold agenda is helping to make it happen.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I move to proceed to legislative  session.
