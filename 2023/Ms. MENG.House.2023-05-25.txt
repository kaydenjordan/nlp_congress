 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my Republican  colleagues--although I don't see them--to put people over politics. I  invite five of my Republican colleagues to simply sign the petition to  raise the debt ceiling.   This will directly impact my Queens' families if action is not taken.  It would kill over 7,000 jobs in my district, jeopardize Social  Security payments for over 85,000 families, threaten retirement savings  of over 100,000 people.   This Memorial Day weekend, it is not enough to march in parades and  post pictures on social media. Republicans are risking benefits for  over 300,000 people in my district alone that rely on Medicare,  Medicaid, or veterans' health coverage.   Smiling and posing for pictures with veterans as they work to cut  veterans' benefits and lay off first responders, that is unacceptable.   We just need five Republican colleagues to save our country.                            ____________________
