 Madam Speaker, as we reach the middle of 2021, this  House has made incredible progress, including fighting the global  pandemic by passing the American Rescue Plan.   Already, more than 300 million vaccine shots have been administered.  Communities are opening up, and business is picking up, creating jobs  and opportunity.   Next month, parents will begin receiving their monthly child tax  credit, legislation that will cut the Nation's child poverty rate in  half.   We have a pathway to recovery and transformation that offers real  promise to every American. But underneath all of this, our country  faces a deep divide that threatens to undo the foundations upon which  our country rests.   These divisions reached an apex on January 6, when our Capitol came  under attack and five people died.                                time  1215    The immediate threat to the Capitol may have receded, but the threat  across the country still simmers.   It is therefore imperative that we fully understand the events  leading up to and including the siege on the Capitol on January 6.   As someone who was here in the gallery during the attack, someone who  watched in horror as they rushed the Speaker off the floor, who took  cover as the Capitol Police barricaded the door against the mob, who  fully understands the cost to our Nation and the implications of simply  moving on, I am personally, deeply invested in preventing such an  attack on our Capitol from ever happening again.   The divide in our Nation threatens the prospects of our recovery and  the potential for America to lead on the global stage.   Congress must now work in unison, Democrats and Republicans, to  institute the policies we need to prevent future acts of domestic  extremism. For years, I have worked to pass legislation like the  Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act that would invest in the types of  programs built to spot and intervene in this type of extremism.   When my friend Republican Congressman   John Katko negotiated a  bipartisan committee to investigate January 6, he did it because he  knew the stakes we faced as a Nation.   The work of the Select Committee will be essential to history's  understanding of what took place on January 6 and protecting the future  of our Republic.   My hope is that the members of this committee will be committed to  the  [[Page H3161]]  sober and relentless pursuit of the truth so that such a crisis never  happens again.                            ____________________
