 Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend for yielding and  allowing me the opportunity to speak.   I rise today in support of H.R. 3119, the Energy Emergency Leadership  Act. I thank my good friend from Illinois, Mr.   Bobby Rush, for  continuing to work with me to get this bill across the finish line.   This is the third Congress in a row that we have introduced this  bill, each time passing the Committee on Energy and Commerce with  unanimous, bipartisan support.   And frankly, given what we have seen just over the last few months in  disruptions to our energy supply--including the Colonial Pipeline  attack--it is well past due for this important energy security measure  to be enacted in law.   Mr. Speaker, our Nation's economy and the health and safety of the  American public depend upon the reliable and uninterrupted supply of  fuels and electricity.   Hazards of all forms--including natural disasters, digital, and  cyberattacks--are no longer just threats. They are occurring at an  alarming and continuing rate.   Whether it is power outages in Texas and California due to weather  events, or foreign adversaries hacking into our pipelines or grid, it  is critical that we better equip our Federal agencies to prevent and  respond to attacks in a way that fully protects the public.   Presidential administrations of both parties have recognized this by  providing the Department of Energy with the responsibilities,  expertise, and tools to ensure the reliable supply of energy.   It is time Congress does its part by requiring the energy emergency  and cybersecurity functions at DOE to be organized under the leadership  of an assistant secretary confirmed by the Senate. This will ensure the  Department has focused and accountable leadership with high-level  continuity throughout future administrations.   H.R. 3119 will encourage more effective and seamless information- sharing with Federal and industry stakeholders on energy security  threats, risks, and incidents, as well as recovery and response.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of H.R. 3119 in  order to protect our Nation's electric infrastructure from foreign  adversaries who are attempting to disrupt our energy system and cause  untold harm to our economy, our daily lives, and our national security.    Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3003, the  Promoting United States Wireless Leadership Act of 2021.   I want to thank my colleague from Michigan, Representative Dingell,  as well as my fellow 5G Caucus co-chairs, Congressman Bill Johnson and  Congresswoman Ann Kuster, for working with me on this important  legislation to enhance United States' leadership in the development of  wireless standards.   H.R. 3003 directs the NTIA to assist and encourage participation by  trusted companies, both large and small, in international  telecommunications standards-setting bodies like 3GPP and IEEE. These  independent business-led entities determine the standards by which 5G  operators, equipment manufacturers, software providers, and others  build to.   Not surprisingly, countries like China are increasingly asserting  their influence in these bodies in order to skew tech standards toward  Chinese-controlled companies and their technologies.   We need a unified approach to push back against international  competitors like Russia and China in order to protect U.S. national  security, global competitiveness, and cost-effectiveness of wireless  communications. Our bill does just that.   H.R. 3003 will undoubtedly help ensure the U.S. remains a leader in  the future of tech.                            ____________________
