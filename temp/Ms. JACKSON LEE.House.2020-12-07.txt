 Mr. Speaker, as a cosponsor and a senior Member of  the House of Representatives, I rise in strong support of this  bipartisan resolution, H. Res. 512, ``Calling for the global repeal of  blasphemy, heresy, and apostasy laws''.   First and foremost, I would like to recognize and thank Congressman  Jamie Raskin for his leadership on this vital resolution.   Mr. Speaker, this resolution calls upon the President and the  Department of State to prioritize the repeal of blasphemy, heresy, and  apostasy laws in bilateral relationships between the United States and  countries that have such laws.   It also designates countries that enforce such laws as ``countries of  particular concern'' with respect to religious freedom.   Furthermore, H. Res. 512 opposes efforts by the United Nations to  implement an international anti-blasphemy norm.   Lastly, the resolution calls on the governments of countries that  enforce such laws to either amend or repeal them as well as to release  anyone imprisoned pursuant to them.   Blasphemy laws, as is noted in the resolution, lead to religious  intolerance, discrimination and violence.   Moreover, these laws are often weaponized to target marginalized  religious communities.   Charges can be based on false accusations and are commonly brought  forth for sectarian or political purposes.   In 2019, the United States Commission on International Religious  Freedom released its 20th Annual Report, recommending that the U.S.  Department of State designate sixteen nations as ``countries of  particular concern'' due to their severe suppression of religious  freedom.   For example: In Burma, a predominantly Buddhist nation, the Rohingya  Muslim people have been subject to what the U.N. high commissioner for  human rights has called ``a textbook example of ethnic cleansing'';   In China, over 1 million ethnic Uyghur and Kazakh Muslims have been  arbitrarily detained in concentration camps styled as ``political  education'' camps, where they are subject to torture and inhumane  conditions;   In Iran, the Baha'i community is treated by the government as a band  of heretics, and, as of February 2017, at least 90 Baha'i were held in  prison solely for their religious beliefs;   In Russia, Jehovah's Witnesses have been banned as an extremist  group, and their properties have been seized and liquidated by order of  the government. Dozens of individuals have been arrested on extremism  charges and remain in custody or under house arrest; and   The right to worship freely is one of the founding and most essential  principles of the United States.   As the world's oldest democracy, America has a responsibility to  protect the freedoms of speech, expression, and religion against  official persecution around the world.   Throughout my tenure in Congress, I have been a fierce defender of  human rights, and this resolution is a small but important step in  safeguarding the individual freedoms of choosing one's religion, or no  religion at all, as well as worshipping and thinking freely no matter  where you live.   With this in mind, I am proud to be a leader on this resolution, and  I urge all Members on both sides of the aisle to join me in voting for  H. Res. 512, ``Calling for the global repeal of blasphemy, heresy, and  apostasy laws.''    Mr. Speaker, as a senior Member of the House of  Representatives and the founding chair of the Congressional Children's  Caucus, I rise in strong support of this bipartisan resolution, H. Res.  189, ``Recognizing the importance of sustained United States leadership  to accelerating global progress against maternal and child malnutrition  and supporting United States Agency for International Development's  commitment to global nutrition through its multisectoral nutrition  strategy.''   First and foremost, I would like to recognize and thank Congressmen  Roger Marshall and Jim McGovern for their leadership on this vital  resolution.   By passing H. Res. 189 today, we are committing ourselves to  improving the health of women and children in impoverished areas,  helping prevent illness, and improving economic conditions in poorer  countries.   With that in mind, I wish to commend the U.S. Agency for  International Development's (USAID) maternal and child nutrition  programs that seek to improve health outcomes by implementing  nutrition-specific interventions, or those that address the immediate,  health-related determinants of undernutrition.   These critical investments are closely coordinated with USAID's  nutrition-sensitive interventions that address underlying or systemic  causes of inadequate nutrition, such as education, water, sanitation,  and hygiene, agriculture, as well as the healthy timing and spacing of  pregnancy.   It is no secret that poverty amplifies the risk of, and risks from,  malnutrition.   People who are poor are more likely to be affected by different forms  of malnutrition.   Furthermore, malnutrition increases health care costs, reduces  productivity, and slows economic growth, which can perpetuate a cycle  of poverty and ill-health.   Malnutrition can have several negative and deadly effects such as  decreased cognitive development in newborns, greater vulnerability to  disease and other issues.   Women, infants, children, and adolescents are at particular risk of  malnutrition.   Optimizing nutrition early in life, especially from the 1,000 days  from conception to a child's second birthday ensures the best possible  start in life, with long-term benefits.   For example, adults who were not malnourished as children earn nearly  46 percent more than their counterparts, as stated in the resolution.   According to UNICEF, nearly half of all deaths in children under 5  are attributable to undernutrition.   Mr. Speaker, I would be remiss if I stood here today without  addressing the global impact of COVID-19 on malnutrition.   Today, the significant and life-altering shocks created by the  pandemic and the necessary containment measures have meant that more  vulnerable children are facing malnourishment, as efforts to mitigate  the transmission of COVID-19 have resulted in the disruption of food  systems, thereby upending health and nutrition services, devastating  livelihoods, as well as threatening food security.   As of July 2020, an estimated 370 million children were missing  school meals, which have been directly tied to improving students'  health and nutrition while also helping them develop good eating  habits.   Recent estimates from UNICEF indicate that in addition to the 690  million undernourished people in 2019, at least another 83 million  people, and possibly as many as 132 million, may go hungry in 2020.   Mr. Speaker, this resolution is needed now more than ever, and I am  proud to be here and voice my support for it.   I urge all Members on both sides of the aisle to join me in voting  for H. Res. 189, ``Recognizing the importance of sustained United  States leadership to accelerating global progress against maternal and  child malnutrition and supporting United States Agency for  International Development's commitment to global nutrition through its  multi-sectoral nutrition strategy.''    Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the Judiciary,  Homeland, and Budget Committees, I rise in strong support of S. 1153,  the ``Stop Student Debt Relief Scams Act,'' which helps protect  borrowers from deceptive student debt relief scams by enhancing law  enforcement and administrative abilities to identify and shut down such  student debt relief scams.   With ordinary Americans facing nearly $1.5 trillion in student loan  debt, borrowers are looking for relief wherever they can find it but  unfortunately many borrowers do not receive the right information about  how to find out and qualify for opportunities to get help with lowering  or postponing their payments or applying for relief, nearly all of  which is available for free.   These include income-driven repayment, deferment, forbearance,  consolidation, rehabilitation, and even some programs for loan  forgiveness.   Debt relief scams falsely promise borrowers a quick fix with little  hassle and their business model is to robocall student loan borrowers  until they agree to pay thousands of dollars in unnecessary and  exorbitant fees for services that are already available for free.   They claim to reduce or forgive borrowers' student debt and take care  of all the paperwork.   Some even purport to be associated with the federal government.   Most victims of these deceptive debt relief scams are not only  defrauded by the companies that promised to help them, but unknowingly  become delinquent on their payments and default on their loans, miss  communications with their servicers, and fall even deeper into debt.   S. 1153, the Stop Student Debt Relief Scams Act of 2019 would  accelerate the end to this rampant misconduct.   Specifically, the Stop Student Debt Relief Scams Act of 2019 will  enhance law enforcement and administrative abilities to identify and  shut down student debt relief scams by:   Clarifying that it is a federal crime to access U.S. Department of  Education information technology systems for fraud, commercial  advantage, or private financial gain, and fines scammers up to $20,000,  up to 5 years imprisonment, or both, for violations of the law;   Directing the U.S. Department of Education to create a new form of  third-party access, akin to the current ``preparer'' function on the  Free Application for Student Aid (FAFSA) for those applying on behalf  of a student and their family, in order to protect legitimate  organizations--such as legal aid groups--that help borrowers navigate  repayment;   Requiring the U.S. Department of Education to maintain commonsense  reporting, detection, and prevention activities to stop potential or  known debt relief scams; and   Requiring student loan exit counseling to warn federal loan borrowers  about debt relief  [[Page H6883]]  scams, in recognition of the fact that borrowers may fall prey to false  promises because they lack sufficient information on legitimate  programs to help them manage repayment.   This is needed legislation and I am pleased it has been endorsed by  Education Finance Council, Generation Progress, National Consumer Law  Center (on behalf of its low income clients), National Council of  Higher Education Resources, Student Loan Servicing Alliance, The  Institute for College Access and Success, and Young Invincibles.   I urge all Members to join me in voting for S. 1153, the ``Stop  Student Debt Relief Scams Act.''                                time  1400     Mr. Speaker, there are 14.8 million cases of COVID- 19, now some 282,000 deaths. In the State of Texas, there are 1.3  million, an increase of 10,000 cases and 23,000-plus deaths. The  numbers keep going up. The scientists predict that we may have as many  as 500,000 deaths by March 2021.   There has to be a national protocol of wearing masks, socially  distancing, and washing your hands. But as we begin to do the vaccines,  there must be a public understanding of, one, the safety of those  vaccines; but, number two, the vaccines should be distributed in our  small and local hospitals that our communities are familiar with along  with local health facilities.   We will be working to ensure that populations--people of color and  indigenous people who are impacted--have access to vaccines where they  are familiar with medical professionals. That should be the route of  the United States Congress and pass the COVID-19 package not next week,  but this week.   Our constituents are desperate.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I  also thank the gentleman for bringing us together on such an important  moment, and of course, as he reflected on the fact that I think we were  together just a few years ago in the National Archives commemorating  the importance of these amendments, but also the Emancipation  Proclamation.   And for those of us in Texas or in places past the Mississippi, if I  might start with the question of freedom, we did not get the full  impact of freedom until 1865. Abraham Lincoln proclaimed the slaves  free with his pronouncement in 1863, and then it took General Granger 2  years to come and present that to those of us west of the Mississippi.   This is why I think this moment on the floor of the House, Mr.  Speaker and Mr. Butterfield, is a sacred and somber moment. We can  declare this a normal course of business, Mr. Mfume, that we are on the  floor debating, as we usually do, but I really call this a sacred  moment because it is a moment to educate the American people. It is a  moment to go full circle, if you will, to all of the social justice  advocacies that we have done, all of the issues that pretended to  divide us.   I think the reason is that, does anyone understand the legacy of  those who are descendants of enslaved Africans?   That we had to wait for an amendment to give us the fullness of a  human being. We were not counted as human beings fully when the  Constitution was written.   Just imagine coming from a legacy where you were not counted as one,  you were counted less than one. And until this amendment, the idea of  slavery of which we had been property, counted as property. So I think  it is important to read the 13th Amendment: ``Neither slavery nor  involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the  party shall have been fully convicted, shall exist within the United  States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction. Congress shall have  the power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.''   Think of that. Even indentured servants had a different status than  anyone who was a descendent of enslaved Africans who came to this  country in 1619 and a little bit before. That is what we discuss today.  That is the issue of the 13th Amendment. And it is important to realize  that the Framers never used the words slave, shareholder, master, or  slavery anywhere in the Constitution. That is almost to say that we had  no valid space even in a negative connotation.   So to actually realize why this is so sacred, let me give you some of  history. By 1861, when the Civil War broke out, more than four million  people--nearly all of them African decent--were enslaved in 15 Southern  and border States. By 1862, President Abraham Lincoln came to believe  firmly that emancipating enslaved people in the South would help the  Union crush the Confederate rebellion and win the Civil War. We became  a practical part of saving the Union. We became the cornerstone, the  descendents of enslaved Africans.   The question of slavery was not based upon the brutality of the  separation of families, the beating that was suffered, the sheer  brutality of it. No, it was not that. I do not find fault for that era,  but people need to understand that it was not because someone bowed  their heads--they were the abolitionists--and said, Oh, how sad it is  that human beings are being held in bondage. We became a calculating  force.   But look at the numbers. Four million enslaved. One would wonder why  this is a sacred moment on the floor of the House.   So Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation, which took effect in 1863,  announced that all enslaved people held in the States--then in  rebellion against the United States--shall be then there forward and  forever free.   But the Emancipation Proclamation itself did not end slavery in the  United States, as it only applied to the 11 Confederate States then at  war against the Union.   Remember, we became the practical cornerstone of trying to end the  war, to stop the rebellion, and to preserve the Union. I am glad the  Union was preserved. I am glad we are the United States of America.   Yet it is so crucial in the understanding of even this year of 2020,  even understanding the horrors of George Floyd's death, what his family  still suffers, and why there was such a rage of young people and why  the words ``Black Lives Matter'' came because of the brutality of our  history, and here, in the 21st century, we are still suffering from the  inequities of those that did not understand not only the question of  justice, but also the question of the brutality and the history of  slavery.    Maybe there would have been a better understanding if a little  history was woven into where we are today. As I indicated, the  Emancipation Proclamation did not do it because, as it said, it did not  deal with States like Massachusetts and Ohio, to my understanding. It  did not deal with those States.   In April 1864, the United States Senate passed a proposed amendment  banning slavery with the necessary two-thirds majority, but it faulted  in the House of Representatives as more and more Democrats refused to  support it. So it was not an easy journey.   When Congress reconvened in December 1864, the emboldened Republicans  put the proposed amendment up for a vote again, and Lincoln threw  himself in the legislative process, something that gives leadership and  substance to the idea of freeing slaves, freeing human beings.   The Constitution now is a stronger document because, as he put  himself into this, Lincoln and his allies see what is before you to  focus on the most important thing that this amendment protects the  slaves now born and in the United States, but also the millions yet to  be born. He was committed to the passage of the 13th Amendment. He  authorizes allies to entice House members with plum positions and other  inducements, reportedly telling them: I leave it to you to determine  how it shall be done, but remember that I am President of the United  States, cloaked with immense power, and I expect you to procure the  votes.   The whip is on the floor, Mr. Clyburn. I am all the sudden elevated  in my capacity as a whip because this President Lincoln was determined  to have his agents on the floor use that authority to get what needed  to be done. On January 31, 1865, the House of Representatives passed  the proposed amendment with a vote of 119-56, with the required two- thirds majority.   Mr. Speaker, I started out by saying this is a sacred moment. I hope  the people at home and our colleagues can see what slavery represented,  the brutality of the back of this slave. It didn't take much to be  whipped, whipped, and whipped. So scarred, so brutalized that you were  almost to death. Or to see a family so like chattel, so like property,  so demeaned. Families separated, babies separated. Children becoming  more valuable than mom and dad; dad becoming more valuable.   And I remember reading the Slave Narratives, and they said that a  woman told her slave husband to come home quick from where he was  working in another plantation because they are getting ready to sell  their children in one place and her in another. We need you home, she  said.   Who would imagine that human beings would have collars around their  necks, slavery so brutal that it was unspeakable and could not be  heard?   So today, as we commemorate the 155th anniversary of this important  step, realizing that it had to go through as an amendment to all of the  States, what a journey it was.   I think the words of Sojourner Truth are telling, and that is why we  fought to have her busts, her statue here when she was at an  abolitionist meeting and someone said, Yes, sir, what do you want? And  she said, Ain't I a woman? I born 13 children and I have seen most all  of them sold into slavery.   That is why we are on the floor today. We are on the floor today  because of the continued misunderstanding of race in this Nation.   We are on the floor today because more of us need to understand what  H.R. 40 is all about. It is a magnificent piece of legislation that  deals with the questions of the commission to study and develop  reparation proposals. It is a reflection of the history of African  Americans in this country. It is a simple process of getting a  commission that dignifies what happened to us and  [[Page H6892]]  looks for reconciliation and restoration and proposal to deal  systemically with the ongoing disasters that we see in our respective  communities, from disparities in healthcare, COVID-19, housing, the  criminal justice system, education. That is why we stand here today.   So I thank Mr. Butterfield for yielding, and I thank this body for  understanding this is a sacred moment.   Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of this body and the Committee on the  Judiciary, I am pleased to join my colleagues in this Special Order  marking the anniversary of the passage on December 6, 1865 of the 13th  Amendment to the Constitution and celebrating the passage of the 14th  and 15th Amendments, known as the Civil Rights Amendments.   I thank my colleague, Congressman Butterfield, for anchoring this  important Special Order and am remembering our late colleague, John  Lewis, a great and beloved man, who risked and gave his life to make  real the promise of those amendments.   The 13th Amendment, the first of the three great Civil War  Amendments, was passed in 1865 and abolished slavery.   The 14th Amendment conferred citizenship on the newly emancipated  slaves, and the 1st Amendment prohibited abridging the right to vote on  account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude.   Taken together, these amendments were intended and have the effect of  making former slaves, and their descendants, full and equal members of  the political community known as the United States of America.   By 1861, when the Civil War broke out, more than 4 million people  (nearly all of them of African descent) were enslaved in 15 southern  and border states.   By 1862, President Abraham Lincoln came to believe firmly that  emancipating enslaved people in the South would help the Union crush  the Confederate rebellion and win the Civil War.   Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation, which took effect in 1863,  announced that all enslaved people held in the states ``then in  rebellion against the United States, shall be then, thenceforward, and  forever free.''   But the Emancipation Proclamation itself did not end slavery in the  United States, as it only applied to the 11 Confederate states then at  war against the Union, and only to the portion of those states not  already under Union control.   To make emancipation permanent would take a constitutional amendment  abolishing the institution of slavery itself.   In April 1864, the U.S. Senate passed a proposed amendment banning  slavery with the necessary two-thirds majority but it faltered in the  House of Representatives, as more and more Democrats refused to support  it.   When Congress reconvened in December 1864, the emboldened Republicans  put the proposed amendment up for vote again and Lincoln threw himself  in the legislative process, inviting individual representatives to his  office to discuss the amendment and putting pressure on border-state  Unionists (who had previously opposed it) to change their position.   Lincoln was committed to the passage of the 13th Amendment, telling  his allies to ``see what is before you, to focus on the most important  thing; that this Amendment protects the slaves now born and in the  United States, but settles the question for all time for the millions  yet to be born.''   He authorized his allies to entice House members with plum positions  and other inducements, reportedly telling them: ``I leave it to you to  determine how it shall be done; but remember that I am President of the  United States, clothed with immense power, and I expect you to procure  those votes.''   On January 31, 1865, the House of Representatives passed the proposed  amendment with a vote of 119-56, just over the required two-thirds  majority, and the following day, Lincoln approved a joint resolution of  Congress submitting it to the state legislatures for ratification.   Mr. Speaker, the United States is the world's only superpower and  boasts the largest economy in the history of the world and for many  years was the world's indispensable nation and the example that all  aspiring democracies wished to emulate.   But at the same time, this nation has also been home to many searing  instances of social unrest resulting from racial injustices, as we  witnessed this year on the streets of big cities and small towns in  urban and rural communities.   We saw Americans, by the millions across the country, coming from all  races and ages, engaging in what the late John Lewis called ``good  trouble'' by protesting and demanding an end to the systemic racial  inequality in our criminal justice system that too often victimizes and  disproportionately treats black Americans worse, ceteris paribus, when  it comes to suspicion, apprehension, arrest, detention, trial,  sentencing, and incarceration.   While the brutal deaths of George Floyd in Minneapolis and Breanna  Taylor in Louisville shocked the conscience of the nation, most black  Americans will tell you what they experienced is not new, but has been  occurring for generations, if not centuries.   What is critically important to understand is that the instances of  brutal and unfair treatment the nation has witnessed this year cannot  be attributed to the proverbial few ``bad apples in the bushel'' but is  instead the foreseeable consequence of systemic racism and racial  inequality in the system.   Not just the criminal justice system, but the health care system, the  economic system, and the educational system to name the most glaring  examples.   To find our way out of this dark time, we need to understand how it  came to be.   That is why in January 2019, I introduced H.R. 40, which establishes  a commission to examine slavery and discrimination in the colonies and  the United States from 1619 to the present and recommend appropriate  remedies.   Among other requirements, the commission shall identify (1) the role  of federal and state governments in supporting the institution of  slavery; (2) forms of discrimination in the public and private sectors  against freed slaves and their descendants; and (3) lingering negative  effects of slavery on living African-Americans and society.   Official slavery ended with the Civil War and ratification of the  Thirteenth Amendment.   But unofficial slavery was continued with the new institution of  sharecrop farming, a criminal justice system that would press convicts  into work once done by slaves, and labor policies that dictated income  for work done based upon skin color.   And, of course, all of this was reinforced by the systematic  disenfranchisement of black Americans, the ``discrete and insular  minority'' excluded from ``those political processes ordinarily to be  relied upon to protect'' them, to quote Chief Justice Hughes' famous  Carolene Products Footnote 4.   For these reasons, the history of the United States is intertwined  with the history of enslaved Africans in the Americas.   There is blood and there are tears, but there is also redemption and  reconciliation.    But to get there, we must have the complete truth and lay our  history bare.   It is the light that sheds the way to the more perfect union all  Americans want .   The Commission created and empowered by H.R. 40 is a necessary first  step in that effort to get to truth and reconciliation about the  Original Sin of American Slavery that is necessary to light the way to  the beloved community we all seek.   Finally, I join all my colleagues in pointing out that the most  fitting and proper means of paying tribute to the beloved John Lewis's  extraordinary life is for the Senate to immediately take up and pass  the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, landmark legislation to  protect the precious right to vote for all persons and to ensure that  our democracy has the tools needed to remain strong.   Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of this body and the Committee on the  Judiciary, I am pleased to join my colleagues in this Special Order  marking the anniversary of the passage on December 6, 1865 of the 13th  Amendment to the Constitution and celebrating the passage of the 14th  and 15th Amendments, known as the Civil Rights Amendments.   I thank my colleague, Congressman Butterfield, for anchoring this  important Special Order and am remembering our late colleague, John  Lewis, a great and beloved man, who risked and gave his life to make  real the promise of those amendments.   The 13th Amendment, the first of the three great Civil War  Amendments, was passed in 1865 and abolished slavery.   The 14th Amendment conferred citizenship on the newly emancipated  slaves, and the 15th Amendment prohibited abridging the right to vote  on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude.   Taken together, these amendments were intended and have the effect of  making former slaves, and their descendants, full and equal members of  the political community known as the United States of America.   Section 2 of the 14th Amendment is noteworthy because it did two  important things.   First, it repealed Article I, Section 2, which counted slaves as 3/5  of a person for purposes of taxation and apportionment of seats in the  House of Representatives.   Second, it punished states that denied the right to vote to any male  citizen over the age of 21 (who was neither a felon nor had fought on  the side of the Confederacy during the Civil War) by reducing their  population for purposes of representation in Congress.   The Framers knew then, and everyone knows now, that the male citizens  over the age of 21 who were being denied the right to vote were the  former slaves.  [[Page H6893]]    The Framers of the 14th Amendment also knew which states were denying  these citizens the right to vote.   The Framers could have identified those states by name but elected  not to do so.   They chose not to do so because that would have required them to  despoil the sanctity and revolutionary character of the Constitution by  having to acknowledge explicitly that slavery had existed legally in a  country founded on the ``self-evident truth'' that ``all men are  created equal.''   It is for this reason that the Framers never used the words  ``slave,'' ``slaveholder,'' ``master,'' or ``slavery'' anywhere in the  original Constitution.   The single reference in the Amendments is the declaration in the 13th  Amendment that ``Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a  punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted,  shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their  jurisdiction.''   The reason this is important is because it shows that when it comes  to matters of race and politics in America, the Framers and Congress  have always been masters of writing in code so as not to bruise the  feelings or upset the tender sensibilities of their fellow citizens in  the Southern states.   The Framers and Congress were practiced in the art of expressing  their true views and achieving their objectives without enshrining in  the Constitution or laws the fact that certain of their countrymen  trafficked in racism.   By 1861, when the Civil War broke out, more than 4 million people  (nearly all of them of African descent) were enslaved in 15 southern  and border states.   By 1862, President Abraham Lincoln came to believe firmly that  emancipating enslaved people in the South would help the Union crush  the Confederate rebellion and win the Civil War.   Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation, which took effect in 1863,  announced that all enslaved people held in the states ``then in  rebellion against the United States, shall be then, thenceforward, and  forever free.''   But the Emancipation Proclamation itself did not end slavery in the  United States, as it only applied to the 11 Confederate states then at  war against the Union, and only to the portion of those states not  already under Union control.   To make emancipation permanent would take a constitutional amendment  abolishing the institution of slavery itself.   In April 1864, the U.S. Senate passed a proposed amendment banning  slavery with the necessary two-thirds majority but it faltered in the  House of Representatives, as more and more Democrats refused to support  it.   When Congress reconvened in December 1864, the emboldened Republicans  put the proposed amendment up for vote again and Lincoln threw himself  in the legislative process, inviting individual representatives to his  office to discuss the amendment and putting pressure on border-state  Unionists (who had previously opposed it) to change their position.   Lincoln was committed to the passage of the 13th Amendment, telling  his allies to ``see what is before you, to focus on the most important  thing; that this Amendment protects the slaves now born and in the  United States, but also the millions yet to be born.''   He authorized his allies to entice House members with plum positions  and other inducements, reportedly telling them: ``I leave it to you to  determine how it shall be done; but remember that I am President of the  United States, clothed with immense power, and I expect you to procure  those votes.''   On January 31, 1865, the House of Representatives passed the proposed  amendment with a vote of 119-56, just over the required two-thirds  majority, and the following day, Lincoln approved a joint resolution of  Congress submitting it to the state legislatures for ratification.   Mr. Speaker, let me recite the opening sentence of Section 1 of the  14th Amendment: ``All persons born or naturalized in the United States  and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United  States and of the State wherein they reside.''   This text was and is a clear repudiation of the infamous Supreme  Court's 1857 decision in Dred Scott, in which Chief Justice Roger Taney  wrote that a black man, was so inferior to the white man that he had no  rights the white man was bound to respect, and could never, even if  born free, claim rights of citizenship under the federal constitution.   The next clause in Section 1 states: ``No State shall make or enforce  any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of  the United States.''   This greatly expanded the civil and legal rights of all American  citizens by protecting them from infringement by the states as well as  by the federal government.   The third clause, ``nor shall any State deprive any person of life,  liberty or property, without due process of law,'' expanded the due  process clause of the Fifth Amendment to apply to the states as well as  the federal government.   Over time, this clause has been interpreted to guarantee a wide array  of rights against infringement by the states, including those  enumerated in the Bill of Rights (freedom of speech, free exercise of  religion, right to bear arms, etc.) as well as the right to privacy and  other fundamental rights not mentioned elsewhere in the Constitution.   Finally, the ``equal protection clause'' (``nor deny to any person  within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws'') was clearly  intended to stop state governments from discriminating against black  Americans, and over the years would play a key role in many landmark  civil rights cases.   It should be noted also, Mr. Speaker, that Section 2 of the 14th  Amendment authorized the federal government to punish states that  violated or abridged their citizens' right to vote by proportionally  reducing the states' representation in Congress, and mandated that  anyone who ``engaged in insurrection'' against the United States could  not hold civil, military, or elected office (without the approval of  two-thirds of the House and Senate).   And Section 5 of the 14th Amendment gave Congress ``the power to  enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article.''   In giving Congress power to pass laws to safeguard the sweeping  provisions of Section 1, in particular, the 14th Amendment effectively  altered the balance of power between the federal and state governments  in the United States.   Nearly a century later, Congress would use this authority to pass  landmark civil rights legislation, including the Civil Rights Act of  1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965.   The 15th Amendment granting African-American men the right to vote  was adopted into the U.S. Constitution in 1870.   The 15th Amendment states: ``The right of citizens of the United  States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or  by any State on account of race, color, or previous condition of  servitude.''   Despite the amendment, by the late 1870s discriminatory practices  were used to prevent blacks from exercising their right to vote,  especially in the South.   It wasn't until the Voting Rights Act of 1965 that legal barriers  were outlawed at the state and local levels if they denied African- Americans their right to vote under the 15th Amendment.   Mr. Speaker, the United States is the world's only superpower and  boasts the largest economy in the history of the world and for many  years was the world's indispensable nation and the example that all  aspiring democracies wished to emulate.   But at the same time, this nation has also been home to many searing  instances of social unrest resulting from racial injustices, as we  witnessed this year on the streets of big cities and small towns in  urban and rural communities.   We saw Americans, by the millions across the country, coming from all  races and ages, engaging in what the late John Lewis called ``good  trouble'' by protesting and demanding an end to the systemic racial  inequality in our criminal justice system that too often victimizes and  disproportionately treats black Americans worse, ceteris paribus, when  it comes to suspicion, apprehension, arrest, detention, trial,  sentencing, and incarceration.   While the brutal deaths of George Floyd in Minneapolis and Breanna  Taylor in Louisville shocked the conscience of the nation, most black  Americans will tell you what they experienced is not new, but has been  occurring for generations, if not centuries.   What is critically important to understand is that the instances of  brutal and unfair treatment the nation has witnessed this year cannot  be attributed to the proverbial few ``bad apples in the bushel'' but is  instead the foreseeable consequence of systemic racism and racial  inequality in the system.   Not just the criminal justice system, but the health care system, the  economic system, and the educational system to name the most glaring  examples.   To find our way out of this dark time, we need to understand how it  came to be.   That is why in January 2019, I introduced H.R. 40, which establishes  a commission to examine slavery and discrimination in the colonies and  the United States from 1619 to the present and recommend appropriate  remedies.   Among other requirements, the commission shall identify (1) the role  of federal and state governments in supporting the institution of  slavery; (2) forms of discrimination in the public and private sectors  against freed slaves and their descendants; and (3) lingering negative  effects of slavery on living African-Americans and society.   Official slavery ended with the Civil War and ratification of the  Thirteenth Amendment.   But unofficial slavery was continued with the new institution of  sharecrop farming, a criminal justice system that would press convicts  into work once done by slaves, and labor policies  [[Page H6894]]  that dictated income for work done based upon skin color.   And, of course, all of this was reinforced by the systematic  disenfranchisement of black Americans, the ``discrete and insular  minority'' excluded from ``those political processes ordinarily to be  relied upon to protect'' them, to quote Chief Justice Hughes' famous  Carolene Products Footnote 4.   For these reasons, the history of the United States is intertwined  with the history of enslaved Africans in the Americas.   There is blood and there are tears, but there is also redemption and  reconciliation.   But to get there, we must have the complete truth and lay our history  bare.   It is the light that sheds the way to the more perfect union all  Americans want.   The Commission created and empowered by H.R. 40 is a necessary first  step in that effort to get to truth and reconciliation about the  Original Sin of American Slavery that is necessary to light the way to  the beloved community we all seek.   Finally, I join all my colleagues in pointing out that the most  fitting and proper means of paying tribute to the beloved John Lewis's  extraordinary life is for the Senate to immediately take up and pass  the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, landmark legislation to  protect the precious right to vote for all persons and to ensure that  our democracy has the tools needed to remain strong.
