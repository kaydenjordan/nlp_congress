 Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, I strongly support H.R. 1, and I  commend Congressman   John Sarbanes for his persistent work on this  legislation. We have an opportunity here to reduce the role of dark  money in politics and make it easier for Americans to participate in  our democracy.   This is not a partisan issue. This is an American democracy issue,  and H.R. 1 is the best solution to cleaning up corruption in  Washington.   I am proud of my colleagues for working on this historic and  necessary package.                                time  0930    You see, Madam Chair, I ran as a publicly funded candidate in Arizona  under our public financing law called Clean Elections when I first ran  for the legislature. This meant I had to go out and get a certain  number of $5 contributions from constituents in my district, which I  then turned in to get my public financing.   It was the same for everyone who was running as a Clean Election  candidate, regardless of party. It equalized everything.   One of my favorite stories is that I was walking from my law office  down to the post office to check my mail, and this cowboy pulled up in  his pickup truck at a stoplight and rolled down the window, and he  said, ``Hey, Ann. You don't know me, but I gave you $5.''   So he felt empowered in my election. I walked over, and we had a  conversation in the middle of the street.   That is the way it should be. This puts power in the pocket of the  people, not special interests, and that is the way it should be.   It is the For the People Act, and that empowers people, and that  makes our democracy work.   I offer my amendment because it creates transparency in the process.  This amendment was actually suggested by a Republican colleague. It  requires the disclosure of credit card verification value and billing  address information for purchases of online advertising. The credit  card verification value is an antifraud security technology designed to  protect us and to reduce fraudulent activity.   We know that there are bad actors and foreign nationals out there  that have an interest in influencing our American elections through  online advertising. Haven't we seen that very, very well in the last  couple of years. We have loopholes that allow them to do so, but we can  fix that. Not only can we fix it, we must fix it.   This amendment is a commonsense solution to help protect the  integrity of our elections and prevent bad players from compromising  our outcomes. This amendment is focused on protecting our democracy  through transparency in the digital age.   Madam Chair, I urge you and all my colleagues to support my amendment  and the entire H.R. 1 package to clean up Washington and put the  American people first.   Remember that cowboy who stopped me in the middle of the road who  felt like he was empowered in his election and in his selection of his  representative. That is the way it should be.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, while I have the utmost respect and  admiration for my colleague across the aisle--in fact, he is one of my  favorite Members of Congress--I strongly disagree with his  characterization of H.R. 1.   No one knows more than I about dark money, secret money being spent  in elections. I have had tens of millions of dollars spent to defeat  me, yet I prevail because I have the power of the people.   That is what this bill does. It empowers people just like that cowboy  who stopped me with his pickup and contributed $5 to my legislative  election.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this election. There is  nothing more important than elections in our democracy and empowering  the people to participate, nothing. That is the cornerstone of our  democracy.   Madam Chair, I yield the balance of my time to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Lofgren), my esteemed colleague.    Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
