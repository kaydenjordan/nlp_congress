 Madam Speaker, when I hear from our friends and  neighbors across Georgia, there is no issue that families find more  concerning than that of the cost of their healthcare.   As a two-time breast cancer survivor, access to quality healthcare is  very, very personal to me. While I was in the hospital, all I had to do  was focus on the strength of my family, the grace of the God that I  love, and winning my battle with cancer.   Yet still, far too many families are forced to worry about paying for  their chemotherapy versus affording the mortgage on their home. That is  why I continue to work so hard every day to expand affordable  healthcare for families across Georgia and across the Nation and why I  am so proud that my bill to cut healthcare costs for those who have  been laid off during the pandemic was signed into law by our President.   No American should ever be forced to make the decision between  putting food on the table or paying for their family's medical bills.                            ____________________
