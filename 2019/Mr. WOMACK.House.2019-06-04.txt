 Madam Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H. Res.  415, a rule providing for House consideration of H.R. 6, the American  Dream and Promise Act of 2019.   According to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), H.R. 6 increases  the deficit by at least $30 billion over ten years. CBO indicates that  this is additional mandatory spending. Under current projections,  mandatory spending is set to increase from 69 percent to 78 percent of  the federal budget over the next decade. Adding to this already  unsustainable projected growth, mandatory spending threatens to crowd  out necessary spending on defense, homeland security, veterans,  infrastructure, public health, education, and other discretionary  priorities. Absent the waiver made by this rule, H.R. 6 would be  vulnerable to a PAYGO point of order.   The rule providing for consideration of H.R. 6 waives all points of  order against the bill, including clause 10 of rule XXI, the House  PAYGO, or ``Pay-As-You-Go,'' rule, which requires any legislation  increasing the deficit to be offset with spending cuts or tax  increases.   Unsurprisingly, this rule was met with strong objections at the start  of the 116th Congress by many progressive lawmakers who viewed PAYGO as  an impediment to costly proposals such as the ``Green New Deal'' and  ``Medicare-for-All,'' which is projected to cost at least $32 trillion  on top of what the federal government is already spending. After much  debate, the PAYGO rule was adopted by the new House majority on January  3, the first day of the 116th Congress. Immediately after this new  House rule was adopted, a number of stories circulated in the press  indicating that my colleagues in the Democratic Leadership intended to  waive the PAYGO rule any time they needed to. In a sign of more  division on that side of the aisle, Democrats introduced bills to  repeal the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act, even though they had just voted  for PAYGO in the House rules package.   From a budget enforcement perspective, it's clear Democrats continue  to circumvent their own rules. l hope this waiver does not continue the  practice that the House PAYGO rule will be waived by the House Rules  Committee whenever a bill is non-compliant, feels inconvenient, or  stands in the way of advancing their costly agenda.   I oppose the rule for H.R. 6, since it enables a fiscally  irresponsible bill to move forward without following House rules.  Budget enforcement should be an important priority of the House Budget  Committee. I hope the House will limit the extent to which future  legislation increases already unsustainable budget deficits.   The material previously referred to by Mrs. Lesko is as follows:                      Amendment to House Resolution 415         At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 2. That immediately upon adoption of this resolution,       the House shall resolve into the Committee of the Whole House       on the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R.       3056) to provide supplemental appropriations relating to       border security, and for other purposes. The first reading of       the bill shall be dispensed with. All points of order against       consideration of the bill are waived. General debate shall be       confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on Appropriations. After general       debate the bill shall be considered for amendment under the       five-minute rule. Points of order against provisions in the       bill for failure to comply with clause 2 of rule XXI are       waived. Clause 2(e) of rule XXI shall not apply during       consideration of the bill. When the committee rises and       reports the bill back to the House with a recommendation that       the bill do pass, the previous question shall be considered       as ordered on the bill and amendments thereto to final       passage without intervening motion except one motion to       recommit with or without instructions. If the Committee of       the Whole rises and reports that it has come to no resolution       on the bill, then on the next legislative day the House       shall, immediately after the third daily order of business       under clause 1 of rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of the       Whole for further consideration of the bill.        Sec. 3. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 3056.
