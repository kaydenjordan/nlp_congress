 Mr. Speaker, 3 in 10 adults in America today have reported  not taking medicine as prescribed because of the cost. Our seniors and  families should not have to choose between paying their monthly bills  and affording their prescription drugs.   That is why I introduced the Advancing Enrollment and Reducing Drug  Costs Act with my friend from New Hampshire, Chris Pappas, to simplify  how low-income seniors get the help they need affording their  medications.   That is why I introduced the Star Rating for Biosimilars Act with my  friend from Ohio,   Bob Gibbs, to drive down costs and provide greater  access to generic biosimilar drugs treating cancer, arthritis, and many  other conditions.   And that is why the House is moving forward with H.R. 3, the Low Drug  Costs Now Act, which will use competitive price negotiation to save  Medicare some $345 billion and save United States households nearly  $160 billion, combined. Private businesses would save some $46 billion  under our bill.   Across America, seniors and families are struggling to afford the  prescription drugs that they need to stay healthy and alive. It is time  for Congress to act. Let's act now.                            ____________________
