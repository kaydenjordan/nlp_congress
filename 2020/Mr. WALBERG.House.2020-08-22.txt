 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me the  time.   Madam Speaker, I was told in persuasion class many, many years ago  that if you had a weak argument, you shouted all the more. After  hearing some of the leadership on the other side of the aisle, I guess  they learned the same approach--a weak argument that isn't holding up.   When I heard the majority leader talk about ``this is for the  people,'' this is for ``your people,'' I don't believe that at all  because Jeanie, my rural mail carrier, is working today; 68 Democrats  are not working today. Yet, this is supposed to be something of  importance.   Last week, we heard the convention start this postal deal going on.  This is just a continuation of the Democrat convention. I want you to  know that nothing that has been said about supposedly what the  President is attempting to do in defunding, in deflating, in stopping  the vote or the mail service is true. My Democrat colleagues know that  as well. I think that is why 68 chose to stay home today as opposed to  coming here in a planned event that meant nothing other than politics.
