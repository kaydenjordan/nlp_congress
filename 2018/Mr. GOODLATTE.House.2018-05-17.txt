 Mr. Chairman, I rise today to support fair sugar  policy.   The sugar program represents a hidden tax on American businesses and  consumers and is responsible for the loss of U.S. food manufacturing  jobs.   Each month, families go to the grocery store, and unbeknownst to  them, the sugar in many of the products they buy is subject to a cost  that is generally 30 to 40 percent higher than the world cost. Very  few, if any, will ever know that a hidden sugar tax has been imposed  upon them by the sugar program. This hidden tax totals at least $2.4  billion a year for American consumers.   There are more than 600,000 sugar-using industry jobs in our Nation,  including thousands in Virginia's Sixth District. I want to stand up  and be counted as an advocate for keeping those jobs in the United  States.   I hope my colleagues will join me in voting for this amendment to  help put an end to the hidden costs of the sugar program.
