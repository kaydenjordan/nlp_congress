L. Stevens, a  west Texan, a World War II veteran who also took part in both the  Normandy invasion on D-day and the invasion of Okinawa.   His service to this country was inspired at the age of 17 as he  enlisted in the Navy with the desire to follow in the footsteps of his  brother. Stevens' sacrifice helped create a safer world for his two  daughters, his six grandchildren, and his 12 great-grandchildren.   Mr. Speaker, I think it is important for us to recognize the service  of all of these servicemembers as we approach Veterans Day. These are  just a few stories, among many, bipartisan in all of our districts. My  hope is that this country can look to the service of these, many of  whom are part of the greatest generation, and we can realize that this  is the greatest country in the world, but it is not without sacrifice.  [[Page H6185]]    It is these folks and it is their families' sacrifice who brought us  together. Once again, I believe that going forward, veterans just like  these will continue to bring us together. It is my challenge to  everybody in this body and all across the United States that we  recognize our veterans' service and their families' sacrifices as we  approach Veterans Day.                            ____________________
