 Madam President, the American people are counting on  Congress to act on some of the biggest issues facing our country.   For starters, there is a border crisis. Since January, more than  630,000 migrants have come to our southern border, including more than  65,000 unaccompanied children. In May, Customs and Border Protection  had their busiest month in 21 years, with more than 180,000 encounters  in May alone, and we are on track to see some of the highest numbers in  yearly border crossings in decades.   Well, the alarm bells are sounding, but amid this crisis, the Senate  Judiciary Committee held a hearing this morning on a partisan bill that  has nothing to do with the extant border crisis.   Make no mistake, I believe Congress should absolutely take action to  allow current DACA, or Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals,  recipients to remain in the United States, but a partisan bill that  would provide a pathway to citizenship for 4.4 million adults and other  unrelated issues has simply no chance of passing in the Senate.  [[Page S4527]]    Now, Senator Durbin, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, who has  long been an advocate for the Dreamers, if he really were serious about  that issue, he now has the authority, as chairman of the Judiciary  Committee, to put a bill before the committee to allow Senators to  offer and vote on amendments and to mark up a bill. And if he were able  to get a majority of the committee to vote for a bill, he could then  ask majority Leader Schumer to put the bill on the floor. But, so far,  most of our discussions on immigration have been just that, all talk  and no action.                            ____________________     At the same time, Madam President, America's roads and  bridges are in dire need of attention by Congress. Every year, the  American Society of Civil Engineers evaluates the state of our  infrastructure and issues a report card to let us know how we are  doing. Well, America is barely passing with a ``C-minus.'' Texas is  faring slightly better than the rest of the class, with just a ``C.''   I believe Republicans and Democrats alike think that rebuilding our  roads and bridges is important. We even share the same goal of  expanding the definition of ``infrastructure'' to include broadband  because we saw during the current pandemic that broadband is no longer  a luxury. It is an absolute necessity, whether it is for telehealth or  whether it is for our children learning remotely or for people working  remotely from home.   Even as bipartisan negotiations continue, though, the majority leader  is eyeing the prospects of a partisan bill that would circumvent the  normal legislative process and would be entirely a partisan product.  But we know that in a 50-50 Senate, bipartisan work on shared  priorities is not impossible. In fact, we did it just last week.   Last week, we saw a great example of what can be accomplished if we  will work together to achieve an outcome.                            ____________________     Madam President, in recent years, China has emerged as  one of the greatest competitors to America. Both Republicans and  Democrats recognize the need to take action now to confront the growing  threats posed by China, and so that is what we did last week.   Last week, the Senate passed a sweeping bipartisan bill to invest in  strategic competition with China, in large part by funding the CHIPS  for America Program to shore up this vulnerable supply chain of  advanced semiconductors coming primarily from Asia, primarily from  Taiwan                            ____________________     Now, Madam President, there is a lot of work that we can  and should do on a bipartisan basis because, of course, not every issue  should be or is a partisan issue. But I will have to tell you that old  habits die hard around here.   Despite the clear need for cooperation to move critical legislation  through a 50-50 Senate, the majority leader is resisting any progress  on issues that we can and should be addressing. Instead, he is trying  to drum up a scenario where somehow we decide to eliminate the 60-vote  requirement, otherwise known as the filibuster. But it is that 60-vote  requirement that requires both parties to roll up their sleeves and do  the hard work and build consensus.   In a country of 330 million people, we need to have the continuity  and the planning and the stability of bipartisan work products, not  just a partisan bill that can be undone after the next election for  Congress or after the next Presidential election.   Well, over several months, our Democratic colleagues have been asked  about the fate of the filibuster, whether they would be willing to  eliminate the filibuster in pursuit of partisan goals. Senator Schumer,  for one, has repeatedly said that ``all options are on the table''-- whatever that means--and a number of our Democratic colleagues have  parroted the same line.   Now, they have looked for examples of Republicans filibustering  bills, just like they have done over the last 6 years. They assumed  this would be the golden ticket to rid themselves of the bipartisan  filibuster requirement and escape blame, only things haven't quite  worked out that way. The roadblock to bipartisanship isn't on the  Republican side but, rather, on the Democrat side.                            ____________________     Madam President, after passing five bipartisan COVID-19  relief bills last year to support the American people through the  pandemic, our Democratic colleagues kicked off this year with a  different approach. They made no attempt to try to negotiate another  consensus package, as we had done five times before last year, and  insisted on skirting the normal legislative process so they could pass  a purely partisan $1.9 trillion spending bill.   Well, the problem with that is it was really mislabeled. One, it  vastly overshot the target, and it spent less than 10 percent of the  money--which, purportedly, was for COVID-19 relief--on COVID-19, and  less than 1 percent of that was related to vaccines, which was clearly  the most urgent need.   But the money that we had appropriated last December hadn't even been  spent yet, but, apparently, the Biden administration wanted to  demonstrate that it could get things through but, in the meantime,  appropriated $1.9 trillion, threatening us with something we haven't  seen rear its head in a long time, which is inflation.   But the bill, as I said, included a lot of unrelated and unnecessary  partisan priorities, ranging from blank checks for mismanaged union  pension funds, funding for climate justice, backdoor money for Planned  Parenthood, and an exclusive paid leave program for Federal  bureaucrats.                            ____________________     Madam President, where did that land us? Well, as I said,  last week, the Department of Labor announced that inflation had climbed  to the highest rate since 2008. Core inflation surged to the highest  level in nearly three decades. Families are feeling the pinch of higher  prices as they pay higher prices for everything from housing to cars to  gasoline to groceries.   This is really sort of a silent and hidden tax on their income, when  the dollar that they earn is worth less and less as prices go higher  and higher. But, unfortunately, this is the exact scenario economists  expected when our Democratic colleagues rolled out this $2 trillion  spending bill at the beginning of the year. And they are currently  proposing to spend trillions of dollars more.   Even Larry Summers, who once served as Treasury Secretary under Bill  Clinton and Director of the National Economic Council under President  Obama, warned about inflation. He penned an op-ed in the Washington  Post in February, cautioning the administration about the risks of  inflation, making himself persona non grata among our Democratic  colleagues. But he wrote another one last month saying that ``the  inflation risk is real.''   You might think that would serve as a cautionary tale to our  Democratic colleagues, that partisan legislation does not give way to  sound and stable policies. But that is not the case.   When the majority leader said all options are on the table for  eliminating the filibuster, he didn't mention the fact that he would be  setting the table and setting the agenda trying to make that case.   Absent Republican obstruction that he and other members of the media  forecasted, the majority leader is now teeing up a series of designed- to-fail votes so he could explain or justify--try to justify--why the  filibuster should be eliminated                            ____________________     Madam President, we kicked things off last week with a  vote on a bill that would exploit the cause of pay fairness, when that  is already clearly the existing law, but, in this case, to line the  pockets of trial lawyers.   Senator Schumer said this month, the Senate will vote on S. 1, the  partisan Federal election takeover bill. So just as our Democratic  colleagues went on a spending spree in the name of  [[Page S4528]]  COVID-19, this bill hijacks the constitutional authority of the States  in the purported name of increasing voting access. But this bill, too,  is chock full of unnecessary, unpopular, and unconstitutional election  proposals.   It makes it much easier for partisans to affect our elections through  fraud, in part, by removing requirements for the most basic safeguard,  which is voter identification.   That was one of the main recommendations in 2005 of the Commission on  Federal Election Reform, a bipartisan commission cochaired by former  President Jimmy Carter, a Democrat, and former Secretary of State,  James Baker, a Republican. That Commission, back in 2005, recommended  that voters be required to present a photo ID card and the State should  provide free cards to voters who, for some reason, didn't have a  driver's license or other identification.   In order to vote in person, most States require voters to present  some valid form of identification. Matching the name of an eligible  voter with the name on a valid form of ID is a commonsense safeguard  against fraud, but one our Democratic colleagues apparently want to  eliminate.   In fact, their legislation would stop the States--actually it would  prohibit the States--from requiring proof of identification in order to  vote. Just sign a piece of paper saying you are who you say you are and  no further questions can be asked.   On top of that, this bill would require the States to automatically  register anyone in their databases for everything from the department  of motor vehicles to public assistance. We know these programs aren't  limited to eligible voters and could include noncitizens and others who  aren't eligible to cast a ballot, not to mention the fact that those  who are already registered to vote would be registered again,  potentially.   And even if there are duplicate registrations or if someone passes  away or moves, States would not be allowed, by this law, to clean up  their voter rolls within 6 months of an election.   But just when you think things can't get any crazier, they do. Our  Democratic colleagues want to provide taxpayer funding for political  campaigns and elections. That is right. They want you to pay for a  political candidate's campaign, whether you want to or not, whether you  support the policies of that candidate or not.   A lot of companies have matching programs for charitable giving. If  an employee donates to the charity of their choice, the company often  will match the donation dollar for dollar. Well, that same principle  applies here, in part, except instead of the charity getting money, it  is now a political candidate. Instead of the company footing the bill,  it is--you got it--it is you, the taxpayer.   I could go on and on. This proposal, S. 1, which we will be voting on  in the near future, changes the basic structure of the Federal Election  Commission, which is currently a bipartisan Commission, which is forced  to obtain a bipartisan majority before they can act. It split 3 to 3.  But this bill would eliminate that bipartisan requirement and simply  allow a partisan Federal election committee to work its will.    This bill also legalizes something called ballot harvesting, which is  susceptible to widespread fraud. In other words, it lets a campaign  worker go around to nursing homes, neighborhoods, union halls,  wherever, and collect your ballot and then to take them down to the  clerk's office and cast that ballot. Well, the opportunities for fraud  are pretty obvious.   This bill would also implement a new financial disclosure policy that  even the American Civil Liberties Union says ``could interfere directly  with the ability of many to engage in political speech about causes  that they care about.''   But above all this, this bill undermines the trust and accountability  that is so important to elections. The Judiciary Committee recently had  a hearing where the secretary of state, who happens to be a Democrat,  from New Hampshire said the single most important thing in providing a  big turnout for elections is public confidence that their ballot will  be counted. It is not how many days before election day you can vote,  who can vote by mail; it is the public's confidence that their ballot  will be counted, no matter how and when cast.   So S. 1 is not a serious attempt at bipartisanship. It is the  opposite. It is not an honest effort to pass legislation. Right now, we  know that Democrats don't even have 50 votes on their side of the  aisle. But the majority leader is trying to prove that partisanship  apparently has a death grip on the Senate, but, unfortunately for him,  it is not the party he thinks.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print my bill  for introduction in the Congressional Record. The bill's purpose is to  improve the safety and security of members of the Armed Forces, and for  other purposes.                                  S. 2058         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
