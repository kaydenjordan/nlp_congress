 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the achievements  of the Lampeter-Strasburg High School women's softball team located in  Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, that recently reached the pinnacle of  its sport by winning the State championship. I am especially proud, Mr.  Speaker, of this win because this is the school in my home school  district where my family and I reside.   The Lampeter-Strasburg Pioneers beat West Allegheny on Thursday, June  14, to claim its first-ever PIAA 5A softball State championship. After  losing by a slim margin 2 years ago, the Pioneers overcame adversity  and returned to the State finals this year to win 6-2. The team's 14-3  win over Donegal--which won last year's 5A State championship title--in  the Lancaster-Lebanon section 3 playoff is further evidence of its  success during the postseason.   I spoke to Coach Gene Charles last night by phone. He credited the  victory to the team's clutch hitting and key defensive stops later in  the game. Coach Charles has coached at Lampeter-Strasburg for more than  20 years, building an extensive network of active alumni who frequently  travel to games with his family.   We are lucky to have leaders and mentors in our district like Coach  Charles who inspire our student athletes to strive for success and to  learn from failure.   Junior Brynne Baker also pitched a noteworthy game, holding the  opposing team to just one earned run. In her postgame interview, Baker  said this was a huge win for the team, especially the graduating  seniors, and a proud moment for the Lancaster-based community.   Congratulations to all the players, coaches, their families, and all  those who made this championship for Lampeter-Strasburg possible. Your  community is proud of you and will continue rooting for you season  after season.

The Crusaders baseball team recently claimed its first baseball  championship in school history. After a remarkable 20-5 season, the  Crusaders won the Lancaster-Lebanon Section 4 and District 3 titles,  setting themselves up for a run at the State championship.   Sure enough, the Crusaders defeated South Side 5-1 in the PIAA 3A  Championship.   In addition to the Crusaders' great offense, the highlight of the  game was senior Dillon Marsh's dominating pitching performance. Marsh,  who has committed to playing at the University of Kentucky next year,  pitched a complete game, striking out 11 batters without allowing a  single walk.   This game continued his excellent postseason performance, during  which he surpassed the 100 strikeout mark for the season and threw a  no-hit shutout in the State semifinals.   In summarizing his victory and the celebration with his teammates,  Marsh simply stated: ``It was just pure happiness.''   Congratulations to the Lancaster Crusaders baseball team, the  coaches, the families, and everyone at the school and in the community  who supported this team along the way.                            ____________________
