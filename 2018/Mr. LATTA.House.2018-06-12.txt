 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 449) to require the Surgeon General of the Public Health Service  to submit to Congress a report on the effects on public health of the  increased rate of use of synthetic drugs, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 449         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Synthetic Drug Awareness Act       of 2018''.       SEC. 2. REPORT ON EFFECTS ON PUBLIC HEALTH OF SYNTHETIC DRUG                     USE.         (a) In General.--Not later than three years after the date       of the enactment of this Act, the Surgeon General of the       Public Health Service shall submit to Congress a report on       the health effects of new psychoactive substances (including       synthetic drugs) used since January 2010 by persons who are       at least 12 years of age but no more than 18 years of age.        (b) New Psychoactive Substance Defined.--For purposes of       subsection (a), the term ``new psychoactive substance'' means       a controlled substance analogue (as defined in section       102(32) of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 802(32)).     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous materials in the Record on the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my strong support for H.R. 449,  the Synthetic Drug Awareness Act of 2018. Synthetic drugs, such as  synthetic marijuana and bath salts, are produced in the lab and can  have chemical structures that are designed to mimic or even enhance  those naturally occurring drugs.   Fentanyl, another synthetic drug, a substance that is 50 times more  potent than heroin and 100 times more potent than morphine, has  numerous analogs.   These drugs are modified to circumvent the Drug Enforcement  Administration's scheduling regime and are a serious public health  risk. That is why H.R. 449 is so important, because it will require the  United States Surgeon General to submit a comprehensive report to  Congress on the public health effects of synthetic drug use among  youth.   I would like to thank my colleague from New York, Representative  Hakeem Jeffries, for his hard work on this important initiative, along  with Representatives Chris Collins, G.K. Butterfield, and Trey Gowdy.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1415     Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman of the committee for all  his hard work and for especially shepherding these 57 bills that we got  through committee on the opioid crisis  [[Page H5036]]  that we have in this country. I thank him for that and for helping on  this piece of legislation today.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4284, the INFO Act, the  Indexing Narcotics, Fentanyl, and Opioids Act.   In Ohio, we have experienced some of the worst of the crisis. In a  12-month period ending June 30 of last year, 5,232 lives were lost due  to overdoses. That is a 39 percent increase from the previous year and  three times the national average.   In talking with my constituents across the district, I have learned  that to make a real difference in the lives of those who are struggling  with addiction, we need to get more data, information, and funding into  the hands of the right people. That is exactly what the INFO Act does.   My bill creates a public dashboard consisting of comprehensive  information and data on nationwide efforts to combat the opioid crisis.  Establishing a one-stop shop makes it easier for advocates, healthcare  providers, and State and local governments to access Federal funding,  data on opioid abuse, and the best practices for treatment.   Due to this crisis, we are losing 115 Americans a day across this  Nation. The time to act is now. I urge my colleagues to support the  passage of this legislation.
