 Madam Speaker, I rise to oppose the previous question so  that we can immediately consider H.R. 6858 to unleash American domestic  energy production.   Americans across the country are paying sky-high prices at the gas  pump. Almost every single day for the past month, gas prices have hit a  new record high.   The national average for a gallon of gas is now over $5 per gallon.  In Phoenix, my home State, Arizonans are paying over $5.60 per gallon.  I think yesterday it was $5.63 per gallon.   Filling up at the pump is becoming increasingly unaffordable for many  Americans. As Members of Congress, many of us can afford to spend $5  for a single gallon of gas. But many Americans, like my own kids, who  are working hard, and my senior citizens in my district who live on  fixed incomes, simply can't afford to pay this high price.   Republicans have a solution. We have a plan to increase American  energy production today and lower prices tomorrow, if only my  colleagues across the aisle would agree to take up this legislation.   H.R. 6858 requires the President to submit an energy security plan to  Congress and requires the Energy Secretary to develop a plan to  increase oil and gas production on U.S. Federal lands. This legislation  reinstates the Keystone XL pipeline, unleashes American natural gas  production and oil production, and reverses the oil and gas moratorium  on Federal lands and waters so we can harness our U.S.-abundant energy  resources.   Republicans have brought up this legislation, as has been said  before, for consideration several times, but the energy crisis just  keeps getting worse and worse, and gas prices keep getting higher.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the previous  question.
