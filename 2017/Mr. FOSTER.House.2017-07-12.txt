 Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   As the only physicist in the U.S. Congress, I feel a special  responsibility to speak out on the importance of strengthening our  global nuclear security architecture. At a time when it is more  important than ever for the security of the United States to reinforce  international norms against nuclear testing, we are here debating an  amendment that would restrict the ability of a key international  institution to monitor nuclear weapons, and, in fact, is designed to  undercut prospects for either eventual ratification or even continued  adherence to the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.   The Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization Preparatory  Commission is tasked with establishing a verification regime to monitor  compliance with the comprehensive ban on nuclear explosive testing.   If enacted, this amendment would send the wrong signal to the world,  deliberately risking an opening for the resumption of unrestricted  nuclear testing by many nations on Earth, which would be a national  security disaster for the United States.                                time  2145    During the debate on the Iran nuclear agreement, I received more than  a dozen classified briefings, many of them individual classified  briefings by our weapons experts who supported the negotiating team. At  that time, I spent a lot of time putting myself in the place of a  terrorist or proliferating nation, and I came to understand the  overwhelming technical advantage that the United States possesses today  over both other nuclear states, and any potential proliferation state,  because we conducted more than 1,000 nuclear tests from 1945 to 1992,  more than all other countries on Earth combined.   Many of those tests were extensively instrumented and have provided  us with the ability to accurately computer model and evaluate the  performance of nuclear weapons without the risk to safety and to the  environment. This is why no official of the Department of Energy,  Department of Defense, or any other of our nuclear laboratories have  ever called for a resumption of nuclear testing or an unsigning or  deprecation of the CTBT, because the moment that other nations begin or  resume testing, we lose that crucial advantage.   It seems very odd to me that my Republican colleagues would want  other nuclear or nonnuclear states to obtain intellectual property and  parity in this matter. Although under this amendment the direct funding  for the international monitoring system would nominally remain  unscathed, it is difficult to imagine that a significant reduction in  U.S. technical and financial support to the CTBTO would not adversely  affect the organization's ability to maintain and operate any nuclear  monitoring system.   The proposed amendment also seeks to undermine the United States'  obligation as a signatory not to conduct nuclear test explosions. If  the United States unilaterally declares itself exempt, then other  countries are very likely to do the same. In addition, contrary to what  the amendment implies, U.N. Security Council Resolution 2310, does not  impose any new obligations on the United States. Nothing is mandatory  in the U.N. resolution. But repudiating support for the resolution  could trigger bad faith in other nations around the world and reduce  U.S. legitimacy and leverage that ensures other countries do not test  nuclear weapons.   So we should not signal any intention that the United States  encourages a return to a more hostile nuclear environment, an  environment in which the United States does not condemn nuclear weapons  testing but, rather, gives away our position as a country that seeks  peace and prosperity for our future.   We have an opportunity to turn political rhetoric into concrete  action to curb the global proliferation of nuclear weapons and secure  the safety of future generations. From a national security point of  view, we must acknowledge that the CTBT locks in an enormous  competitive advantage for the United States, one that would be a huge  mistake to begin throwing away.   Although the CTBT failed to be ratified by a handful of votes the  first time it came up in 1999, as George Shultz, the Secretary of State  under President Reagan said: ``You can say that a Senator might have  been right to vote against the CTBT when it was first put forward''--in  1999--``and right to vote for it now. Why? Because things have  changed.''   And what he meant by that is that stockpiled stewardship works, and  that the detection system, both that is maintained by the United States  and by the world communities by the CTBTO works as well. Short of  ratification, the U.S. support for the CTBTO Preparatory Commission  remains essential.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the Wilson amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
