 Mr. Chairman, the Defense Innovation Unit-Experimental  is a program that leverages brilliant engineers at places like the  Silicon Valley or MIT to invent such amazing things as saline cooling  to save the lives of badly wounded soldiers on the battlefield or  create improved communications.   In just the last year, the DIUx program saved the United States Air  Force hundreds of millions of dollars by replacing a whiteboard  management system for managing refueling with an integrated app that  saved millions of pounds of fuel each week, totaling hundreds of  millions of dollars and, ultimately, billions of savings.   This never would have happened without DIUx. It pays for itself many  times over. In fact, we would not have things today like Predator or  key anti-missile defense systems without it.   Perhaps some big defense contractors might wish to cut DIUx, but only  in Washington would we cut a program that integrates Silicon Valley and  MIT engineers, develops products in months instead of decades, and  saves billions of dollars. This amendment protects that from happening  by restoring the $14 million in funding, something it already saved in  fuel in just a couple of days with the United States Air Force.   I am proud to be a cosponsor of this bill, and I thank my colleagues  for their work on this bipartisan measure. I urge support.
