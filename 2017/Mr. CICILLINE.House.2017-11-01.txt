 Mr. Speaker, right now, President Trump and the  Republicans are trying to pass a massive tax cut for billionaires,  millionaires, and wealthy corporations, and reward companies that ship  American jobs overseas. The only way they can pay for it is by raising  taxes on working people and cutting more than $1 trillion from Medicare  and Medicaid.   This is not what Donald Trump, the candidate, promised the American  people when he ran for President. He promised he would protect Social  Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, but it turns out that wasn't true.   Wealthy Americans are doing better than ever. The top 1 percent are  earning three times as much as they did 30 years ago, but working  people haven't seen their pay go up at all.   Let's get serious. Let's get working people a better deal that cuts  their taxes. Let's get them a better deal that protects Social Security  and Medicare. Let's not give tax breaks to companies that ship American  jobs overseas.   The American people deserve a better deal, not this raw deal that  hurts working families.                            ____________________
