 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:    Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Reduce  Impaired Driving for Everyone Act of 2019 or RIDE Act of 2019. I would  like to thank my co-sponsor, Senator Rick Scott of Florida, who joins  me on this important bill--a bill that will help end drunk driving and  prevent thousands of fatalities and injuries across the nation.   While we have made progress over the last several decades to reduce  drunk driving on our roads, it is still a national tragedy. In 2017,  the latest year for which we have statistics, the National Highway  Traffic Safety Administration found that 10,874 person were killed on  American roads by a drunk driver. That's one death every 48 minutes.  And most tragically: every single one of those 10,874 deaths could have  been prevented.   Traffic fatalities due to drunk driving account for one-third of all  such fatalities. Yet, drunk drivers have only a two percent chance of  being caught. And one study found that the average drunk driver has  driven drunk 87 times before being arrested. The RIDE Act aims to make  sure these drivers do not hit the road in the first place.   I'm not new to this fight. When I was Attorney General of New Mexico  in the 1990's, our State had one of the highest DWI rates in the  Nation. Then, on Christmas Eve in 1992, a drunk driver killed a mother  and her three young daughters as he sped down the highway the wrong way  going 90 miles per hour. That tragedy galvanized me and many others in  our State. I worked to impose stronger penalties for repeat offenders,  impose a lower legal limit for intoxication, and close drive-up liquor  windows. Those efforts and the efforts of many others across New Mexico  helped bring down the number of alcohol-related fatalities from 460 in  1992 to 131 in 2017. But that's 131 too many. And so we have more work  to do in New Mexico and across the Nation.   I've worked many years to fund development of the Driver Alcohol  Detection System for Safety or DADSS technology--technology that  prevents drivers impaired above the legal limit from ever taking the  wheel. When I first started advocating for this technology, it seemed  far-fetched to some, out of reach. But, now--it's being road-tested and  within our grasp.   The RIDE Act builds on the $50 million dollars Congress has  appropriated since 2008 by appropriating $5 million per year toward  drunk driver detection technology during fiscal years 2021 and 2022.  The bill will fund the technology transfer of this software to ready it  for installation and testing in vehicles.   At the same time the Federal government has moved to introduce this  technology, some private automobile manufacturers are also developing  technology of their own for installation in their vehicles. They are to  be applauded.   NHTSA and the Automotive Coalition for Traffic Safety, of which every  major automobile manufacturer is a member, have engaged in a decade- long public-private partnership to research, manufacture, and test  equipment to make vehicles inoperable if alcohol is present in a  person's breath. They are engaged now in calibration to ensure that a  vehicle will be inoperable only if a driver is above the legal limit.  NHTSA and ACTS are working with the states of Maryland and Virginia to  test this technology. Real world testing is essential--which is why the  RIDE Act will empower the Federal General Services Administration to  incorporate anti-drunk driving software into its fleet on a pilot  basis.   Finally, the RIDE Act requires the NHTSA to promulgate rules to  require installation of advanced drunk driving prevention technology in  all new vehicles not later than two years after enactment of the bill.  Automobile manufacturers will have two model years to comply with the  rule. This means the RIDE Act sets out about a four year window to  prevent drunk driving in all new vehicles. This tremendous goal is  within reach.   Again, I appreciate the support of my colleague, Senator Scott. The  RIDE Act should have strong bipartisan support. Drunk drivers don't  discriminate on the basis of political party. I urge all our colleagues  to join us in this important fight against drunk driving and the  devastation that it causes.                                  S. 2604         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

A bill to amend title 49, United States Code, to require the  Secretary of Transportation to award grants to States that have enacted  and are enforcing certain laws with respect to stretch limousines, and  for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and  Transportation.
