 Mr. President, there are so many problems going on  right now in the country. As I interact with people in Oklahoma, they  are frustrated with where things are going with the economy. The rising  inflation is literally inflation we have not seen for 40 years.   People who are 40 years old and younger have never experienced an  economy like we are experiencing right now. But for those who lived  during the time of Jimmy Carter, they all remember extremely well what  it was like--what it was like to literally every single week when you  go to the grocery store for prices to be higher, to be able to watch  prices accelerate month after month after month.   The policies that have been put in place this year by the Biden  administration and folks in this body have led directly to rampant  inflation across our Nation and are causing a major problem.   The debt ceiling was voted on just days ago here in this body. It was  $2\1/2\ trillion. That $2\1/2\ trillion has been set aside for the next  13 months or so.   There is an enormous gathering of debt. We continue to be able to see  the inflation continue to rise. And in the middle of it is a  conversation about this bill that is called Build Back Better.   Now, we haven't seen all the bill yet. It is 2,000-plus pages. But  the pages change every week, and they have for weeks and weeks. We  still have large sections of the bill that is being dropped out that  just says: ``We will add in more information here later.''   But the sections that we do have, and that have been scored, there  are major problems here. This is not just a Republican-Democrat  conversation; this is the direction-of-the-country conversation. Is  this really what we want to do and the direction that we want to go?   This bill--it was scored independently by CBO, looked at this bill  and said if it looks out over 10 years with these policies in place, it  would add $3 trillion more in debt.   Now, as it is written, with all the budget gimmicks and everything in  it, they say: Well, it actually will only add $365 billion in debt-- though the White House continues to claim that it is all paid for; it  is all paid for; it is free; it is free; it is free.   The more we dig into it, the more problems we see. Some of those are  philosophical changes. This bill changes what has been entitlements in  the past. Entitlements have been connected to actually work to  incentivize people to be able to work, knowing that people don't grow  out of poverty by constantly getting government benefits. You are  trapped in poverty. Work is what actually helps people escape out of  poverty.   That is what Bill Clinton talked about often, about changing welfare  as we know it. This bill actually changes it back to welfare as we knew  it and shifts back entitlements to say you don't have to actually be  working to receive all these government benefits. In fact, this bill  even says you don't even have to be an American citizen to receive all  these benefits; that if you are illegally present in the country, you  get thousands and thousands of dollars in government benefits. If you  are not working, but you are able to work and you choose not to, you  get thousands and thousands and thousands of dollars in benefits.   I have to tell you, for the folks I know who leave for work at 6 a.m.  and head to work, they are a little frustrated that their tax dollars  are going to people still in bed, who are not engaging. But that is  what this bill does;  [[Page S9230]]  it changes us from a situation where we incentivize work to we  incentivize not working.   Part of that is in the child tax credit that is being discussed. I  and my colleagues on the other side of the aisle voted to change the  child tax credit for this year that was already in place, that already  incentivizes work, that helps individuals with small children who need  help. That has been in place in the Tax Code. In fact, Republicans also  voted for that in the past with a work incentive.   That was changed in March of this year in a straight partisan vote.  And it was done for a temporary basis because of COVID, to actually  allocate dollars to families, regardless of if they are working or not  during the time of COVID.   Now, the conversation is, that needs to be extended, not just through  COVID but to just keep extending it, to take away the work  requirements, to take away the requirement to be a citizen of the  United States to receive these dollars, and to actually make it where  you are getting a monthly check rather than just a tax incentive at the  end of the year based on if you were working or not.   And the working requirement is not high. It is, literally, if you  worked and earned $2,500 in a year, you qualify for the tax credit. But  they take away even that requirement for your family.   The childcare piece has been interesting because I have heard a lot  of my Democratic colleagues talk about, well, we are going to give free  childcare to folks.   The problem is--a multitude of issues with this. One is, if you are a  faith-based entity for childcare, you are excluded from this, which  about half of the childcare facilities around the country are provided  by churches and faith-based nonprofits--rural and urban areas, they are  all cut out.   The other challenge is, while they talk about free childcare, free  childcare, free childcare, a very liberal think tank just did the math  on this, what it would mean for middle-class families who actually do  childcare at that same facility. Middle-class families who are paying  right now for childcare would, after this bill is put in place--they  estimate that it would cost $13,000 more a year for childcare if you  are not getting the subsidies.   So if you are getting the subsidies, it is free. If you are a dollar  past the subsidies, you are going to pay $13,000 more a year for your  childcare.   I hope you are tracking the cost of natural gas as it is raised  because it is about to go up again. If this bill--what I call the  ``Build Back Broke'' bill--passes, the cost of natural gas and the cost  of heating across America will go up because there is a new fee on  methane.   I could go on and on and on with the issues that are in this bill  that are content, that are philosophical issues, that are issues that  affect people who live in my State and will raise the cost for them.   Some people ask me: Who are the folks who actually like this bill?   Well, there are quite a few folks who like this bill. The folks who  are in wealthy Democrat-run States, they love this bill because the  wealthiest individuals in the highest tax States--and those are the  blue States--the wealthiest individuals in the highest tax States, they  get a huge tax break in this bill. For the wealthiest individuals, they  get an $80,000-a-year cut in their taxes, what they call State and  local taxes. So if you are in New York or New Jersey or Illinois or in  California and you are in the top 1 percent, you get an $80,000 cut in  your taxes. They like this bill.   Somebody else who likes this bill are the wealthy who actually buy  electric vehicles--incredibly expensive, beautiful vehicles, many of  them, but they get $12,500 off of their vehicle based on this bill.   The environmental activists love this bill because billions of  dollars actually go directly to these environmental activist groups.  Many who were active in the Biden campaign, they get additional  billions of dollars coming in. In fact, there are billions of dollars  to create a new Civilian Climate Corps--a group of young people who  will travel around the country actually promoting environmentalism,  paid for with Federal tax dollars. They like this bill. Unions like  this bill because, currently, if you donate to a nonprofit, you are  able to take some of that off of your taxes. But under this bill, that  goes away, and it is replaced with if you pay union dues, you get to  write this off your taxes. So unions definitely like this bill.   And the folks who really, really like this bill--reporters and  journalists. Reporters and journalists love this bill. So some of them  are not talking about the content of this bill. The reason I say that,  because this bill pays half the salary for reporters and journalists  all over the country. This bill puts in place that half the salary of  reporters and journalists in every city and every community across  America will get half of their salary paid for by the Federal tax  dollars.   Let's see, government-paid reporters and journalists--what could go  wrong with that?   There are a lot of issues in this bill. And as we talk through this  bill, and as, thankfully, this bill is slowing down dramatically so  that people are able to see the contents of this bill, I have more and  more people who catch me and say: I have a major concern with this bill  and, I have to tell you, I have had for months. And we continue to be  able to speak out on issues that change the direction for our Nation  that are actually built into this bill.                                  Christmas    Mr. President, it is the middle of December, and we are still hanging  out in DC. We are actually past the date that we were supposed to not  be here any longer, according to our official calendar, but there is  work to be done. And we continue to be able to do the work. It is a  contentious body and, at times, a contentious nation.   I was with a group of folks yesterday for an early morning breakfast.  And as we prayed together, one of them looked at me and said: I need a  little ``Prince of Peace'' right now.   So can I just for a moment in this Chamber pause and just do a quick  reminder of what is coming over the next couple of weeks, not about the  heat of battle in this room but where we are in this season?   Reading from the Book of Isaiah, Isaiah 9:6 says: For a child will be  born to us. A son will be given to us; and the government will rest on  His shoulders, and His Name will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty  God, Eternal Father, Prince of Peace. And there will be no end to the  increase of this government or of his peace. It sounds like this in  Luke, Chapter 2:         Now in those days a decree went out from Caesar Augustus,       that a census be taken of all the inhabited earth. This was       the first census taken while Quirinius was governor of Syria.       And everyone was on his way to register for the census, each       to his own city. Joseph also went up from Galilee, from the       city of Nazareth, to Judea, to the city of David which is       called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and family of       David, in order to register along with Mary, who was engaged       to him, and was with child. While they were there, the days       were completed for her to give birth. And she gave birth to       her firstborn son; and she wrapped Him in cloths, and laid       Him in a manger, because there was no room for them in the       inn.        In the same region there were shepherds staying out in the       fields and keeping watch over their flock by night. And an       angel of the Lord suddenly stood before them, and the glory       of the Lord shone around them; and they were terribly       frightened. But the angel said to them, ``Do not be afraid;       for behold, I bring you good news of great joy which will be       for all the people; for today in the city of David there has       been born for you a Savior, who is Christ the Lord. This will       be a sign for you: you will find a baby wrapped in cloths and       lying in a manger.'' And suddenly there appeared with the       angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God and       saying, ``Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace       among men with whom He is pleased.''        When the angels had gone away from them into heaven, the       shepherds began saying to one another, ``Let's go straight to       Bethlehem then, and see this thing that has happened which       the Lord has made known to us.'' So they came in a hurry and       found their way to Mary and Joseph, and the baby as He lay in       the manger. When they had seen this, they made known the       statement which had been told them about this Child. And all       who heard it wondered at the things which were told them by       the shepherds. But Mary treasured all these things, pondering       them in her heart. The shepherds went back, glorifying and       praising God for all that they had heard and seen, just as       had been told to them.    A little peace on Earth will be helpful to this body and to our  Nation on this day.   Merry Christmas to you.   I yield the floor.  [[Page S9231]]
