 Madam Speaker, I rise proudly in support of the George  Floyd Justice in Policing Act, along with my colleagues, Congresswoman  Jackson Lee and Congresswoman Barbara Lee.   Unfortunately, I have had a lifetime of dealing with police brutality  and police misconduct. It first happened when I was 11 years old. I was  simply horseplaying with some of my friends in my neighborhood when the  police approached us and asked us to keep it down. Because we had the  audacity to ask a follow-up question, I was grabbed on my arm, I was  thrown against the wall, and I was thrown to the ground, handcuffed,  and night-sticked in the back.   Unfortunately, this was the first time, but not the last time. I have  been taken out of my car and handcuffed, taken to jail and released  without seeing a judge. Unfortunately, this is the norm for too many  African Americans and too many poor people across this country.   So I ask my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support the  George Floyd Justice in Policing Act so that we can finally have  justice and, most importantly, accountability across this country.  Those who serve us in law enforcement are not above the law.                            ____________________
