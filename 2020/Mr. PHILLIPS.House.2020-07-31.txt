 Madam Speaker, I thank Ranking Member Marchant and  Chairman Deutch for their principled leadership on the Ethics Committee  and for their reflections on our solemn duties of self-discipline,  self-accountability, and self-governance.   There is no joy in reprimanding one of our colleagues, for a  transgression by one of us is a stain on all of us. Whether one takes  an oath of office as a politician, a police officer, or a public  official, we are duty-bound to hold ourselves to the highest standards  of conduct and serve as role models for our Nation.   During a remarkably difficult and divisive period of American  history, I am proud to have chaired a bipartisan investigative  subcommittee comprised of two Republicans--Representatives Bill Flores  and   John Katko--and two Democrats--Representative Jamie Raskin and  me.   On most days, an aisle separates us, but there was not a moment of  distance between us during our work on this subcommittee. From day one,  we were unified and unwavering in our pursuit of truth and commitment  to objectivity, none of which would have been possible without the  remarkable, nonpartisan Ethics Committee staff, who conducted this  investigation with integrity, professionalism, and extraordinary  patience.   For that, the entire House joins me in expressing gratitude to Tom  Rust, Brittney Pescatore, Janet Foster, Zeke Ross, Danielle Appleman,  and Caroline Taylor for their principled service and diligent work.   In closing, it is my hope that every one of our colleagues takes the  time to read our report, reflect on the lessons of this case, and  recommit to acting creditably on the people's House and the values on  which it stands.                                time  0930
