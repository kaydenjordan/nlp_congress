 Mr. Speaker, I thank both committees of jurisdiction for  their work on the INVEST in America Act.   I would like to share some of the significant resources that this  bill will bring to my home district of El Paso, Texas.   This bill would bring almost $20 million in investment directly to  two projects for the city and county of El Paso. The first project, the  John Hayes Extension, would assist the exponential growth we have seen  in the Eastern portion of our country.   The second project, the Stanton Street Bridge Intelligent  Transportation System, would improve the traffic flow around this land  port of entry.   The INVEST in America Act also establishes the Reconnecting  Neighborhoods Program to help communities, like downtown El Paso, that  were divided when highways, such as I-10, were built through the heart  of our city.   The amendments I have offered to this bill would bring crucial  funding to some of the most economically disadvantaged members of our  community. They also recognize our key location on the U.S.-Mexico  trade corridor.   My amendments include millions of dollars for colonial surface,  drinking water, and wastewater infrastructure, as well as an increase  in an optional set-aside for infrastructure critical to trade in border  communities.   Simply put, the INVEST in America Act is a transformational measure  for El Paso, and I look forward to voting for it.
