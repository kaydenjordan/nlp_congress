 Mr. Chairman, I thank the chair for yielding.   Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 1615 and in support of  our gas stoves.   Across southern Michigan, people--including chefs in my district and,  most importantly, my wife--are bewildered by the attacks on gas stoves,  and many can't wrap their heads around it.   Here is the deal: a climate group with deep ties to the CCP published  a questionable study on gas stoves. President Biden's climate czar and  Energy Secretary have met with this group, and despite the group's deep  ties to the CCP, American taxpayer dollars continue to be funneled to  them.   Shortly after publication of the study, a Consumer Product Safety  Commission member said that a gas stove ban was ``on the table.''   Let's be clear. The House is not going to stand by while the  administration continues to restrict the freedoms of Americans,  undermine energy security, and make life even more costly for families.   About 40 percent of Americans are utilizing gas stoves, and we are  not going to restrict our own freedom because a group connected to the  CCP would like us to.   Natural gas is safe, it is reliable, and it is affordable for  millions of Americans. Natural gas makes America strong, resilient,  provides stability, and has been the key factor in cleaning up our  environment unlike other nations.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' to support our  freedom, energy security, and a prosperous future.
