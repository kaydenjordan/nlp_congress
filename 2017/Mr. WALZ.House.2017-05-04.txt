 Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the  Paralyzed Veterans of America urging rejection of the latest version of  the American Health Care Act.                                  Paralyzed Veterans of America,                                        Washington, DC, May 3, 2017.      Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Minority Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Ryan and Leader Pelosi: Paralyzed Veterans of       America (PVA) urges rejection of the latest version of the       American Health Care Act (AHCA). PVA is the nation's only       Congressionally-chartered veterans' service organization       solely dedicated to representing veterans with spinal cord       injury and/or disease. Consequently, we are very concerned       about the conflicting information circulating about this       legislation and the adverse impact it could have on our       members and millions of other people with disabilities.        As we understand it, the AHCA cuts $880 billion out of the       Medicaid program in order to finance tax cuts that will       explode the deficit and largely assist upper income       individuals, corporations, and providers. The Medicaid       changes are particularly devastating to people with       disabilities. Under the cap and cut proposal, the federal       government would no longer share in the costs of providing       health care services and community services beyond the capped       amount. This would eliminate the enhanced federal match for       the Community First Choice Option under Medicaid that       provides attendant care services in the community. Thanks to       this program, many poor veterans with serious non-service-      connected disabilities have been able to move from nursing       homes into their communities. The AHCA also weakens Medicaid       by ending the Medicaid expansion earlier and offering       Medicaid block grants to states. Data from the Robert Wood       Johnson Foundation shows expansion has helped thousands of       veterans and their caregivers.        For veterans and PVA members in particular, the AHCA       continues several problematic policies of the ACA as well as       troubling new provisions that could affect the ability of       many veterans and their family members to afford health       insurance in the private market. The underlying AHCA bill:        Continues to exclude CHAMPVA beneficiaries--dependents of       the most catastrophically disabled veterans--from the       dependents' coverage policy up to age 26.        Fails to remove the prohibition on enrollment into the VA       health care system for Priority Group 8 veterans, thus       denying these veterans access to the principal health care       system for veterans.        Denies access to tax credits making health insurance       affordable to anyone eligible for a host of other federal       health programs, including those ``eligible'' for coverage       under Title 38 health care programs. This would prevent many       veterans who may be ``eligible for'' but not enrolled in the       VA health care system from accessing these tax credits       intended to help people buy insurance.        Not only do the changes made to the original version of the       AHCA continue its failure to protect veterans and people with       disabilities, they make these circumstances worse. The latest       changes would allow states to seek waivers that would allow       insurers to charge higher premiums to people with pre-      existing conditions, including people with disabilities. The       new amendments also would allow states to seek waivers from       the ACA's requirement that certain essential health benefits       must be provided, including crucial services for people with       disabilities such as prescription drugs, rehabilitative and       habilitative services and devices, preventative and wellness       services and chronic disease management. The combination of       these changes would make it nearly impossible for people with       pre-existing conditions to find affordable plans that cover       basic health care services.        Throughout these past few months, the American people have       been calling for a bipartisan effort to improve the nation's       health care system. Congress should heed these voices, stop       its pursuit of the flawed American Health Care Act and work       together through regular order to strengthen all Americans'       access to affordable, high quality health care.            Sincerely,                                                        Carl Blake,                                      Associate Executive Director.     Mr. Speaker, there are many reasons that people may come to  the conclusion this is not the piece of legislation for them. I would  argue most egregious amongst this is the manner in which it was done.  There was clearly an error made on the 7 million veterans you heard  about. I do not question a single Member's commitment in here to caring  for veterans. You did not do it on purpose. You did it because you had  to, to meet the arcane rules of the Senate, so you stripped it out, and  you will, by all intents and purposes, fix it in the Senate.   For you, I would say good luck with that. But for the Members who are  sitting here: Why would we not debate this? Why would we not fix it?  Why would we not go through regular order so all of us would ensure  there is not a loophole that would deny coverage to 7 million veterans.  This is too important to rush. It is too important to make errors like  this. It is darn sure too important to count on the Senate to fix it.  And it was our responsibility.   So here we sat with 30 seconds among 15 of us to make points that are  important to the American public.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues: reject this. Come back and do it  right, and provide the health care our veterans deserve.
