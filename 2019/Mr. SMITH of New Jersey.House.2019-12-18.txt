 Madam Speaker, the U.S. Constitution is  clear and unambiguous--impeachment of any president is permitted only  for treason, bribery, high crimes and misdemeanors.   Undoing the will of the people expressed in a free and fair election  with the proposed articles of impeachment, totally fails to meet the  legal standard prescribed by the U.S. Constitution. Despite hearings  and a process that were egregiously flawed and unfair, there is still  no direct evidence whatsoever of any crime.   Disagreement with or intense dislike for this or any other president  of the United States is not now--nor should it ever be--grounds for  impeachment.
