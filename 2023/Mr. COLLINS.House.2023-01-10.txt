 Mr. Speaker, how 'bout them Dawgs?   It is an honor this morning to rise and deliver my first speech on  the floor of the people's House, and what a special occasion it is.    After last night's resounding victory, it is clear that the Georgia  Bulldogs haven't gotten tired of winning.   I congratulate the University of Georgia, especially the players, who  left it all on the field during practice and the games and earned  another championship last night.   Because of their passion and talent, the number one State for  business is now the number one State for college football for the  second year in a row.   As the Representative for Georgia's 10th District, the proud home of  the University of Georgia, I could not be prouder of the team or  happier for our State because the Dawgs are on top of the SEC and all  of college football once again.   Go Dawgs.
