 Madam Speaker, a few weeks ago, our Nation observed  National Public Health Week, and I rise today to honor the work and  accomplishments of a leading figure in public health in Lancaster  County, Dr. Hilda Shirk, who is retiring after 7 years as president and  CEO of Lancaster Health Center.   Dr. Shirk has been a tireless advocate for public health and for  ensuring everyone has access to quality care,  [[Page H3485]]  and she has been a tremendous leader in our Lancaster County community.  Just last year, the health center that she leads logged over 80,000  patient visits.   Madam Speaker, Dr. Shirk led the health center during a pivotal time  in the organization's history. Under her steadfast leadership, she grew  the organization in many ways, including doubling the organization's  operating budget, increasing its staff by nearly 50 percent, and  increasing accessibility at two new sites in Lancaster City.   Dr. Shirk will be retiring later this year. It is a pleasure to honor  such an incredible community leader. We thank her for her years of  service and wish her well in her retirement.                            ____________________
