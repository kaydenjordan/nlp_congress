 Is there a sufficient second?   There appears to be a sufficient second.   The clerk will call the roll.   The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.    Mr. President, I am honored to recognize Dawn  Curtis and her late husband Danny Curtis on being named 2020 Angels in  Adoption award recipients.   The Congressional Coalition on Adoption Institute, CCAI, was  established in 2001 to raise awareness about the need for adoption in  the United States and eliminate barriers standing between orphan and  foster children becoming part of a family. Angels in Adoption is the  CCAI's signature public awareness program, which annually recognizes  outstanding individuals, families, and organizations that have made  extraordinary contributions to adoption, permanency, and child welfare.  I am honored to congratulate Dawn and Danny Curtis for their exemplary  work that led to this well-deserved national honor.   Dawn and Danny had two biological children and dreamed of a bigger  family. The call to expand their family was answered during a visit to  their local Walmart, where Dawn and Danny were browsing a photo album  of children in foster care at a booth hosted by the Arkansas Department  of Human Services. They fell in love with the picture of a 4-year-old  girl and learned she had three brothers. The siblings had been in the  foster care system for 3 years and multiple homes when the couple  adopted all four of the children.   After their first adoption experience, Dawn decided to follow her  passion to work with children in foster care and obtained her master's  degree in social work. She went on to work for the Arkansas Department  of Human Services and served in a variety of roles during her career,  including as an adoption specialist. During these years, the family was  approached to consider adopting others in foster care and eventually  added six more children to their home.   Danny worked for many years as a police officer and a bus driver  while caring for his growing family. Danny and Dawn also visited  Washington, DC, on several occasions to advocate for adoption and  children in foster care. The 12 Curtis children span 20 years of age  and are all adults now, but the example and dedication of their parents  continues to move everyone around them.   The Curtis family is an amazing example of putting love into action.  Their personal commitment changed the lives of the children they  brought into their family and serves as an inspiration for others as to  the impact of foster care and adoption.                            ____________________
