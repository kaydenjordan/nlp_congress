 Mr. Speaker, today I rise because, as a proud pro-life  advocate, I cannot stay silent as I watch the Biden administration chip  away at the rights of defenseless unborn.   Democrats have been working over time with the Biden administration  to roll back critical protections for the unborn so they can push  radical pro-abortion policies, and their latest victim, it appears, is  the Hyde amendment.   For over 40 years, the Hyde amendment has saved millions of lives by  preventing the use of taxpayer dollars to fund abortions. A recent poll  from the Knights of Columbus indicates that 58 percent of Americans  oppose the use of taxpayer dollars to support abortions. That number  also includes 65 percent of Independents and 31 percent of Democrats.   If millions of Americans are against the use of tax dollars being  used to support abortion, then why is Congress considering legislation  that does just exactly that?   If this legislation were for the people, wouldn't we listen to them  instead of forcing American taxpayers to subsidize something that the  majority of them are against?   Taking the life of an unborn child is simply unconscionable. I  believe that we, as a governing body, have a responsibility to protect  life at every stage, especially the defenseless unborn who are unable  to advocate for themselves. We have no business using taxpayer dollars  to fund abortions.                            ____________________
