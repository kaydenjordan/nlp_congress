 Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to amendment 35, and  I yield myself such time as I may consume.   The amendment would establish an online public directory of political  appointees at the Office of Personnel Management.   I want to thank Ranking Member Rogers for his extraordinary  leadership throughout this process. I want to echo his words from his  opening testimony on Monday before the House Rules Committee where he  urged the committee to ``keep out superfluous amendments that are not  related to the Department of Defense.''   Unfortunately, this advice fell upon deaf ears with regard to this  particular amendment. This politically charged amendment is wholly  outside HASC's jurisdiction. It does not belong in the NDAA.   This lies solely within the jurisdiction of the House Oversight and  Reform Committee, and the reasoning as to why we are debating this as a  measure in the NDAA is absolutely beyond me.   The Plum Book is already available online, and as of 2012 has already  been published in a more searchable and accessible format. Given that  the Plum Book is already accessible online in two separate locations,  there is no justification whatsoever for the measure's authorization  for $7 million in appropriated taxpayer money to build this new online  database.   This amendment goes beyond the original intent of the Plum Book by  creating a continuously updated website listing thousands of political  appointees and senior government officials, which may dissuade good  people from serving in future Presidential administrations and risk  abuse by enabling political targeting.   A tool that is updated monthly is not a transitional resource between  administrations but, rather, a database that can be readily exploited  by political activists to track down and target politically appointed  leaders.   Political appointees are already accountable to the duly elected  President whom they serve, and the President, of course, is accountable  to the American people every 4 years and to Congress each day of his or  her term.   Even more concerning is requiring the OPM Director to publish a  report containing information on any appointee's demographics,  including self-identified data on race, ethnicity, Tribal affiliation,  gender, disability, sexual orientation, veteran status, and whether the  appointee is over the age of 40.   Although the bill language claims to make the information anonymous,  the mere fact that OPM would be in possession of this personal  information, which is utterly unrelated and immaterial to the position  to which the person is being appointed, could have a chilling effect on  future political appointees.   Additionally, there appear to be no safeguards in this amendment  protecting this personal information from subsequent disclosure,  whether through a FOIA request or a cyber  [[Page H4944]]  breach. We have already seen during this Congress the multiple cyber  breaches at various Federal agencies.    If we can't secure the information collected by the Federal  Government, then the government shouldn't be in possession of that  information to begin with.   This provision in and of itself is egregious.   Transparency and accountability are essential to our constitutional  government, but this amendment neglects the necessary safeguards to  protect Federal employees.   Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues, what protections are in the PLUM  Act to ensure that the database cannot be abused by activists to target  and harass public officials?   What protections exist in this amendment to protect officials who are  serving in sensitive, national security positions?   Why is it truly necessary, given that political appointees are  already accountable to the public through their service under an  elected President?   Don't you agree that this sensitive, private information this  amendment seeks is not appropriate for the government to be collecting  from our civil servants?   Shouldn't we instead be concerned about the effectiveness of our  government leadership?   This amendment is a slippery slope to requiring, collecting, and  publishing the same information about our broader Federal workforce.   Until these questions can be answered with sound policy, and our  Federal agencies can guarantee the cybersecurity and other security of  this information, I urge my colleagues to oppose this nongermane  amendment.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, in closing, I would just urge opposition to  this nongermane, intrusive, and overreaching amendment.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The  SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 8,  the yeas and nays are ordered.   Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this question  are postponed.              Amendment No. 36 Offered by Mr. Johnson of Georgia
