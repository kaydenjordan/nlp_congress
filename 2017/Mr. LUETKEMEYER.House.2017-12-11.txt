 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the bill (H.R. 2706) to provide requirements for the appropriate  Federal banking agencies when requesting or ordering a depository  institution to terminate a specific customer account, to provide for  additional requirements related to subpoenas issued under the Financial  Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989, and for  other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2706         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Financial Institution       Customer Protection Act of 2017''.       SEC. 2. REQUIREMENTS FOR DEPOSIT ACCOUNT TERMINATION REQUESTS                     AND ORDERS.         (a) Termination Requests or Orders Must Be Valid.--  [[Page H9771]]         (1) In general.--An appropriate Federal banking agency may       not formally or informally request or order a depository       institution to terminate a specific customer account or group       of customer accounts or to otherwise restrict or discourage a       depository institution from entering into or maintaining a       banking relationship with a specific customer or group of       customers unless--        (A) the agency has a valid reason for such request or       order; and        (B) such reason is not based solely on reputation risk.        (2) Treatment of national security threats.--If an       appropriate Federal banking agency believes a specific       customer or group of customers is, or is acting as a conduit       for, an entity which--        (A) poses a threat to national security;        (B) is involved in terrorist financing;        (C) is an agency of the Government of Iran, North Korea,       Syria, or any country listed from time to time on the State       Sponsors of Terrorism list;        (D) is located in, or is subject to the jurisdiction of,       any country specified in subparagraph (C); or        (E) does business with any entity described in subparagraph       (C) or (D), unless the appropriate Federal banking agency       determines that the customer or group of customers has used       due diligence to avoid doing business with any entity       described in subparagraph (C) or (D),      such belief shall satisfy the requirement under paragraph       (1).        (b) Notice Requirement.--        (1) In general.--If an appropriate Federal banking agency       formally or informally requests or orders a depository       institution to terminate a specific customer account or a       group of customer accounts, the agency shall--        (A) provide such request or order to the institution in       writing; and        (B) accompany such request or order with a written       justification for why such termination is needed, including       any specific laws or regulations the agency believes are       being violated by the customer or group of customers, if any.        (2) Justification requirement.--A justification described       under paragraph (1)(B) may not be based solely on the       reputation risk to the depository institution.        (c) Customer Notice.--        (1) Notice required.--Except as provided under paragraph       (2) or as otherwise prohibited from being disclosed by law,       if an appropriate Federal banking agency orders a depository       institution to terminate a specific customer account or a       group of customer accounts, the depository institution shall       inform the specific customer or group of customers of the       justification for the customer's account termination       described under subsection (b).        (2) Notice prohibited.--        (A) Notice prohibited in cases of national security.--If an       appropriate Federal banking agency requests or orders a       depository institution to terminate a specific customer       account or a group of customer accounts based on a belief       that the customer or customers pose a threat to national       security, or are otherwise described under subsection (a)(2),       neither the depository institution nor the appropriate       Federal banking agency may inform the customer or customers       of the justification for the customer's account termination.        (B) Notice prohibited in other cases.--If an appropriate       Federal banking agency determines that the notice required       under paragraph (1) may interfere with an authorized criminal       investigation, neither the depository institution nor the       appropriate Federal banking agency may inform the specific       customer or group of customers of the justification for the       customer's account termination.        (d) Reporting Requirement.--Each appropriate Federal       banking agency shall issue an annual report to the Congress       stating--        (1) the aggregate number of specific customer accounts that       the agency requested or ordered a depository institution to       terminate during the previous year; and        (2) the legal authority on which the agency relied in       making such requests and orders and the frequency on which       the agency relied on each such authority.        (e) Definitions.--For purposes of this section:        (1) Appropriate federal banking agency.--The term       ``appropriate Federal banking agency'' means--        (A) the appropriate Federal banking agency, as defined       under section 3 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12       U.S.C. 1813); and        (B) the National Credit Union Administration, in the case       of an insured credit union.        (2) Depository institution.--The term ``depository       institution'' means--        (A) a depository institution, as defined under section 3 of       the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1813); and        (B) an insured credit union.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks, and  include extraneous material on this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, today the House will consider an amended version of H.R.  2706, the Financial Institution Customer Protection Act, legislation I  introduced in an effort to provide greater transparency and  accountability among banking regulators.   Over the past few years, members of the Financial Services Committee  and others in the House have expressed bipartisan concern surrounding  Operation Choke Point, the Department of Justice and FDIC-led  initiative that sought to separate legal businesses from financial  services they need to survive.   People may think Operation Choke Point is limited to payday lenders  or the banks serving them, but it is not. This initiative has spread to  many industries, including tobacco shops, pawn brokers, ATM operators,  even amusement gaming companies, to name just a few. Even attorneys and  third parties that serve these industries have been impacted.   The underlying problem here is significant. The Federal Government  should not be able to intimidate financial institutions into dropping  entire sectors of the economy as customers, based not on risk or  evidence of wrongdoing, but purely on personal and political  motivations.   This type of program sets an incredibly dangerous precedent that  shouldn't be permitted under any Presidential administration. There  needs to be a process in place to ensure that the banking regulators  have the ability to pursue bad actors, but not to punitively target  specific businesses or products that operate and are offered within the  confines of the law.   This legislation offers a straightforward approach to a complicated  problem. It simply dictates that Federal banking regulators cannot  suggest, request, or order a financial institution to terminate a  banking relationship unless the regulator has material reason beyond  reputational risk. It also puts in place the requirement that agency  management sign off on any account termination request or order.   The provisions contained in H.R. 2706 are so reasonable, in fact,  that the FDIC has already used its authority to put them in place.  Effective 2015, agency policy now requires supervisory staff to track  and document account termination recommendations. Such recommendations  must now be made in writing and not through informal suggestion. FDIC  regional leadership must be made aware of any such recommendation, and  the basis for such recommendation cannot rely solely on reputational  risk.   The original bill would have also struck the word ``affecting'' in  FIRREA and replaced it with ``by'' or ``against.'' I maintain that this  modest change would have helped to ensure that broad interpretations of  the law are limited and that the original intent of the statute,  helping to penalize fraud against or by financial institutions, is  restored.   Attorney General Sessions announced the end of Operation Choke Point  earlier this year, and we have noticed a dramatic decline in FIRREA  subpoenas resembling those seen during the height of the initiative.  The issues with FIRREA still need to be addressed, and while H.R. 2706  is not the opportunity to do that, I will continue to press for  reasonable reforms and clarifications of the law.   Within the banking agencies, these account termination requests are  still a significant problem. Just last week, I had a meeting with an  industry that has seen a rash of account terminations in Missouri,  Massachusetts, Rhode Island, California, Texas, and Wisconsin, to just  name a few of the States that have been affected. We have to restore  order, Mr. Speaker. Our goal should be to have more individuals and  businesses in banks, not forced from them.   Mr. Speaker, I remind my colleagues that the House has passed by a  voice vote two appropriations amendments prohibiting funding for  Operation Choke Point. Members from both sides of the aisle have  written letters and  [[Page H9772]]  talked to regulators about the dangers of such a program. This is a  very real issue and one that must be addressed.   Again, I want to emphasize that it is essential that DOJ and  financial regulators maintain the ability to pursue bad actors or  anyone they think could be a bad actor. This amended version includes  language offered by Ranking Member Waters to ensure that customer  account termination notices don't interfere with ongoing criminal  investigations. The checks and balances in this legislation would help  to ensure accountability among the regulators and would in no way  hinder the ability of any executive branch agency from going after  individuals or businesses suspected of fraudulent activity.   This legislation offers a responsible approach to curbing the  malpractice we have seen in Operation Choke Point. I want to thank the  many colleagues who worked with me on this legislation, in particular,  the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Heck), Chairman Hensarling, and  Ranking Member Waters for helping to get this considered on the  suspension calendar today.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Indiana (Mr. Hollingsworth), who is a distinguished member of the  Financial Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I just want to reiterate that this bill  is about greater transparency and accountability among the banking  regulators.   The Federal Government should not be able to intimidate financial  institutions into dropping entire sectors of the economy's customers  based on personal and political motivations. It should be based on risk  and evidence of wrongdoing.   Our new AG has stopped this practice, and the FDIC has incorporated  many of the principles in this bill already into their standard  operating procedures. But the importance of this bill is to codify in  law for the regulators the guardrails that are necessary to keep this  from happening to protect our citizens from this and many other  activities by an overreach of the bureaucracy.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the bill (H.R. 3093) to amend the Volcker Rule to permit certain  investment advisers to share a similar name with a private equity fund,  subject to certain restrictions, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3093         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Investor Clarity and Bank       Parity Act''.       SEC. 2. NAMING RESTRICTIONS.         Section 13 of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (12       U.S.C. 1851) is amended--        (1) in subsection (d)(1)(G)(vi), by inserting before the       semicolon the following: ``, except that the hedge fund or       private equity fund may share the same name or a variation of       the same name as a banking entity that is an investment       adviser to the hedge fund or private equity find, if--         ``(I) such investment adviser is not an insured depository       institution, a company that controls an insured depository       institution, or a company that is treated as a bank holding       company for purposes of section 8 of the International       Banking Act of 1978;        ``(II) such investment adviser does not share the same name       or a variation of the same name as an insured depository       institution, any company that controls an insured depository       institution, or any company that is treated as a bank holding       company for purposes of section 8 of the International       Banking Act of 1978; and        ``(III) such name does not contain the word `bank' ''; and         (2) in subsection (h)(5)(C), by inserting before the period       the following: ``, except as permitted under subsection       (d)(1)(G)(vi)''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and to include extraneous material on the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3093, the Investor Clarity and  Bank Parity Act. I would like to start by thanking my colleague from  Massachusetts (Mr. Capuano) for his work on this important bipartisan  legislation.   This bill makes a modest amendment to section 619 of the Dodd-Frank  Act, also known as the Volcker rule, by correcting an unintended  consequence that occurred during implementation.   When the regulators issued the final rule to the Volcker rule, they  imposed severe limitations on the ability of bank holding companies and  their affiliates, including investment advisers, to sponsor hedge funds  and private equity funds, also known as covered funds. As a result, a  covered fund cannot use the name of a sponsor.   For example, if XYZ investment adviser is an affiliate of XYZ bank  and sponsors a real estate fund, that real estate fund could not be  named XYZ real estate fund. Not only is such a restriction at odds with  industry practice, it reduces transparency and confuses investors about  who is actually managing a covered fund.   H.R. 3093 eliminates this prohibition and simply allows an affiliate  of a bank holding company, such as an investment adviser, to share a  similar name with a private equity fund. In doing so, this legislation  clarifies the original intent of the Volcker rule and, most  importantly, helps investors have better insight into who is actually  managing a covered fund.   Finally, H.R. 3093 is consistent with recommendations provided by the  Treasury Department in its recent report on banks and credit unions.   I want to again thank my friend from Massachusetts for his work on  this bill. The Volcker rule is in need of additional reforms. I  appreciate that Mr. Capuano has started on the naming issue and that  our colleagues on the Senate Banking Committee have included modest  Volcker reforms in Chairman Crapo's regulatory relief legislation.   It is my hope, however, that this is the beginning of the  conversation and that we can work again in a bipartisan, bicameral  fashion to pass additional Volcker reforms, such as the designation of  a single regulator to work with other regulators. In the meantime, I  urge my colleagues to support this commonsense legislation today.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time,  and I yield back the balance of my time.
