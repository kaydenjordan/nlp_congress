 Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of  legislation that I introduced today along with Senator Padilla to  preserve the enduring legacy of California's giant sequoias: the Save  Our Sequoias Act. I thank Senator Padilla for working with me on this  important bill, as well as the bipartisan sponsors of similar  legislation in the House.   The Save Our Sequoias Act would charge a dedicated group of Federal,  State, local, and Tribal land managers known as the Giant Sequoia Lands  Coalition with developing wildfire resilience projects to help save  these magnificent trees.   The bill would also provide Federal Agencies with narrow, targeted  authorities to implement these projects quickly and protect our  remaining sequoias, as well as create a strategy to enhance sequoia  reforestation.   Giant sequoias are one of the most iconic plants in the world. The  sequoia known as General Sherman is the largest tree on Earth at more  than 100 feet in circumference and 275 feet tall.   Sequoias grow quickly, producing a 50-foot tree's worth of wood each  year, yet can live to be thousands of years old. They are also  remarkably fire-adapted, with spongy bark that can be up to 2-feet  thick.   Perhaps most importantly to me, these incredible trees only grow in  my home State of California. Just being around these trees is a  humbling experience. Their immensity puts them in a class by  themselves, and it is no wonder that they have been the source of  reverence and amazement.   For many years, sequoias were considered nearly immune to the effects  of wildfires, but unfortunately devastating fires in recent years have  overwhelmed even their potent defenses. Officials have estimated that  20 percent of all mature giant sequoias have been destroyed just since  2020.   Scientific research has additionally suggested that without  significant action, another 20 percent could be lost in the next 3  years. This would be a staggering tragedy and demands action. As former  President Theodore Roosevelt himself put it, ``A grove of giant redwood  or sequoias should be kept just as we keep a great and beautiful  cathedral.''   The vast majority of giant sequoias live on Federal land, and I thank  President Biden and his administration for using existing authorities  to try to save these magnificent trees. Nevertheless, Congress can and  should enact legislation to protect sequoias long into the future.   Our bill would accomplish this goal by first codifying the Giant  Sequoia Lands Coalition, an existing group of public land managers with  jurisdiction over sequoia groves, and requiring it to develop a  strategy to make sequoia groves more resilient to wildfire. It would  also provide congressional support for the Biden Administration's  current actions under an emergency declaration to expedite sequoia  wildfire resilience projects.   Federal agencies should not be reliant on emergency authorities,  however, in order to implement necessary wildfire resilience projects  in the future. To that end, our bill provides those Agencies with  narrow, targeted authorities to continue making progress on those  projects and authorizes funding for dedicated personnel. It also  establishes a grant program for sequoia resilience projects that occur  off of Federal land.   Lastly, our bill ensures that we do not simply mitigate future  sequoia losses but also begin the process of regrowth. Since sequoias  can live to be thousands of years old, it is never too early to begin  rejuvenating these majestic trees.   Mr. President, giant sequoias are one of the great treasures of the  world, not just of California. It is incumbent upon Congress to pass  our bill to ensure they are protected and can be cherished for  thousands of years to come.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of  legislation that I introduced today along with Senator Padilla to  preserve the enduring legacy of California's giant sequoias: the Save  Our Sequoias Act.
