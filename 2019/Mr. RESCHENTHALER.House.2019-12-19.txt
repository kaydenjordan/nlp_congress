 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the United  States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) negotiated by President Trump  which will generate new economic opportunities for Pennsylvania workers  and families.   Thanks to President Trump's economic policies, earlier this year,  Pennsylvania's unemployment hit an all-time low of 3.8 percent. In his  first two years in office, the president fostered job and wage growth  by enacting the largest tax reform in 31 years and cutting burdensome  regulations that handcuffed Pennsylvania employers. But it's the USMCA,  his rewrite of the North American Free Trade Agreement, that promises  to be an even greater boon for my state's economy and the nation.   Pennsylvania is uniquely positioned to benefit from the USMCA given  our strong ties with Canada and Mexico. In 2017 alone, Pennsylvania  exported over $10 billion worth of goods to Canada and over $4 billion  worth of goods to Mexico. Nearly 500,000 jobs across the state are  supported by U.S. trade with our North American neighbors. By removing  the red tape required to trade, we can empower job creators to grow  their businesses and hire even more workers.   Importantly, the USMCA improves access to international markets for  many of the industries that drive our state's economy. Pennsylvania  farmers currently export over $1 billion in goods each year to Canada  and Mexico. This agreement creates even more export opportunities by  eliminating Canada's protectionist dairy program and opening access for  chicken and egg exports.   U.S. manufacturing is another key sector that will enjoy new  protections under the USMCA. The deal includes stronger rules of  origin, meaning more goods and materials, including Pennsylvania steel,  will be manufactured in the U.S. Further, the agreement puts in place  new enforceable labor standards to level the playing field for American  workers and includes new commitments to address non-tariff barriers  that currently hinder trade.   The USMCA also includes, for the first time ever, a chapter dedicated  to digital trade. I applaud the administration's work to promote  digital trade and protect the intellectual property of American  innovators. In my district alone, nearly 1,000 people are employed by  the movie and television industry and rely on this work to pay their  bills and feed their families. It is critical that we build upon the  strengths and accomplishments of the USMCA and ensure future trade  deals leave adequate space for Congress to work together with the  president and American creators to reform and update current copyright  laws, including Section 512 of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act,  which was written in 1998 and has not kept up with the times. Future  trade deals should exclude this provision so that Congress can work in  a bipartisan manner to ensure U.S. law better protects the creative  professionals living in my district and across the nation.   Mr. Speaker, President Trump has already fostered an economic  resurgence through his pro-growth policies, and the USMCA will further  that progress. I am proud to support USMCA today.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        December 19, 2019, on page H12269, ``*ERR08*'' inadvertently  appeared at one place.
