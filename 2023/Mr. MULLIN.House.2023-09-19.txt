 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the  majority's manufactured shutdown threat. For this reason, I ask my  colleagues to defeat the previous question so we can bring up  legislation that commits to protecting vital programs, like Social  Security.   Our most vulnerable communities will suffer as a result of this  shortsighted attempt to hold our most important Federal programs  hostage. For example, my California bay area district is home to over  127,000 senior citizens, many of whom rely on Social Security.   Under a Republican shutdown, new applicants to the Social Security  program wouldn't be able to enroll in this bedrock American program.  While Social Security payments would continue during a shutdown,  seniors would experience even more delays and lengthy phone queues when  contacting the Social Security Administration. Many seniors already  struggle to find help, and a Republican shutdown would only exacerbate  this problem.   Modern Republicans are playing roulette with essential constituent  services and creating yet another manufactured crisis.   I urge the majority to bring a serious bipartisan proposal to the  table to prevent this avoidable crisis.
