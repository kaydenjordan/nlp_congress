 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 1132) to amend title 5, United States Code, to provide for a 2- year prohibition on employment in a career civil service position for  any former political appointee, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows                                 H.R. 1132         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Political Appointee       Burrowing Prevention Act''.       SEC. 2.

If       the Associate Director makes that determination, the       Associate Director may approve the request.        ``(4) Notification to congress.--With respect to any       request approved under paragraph (3), the Associate Director       shall, not less than five days before the date the Associate       Director provides approval to the head of the requesting       agency, provide to the Committee on Oversight and Government       Reform of the House of Representatives and the Committee on       Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs of the Senate the       agency certification under paragraph (2) and the agency       head's rationale for that certification.        ``(5) Covered individuals.--An individual described in this       paragraph is--        ``(A) a political appointee;        ``(B) a former political appointee who held any political       position during the five-year period before the date of the       request described in paragraph (2); or        ``(C) at the discretion of the Director of the Office of       Personnel Management, a former political appointee who held       any political position before the five-year period described       in subparagraph (B).        ``(b) Restriction on Appointment.--        ``(1) In general.--Notwithstanding any other law, rule, or       regulation, during the 2-year period following the date a       political appointee leaves or departs from a political       position, such appointee may not be appointed to any career       position in the civil service.        ``(2) Exception.--Paragraph (1) shall not apply to a       political appointee who has not personally and substantially       participated in any particular matter while employed in a       political position.        ``(c) Application.--Nothing in this section shall be       construed to restrict the appointment of an individual who       is--        ``(1) entitled to reinstatement under section 3593(b); or        ``(2) eligible for reinstatement under section 3593(a).

(b) Clerical Amendment.--The table of sections of chapter       31 of title 5, United States Code, is amended by adding after       the item relating to section 3114 the following:  ``3115. Employment of political appointees.''.        (c) Application.--        (1) Appointment requests.--Section 3115(a) of title 5,       United States Code, as added by subsection (a), shall apply       to any appointment or request for appointment described in       such section submitted to the Associate Director of Merit       Systems Accountability and Compliance after the date of       enactment of this Act.

(d) Regulations Required.--The Director of the Office of       Personnel Management shall issue regulations necessary to       carry out this Act. Such regulations shall include guidance       on the definition of the term ``personally and substantially       participated in a particular matter'' in section 3115(b)(2)       of title 5, United States Code, as added by subsection (a),       consistent with section 2641.201 of title 5, Code of Federal       Regulations.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1132, the Political  Appointee Burrowing Prevention Act, introduced by the gentleman from  Colorado, Representative Buck.   This important bill will protect the integrity of the civil service  and ensure the American people are served by a competent, nonpolitical  career workforce.   Under current law, each administration appoints a political staff to  help advance the administration's political goals. These political  employees leave at the end of the administration to make way for the  next administration's appointees.   In contrast, the career civil service is designed to carry over from  administration to administration. These employees should be hired based  on their qualifications and promoted based on their performance.  Despite the significant differences between the two types of positions,  however, political appointees are currently allowed to convert to  career positions. This practice is known as ``burrowing.''   As the Government Accountability Office explained: ``Circumstances  surrounding conversions can raise questions as to whether the  individuals selected experienced favoritism or enjoyed an unfair  advantage in the selection process.''   GAO went on to say: ``Any appearance of this could compromise the  merit system's integrity.''   H.R. 1132, the Political Appointee Burrowing Prevention Act, will  enact in law the requirement for OPM to review political conversions.   The bill also raises the bar for political conversions, requiring an  agency certify the conversion is necessary to meet its mission. To  ensure Congress can continue to monitor for abuse, the certification  must be provided to Congress before it is approved.   Finally, the bill prohibits political conversions within 2 years of  leaving a political appointment. This ensures sufficient time has  passed between when political appointees finish their appointment and  when they may become a career employee.   In closing, this bill protects the integrity of the merit-based  system so career politicians stay free of politics. The American people  deserve nothing less.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Colorado (Mr. Buck), the sponsor of the bill and my esteemed colleague.    Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 3737) to provide for a study on the use of social media in  security clearance investigations.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows                                 H.R. 3737         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Social Media Use in       Clearance Investigations Act of 2017''.       SEC. 2. STUDY ON USE OF SOCIAL MEDIA IN SECURITY CLEARANCE                     INVESTIGATIONS.         Not later than 6 months after the date of enactment of this       Act, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget       shall submit to Congress a report on the examination of       social media activity during security clearance       investigations, including--        (1) the current use of publicly available social media in       security clearance background investigations;        (2) any legal impediments to examining publicly available       social media activity, and whether those impediments are       statutory or regulatory in nature;        (3) the results of any pilot programs to incorporate social       media checks in such investigations, including the       effectiveness and cost of such programs;        (4) options for widespread implementation of the       examination of social media activity during such       investigations; and        (5) estimates on the cost for such options as part of--        (A) all Top Secret investigations; or        (B) all Secret and Top Secret investigations.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3737, the Social Media  Use in Clearance Investigations Act of 2017, introduced by the  gentleman from Florida, Representative DeSantis.   According to the Pew Research Center, 7 in 10 Americans use social  media today. A significant portion of those Americans' personal and  professional interactions occur online. It is just common sense that  the government should check the social media of individuals who apply  for security clearances, but it doesn't.   H.R. 3737 will move the government toward implementing checks of  social media for individuals we trust with our country's most sensitive  information.   The bill requires a study of the use of social media in security  clearance investigations to inform government-wide implementation of  social media checks. The study will provide comprehensive information  on existing pilot programs, lessons learned, and costs.   We must begin the process of strengthening the system now, and that  starts with determining best practices for moving forward.   H.R. 3737 will help ensure that government checks social media before  issuing security clearances.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. DeSantis), the sponsor of this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 4043) to amend the Inspector General Act of 1978 to reauthorize  the whistleblower protection program, and for other purposes, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4043         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Whistleblower Protection       Extension Act of 2017''.       SEC. 2. REAUTHORIZATION.

App.) is amended--        (1) in paragraph (1)(C)--        (A) by redesignating clauses (i) and (ii) as subclauses (I)       and (II), respectively, and adjusting the margins       accordingly;        (B) by striking ``Ombudsman who shall educate agency       employees--'' and inserting the following: ``Coordinator who       shall--        ``(i) educate agency employees--'';        (C) in subclause (I), as so redesignated, by striking ``on       retaliation'' and inserting ``against retaliation'';        (D) in subclause (II), as so redesignated, by striking the       period at the end and inserting the following: ``,       including--         ``(aa) the means by which employees may seek review of any       allegation of reprisal, including the roles of the Office of       the Inspector General, the Office of Special Counsel, the       Merit Systems Protection Board, and any other relevant       entities; and        ``(bb) general information about the timeliness of such       cases, the availability of any alternative dispute       mechanisms, and avenues for potential relief.;''; and         (E) by adding at the end the following:        ``(ii) assist the Inspector General in promoting the timely       and appropriate handling and consideration of protected       disclosures and allegations of reprisal, to the extent       practicable, by the Inspector General; and        ``(iii) assist the Inspector General in facilitating       communication and coordination with the Special Counsel, the       Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and       Efficiency, the agency, Congress, and any other relevant       entity regarding the timely and appropriate handling and       consideration of protected disclosures, allegations of       reprisal, and general matters regarding the implementation       and administration of whistleblower protection laws, rules,       and regulations.'';        (2) in paragraph (2), by striking ``Ombudsman'' and       inserting ``Coordinator'';        (3) by redesignating paragraph (3) as paragraph (4); and        (4) by inserting after paragraph (2) the following:        ``(3) The Whistleblower Protection Coordinator shall have       direct access to the Inspector General as needed to       accomplish the requirements of this subsection.''.        (b) Responsibilities of CIGIE.--Section 11(c) of the       Inspector General Act of 1978 (5 U.S.C.

(c) Reporting.--Section 5 of the Inspector General Act of       1978 (5 U.S.C.

(2) Retroactive effective date.--The amendment made by       paragraph (1) shall take effect on November 26, 2017.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4043, the Whistleblower  Protection Extension Act, a bill I introduced with Ranking Member  Elijah Cummings.   The Whistleblower Protection Extension Act reauthorizes the  whistleblower ombudsman program.   Whistleblowers are the front line of defense against waste, fraud,  and abuse in the Federal Government, but too many Federal employees are  unaware of the laws that protect them and the options available for  dealing with retaliation and other actions intended to silence them.   To address this problem, Congress created the ombudsman program in  2012. The program directs agency inspectors general to designate an  ombudsman for whistleblower protections at the agency. They provide  information to employees on whistleblower protections and remedies in  the event of retaliation.   This program was originally a component of the 2012 Whistleblower  Protection Enhancement Act and was set to expire after 5 years. Over  the past 5 years, the ombudsman program has received high marks from  the inspector general community. This benefits the country as a whole  and makes the Federal Government more efficient. For that reason, it is  imperative that we pass H.R. 4043 and make the ombudsman program  permanent.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (S. 188) to prohibit the use of Federal funds for the costs of painting  portraits of officers and employees of the Federal Government, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                   S. 188         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Eliminating Government-      funded Oil-painting Act'' or the ``EGO Act''.       SEC. 2. PROHIBITION ON USE OF FUNDS FOR PORTRAITS.         (a) In General.--Subchapter III of chapter 13 of title 31,       United States Code, is amended by adding at the end the       following:       ``Sec. 1355. Prohibition on use of funds for portraits         ``(a) No funds appropriated or otherwise made available to       the Federal Government may be used to pay for the painting of       a portrait of an officer or employee of the Federal       Government, including the President, the Vice President, a       Member of Congress, the head of an executive agency, or the       head of an office of the legislative branch.        ``(b) In this section--        ``(1) the term `executive agency' has the meaning given the       term in section 133 of title 41; and        ``(2) the term `Member of Congress' includes a Delegate or       Resident Commissioner to Congress.''.        (b) Clerical Amendment.--The table of sections for       subchapter III of chapter 13 of title 31, United States Code,       is amended by adding after the item relating to section 1354       the following new item:  ``1355. Prohibition on use of funds for portraits.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and to  include extraneous material on the bill under consideration, including  an exchange of letters on the House companion bill, H.R. 1701, between  the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform and the Committee on  House Administration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 188, the Eliminating  Government-Funded Oil-Painting Act, a bill introduced by Senator Bill  Cassidy. In years past, the Federal Government spent hundreds of  thousands of dollars on portraits of government officials. Taxpayer  funds should be invested in programs that benefit taxpayers and our  country, not oil paintings of Cabinet members to boost their egos.   That is why today we consider S. 188, the Eliminating Government- Funded Oil-Painting Act, otherwise known as the ``EGO Act.'' The EGO  Act makes clear, once and for all, that government agencies cannot  spend taxpayer dollars on oil paintings.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense,  bipartisan legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.           House of Representatives, Committee on Oversight and             Government Reform,                                  Washington, DC, December 6, 2017.      Hon. Gregg Harper,      Chairman, Committee on House Administration, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: On September 13, 2017, the Committee on       Oversight and Government Reform ordered reported H.R. 1701,  [[Page H1419]]       the ``Eliminating Government-funded Oil-painting Act'' with       an amendment, by voice vote. The bill was referred primarily       to the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, with an       additional referral to the Committee on House Administration.        I ask that you allow the Committee on House Administration       to be discharged from further consideration of the bill so       that it may be scheduled by the Majority Leader. This       discharge in no way affects your jurisdiction over the       subject matter of the bill, and it will not serve as       precedent for future referrals. In addition, should a       conference on the bill be necessary, I would support your       request to have the Committee on House Administration       represented on the conference committee. Finally, I would be       pleased to include this letter and any response in the bill       report filed by the Committee on Oversight and Government       Reform, as well as in the Congressional Record during floor       consideration, to memorialize our understanding.        Thank you for your consideration of my request.            Sincerely,      Trey Gowdy.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                               Committee on House Administration,                                   Washington, DC, December 6, 2017.      Hon. Trey Gowdy,      Chairman, Committee on Oversight and Government Reform,           Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you for your letter regarding H.R.       1701. As you know, the bill was received in the House of       Representatives on March 23, 2017, and referred primarily to       the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform and in       addition to the Committee on the Committee on House       Administration. The bill seeks to restrict funds appropriated       or otherwise made available to the Federal Government from       being used to pay for the painting of a portrait of an       officer or employee of the Federal Government, including the       President, the Vice President, a Member of Congress, the head       of an executive agency, or the head of an office of the       legislative branch. On September 13, 2017, your Committee       ordered H.R. 1701 to be reported with an amendment by voice       vote.        I realize that discharging the Committee on House       Administration from further consideration of H.R. 1701 will       serve in the best interest of the House of Representatives       and agree to do so. It is the understanding of the Committee       on House Administration that forgoing action on H.R. 1701       will not prejudice the Committee with respect to appointment       of conferees or any future jurisdictional claim. I request       that your letter and this response be included in the bill       report filed by your Committee, as well as in the       Congressional Record.            Sincerely,                                                      Gregg Harper,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Speaker, I would like to make the gentleman from  Virginia aware that I have no further speakers and I am prepared to  close. I enjoy my colleague from Virginia's rather dry sense of wit and  humor.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill, and I yield back  the balance of my time
