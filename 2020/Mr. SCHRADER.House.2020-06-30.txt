 Madam Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to the  Oregon State University president, Dr. Ed Ray, who officially retires  today after 17 years of dedicated service to the school, the faculty,  and, most importantly, the students.   During his tenure at Oregon State University, President Ray set a  course for the school that made huge impacts in teaching, research,  outreach, and engagement.   Under Ray's leadership, Oregon State University has undergone an  incredible transformation, which has seen: student enrollment increase  from 19,000 in 2004 to over 32,000 this year; completion of 96 major  facility renovations and new buildings at OSU campuses, in excess of  $1.1 billion; and a capital fundraising campaign that successfully  raised nearly $1.15 billion.   President Ray leaves Oregon State with a legacy and vision for the  future that will continue in service to student success, faculty and  research excellence, outreach, and a 21st century mission.   Madam Speaker, on behalf of a grateful Beaver Nation, we say thank  you to Ed.   Madam Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to Oregon State University  President Dr. Ed Ray, who is officially stepping down today after 17  years of dedicated service to the school, faculty, and most importantly  the students.   President Ray is a passionate advocate for higher education--it is  his life's work in which he has dedicated the last 50 years as a  teacher and administrator.   Prior to his arrival at Oregon State University in 2003, Ray spent  over 30 years at Ohio State University where he was a member of the  economics faculty from 1970 to 2003, served as economics department  chair from 1976 to 1992, served as associate provost then senior vice  provost and chief information officer from 1992 to 1998, and finally  executive vice president and provost from 1998 to 2003.   Upon his arrival at OSU, President Ray set a course for the school to  make substantial impacts in teaching, research, and outreach and  engagement. Focusing on inclusive excellence through student access,  learning, and success, as well as leading a campus community that is  safe, inclusive, and diverse.   Under President Ray's leadership, OSU has become an internationally  recognized public research university, undergoing an incredible  transformation which has seen:   Student enrollment increase from 19,000 in 2004 to 32,744 students  this year--making OSU the state's largest university for the sixth  straight year. Of that number, 5,978 were first-generation students,  8,327 were students of color and 3,492 were international students.   The percentage of historically under-represented students at OSU has  nearly doubled from 13.5 percent to 26.3 percent.  [[Page H2980]]    The school has completed over 96 major facility renovations and new  buildings at OSU campuses in excess of$1.1 billion   A capital fundraising campaign that successfully raised nearly $1.15  billion for OSU's foundation.   The development of the Student Success Initiative, a comprehensive,  university-wide effort led by Ray which has raised $150 million for  scholarships, fellowships, and student experience funds.   In 2016, the development of OSU Cascades to enhance access to an OSU  four-year degree for the underserved central Oregon region. This is the  first new university expansion to be built in Oregon in 50 years.   The development of OSU E-campus into a consistent national top-ranked  institution for distance learning. This year, U.S. News & World Report  ranked OSU's online undergraduate program number five in the nation-- the school's sixth straight year ranked in the top-10 nationally. A  reflection of OSU's commitment to providing students with high quality  options for attaining an OSU degree that meets their needs.   The expansion of the Hatfield Marine Science Center in Newport that,  starting this fall, will provide a coastal campus location for  undergraduates, expand student access to marine studies, enhance the  marine laboratory, and provide a safe haven for community members in  case of a tsunami.   The expansion of OSU's dual-enrollment program to all 17 of Oregon's  community colleges, making it easier for students to access and  complete four-year degrees.   OSU's research enterprise continues to grow in scope and impact.  Awards to OSU faculty in 2019 totaled $439.7 million--OSU's second  largest award year ever.   In addition to his work at OSU, President Ray has consistently served  on executive boards of national associations including: the NCAA,  American Council on Education, the Association of American Colleges and  Universities, and the Association of Public and Land-grant  Universities.   His leadership in higher education has been recognized with the CASE  District VIII Leadership Award (2013), an honorary doctorate from the  University of Portland (2014), and the Oregon History Makers Medal  (2018) presented by the Oregon Historical Society. President Ray has  also been active locally in Oregon communities and currently serves as  board chair of Special Olympics Oregon.   President Ray's final State of the University address in February he  said, ``I guarantee the best is yet to come for OSU''. I couldn't agree  more and that is in no small part due to his exceptional leadership and  dedication for the last 17 years. President Ray leaves OSU with a  legacy and vision for a future that will continue in service to student  success, faculty and research excellence, outreach, and OSU's mission  as a 21st'' century land grant university.   Ed, on behalf of a grateful Beaver Nation we say, `thank you'.                            ____________________
