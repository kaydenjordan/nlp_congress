 Madam Speaker, I rise to honor the life of the late  Congressman Esteban Torres, a dedicated public servant, trailblazer for  Latino political power, and a champion for the working class.   Congressman Esteban Torres dedicated his life to serving his  community, early on as a labor leader and eventually in Congress and  the White House.   He was among the first Latinos elected to Congress, paving the way  for increased representation across all levels of government.   As a Member of this body, Congressman Torres proudly represented the  community in which he was raised and much of the community that I am  proud to serve today.   He fought with integrity for the rights of immigrants, environmental  justice, and economic empowerment.   His legacy will live on in the communities he represented and in the  hearts that he touched.   I send my sincere condolences to his family and all who knew him.                            ____________________
