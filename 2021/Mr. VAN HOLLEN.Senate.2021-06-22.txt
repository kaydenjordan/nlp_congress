 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, just a short time ago on this Senate  floor, we witnessed a low point for this body. We witnessed every  Republican Senator voting against moving forward to consider  legislation to strengthen our democracy. We witnessed all 50 Republican  Senators voting to block consideration of the For the People Act.   I don't know why people are afraid of debating this issue, which is  so fundamental to our country at this particular point in time. This  bill, the For the People Act, has many important provisions. One of  them, of course, is to establish minimum national standards, to make  sure that every eligible American voter can access the ballot box. That  should be something we all want. We should want every American eligible  to vote to be out there exercising his or her right to vote, to  participate in the decision making in our democracy. And yet not a  single Republican Senator voted to proceed with that debate, even  though this bill is more important now than ever before because we see,  as we speak, Republican State legislatures, in so many places around  our country, voting to erect barriers to the ballot box.   We see this in State after State, a pure partisan power play to rig  the rules, to win elections by subtraction--not to win elections  through the hurly-burly debate over the issues of the day, not to win  elections by talking about the agenda that somebody is advocating and  why someone should vote for a particular candidate. That is the way it  is supposed to be. But these are legislatures that are putting up  barriers to make it harder for people to access the ballot and  specifically designing these barriers to try to limit participation by  people of color and by younger voters.   We saw that even before the aftermath of this election. We saw it in  the aftermath of the Supreme Court decision in Shelby v. Holder. We saw  Texas and North Carolina and other States adopting these kind of  restrictive voting laws. You don't have to take my word for it; the  U.S. courts took a look at the North Carolina law that was passed a  number of years ago and said that they targeted African-American voters  with ``surgical precision'' to try to keep them from accessing the  voting booth, and that is exactly the kind of thing that is going on  now in State after State around the country: trying to win, not by the  addition and multiplication of democracy, but by subtraction and by  division.   And so why are these States doing this at this moment? They are doing  it because of the Big Lie that was perpetrated in the aftermath of our  Presidential election, a lie that the former President persists in  spewing and repeating to this very moment, the lie that he was somehow  cheated or robbed out of an election that led to the attack on this  Capitol on January 6.   It is that lie that is giving rise to these actions in State  legislatures. It is that lie that sadly led this body just a short  while ago to block consideration of a bill to establish a commission to  look at what happened on January 6. That bill, too, was filibustered  just like this one, in order to prevent the American people from  getting to the bottom of the Big Lie. Republican Senators blocked that,  too. They don't want the country to know, and they are perfectly happy  to allow all these State legislatures to put up barriers to voting as  part of that Big Lie narrative.   And we know it is a big lie for so many reasons. Of course, President  Trump and his campaign took their claims to courts throughout the  country. Over 60 courts said those were ridiculous claims. President  Trump's own Justice Department and his Attorney General, former  Attorney General Barr, before he stepped down, said there was no  wrongdoing in this election that would change any kind of outcome.   The President's point person at the Department of Homeland Security,  responsible for monitoring the integrity of elections, has testified  before Congress and said very clearly that the 2020 Presidential  election was the most secure election in American history--most secure  in American history. That is from the person in charge of election  integrity in President Trump's own administration.    So why are all these States enacting these barriers to voting after  an election that the Trump Homeland Security Department said was the  most secure in history? It is because so many people turned out and  voted in that secure election and they didn't like the outcome.   So when you don't like the outcome in elections, instead of taking  your case to the American people and saying, Vote for us next time  because here is our agenda for the country, here is what we are going  to do--instead, they decided they are going to try to win by putting up  barriers to try to prevent those large turnouts, especially from people  of color, and we saw younger voters come out in 2020.   So the decision to block this bill from debate is just a continuation  of protecting the Big Lie. It is a continuation of protecting the Big  Lie that is being fueled around the country by Donald Trump's  continuous fraudulent claims, which unfortunately have seized the  Republican Party.  [[Page S4691]]    We saw what happened in the House of Representatives. Liz Cheney, a  stalwart conservative, ousted from her leadership position because she  didn't pay homage to the former President. That is what is going on  here. That is what is going on in the House, and that is what is  reflected in this vote today, the refusal to even debate a bill to  strengthen our democracy. Come to the floor, tell us what you don't  like, tell us what you want to do. Do you really believe that what  these State legislatures are doing is a good thing for our democracy?   I know it is easier not to have to talk about that, easier to ignore  that, but we are not going to let this issue go away. We are going to  be here week after week to make sure that we continue to push this For  the People Act.   Now, in addition to the provisions to establish minimal protections  so every eligible voter can access the voting booth, the For the People  Act also has a number of very important provisions that are  overwhelmingly popular with the American people. One of them is the  incorporation of what is known as the DISCLOSE Act.   The DISCLOSE Act does a very simple thing: It gets rid of secret  corporate money being plowed into our elections through these secret  super PACs. You know what happened after the decision in Citizens  United were two things. One, corporate money could flow in unlimited  amounts into elections, but the Supreme Court at the time said: You can  at least be aware of who is spending this money if you pass laws to  make sure it is transparent.   In fact, a lot of the Justices who voted to overturn the Citizens  United--excuse me, voted to allow corporate money in politics, who were  the majority in Citizens United, have also said in that same opinion  that they essentially expected Congress to enact laws to ensure  transparency.   In fact, eight of the nine Supreme Court Justices in that case took  that position. Yet the Republican leader, who in the early 2000s called  for more transparency when it came to money being spent in elections,  is taking the opposite idea: We don't want the public to know who is  spending all that money. We want it to be secret.   I think most of us would agree and I know the American public agrees  that they have a right to know who is spending millions and millions of  dollars to try to influence their votes. We know that because survey  after survey shows that Republicans, Democrats, and Independents all  agree that they should know who is spending all of this dark money.   When you see a TV commercial that says, ``Paid for by the Committee  for America,'' you should know who is financing that ad to try to  influence your vote. It is a very simple principle. Voters have a right  to know. It was a principle agreed to by conservative jurists like  Justice Scalia. And yet the position of the Republican Senators today  was: We don't even want to talk about that. We don't even want to  debate that provision.   By the way, that provision, the DISCLOSE Act, passed the House back  in 2010, and it came here to the U.S. Senate, and the Senate version of  the DISCLOSE Act was debated on this Senate floor, and 59 Senators at  that time voted to proceed with the bill.   You might say: 59 Senators, that is the majority; why didn't it pass?  Because of the filibuster rule. They needed 60. And 59 Senators said:  We want disclosure. And 59 Senators said: Get rid of secret money. But  because of the filibuster rule, it didn't pass. It couldn't get to  final passage on a simple majority.   If that had passed back in 2010, we wouldn't have our airwaves  flooded with secret money today. We would have done what the American  people wanted. The DISCLOSE Act is in this bill now, and once again, 11  years later, Republican Senators are filibustering the bill for the  DISCLOSE Act.   They don't want the American people to know who is spending all of  that money, mostly corporate money, flowing underground under the radar  screen through our political system to try to elect candidates of the  choice of whatever special interests are spending that money. They  don't want you to know who they are, who is spending all that money to  elect people. So why don't we all agree we are going to get rid of  secret money? Apparently, we don't even want to debate that.   Another provision that is universally popular with the American  people is the idea that we should have nationwide nonpartisan  congressional districting. Let's draw congressional districts not based  on politics but based on some nonpartisan criteria.   I think we all heard the line that it should not be the case that  politicians are picking the voters. Voters should pick their elected  officials. These days, people can draw congressional district maps with  incredible precision with the use of computers. You can literally try  and draw a congressional district designed to get exactly the  electorate they want.   I don't think that is the way the Founders expected it to end up  working, to get a computer that could draw these districts with that  kind of precision and accuracy. And so one of the other important  provisions in the For the People Act is, Let's draw congressional  districts so that, we, the people, can make these decisions without the  lines having been drawn to predetermine the outcome. That is also in  this bill.   It also has some other important provisions that I support to try to  reduce the impact and influence of big money contributors to allow  people with lesser means to be able to contribute to elections and have  some element of public financing so that the system is more geared  toward the public interest than relying exclusively on the private big  contributions. That is another provision that is in the For the People  Act.   Some people may disagree with that. Come to the floor, debate it,  offer an amendment to get rid of it, let's vote. But what we saw today  was a refusal to engage in the democratic process of debate in  consideration of a bill. They used this provision, the filibuster  provision, to block a bill to help protect and strengthen our  democracy, and that is a sad and shameful day in the U.S. Senate.   But I am going to end with this. This issue is not going away. I was  glad to see that even as every Republican Senator voted no, every  Democratic Senator united together to say, We stand for the idea that  we should have some minimal national standards for access to the ballot  booth to protect our democracy and that we should get rid of secret  money in politics.   Every Democrat said, Let's proceed to debate a bill that has those  important provisions in it. And so we are not going away. This is a  vote that may be a temporary setback, but it is my strong view that, at  the end of the day, democracy will prevail in the sense that it will be  strengthened and that the American people are not going to stand for a  process that reinforces the Big Lie that was perpetrated on this  country.   And so the good news--the good news, as I said, is every Democratic  Senator said yes to moving forward, and we will find a way to get this  done. We will find a way to protect our democracy.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 282, which was  submitted earlier today.
