 Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to speak about the  legislation we are going to be voting on later today, including an  amendment that I have, and it has to do with the Crime Victims Fund.  And I just want to explain and remind my colleagues just how important  the Crime Victims Fund is.   This is a very, very major funding source for people who do some of  the most important work in America. I know. I have met these folks. I  have toured their facilities all across Pennsylvania. I am referring to  the advocates for victims of crimes. And these advocates, my goodness,  the heinous and horrendous crimes that they guide people's recovery  from--I am at a loss for words to describe what these folks do often  for children, often for very vulnerable people who are victims of these  heinous crimes.   Well, thank God there are people who dedicate their lives,  professionals who dedicate their lives to helping people with their  recovery, to helping people who are victims to cope with what can be  horrific reliving of the experience when they have to recount it to law  enforcement or go through physical exams and on and on. It is very,  very difficult work, and it is very, very important to help completely  innocent victims get through what is undoubtedly the worst experience  in their lifetime.   So the Crime Victims Fund provides resources for the people who help  the victims of crime and for victims themselves. It is important to  point out that the fund is funded entirely by the proceeds from  criminal penalties. There is no taxpayer money in this fund. There  never has been. It is entirely from criminal penalties.   And there is a statute that created this account in the Federal  Government that requires the money that goes into it, these criminal  penalties, to go to the victims and their advocates. But it doesn't say  when the money has to go, and so that gave rise to a serious problem  that developed.   For years, it turns out that money that was put into this fund--money  from criminal penalties that went into the fund--didn't go to victims,  didn't go to the advocates for victims. It was intentionally withheld  because we had these crazy budget rules that created an incentive to  withhold it.   The way the budget rule worked is, if there was money in the fund  that did not go to the victims of crime and their advocates, as it is  supposed to, under the budget rules, you could pretend that that was a  savings, and it would therefore allow you to spend more money in other  areas. It was effectively a way to circumvent spending caps, and that  is how it was used.   Year in and year out, money was systematically withheld from victims  of  [[Page S4970]]  crime and their advocates, and it was a big problem. I will give you a  sense of scale. In 2014, for instance, only $745 million was obligated,  despite a balance of $9 billion. There was over $8 billion in funding  that was supposed to go to crime victims and their advocates  intentionally withheld. In 2013, only $730 million was obligated out of  a little over an $8 billion balance. There was over $7 billion  intentionally withheld.   From 2001 to 2014, the value of the funds--the money going in-- increased by almost 600 percent. Funding for victims of crime and their  advocates increased by 39 percent.   This was wrong. It was an abuse. It was based on an arcane and  ridiculous budget rule, and it had a very, very deleterious effect. So  when I discovered this, I began fighting this aggressively. It was  brought to my attention by the people who serve victims of crime.   These groups came to me and asked me to help them in the struggle for  them to get the resources they needed to meet the unmet needs of  victims of crime all over my State and, I am sure, all over the  country.   For instance, in 2015, the National Children's Alliance sent me a  letter, and they said:         The [Crime Victims Fund] caps have been set too low;       deposits--    Meaning the criminal penalties going into the fund--       have skyrocketed while disbursements have remained almost       flat. . . . We look forward to further working with you to       make all of the statutory changes needed to update the VOCA       Crime Victims Fund and in turn better meet the needs of all       victims and survivors of crime.    In 2016, the Court Appointed Special Advocates wrote:         Since 2000, when Congress began capping disbursement from       the Crime Victims Fund to prevent fluctuations in deposits,       funding has not kept pace with the needs of victims,       including the growing population of child victims in America.    In 2015, I got a letter from the Pennsylvania Coalition Against  Domestic Violence, and they said:         The most frustrating thing for someone who has done policy       work is that there is money available for these unmet needs.    That is all true. There was money available. It was because money was  deposited into the fund. It was just being systematically withheld from  the victims of crime and their advocates.   But I got the message, and I think these folks were exactly right. So  in response to these groups, I began working closely with appropriators  on both sides of the aisle to address this problem and worked  extensively with Senator Shelby and his staff. The fact is, since about  2015, appropriators, the folks who control the effective allocation of  this, have voluntarily obligated appropriate levels of disbursements  since 2015, and the chart illustrates this very clearly.   Everything to the left of the green line is prior to 2015. You can  see these very, very low levels--less than $1 billion every year-- despite huge amounts of money being poured in; and then afterwards,  starting in 2015, large, large increases in disbursements from the  fund. Very, very important.   This has changed the circumstances for advocates of crime. They have  grown enormously. I know this. In Pennsylvania, they have been able to  hire more counselors. They have been able to open more facilities to  treat and to help these victims of crime.   This is tremendous progress, but there is no guarantee that it is  going to continue. So I have sought to make this simple principle: The  idea that the money flowing into the fund should also flow out of the  fund to the victims. I have tried to make this a permanent arrangement.   Now, let me be very clear. I am not trying to change budget rules. I  am not trying to reopen some general budget. This is one egregious  example of a category of budget flaws, and I am not trying to change  it. I would love to change that. I should qualify that. I am trying to  change it in other venues, but not here, not today. Today, all I am  trying to do is something very, very narrow and very specific, and that  is to make sure that victims of crimes and their advocates get the  money they are supposed to get. It is really and truly as simple as  that.   I have introduced legislation to do just this, repeatedly--you know,  legislation that would simply require that we appropriate the  appropriate dollar amounts each year. It was reported favorably out of  the Senate Budget Committee in 2015. It was unanimously adopted in the  congressional Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019.   So there is broad bipartisan support for this idea. But we have never  been able to get it across the finish line. Again, I am not trying to  change all the budget rules, just this one fund. I just want to make  sure that crime victims get the money that the statute says they are  supposed to get.   The Senator from Illinois, I believe, is the Senator who has  introduced legislation that would create a new category of resources  for the Crime Victims Fund, and that is specifically to add deferred  and nondeferred prosecution agreement payments to the Crime Victims  Fund. So it wouldn't be just criminal judgments. It would also be these  prosecution agreements.   I fully support that money going into the Crime Victims Fund. It is a  new, important source of revenue that can help to serve these victims  of crime. There are no tax dollars involved. I support this goal. I  support this legislation. I just want to make sure that we don't go  back to these days, that weren't so terribly long ago, when money going  into the fund stayed in the fund because it served people's purposes.   And that is a problem I have with the underlying legislation in its  current form. That legislation has no requirement whatsoever that any  increase in funding will actually be matched by an increase in outflows  for victims and their advocates.   You see, making the fund bigger doesn't by itself guarantee that  there will be any more money for victims of crime or their advocates.  Ensuring that money goes into the fund is just not enough. We saw this.  We need to ensure that more money is actually leaving the fund and  going to victims, not remaining unspent so as to offset some other  category of spending, who knows what.   I was appreciative back in 2018 for the endorsement from the National  Organization for Victim Assistance, who wrote:         A permanent solution is needed. . . . There is no mechanism       to stop Congress from diverting money from victims in the       future, should it choose to do so.    Well, my amendment solves this problem. It is very simple. It would  just require a reasonable minimum level for victims and advocates based  on the amounts that have been deposited into the Crime Victims Fund  from both of the sources.   As I say, Congress has been adhering to this voluntarily since 2016.  What my amendment would do is it would simply create a point of order.  If legislation came to the floor that violated this principle and that  went back to these days of withholding--intentionally withholding-- money that should be going to victims of crime, then that legislation  would be subject to a point of order. Now, 60 Senators could override  that point of order, but at least it would create the presumption and  an incentive for appropriation legislation to actually provide the  funding to victims and their advocates that it is supposed to.   I should also be clear. The policy only creates a spending floor. It  would be at the discretion of the appropriators first and Congress as a  whole later to decide if they wanted to disburse more money than what  the floor contemplates, but the floor would at least prevent the worst  of these abuses.   So you can imagine my surprise when some of the folks who are big  advocates for putting more money into the fund are adamantly opposed to  my language that would actually require that money to also come out of  the fund and go to the intended beneficiaries.   You have to ask yourself, Why would someone oppose such a  requirement? It is hard not to think that maybe one of the reasons that  some people are adamant that they not be required to actually disburse  this money is maybe they are thinking about going back to what used to  happen routinely around here.   Remember, if the money is withheld from victims, if we go back to  when the money didn't make it out the door to victims, why, that amount  that is withheld can be spent on other things, and that is a powerful  incentive for a  [[Page S4971]]  lot of folks around here. You can see how it was done.   Now, I have heard people say, some of my opponents say: Don't worry.  We have no intention of diverting any of this money. Just trust us,  they say.   If they have no intention of diverting the money, then why are they  so adamant that they not be required to disburse it to its intended  beneficiaries?   Well, we don't really have to speculate anymore because the President  of the United States, President Biden, has been very clear about his  intentions. In his budget, he has explicitly called for withholding  this money from victims. It is right here in black and white. You don't  have to be creative here. You don't have to be conspiratorial. The  President has declared to the world in a published budget that he wants  to withhold the money from crime victims. In fact, he laid it out  there. It is in table S-8 of his budget.   I think this is a well-founded concern that we might go back to that  practice. And in any case, if nobody wants to go back to that practice,  then why wouldn't they agree to a requirement that this money actually  be disbursed?   Now, over the course of debating this, much has been made of a letter  that has been signed by some victims' organizations. Let's look at this  for what it is. Organizations that depend overwhelmingly on  congressional appropriations are asked to sign a letter by the very  people who control whether or not they get funding, and the letter is  advocating against codifying the stable increased funding that would  benefit those folks.   I think we know what is going on there. I want to thank the many  groups that are supporting this amendment: the Committee for a  Responsible Federal Budget, Heritage Action, FreedomWorks, the R Street  Institute, Taxpayer Protection Alliance, Americans for Prosperity, and  others.   But, folks, this isn't complicated and it isn't about overhauling  budget rules and it isn't about anything that is terribly complicated  or arcane. It is about ensuring that crime victims and their advocates  get the money they are supposed to get.   I urge my colleagues to stand with me and support this amendment and  make sure that the neediest and some of the most vulnerable among us-- victims of crime--receive the increased funding they deserve.    Mr. President, my understanding is that I would have 1  minute to close out debate on this; is that correct?    Could I claim that minute now?    Thank you very much.   Listen, it is very clear that we have very broad agreements on a  provision in this legislation that will dramatically increase the money  that goes into the fund. What my colleagues on the other side of the  aisle object to is a requirement that the money actually go out of the  fund to the victims and their advocates.   And we know that, systemically, money was withheld from this fund for  years, and we know that President Biden has stipulated in his current  budget that it must happen again.   I am simply saying, if we all agree that this nontaxpayer money  coming from criminal penalties and nondeferred agreements, if it is  supposed to go into this account, the Crime Victims Fund, which I  support, it should actually have to go to the victims of crime and  their advocates.   If my amendment passes, this bill could be passed by the House later  that same day or the next day. It could be on the President's desk  before the end of the week, easily. If it were to pass and be signed  into law, then we would be assured that appropriation bills would be  brought to the floor with the proper allocation done. So I urge the  support of my amendment, and then the adoption of the underlying bill.    Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.
