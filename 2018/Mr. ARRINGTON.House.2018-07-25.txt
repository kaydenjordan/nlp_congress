 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend, the  gentlewoman from the Cowboy State (Ms. Cheney), for yielding me time,  but mainly for her leadership on this issue to ensure that we as a  country and as the leaders of this great Nation fulfill our most  important responsibility to provide for a common defense, our  constitutional first job, to provide for the common defense, and, I  would add, to secure our liberty and the liberty of our posterity,  because there is no freedom without liberty. So God bless the  gentlewoman, and I thank her for leading the charge here.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to strongly encourage my colleagues to support  this resolution, H. Res. 1010, expressing the sense of the House of  Representatives that the United States Air Force faces tremendous  readiness challenges, reflected in a shrinking and dilapidated aircraft  fleet, insufficient personnel, and dangerous levels of deferred  maintenance, all of which are due, I think, in large part, I would say,  to budgetary uncertainty, which impedes the Air Force's ability to meet  our national security threats.   Mr. Speaker, there is nothing more important than the safety of the  American people and the security of our country. To do this, it is real  simple. We have to have a strong military. To do that, we would need to  include a strong Air Force.   For the past 70 years, our Air Force has ensured that America's  military prowess is unmatched in the skies, protecting our people, our  allies, and our interests around the world.   I am honored to have Dyess Air Force Base in my backyard, the largest  B-1 bomber base in this country, and I am proud to represent the brave  airmen of the 7th Bomb Wing and the 317th Airlift Group, and all those  in the Key City and in the Big Country area who support them.   I know that these men and women, along with all of our men and women  in the armed services around the world, are doing all they can every  day for our Nation's defense, and we as Congress ought to do all we can  to support them.   I think it is a moral imperative to ensure that our sons and  daughters, that our brothers and sisters who we ask to risk their  families, to risk their very lives, I think we should, at a minimum,  make sure they have the tools and resources necessary to be safe and  successful.   But recently, because of our continued reliance on temporary funding  measures known as CRs, or continuing resolutions, and the budget  uncertainty and disruption that those create, we have hurt the Air  Force's readiness and our combat capabilities.   We have failed, it is hard to believe, for almost 10 years in a row  to fund our military on time. Temporary spending measures, coupled with  continual defense cuts--I think it is about $200 billion over the last  decade--often delay procurement of important assets. Every contract,  whether it is to buy a plane, repair a plane, fuel a plane, or arm a  plane, is adversely affected by this funding start and stop.   But I think we could put it another way. This broken funding process,  or budget and appropriations process that I have been describing,  weakens our defense and plays directly into the hands of our  adversaries.                                time  1515    Throughout our Nation's history, our airmen and airwomen have always  answered the call of duty. They should not pay the price because  Congress has failed to fulfill our duty, which is to fully fund our  military and to do it on time. That is going to send the right message  to our troops. That will affirm our support for our troops. And I think  it sends the right message to our enemies as well, just as importantly.   Congress, though, has continued to fail to do this, and it has caused  significant damage to our entire defense community, including the U.S.  Air Force.   The Air Force has a 70-year history. This is the smallest and oldest  Air Force--the smallest and oldest--we have ever had.   The Heritage Foundation's ``2018 Index of U.S. Military Strength''  rates our Air Force readiness as being merely marginal. With marginal  processes, marginal inputs and resources, you get marginal results.   I think both sides of the aisle, my colleagues and my Democrat  colleagues, would agree that our troops deserve better than marginal  support. More than a quarter of our fighter pilot positions are  unfilled, and there is a 10 percent gap between the pilots that the Air  Force has and what they need to crew their aircraft, a gap that the Air  Force Secretary Heather Wilson said could ``break the force.'' That is  from our Secretary of the Air Force.   Last year, almost one-third of the Air Force's planes were not  flyable, and the average age of our aircraft is almost 30 years old.   Here is the worst part: Not only are we compromising our  capabilities, but  [[Page H7648]]  aviation accidents, including fatal accidents, are on the rise. We now  have four times as many servicemembers dying in training-related  accidents than in combat.   Mr. Speaker, by June of this year, we already matched the number of  noncombat crashes in the Air Force than we had all last year. Between  the years 2013 and 2017, we had 133 military accidents leading to  deaths. That is a 40 percent increase over that timeframe.   While our Nation's Air Force fleet continues to diminish in size and  effectiveness, our adversaries, like China, are modernizing and  expanding. The way I think of it, Mr. Speaker, is with respect to our  investment in national security and our military strength. We are  retreating while some of our adversaries are advancing. That is scary,  and that is unacceptable.   As President Reagan said, weakness invites aggression. He also said  that peace is achieved through American strength.   Our first President said that our military readiness is ``the most  effectual means of preserving peace.''   If we don't reverse this trend, we as a Nation will leave ourselves  vulnerable at a time of escalating threats and increasing instability  around the world.   That is why we need to give the Air Force the quantity and the  certainty of resources that match the caliber of our airmen and their  enormous commitment of that sacred duty of protecting our fellow  Americans. If we do this, our Air Force can continue safeguarding the  skies, remaining the greatest fighting force in the world.   Mr. Speaker, America is still the leader of the free world, and the  world is safer when America leads and when America's military is  strong. The world is counting on us. The American people and our allies  are counting on us. Most importantly, our brothers and sisters in  uniform are counting on us.   Politicians too often make the important seem insignificant and the  insignificant important. There is nothing more important for the  American people and the future of this Republic than what we are  talking about here today.   Let's be leaders. Let's do the right thing, and let's support our  troops.   Again, I want to thank Representative Cheney, along with my fellow  Texans, Chairman Thornberry and Chairman Granger, for their efforts.
