 Mr. Speaker, let us never forget that the GOP tax scam  will harm real people.   On Tuesday afternoon, 42 high school students from the Cristo Rey  Newark High School were here at the Capitol, urging me to vote against  the GOP tax scam.   Mr. Speaker, the young people I met with are from financially  struggling families. They worked hard and got accepted into an  innovative school to gain professional skills. The students take part  in a corporate work study program. Their earnings go towards their  college preparatory education. The model works.   Last year, 100 percent of Cristo Rey Newark's students were accepted  into 4-year colleges. Under the GOP tax scam, these bright, young  people from financially disadvantaged families will have to pay taxes  on their work study earnings--taxes they cannot afford.   That is wrong. I will continue to stand up against the GOP tax scam  and stand for programs that benefit America's children.                            ____________________
