 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 694 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 694         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 4712) to       amend title 18, United States Code, to prohibit a health care       practitioner from failing to exercise the proper degree of       care in the case of a child who survives an abortion or       attempted abortion. All points of order against consideration       of the bill are waived. The bill shall be considered as read.       All points of order against provisions in the bill are       waived. The previous question shall be considered as ordered       on the bill and on any amendment thereto to final passage       without intervening motion except: (1) one hour of debate       equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking       minority member of the Committee on the Judiciary; and (2)       one motion to recommit.        Sec. 2.  On any legislative day during the period from       January 22, 2018, through January 26, 2018--         (a) the Journal of the proceedings of the previous day       shall be considered as approved; and        (b) the Chair may at any time declare the House adjourned       to meet at a date and time, within the limits of clause 4,       section 5, article I of the Constitution, to be announced by       the Chair in declaring the adjournment.        Sec. 3.  The Speaker may appoint Members to perform the       duties of the Chair for the duration of the period addressed       by section 2 of this resolution as though under clause 8(a)       of rule I.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr.  McGovern), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume.  During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the  purpose of debate only.                                time  1230                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of House Resolution 694, which  provides a closed rule for consideration of H.R. 4712, the Born-Alive  Abortion Survivors Protection Act. This important bill ensures medical  care and legal protection for abortion survivors, protects their  mothers from prosecution, and holds abortion providers accountable.   Mr. Speaker, this bill is not duplicative as some have suggested. It  simply augments current law: the Born-Alive Infants Act and the Partial  Birth Abortion Ban Act, which the House passed in 2002 and 2003,  respectively, with very strong bipartisan support.   Current law includes, in the Federal definition of a person, infants  who are born alive no matter the method of birth or the stage of their  development. Current law, Mr. Speaker, also provides criminal penalties  for physicians who provide partial-birth abortions.   What current law does not provide, however, is enforceable protection  for those children who are born alive after a failed abortion attempt  and denied care, nor does it provide criminal penalties, Mr. Speaker,  for those who perform or knowingly ignore these actions.   Mr. Speaker, there are horrific stories of children born alive during  abortions and are either gruesomely left for dead or deliberately  killed once born. Even more, the abortion industry is fully aware of  the risk of a child being born alive during an abortion, especially if  the abortion occurs once the child is gestationally 18 to 20 weeks old  or more, the age at which we know a child is able to survive if given  the proper neonatal care.   Take the story, Mr. Speaker, of Gianna Jessen, an abortion survivor  who testified before the House Judiciary Committee in 2015. She said:  ``Instead of dying, after 18 hours of being burned in my mother's womb,  I was delivered alive in an abortion clinic in Los Angeles on April 6,  1977. My medical records state: `Born alive during saline abortion' at  6 a.m.   ``Thankfully, the abortionist was not at work yet. Had he been there,  he would have ended my life with strangulation, suffocation, or leaving  me there to die. Instead, a nurse called an ambulance, and I was rushed  to a hospital. Doctors did not expect me to live.   ``I did. I was later diagnosed with cerebral palsy, which was caused  by a lack of oxygen to my brain while I was surviving the abortion. I  was never supposed to hold my head up or walk. I do.''   She concluded: ``If abortion is about women's rights, then what were  mine?''   Some abortion providers, Mr. Speaker, are unwilling to respect the  Born-Alive Infants Protection Act, such as Priscilla Smith, who  testified at a House Judiciary Committee hearing in 2015, saying that  she didn't believe it would be a violation of the previous Born-Alive  Infants Protection Act if a baby were killed outside the womb as long  as the baby wasn't ``viable.''   Ms. Smith went on to assert some fetuses are never viable. She made  these claims notwithstanding the fact, Mr. Speaker, that viability is  not a factor, even under existing law, in determining whether an infant  deserves protection under the law. The law protects infants born alive  at any stage of development; and, therefore these abortion survivors  are entitled to the same degree of care that would be received by any  other babies of their age.   The bill we are debating today, Mr. Speaker, would impose enforceable  criminal penalties for clinics that do not treat survivors with proper  medical care. There is, sadly, evidence that clinics fail to provide  this care.   Deborah Edge, a former abortion clinic employee, wrote an op-ed about  her experience. She said: ``I was the doctor's right-hand person in the  operating room, and just like those employees of Dr. Gosnell''--who we  know was  [[Page H495]]  one of the most horrific abortionists to date, guilty of first degree  murder in the cases of at least three babies--``I saw the abortionist  puncture the soft spot in the baby's head or snip its neck if it was  delivered alive.''   The abortion providers, Mr. Speaker, who neglect to provide  appropriate professional care to these babies, or worse, who kill them  once they are born, must be held accountable.   Finally, I believe it is very important to note, to counter some of  the things you will hear from the other side of the aisle, that this  bill provides crucial protections for women. This bill protects women  who seek abortions by prohibiting them from being prosecuted under the  law.   H.R. 4712 also empowers women. It allows them to sue abortionists who  don't provide protection for aborted babies who are born alive. This is  very important, Mr. Speaker. Take the case of a woman named Angela who  went to a clinic in Orlando, Florida, when she was 23 weeks pregnant.   Angela received pills to begin contractions to induce an abortion.  After an hour of labor, Mr. Speaker, Angela delivered her baby, alive,  into a toilet. Angela had her friend call 911 to request help to save  her baby, but when the paramedics arrived on the scene, clinic staff  reportedly turned them away. The fire department's incident report said  they had no contact with the patient.   After the death of her son, Rowan, Angela wrote the following: ``The  very moment I saw my son was alive, nothing else in the whole world  mattered but Rowan's safety . . . Only one thing mattered to me:  getting Rowan help. I begged repeatedly.''   Tragically, the abortion clinic not only refused but also,  apparently, sabotaged Angela's call for help.   The bill that we are debating today, Mr. Speaker, would give women  like Angela the ability to sue abortionists who do not comply with the  law's requirements to give medical attention to children born alive  like baby Rowan.   Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I urge support for this rule to allow  consideration of H.R. 4712, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I compliment my colleague on the other side of the  aisle, Mr. McGovern. We have the opportunity, Mr. Speaker, to spend a  number of hours together up in the Rules Committee. It is always great  to manage debates with Mr. McGovern on the other side of the aisle  because you are left with, number one, no doubt about where he stands.  But number two, a target-rich environment as well, Mr. Speaker.   I would just say a couple of things. First of all, casting aspersions  on this bill when my colleagues say this bill is nothing more than a  political stunt or a political sound bite or a partisan talking point,  I can't imagine, Mr. Speaker, that they really believe that describing  legislation--they may disagree with the legislation--but for us to have  to be on the floor of this body talking about babies who are born alive  and who are killed at the hands of abortionists is far more than a  political sound bite.   I think Mr. McGovern, my colleague, was saying that we ought to be  ashamed of ourselves. I would just say, Mr. Speaker, that is rhetoric  that we don't need and rhetoric that is absolutely inaccurate in terms  of describing the important efforts that we have underway here.    I also would hope, Mr. Speaker, that our colleagues in the other  body, in particular, the Democrats in the other body--Mr. Schumer and  the others over there--were watching Mr. McGovern just now. If the  issue really is, Let's get to work and let's get a deal done, that deal  is in their hands.   Mr. McGovern well knows that you have got to get 60 votes in the  United States Senate to get a deal. We are in the position today where,  of the long list of items Mr. McGovern mentioned, I would say he failed  to mention the single most important obligation we have, which is to  ensure that we get resources to our military.   The reality of the situation we are facing today, at a moment when  our Nation faces grave threats, at a moment where we are having  servicemen and -women killed in training accidents--more killed in  training accidents in the last year than were killed in combat in the  last year--we in this body have failed to do our duty.   The reality of this, for people to understand, is that the Democrats  in the United States Senate are holding funding for defense hostage  because they want amnesty for illegal immigrants. That, Mr. Speaker, is  something that I think is absolutely indefensible.   So I hope that Mr. McGovern's colleagues in the Senate were watching  him, were listening to the concern he has about the sense of urgency  with moving forward.   Frankly, Mr. Speaker, we could have a deal today, if the Democrats  would stop holding spending hostage, stop holding the resources our  military needs hostage in order to grant amnesty for illegal  immigrants.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Tennessee  (Mrs. Blackburn), my friend and colleague and the sponsor of this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from Tennessee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New  Jersey (Mr. Smith), one of the strongest, most honorable and admirable  defenders of life in this body, my friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from New Jersey.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I understand why my colleague on the other side of the  aisle doesn't want the President to be traveling to Pennsylvania. He  doesn't want him to be traveling, I am sure, to any battleground  States. It didn't work out very well for his party in 2016, when the  President, very effectively, did just that all over the country.   I would also say that it is brave for my colleague to read a tweet of  the President here on the House floor. I think the last time that the  two of us were here together, we discussed the fact that it was a tweet  from the President that scared his leadership away  [[Page H499]]  from a crucial meeting at the White House to negotiate the budget cap  deal, to negotiate exactly the deal that he is now so anxious to get  done.   I can assure you, Mr. Speaker, that work is underway. I can assure  you that we could have a deal right now today if--and I will repeat it  once again. I know my colleague is going to say that the Republicans  control the Senate. But he knows, and I know, Mr. Speaker, that the  rules of the Senate require 60 votes to get something done. That means  today that if Chuck Schumer and the Democrats in the Senate are  unwilling to agree to the cap deal, they are unwilling to provide the  resources that we need to fund the military, the resources to make sure  our men and women in uniform can defend the Nation, because they are  holding out, and they are holding that hostage over amnesty. We could  get it done today if they would be willing simply to come to the table  and compromise and stop holding our troops hostage.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from West Virginia  (Mr. Mooney).    Mr. Speaker, if my colleague from Massachusetts is so  concerned about the government shutdown, about children's health, about  providing relief for healthcare, then I assume that he will be voting  ``yes'' for the CR that comes to the floor later today, which, in fact,  does extend CHIP, which, in fact, does help to provide relief from the  terrible medical device tax, and which will keep the government open. I  think that, if he wants to make sure that his objectives are met, there  is a simple solution to do that.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr.  Lamborn).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. LaMalfa).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Iowa  (Mr. King).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Louisiana (Mr. Johnson).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Washington (Mr. Newhouse), my colleague on the Rules Committee.                                time  1330     Mr. Speaker, could I inquire how much time is left on  each side?    Mr. Speaker, is the gentleman prepared to close?    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time to close.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I agree with my colleague on the other side of the aisle, my  colleague from Massachusetts. There is shameful action underway in this  Congress, and that shameful action is the fact that, I will say once  again, we are in a situation where our men and women in uniform have  not received the appropriations that they need to do the job that we  are asking them to do. And the reason they haven't--we have passed an  authorization bill through this body; we have passed an appropriations  bill through this body, but the Democrats in the Senate are refusing to  act. The Democrats in the Senate who hold the key to getting 60 votes  in the United States Senate are refusing to act. The reason they are  refusing to act, Mr. Speaker, is because they want amnesty for illegal  immigrants, and they are holding hostage the extent to which we are  able to provide resources to fund our men and women in uniform.   Mr. Speaker, there is a tremendous amount of urgency on both sides of  the aisle. I respect my colleague from Massachusetts and I respect his  frustration, but I do not respect, Mr. Speaker, the extent to which he  is accusing us of shameful behavior.   We are on this floor today talking about a bill that will protect  babies who are born alive after abortions. The shameful behavior is  that, on the other side of the aisle, they want to talk politics, they  want to talk posturing, they want to talk process. They don't want to  talk about babies who are born alive after abortion. I know why they  don't want to talk about it, because it is uncomfortable. They would  rather ignore that it is actually happening, but we can't ignore it.    Mr. Speaker, we have an obligation in this body to ensure that we  provide protection and care for those who cannot, for the most  vulnerable among us. Mr. Speaker, it is a moral obligation to ensure  the protection of every baby born alive.  [[Page H503]]    I am proud to be here today on behalf of the rule, Mr. Speaker, and I  urge adoption of both the rule and the underlying bill, H.R. 4712, so  we can continue to do what is right, what is morally required of us,  and that is to protect and nurture and make sure we have provided  safeguards for the unborn and for those who are born alive after  abortion.   The material previously referred to by Mr. McGovern is as follows:            An Amendment to H. Res. 694 Offered by Mr. McGovern         At the end of the resolution, add the following new       sections:        Sec. 4. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the       Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare       the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on       the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R.       4820) to extend funding for certain public health programs,       and for other purposes. The first reading of the bill shall       be dispensed with. All points of order against consideration       of the bill are waived. General debate shall be confined to       the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally divided among       and controlled by the respective chairs and ranking minority       members of the Committee on Ways and Means and the Committee       on Energy and Commerce. After general debate the bill shall       be considered for amendment under the five-minute rule. All       points of order against provisions in the bill are waived. At       the conclusion of consideration of the bill for amendment the       Committee shall rise and report the bill to the House with       such amendments as may have been adopted. The previous       question shall be considered as ordered on the bill and       amendments thereto to final passage without intervening       motion except one motion to recommit with or without       instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and reports       that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then on the       next legislative day the House shall, immediately after the       third daily order of business under clause 1 of rule XIV,       resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further       consideration of the bill.        Sec. 5. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 4820.                                   ____           The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a       vote about what the House should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to       a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to       yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first       recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no       substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''       But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the       Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in       the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,       page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous       question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally       not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member       controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the       motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the       time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering       the previous question. That Member, because he then controls       the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for       the purpose of amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on       Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further       debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:       ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a       resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control       shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous       question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who       controls the time for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools for those who oppose the Republican       majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the       opportunity to offer an alternative plan.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.
