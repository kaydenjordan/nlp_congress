 Mr. Chair, I just want to add my support to this. We have  added these prohibitions on three other bills that have come through  here, State, and Foreign Operations; Commerce, Justice, and Science;  and Financial Services and General Government.   It is in the Constitution. Moneys are not supposed to be spent there,  and this is wrong. The country will go on with them staying at Hiltons  or, as Mr. Lieu said, Ritz Carltons, or Holiday Inns, or even Red Roof  Inns.   I just say that this is the right thing to do, and I add my name as a  supporter.
