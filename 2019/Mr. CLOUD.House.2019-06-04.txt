 Mr. Speaker, this last week, I once again got the  opportunity to visit the Texas-Mexico border for an updated look at the  situation, and I can confirm that this is certainly not a manufactured  crisis. Our border resources are completely overwhelmed.   For those of us from Texas, we have understood the situation for  quite some time, and what we saw was an overworked, vastly underfunded  Border Patrol trying to deal with an overwhelming flood of migrants and  dangerous criminal cartels.   Cartels smuggler fees for illicit activity in the Rio Grande Valley  Sector are estimated to be about $80 million each week. Our Border  Patrol's budget in that sector is around $30 million per year. There is  no way for our good men and women in the border services to compete  with this kind of mismatch.   The situation is unsustainable. The phrase we heard repeatedly from  Border Patrol agents is: ``There is no end in sight.'' And, indeed, the  numbers that we expect to be released soon will probably show over  130,000 migrants have crossed just in May.   What is already a crisis will only get worse unless we act. This is,  indeed, a very real crisis, a humanitarian crisis, a criminal crisis,  and a national security crisis. This needs our attention now.                            ____________________
