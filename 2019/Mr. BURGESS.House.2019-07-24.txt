 Mr. Speaker, I thank Mrs. Torres for yielding me the  customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, today we are considering two bills that will never  become law. They are not going to be taken up by the Senate. If they  did, they would not pass, and the President likely would not sign them.   The first bill, H.R. 397, the Rehabilitation for Multiemployer  Pensions Act, was drafted by the majority as an attempted fix of the  multiemployer pension crisis. Unfortunately, the bill does nothing but  create more government, increase the deficit, and kick the can down the  road for another generation that will have to ultimately deal with it.   So let's examine the facts.   Multiemployer pension plans are pensions run jointly by a union and  multiple companies whose employees are members of that union. These are  defined benefit plans that guarantee employees receive a specific  amount upon retirement regardless of the funding available. These plans  must comply with collective bargaining agreements and the Employee  Retirement Income Security Act and pay into the Pension Benefit  Guaranty Corporation, the Federal insurer of the plans.    Over 1,300 multiemployer plans cover more than 10 million  participants, and well over a million are in plans that are either  insolvent or will be within the next two decades. This means that more  than 1 million retirees may have their retirement plan benefits cut if  no action is taken.   Multiemployer pension plans are currently underfunded by $638  billion, and the figure increases by $15 billion each and every year.  The largest plan is the Central States Pension Fund, which has been  sponsored by the Teamsters. It has approximately 385,000 participants  and is underfunded by $41 billion.   To ensure struggling pension plans would not affect the defined  benefit promise to employers, Congress created the Pension Benefit  Guaranty Corporation to provide financial assistance to pay participant  benefits. The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation is funded through  premiums paid by plan funds and is currently not backed by the  taxpayer.   Since 2003, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation has held a  deficit when comparing its current multiemployer pension assets to its  outstanding liabilities due to these insolvent union-managed pension  plans. Today, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation has a deficit of  $54 billion. The entity Congress created to protect insolvent plans is  estimated to be insolvent itself.   This crisis did not materialize suddenly. During the 2008 recession,  retirement plans throughout the country lost nearly 30 percent of their  value, but the weaknesses of the multiemployer system were not  conceived in one event. The American Academy of Actuaries outlined some  of the decisions that led to this instability.   Generally, many plans overleveraged their risk, increased their  benefits in an unsustainable fashion, did not maintain appropriate  resources to recover from losses, and kept fewer working employees.  Additionally, many employers have left their multiemployer pension  plans, further limiting funding for those that remain.   At the end of the day, these plans were mismanaged in a way that has  increased costs and decreased revenue.   So how are our colleagues across the aisle hoping to fix this  troubling situation? The Rehabilitation for Multiemployer Pensions Act  would create a trust fund called the pension rehabilitation trust fund  that would be administered by a brand-new Federal agency within the  Department of the Treasury called the Pension Rehabilitation  Administration.   This new agency would provide unsecured, federally subsidized 30-year  loans to critical or declining multiemployer plans without requiring  the plans to make any actuarial changes to bring them back to solvency.  If the plan cannot certify that it can repay the loan, the plan would  also receive a grant from the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation to  pay retiree benefits and to pay back the loan, essentially double- dipping Federal support. If a plan cannot make interest or principal  payments on the loan, payments can be forgiven to pay retiree benefits.   Finally, H.R. 397 would reverse reforms made in 2014 that allowed  certain plans greater flexibility to regain solvency.   Earlier this month, the Congressional Budget Office published a  report on the estimated budget impact of a previous version of H.R.  397. The new subsidies and the expanded assistance would increase the  Federal deficit by $64 billion without truly addressing the underlying  financial issues.   Should this bill be signed into law, it will be the first time that  the Federal Government has placed United States taxpayers on the hook  to subsidize private pension plans.   It is important to note that many taxpayers who would finance this  subsidy have not, themselves, been included in a pension plan.   As presented today, H.R. 397 would result in a large balloon payment  due in year 30 of the pension rehabilitation trust fund loan. And if a  plan cannot afford loan payments without cutting benefits, the new  Pension Rehabilitation Administration would be allowed to forgive these  debts. This is the definition of a taxpayer bailout.   Mr. Speaker, the majority knows this bill will never move in the  Senate, and I do urge my colleagues to reconsider this legislation.  There, perhaps, are ways to fix this crisis and address it in a  fiscally and actuarially sound manner. A bipartisan agreement is the  only way for a solution to this crisis that will actually make it to  the President's desk.   The second bill in this rule is yet another attempt to fix the crisis  at our southern border without addressing any root cause. H.R. 3239,  the Humanitarian Standards for Individuals in Customs and Border  Protection Custody Act, is a reactionary bill attempting to restructure  Customs and Border Protection through overly prescriptive, one-size- fits-all mandates that actually ignore what CBP has as resources and  its core mission.   If this legislation were to be signed into law, Customs and Border  Protection would be required to provide health and medical screenings  to all migrants who entered their custody. Customs and Border  Protection must provide individuals 1 gallon of water  [[Page H7260]]  per day, access to safe and clean toilets and showers, diaper changing  facilities, and provide sanitation products. CBP will also be required  to provide three meals a day totaling 2,000 calories, interpreters,  video monitoring, adequate lighting, and to keep facilities within a  specific temperature range.                                time  1245    Medical staff are required to be onsite to conduct medical  screenings, regardless of the number of staff or apprehensions, and  specialty physicians are required to, at the very least, be on call.   These physician specialties include pediatrics, OB/GYN, family  medicine, geriatric medicine, infectious diseases, mental health, and  dieticians. Immediate access to such specialists is not even available  to some of our veterans, yet we are mandating it be there for  undocumented migrants.   The bill also requires adult chaperones for children receiving  medical exams. Allowable adults will consist of parents, legal  guardians, and/or adult relatives. However, ``adult relative'' is not  defined, meaning that a very distant relative or someone who simply  states they are a relative could pose as the child's guardian in the  absence of a parent or legal guardian.   This is concerning for identifying trafficking victims. When children  are victims of trafficking, often the only chance they get to be apart  from their trafficker is while receiving medical care, and sometimes  then the trafficker will refuse to leave the child alone.   If we mandate the presence of an adult relative during the child's  medical exam, in fact, we may never learn that the child is a victim.   Additionally, children who arrive with a parent, legal guardian, or  other adult relative are to be kept together in Customs and Border  Protection custody. Under current law, the Office of Refugee  Resettlement has custody of and must provide care for each  unaccompanied alien child, defined as a child without lawful  immigration status under the age of 18 without a parent or legal  guardian to provide care.   If children who arrive with an adult relative are not allowed to be  transferred to the Office of Refugee Resettlement, this bill is  simultaneously mandating that ORR violate current law.   Customs and Border Protection's mission is to safeguard America's  borders to protect the public from dangerous people and materials while  facilitating legal trade and travel. Due to the migrant crisis, more  CBP agents and officers are concentrated on the southern border, taking  them away from their other lawful responsibilities.   If Customs and Border Protection is required to implement the  mandates that are in this bill, customs inspections will be limited,  and lines at ports of entry will become much longer.   Customs and Border Protection inspects our agriculture and food,  checks for counterfeit or defective consumer products, and searches for  and seizes illicit drugs, much of which is currently fueling the opioid  crisis. If they are not on the line to do their job, these things don't  happen.   Customs and Border Protection officers are also the first to welcome  Americans home from abroad and foreigners with legal documentation into  the country. Due to the Democrats' refusal to deal with our southern  border crisis, these important functions will also suffer.   We must also remember that Customs and Border Protection facilities  do not just exist along the southern border. Customs and Border  Protection is located in every State and territory, in addition to  several overseas preclearance facilities. Mandating the presence of  specialty medical personnel and certain facility upgrades is not only  unfeasible in some of these remote locations, but it would also cost an  enormous amount of money.   The cost to comply with the provisions in this bill is unclear  because we don't have a Congressional Budget Office score, but it is  likely to be high.   Customs and Border Protection currently has around $3 billion in  unmet funding needs due to the crisis on our southern border. Requiring  updates to hundreds of Customs and Border Protection facilities,  increasing personnel and equipment, and providing training would add  significantly to this shortfall.   Here is the really amazing part: This bill contains no authorization  for appropriations. Last night at the Rules Committee, it was asked how  Democrats were planning to pay for the mandates in this bill. The  response was that there is money there, that it has previously been  appropriated in the recent border supplemental.   Remember that is the very same supplemental that the House Democratic  leadership told us last May was not necessary because this was a  manufactured crisis. Then suddenly, right before the Fourth of July  recess, it became a very real crisis, and the Congress did step up to  provide the additional funding that was required. But this funding was  provided for specific purposes, not for new requirements upon Customs  and Border Protection.   The answer is that there is no funding provided to implement this  bill, which amounts to an unfunded mandate. That diminishes the  likelihood that any of it would actually happen, should it become law.   Most importantly, this bill does nothing to stop the flow of  irregular migrants, including vulnerable children, to our southern  border.   Placing overly burdensome and unreasonable standards of care on  Customs and Border Protection will only exacerbate the security and  humanitarian crisis on our southern border.   Let me just say this: Having been at the Clint facility last Friday,  the men and women of the Customs and Border Protection are doing the  job that Congress asked them to do. Congress didn't ask them to do;  they told them to do. We passed laws. They are delivering on what we  told them to do.   But the men and women at Customs and Border Protection are good  people who are driven to do the right thing. They care, but at the same  time, we complicate their lives so much by not funding the needs that  they actually have and then adding on top of it all of these unfunded  mandates.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my Democratic colleagues to work across the aisle  to find and implement real solutions rather than unfunded mandates. I  urge opposition to this rule.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Arrington), a valuable member of the Ways and Means  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, Republicans will  amend the rule to add H. Con. Res. 54 that will reconstitute the Joint  Select Committee on Multiemployer Pensions through February of 2020.  The select committee worked to find solutions to reestablish the  solvency of multiemployer plans. While a draft proposal was released,  ultimately, no legislative solution was achieved.   By reconstituting the select committee through February of 2020, we  will build upon the work of a previous committee to finally ensure the  solvency of the multiemployer pension plans. This is an opportunity to  work across the dais on an issue that affects millions of Americans.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a no vote on the previous question so that we can  come together to protect Americans in retirement.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes the gentleman from  Wisconsin (Mr. Steil).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 3 minutes.   Mr. Speaker, I want to talk on reconstituting the select committee  that Mr. Steil just spoke of on the issue on the previous question.   Mr. Speaker, I want to bring the House's attention to an editorial in  The Washington Post from April 25. Before we initiated this discussion  today, they wrote that the retirement livelihoods of hundreds of  thousands of working class Americans are in jeopardy. So, too, are many  businesses for which pension obligations have become a growth-stifling  burden.   Quoting The Washington Post:   ``A meltdown must be avoided, but so, too, must a massive Federal  bailout that would soak the rest of society, including many taxpayers  who do not even have pensions. Between those poles lie inevitable  shared sacrifices: a significant but finite injection of public funds,  offset by limited benefit reductions, conditioned on long-term reforms  to stabilize the system.''   And they go on to say:   ``Congress actually adopted such a proposal on a bipartisan basis in  2014, but the Obama administration balked at implementing the required  benefit haircut for Central States' retirees on the eve of the 2016  election, which sent Congress back to the drawing board. Lawmakers from  both parties and both Chambers formed a committee to write a new bill,  which would have gotten expedited consideration on the floors of both  Chambers. Unfortunately, the committee missed a self-imposed November  30, 2018 deadline.''   Leaving The Washington Post for a moment, now we are talking about  reconstituting that select committee. And, in fact, that is what the  editorial board of The Washington Post was suggesting last April. We  find ourselves at that juncture now.   Mr. Speaker, again, I urge my colleagues to vote against the previous  question and defeat the previous question so we can consider the  amendment brought by Mr. Steil.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   In closing, Mr. Speaker, both bills under consideration as part of  this rule provide Band-Aids to what are much more systemic problems. We  simply cannot keep placing Band-Aids on open wounds.  [[Page H7263]]    Republicans agree that there is a multiemployer pension crisis, but  as my Republican colleagues on the committees of jurisdiction have  stated many times before, it has to be addressed through reforms to the  financial structure of these plans to ensure that the plans will not be  underfunded in the future.   The security humanitarian crisis on the southern border continues. At  least we are to a point right now that we admit that it is a crisis.  Republicans will keep working on solutions to secure the border and  help stabilize Central American countries in order to eliminate the  surge in irregular migration.   These are not problems that can be solved on a partisan basis alone.  I hope our Democratic colleagues will join us in finding a long-lasting  solution.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on the previous question, a ``no''  vote on the underlying measure, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3375, the  Stopping Bad Robocalls Act. I will speak more later of my contribution  on this legislation, but I congratulate the authors of this  legislation, both the majority and the minority.    The American Association of Retired Persons sent us a letter  yesterday urging the adoption by stating: ``All Americans will benefit  from the provisions of H.R. 3375 that promote an accurate call  authentication framework and prevent consumers from being charged for  blocking technology.''   The support does not end with them, but it spans the consumer and  industry groups that have seen the impact of this. This bill  incorporates the best of the private sector solutions, at the same time  putting the call out to crack down on these illegal actors for the  criminals that they are.   We are going to shut these scammers down. This legislation  establishes a more rigorous enforcement structure to shut down illegal  robocalls. It empowers the Federal Communications Commission with  additional enforcement. It also sets the path for providers to  implement new caller ID technologies, with no new line-item charges to  the consumers.   The fraud committed on Americans by illegal robocallers is going to  stop. This bipartisan legislation creates a robust framework designed  to protect consumers from the fraud and nuisance of these calls.   Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr.  Walden), the ranking member of the full committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Ohio (Mr. Latta), the ranking member of the Communications and  Technology Subcommittee on the Committee on Energy and Commerce.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Bilirakis).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Ohio (Mr. Johnson).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Montana (Mr. Gianforte), a valuable member of our Energy and Commerce  Committee.    Madam Speaker, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Washington (Mrs. Rodgers).    Madam Speaker, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Carter), a valued member of the Energy and  Commerce Committee.    Madam Speaker, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Indiana (Mrs. Brooks), a valuable member of the  committee.    Madam Speaker, I am prepared to close. I yield myself  the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, robocalls have moved beyond a simple nuisance.  Sophisticated actors are now using robocalls to trick people into  providing sensitive information by posing as legitimate organizations.   When this happens to hospitals, patients have no reason to believe  that there is a fraudulent actor on the other line, leading them to  reveal sensitive health data and sensitive financial information. This  activity threatens the integrity of real health-related phone calls and  jeopardizes the relationship between the patient and their provider.   Even more challenging than explaining to consumers that the calls  from your phone number are not always from your organization is the  response time required.                                time  1500    According to testimony by Dave Summitt of the H. Lee Moffitt Cancer  Center, in a 90-day period, they received over 6,600 external calls  identified as a Moffitt internal phone number, requiring 65 hours of  response time. This is time that could have been used to support the  hospital rather than respond to fraudulent calls.   During the Energy and Commerce Committee markup, I offered an  amendment with Mrs. Dingell of Michigan to establish a hospital  robocall protection group at the Federal Communications Commission.  This group will issue best practices to help combat unlawful robocalls  made to hospitals, as well as those made spoofing a legitimate hospital  phone number.   The hospital robocall protection group will assist any hospital to  combat these fraudulent robocalls so that they may focus on serving  patients. A patient should not have to worry about whether they are  speaking with their real doctor or their real hospital when discussing  sensitive health information, and providers should not have to deal  with disruptive false claims.   This amendment was adopted in committee, and I look forward to the  best practices being put forward in the hospital robocall protection  group.   The fraud committed on Americans by illegal robocallers is going to  end. This bipartisan legislation creates a robust framework designed to  protect consumers from the fraud and nuisance of these calls.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a yes vote on the underlying legislation, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in favor of H.R. 1058, the Autism  Collaboration, Accountability, Research, Education, and Support Act of  2019, also known as the Autism CARES Act.   H.R. 1058 builds upon a strong foundation that Congress laid by  passing the Combating Autism Act in 2006. This legislation, in 2006,  expanded research, surveillance, and treatment of autism spectrum  disorder, and it has equipped our Federal agencies with enhanced  resources to expand its knowledge of this complex disorder.   The number of children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder has  increased. It is even more imperative that we reauthorize this program  and ensure the continuation of the Interagency Autism Coordinating  Committee. As families across our Nation navigate raising children with  autism, the Autism CARES Act would provide hope by authorizing funding  for continued research, surveillance and education at the National  Institutes of Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and  Health Resources and Services Administration, and it would continue  this through calendar year 2024.   I thank Representatives  Chris Smith and Michael Doyle for their  tireless work to reauthorize this program and better the lives for  individuals with autism and their families.   As Dr. Amy Hewitt pointed out at our hearing, the number of autism  spectrum disorder diagnoses has risen more than 600 percent in the past  few decades.   In 2018, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention determined  that 1 in 59 children is diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder,  and that boys are four times more likely to be diagnosed with autism  than are girls. As more individuals are diagnosed, it becomes even more  important for Congress to ensure that there is adequate research and  support services for these individuals and their families.   Early detection and intervention for individuals with autism and  their families help to increase the communication and social skills,  preparing children for a successful future. The Autism CARES Act  reauthorizes these early detection and intervention programs, in  addition to workforce programs for health professionals. The Leadership  Education in Neurodevelopmental and Related Disabilities, LEND,  programs provide training for healthcare professionals to address  intellectual disabilities, including autism.   As we continue to support research efforts at the National Institutes  of Health and through the Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee, we  will learn more about autism and how to best address it. As we gain  knowledge, our healthcare system needs to stand ready to implement the  best practices obtained, which is why workforce programs are important.   It is critical that we reauthorize the Autism CARES Act on time so  that the Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee does not lapse, and  so that our Nation's research can seamlessly continue.   Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to support this bill, and I hope that the  Senate will swiftly take up this legislation after its passage here  today.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from New  Jersey (Mr. Smith), the principal author of this bill and the  intellectual driving force behind getting this legislation  reauthorized.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from New Jersey.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Carter).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Once again, I want to thank my colleague, Mr. Smith from New Jersey,  for being the intellectual driver and providing the enthusiasm for  getting this bill to the floor and getting it passed.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all colleagues to support this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in favor of H.R. 2035, the Lifespan  Respite Care Reauthorization Act of 2019. As many of us know from  personal experience, being a caregiver for a loved one is a challenging  and exhausting job, and for many Americans, it is a second full-time  job. A number of those Americans are also caring for both aging parents  and their own children. That is over 40 million Americans who have  taken on the role of unpaid caregiver in the past year, and as our  Nation's population ages, there will be an increasing number of  caregivers who are struggling to balance the demands of caregiving with  the rest of their lives.   The Lifespan Respite Care program aims to assist caregivers by  providing them with the opportunity for a small, much-needed break from  those responsibilities. H.R. 2035 would reauthorize funding for this  program through fiscal year 2024, which is important because this  authorization had technically expired but continued to receive  appropriations. Respite care is a critical resource for our caregivers  who spend much of their time helping their loved ones each day.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Washington State (Mrs. Rodgers).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, most insurance plans do not cover the cost of respite  care, but the Administration for Community Living at the Department of  Health and Human Services works with the ARCH National Respite Network  and Resource Center to provide respite care to caregivers across the  United States of America. This legislation is vital to ensuring that we  maintain our access to respite care for our caregivers and their loved  ones.   Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to support H.R. 2035, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
