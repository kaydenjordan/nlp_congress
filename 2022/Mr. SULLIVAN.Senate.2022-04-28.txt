 Madam President, I want to say that it is Thursday, and  it is my favorite time of week, 6 years' strong--almost 7 years--we  have been doing our ``Alaskan of the Week'' series, and we love to do  this because we get to recognize a special Alaskan, someone who makes  the State very special.   Our pages, I think they don't always admit it, but it is probably the  best speech of the week because it is interesting and we have got some  cool stories. I know some of the reporters here like the speech because  it means we are at the end of the week so that is good.   Today, we are honoring a really amazing Alaskan. Her name is Teresa  Gray, of Anchorage, who was, by the way, recently featured by CNN as  one of their heroes for the work her organization does that Teresa  founded to provide medical help to people all over the globe.   So, before I talk about Teresa and her amazing work, I always like to  give a little update of what is going on in Alaska right now. I was  home the last couple weeks traveling all over the State, and it didn't  seem like too long ago when I had said: Hey, winter is coming. Winter  is coming. Well, here is the good news. Well, I love winter, but winter  is now leaving. It is leaving Alaska.   Now, it is cold in many places. My house in Anchorage still has snow  on the ground, but the Sun is now up high in the sky, staying up longer  and longer every single day--although I was in Fairbanks and we had  northern lights going. So that was awesome just last week. But today,  in Anchorage, the Sun rose at 6 a.m. and set around 10 p.m. So it is  getting long. It is gaining. We gain about 5 minutes a day during this  time of the year. Birds are migrating back by the tens of thousands.  The excitement of spring is everywhere.   So to everybody watching, if you are thinking about great summer  travel plans, Alaska is the place to be. So come on up. We would love  to have you.   So, now, let me talk about Teresa Gray and the organization she  founded called Mobile Medics International, which is doing great work  across the globe, even as we speak.   Teresa is originally from Michigan. As a paramedic, she moved to  Alaska in 1999 to be with her then-husband who was from Alaska. And  like so many do when they come to Alaska, she fell in love with Alaska.  Now, she wasn't really an outdoorsy type, but she said:         I just felt at home.    It is the people that she loves. She said the State has such a unique  group of individuals.         We [all] share a kindred spirit. We're all committed to       living the Alaska[n] way.    That is what Teresa said. And for Teresa, the Alaskan way has been to  put her medical skills to use. Now, initially, she worked as an  instructor at the only paramedic school in the State, but within 6  months, she bought the school and created two additional schools, one  in Fairbanks and one in Wasilla, and made these very successful. Eight  years later, she sold those to the University of Alaska.   Then she became a flight medic for AeroMed, now known as LifeMed. She  was a medical trainer for the Alaska Air National Guard unit, the 210th  Rescue Squadron. These are very brave, intrepid PJs who do amazing work  all over the State. And she also helped out with the Anchorage Fire  Department.   When they again adopted a child, their second adopted child, Teresa  decided it was time to retire. An aside here--one of Teresa's children,  Boyd Jorgensen, was a U.S. marine under my command, with the great unit  ECHO Company 4th Reconnaissance Battalion up in Anchorage. So Semper  Fi, Staff Sergeant. I hope you are watching.   Let's talk about your mom.   That retirement for Teresa didn't last long. One day, she was  watching the news, and she saw the image--and I think a lot of us  remember this image--of a 3-year-old Syrian refugee on the beach of  Lesbos, face down in the water. It was very powerful. People all over  the world saw that really ghastly image. She thought: Why isn't anybody  doing anything about this?   She realized, well, she should and she could. So she volunteered for  an Irish medical nonprofit which took her to Greece and then to other  places across the globe.   It didn't take her long to see a need that wasn't being filled. There  are a great many medical nonprofits, but the general model is that the  doctors and other medical professionals arrive at a place and set up  shop. The people in need of care come to them.   But there are so many times Teresa witnessed people who couldn't  leave their communities. In the case of Puerto Rico, there was a  mudslide with limited access to a road that led to a village which  hadn't received medical or any kind of help in over a week. People  couldn't get a doctor there.    So, back in Alaska, she put a call out on social media, and soon,  Mobile Medics International was born. The group is focused on mobility,  on getting to the barrios, to the villages, up in the mountains--hard  places to get to, where she said that ``[s]o many places are lost or  forgotten in disasters'' because they are so hard to get to.   Roughly, 5 years later, the group now has roughly 120 volunteers from  across the globe, including from Alaska, on nearly every continent.  They have been on over 30 missions. They are agile. They are  expeditionary. They are like the Marines. When they go to a place that  has been hit by disaster or to a place experiencing a refugee crisis,  everything they need is in a backpack.   Teresa said:         We can bring our own food, our own water, our own sleeping       accommodations. We try to take basically an ambulance in the       backpack.    Great image. Great idea.   If someone requires more extensive care, then they help get that  individual to a medical facility, maybe in another part of the country.   In addition to natural and humanitarian disasters, Mobile Medics  International also trains people in medically underserved villages to  provide treatment to others in their communities. So it is train the  trainer. Teach someone to fish.   They find people in those communities who are willing to commit to 5  years to build their own program in that community, and they support  them during that time. They visit a few times a year, get them  equipped, get them supplies, get them training,  [[Page S2228]]  and then, all of a sudden, you have people in those communities who  have these medical skills.   Teresa talked about her team once going to a remote island in the  Philippines where, because of a lack of nutrition, this remote island  and the population had a really bad problem with cleft-palate babies.  ``Within three years,'' she said, ``we eliminated cleft-palate babies  on that island by giving out prenatal vitamins.''   Think about that. That is incredible work--one American with a vision  making a huge difference in a place like the Philippines. Great work.   So let's fast-forward to today. Where do you think she is? Where do  you think they are?   Well, they are on the frontlines in Ukraine and Romania to help with  the refugee crisis there. They have four teams there. They are  providing a 24-hour clinic in Romania and go person-to-person to help  with medical care. They have organized a warehouse of donated goods.  They have delivered supplies into Ukraine, and they are providing  emotional support to people who really need it because of the barbaric  invasion that has happened there.   For Teresa and her group, helping during a refugee crisis is  particularly emotional and wrenching. She said:         Natural disasters can be horrific. A refugee crisis is even       more emotionally difficult.    These are people who have lost everything, including their country,  their heritage, and their language.   She talked about how the Ukrainian refugee crisis is particularly  challenging. ``All the men have been left behind,'' she said. You just  have mothers, older men, young girls, and women whose entire life in  Ukraine is now gone.   Her people do more than just medical care. They provide emotional  support as well. When she traveled to Romania, there was an elderly  woman whom she was treating for health issues. The woman asked for a  different kind of help. She asked that she and her son be driven to the  border so she could see Ukraine for the last time--a Ukrainian woman  just wanting to see her country--and Teresa did that.   ``She asked for help, so we gave it to her,'' Teresa said.   This is a great example of the drive, determination, vision, and hard  work of just one person. Think about it. One person, Teresa Gray, with  a vision--and how that vision and drive can change lives--hundreds of  lives, thousands of lives.   So, Teresa, thank you for providing so much help to so many.  Congratulations for being chosen as a CNN hero; but more importantly,  much more importantly--sorry, CNN--congratulations on being our Alaskan  of the Week. You have really, really deserved it and made us all proud.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
