 Mr. Speaker, yesterday the House approved an amendment I  offered to the State-Foreign Operations Appropriations bill for fiscal  year 2020, and I wanted to take this opportunity to explain the  amendment.   There is a humanitarian crisis in Venezuela, and it is man-made. In  my view, the people of Venezuela will not prosper as long as the regime  of Nicolas Maduro remains in power. The regime has proven itself to be  cruel, incompetent, and anti-democratic. It is driving what was one of  Latin America's most vibrant nations into the ground.   The United States cannot be passive. We must stand behind the proud  Venezuelan patriots who are struggling to reclaim their country from  the regime that is destroying it.   Like last year's bill, this year's State-Foreign Operations bill  provides $17.5 million for USAID and State Department programs to  promote democracy and the rule of law in Venezuela. This funding is  drawn from the nearly $2.2 billion in economic support funds that the  bill provides for countries around the world. That is good, but we can  and we should do better.   Because the situation in Venezuela has significantly worsened in  recent months, our amendment would increase the $17.5 million for  Venezuela by $3 million for a total of $20.5 million. This enhanced  funding will be used for five main purposes in Venezuela: to defend  human rights, strengthen civil society, improve governance, support  independent media, and promote fair and transparent elections.   Currently, USAID programs in Venezuela are being conducted through  several U.S.-based implementing partners who, in turn, work with over  35 Venezuelan subpartners. The respected organization, Freedom House,  ranks Venezuela as not free. According to Freedom House, conditions  have grown sharply worse in recent years due to the continued  concentration of power in executive and harsher crackdowns on the  opposition.   As a result, USAID programs to support human rights defenders in  civil society groups are critical. U.S. support  [[Page H4777]]  enables these groups to document abuses by the regime and to keep the  hope of democracy alive in an increasingly authoritarian country.   Venezuela is one of the most dangerous places in Latin America and  the Caribbean to be a human rights defender. The Maduro regime is  currently being investigated for crimes against humanity by the U.N.  Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. The Organization of  American States has similarly denounced the regime's abuses. These men  and women on the ground in Venezuela put their lives on the line to  expose the regime's failings, and they need our support.   On the media front, the regime has arrested and abused journalists,  both Venezuelan journalists and foreign journalists, operating in the  country, including a prominent American journalist. Harassment from the  government has led most independent radio, TV, and print outlets to  close. Social media has, at times, been blocked, including during the  recent uprisings against Maduro. USAID programs are critical to  overcome government censorship and propaganda.   On the democracy front, Maduro was reelected in May of 2018 in a snap  election that failed to meet minimum international standards and was  widely condemned as illegitimate. The sooner that civil society and  international actors can weigh in on how to improve the National  Electoral Council and reform the electoral system more broadly, the  sooner free and fair Presidential elections can be held.   This is the goal of the Guaido government. It is also the goal of the  Lima Group which is composed of Latin American countries and Canada and  which is seeking a just solution to the crisis in Venezuela. It is a  goal that merits continued American support.   I am proud that my colleagues voted for this amendment. It is a vote  for the people of Venezuela who have suffered so much under this  terrible regime.                            ____________________
