 Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in opposition to H.R. 185, which once again prioritizes  politics over science at the expense of the health of the American  people.   To date, COVID-19 has killed more than 1 million of our fellow  Americans. Families have been changed forever. Fortunately, today we  have vaccines, tests, and treatments that have put the darkest days of  the pandemic behind us, but we can't forget that COVID still kills 500  Americans every day.   Variants of concern continue to emerge, and therefore we must be  vigilant and data driven in monitoring any uptick in cases. We must  follow the science and the guidance of our public health experts.    We are not done with COVID; or, rather, COVID is not done with us.  Ending all of our protections and public health measures without a  reasoned discussion is downright dangerous. Unfortunately, that is  exactly what House Republicans continue to do week after week, bringing  bills to the floor that are nothing but political stunts that put  politics over science. This is the latest dangerous stunt.   H.R. 185 would terminate the Centers for Disease Control and  Prevention's order that requires proof of COVID-19 vaccination for  foreign air passengers entering the United States.   Vaccination is protective against severe illness and death from  COVID-19. It reduces the impact of COVID-19 on our healthcare  infrastructure, including hospital capacity and healthcare provider  staffing. That is why the CDC order was put in place and why I continue  to believe that our public health experts are best positioned to make  these kinds of determinations.   This bill would permit unvaccinated individuals to freely enter the  United States, even as variants continue to emerge around the world,  potentially increasing the risk of circulating new variants of concern.  This could potentially stretch our healthcare resources just as our  hospitals, providers, and public health infrastructure try to rebuild.   In addition, H.R. 185 would also prohibit the CDC from issuing any  successor or subsequent orders to require COVID-19 vaccination for  foreign travelers in the future as well. This is dangerous and ties the  hands of our public  [[Page H748]]  health experts to the political whims of the most ideologically extreme  in a way that makes our Nation less safe and more vulnerable in the  future.   Imagine if a dangerous new variant that was highly contagious  appeared somewhere in the world. This Republican bill would prevent the  CDC from restricting people from entering the Nation who are not  vaccinated. This simply defies logic, but it is, unfortunately, what  happens when you have an extreme Republican majority that is more  interested in rushing these bills to the floor as political stunts  without any consideration of the implications.   There have been no committee hearings to hear from experts on what  this bill could mean for the American people, and without any input  from Democratic Members, who remain willing to have reasoned  discussions about moving beyond the immediate emergency of COVID-19.   This is also the second bill in just 2 weeks in which Republicans  have sought to question the safety and efficacy of the COVID vaccines,  despite the unequivocal scientific consensus that COVID-19 vaccination  is protective against severe illness and death.   Mr. Chairman, I have now sat through two Rules Committee debates and  two floor debates in the House of Representatives where some  Republicans have sought to undermine vaccine confidence and contend  that vaccines aren't safe and effective. This is extremely dangerous.   It is also deeply disappointing that we have to continue to have  these discussions instead of coming together to encourage all Americans  to get their vaccinations to protect themselves and their loved ones  against severe illness.   That is why I am also disappointed that the Rules Committee and its  Republican majority barred consideration of an amendment by the  gentleman from California (Mr. Takano) which would have made clear that  nothing in this bill shall be construed to cast doubt on the safety and  efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines. This would have sent a strong message  for us to come together on a bipartisan basis and make clear that this  bill is not intended to disparage vaccines and that the House of  Representatives stands in support of science and reason.   It is telling that the Rules Committee decided not to make this  amendment in order. It is a sad sign that my Republican colleagues  continue to cater to the most extremist members of their Conference who  would rather spread COVID misinformation than come together to  encourage vaccination as our best path out of this pandemic.   Mr. Chairman, Democrats understand that we are entering a new phase  of our response to COVID-19 and believe it is reasonable to reconsider  some of the pandemic-related policies and whether they are still  necessary.   Instead of rushing partisan bills like this to the floor, we are  willing to have bipartisan conversations on a path forward. However, we  will never--and I stress never--call into question the safety and  efficacy of vaccines. We will not undermine the expertise of our public  health officials or put politics over science.   Unfortunately, this bill does just that. For that reason, I strongly  urge my colleagues to oppose this bill, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 1 minute.   Mr. Chair, again, I am not surprised, I guess, but when the gentleman  from Kentucky talks about human rights and then he gives the lists of  the countries that don't mandate vaccines that include Iran, Russia,  Cuba, Syria, and China, these are not countries that care much about  human rights.   As I said before in the Rules Committee, Republicans always talk  about America first. We have the best healthcare and public health  experts in the world, in my opinion. The CDC is so much better than any  of the healthcare organizations, in my opinion, certainly better than  our adversaries like Russia, Cuba, or China, but even for the other  countries that are mentioned.   I understand the World Health Organization is out there, but I think  we should be listening to the public health experts in our country and  not worrying about some of these other countries that are adversaries.   I would be very concerned about people coming from places like  Russia, China, and Cuba not being vaccinated because of the lack of  attention to public health in those countries.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Tennessee (Mr. Cohen).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Washington (Ms. Schrier), a member of our Energy and Commerce  Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 1 minute.   Mr. Chairman, again, the previous Republican speaker said that we are  confusing the public, and I think it is they that are, in fact,  confusing the public.   We are hearing all kinds of anti-vaccine misinformation on the floor  and in Rules, and I just think it is important to note that CDC, FDA,  and nearly all health professionals are near unanimous in recommending  that people get vaccinated and that vaccines are safe and effective.   I just think it is very damaging for the public to constantly hear  from Members on the other side of the aisle about potential problems  with vaccination because then people think that they shouldn't get  vaccinated.   I know what your position is, that you don't want it to be mandated  which, of course, I disagree with because of what public health experts  say for foreign travelers, but please don't continue to give  misinformation.   There are over 500 people that die every day from COVID. COVID is  still here. COVID continues to spread. The variants could come up and  spread at any moment, so we should not give the impression that people  should not take vaccines.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 1 minute.   The gentleman from Pennsylvania--let me just make it clear. I have  not used the word ``conspiracy.'' I am not suggesting there is a  conspiracy on the other side of the aisle.   What I just resent is the fact that I do not hear any of my  colleagues on the other side, on the Republican side, get up and say  that vaccines are safe and effective, and people should take them.   We had an amendment by Mr. Takano before the Rules Committee, which  would have made it clear that nothing in this bill shall be construed  to cast doubt on the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines.   This would send a strong message to us that we should come together  on a bipartisan basis and make clear that this bill is not intended to  disparage vaccines and that the House of Representatives stands in  support of science and reason, but my colleagues refuse to say that.   It is not a question of a conspiracy. It is a question of I believe  it is your obligation to tell the American people that they should be  vaccinated or at least that the vaccines are safe and effective in most  cases, but you don't do that.   So the misconception is out there. It is not a conspiracy, but it is  a misconception that vaccines are not safe.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Again, this is the third in a series of bills over the last 2 weeks  that tries to roll back the protections that the Federal Government has  put in place to try to stop the pandemic.   Now, granted, the pandemic--we have had a lot of success. I mean,  President Biden for the last 2 years in terms of promoting vaccines and  testing and all kinds of public health protections, COVID is on the  wane. The number of people dying, the number of people hospitalized,  all that is on the wane. He has said that he is planning on May 11 to  lift the public health emergency.   But all I have been saying, and all the Democrats have been saying  for the last 2 weeks on all these bills, is let's go by the science.   Let's be reasonable about this. Let's not assume that we can let  foreign travelers in and them not be vaccinated.   Let's not assume that it is a good thing for public health workers to  be unvaccinated. Let's not make a decision to end the public health  emergency immediately.   Let's leave it up to the agencies and the experts, which again, I  believe, are the best in the world. I am not interested in what Russia  does or Cuba does or some of these other countries that are mentioned  because we have the best experts in the world. If anybody denies that I  will prove it to them that we do.   The bottom line is that as Democrats, we understand that the pandemic  is on the wane, but we don't want to rush to make decisions or force  decisions, if you will, on our public health experts that could be  detrimental or make it difficult and tie their hands.   One of the things that is in this bill--and there are going to be a  series of amendments now to deal with this--is to say that not only is  this vaccine mandate eliminated but that the CDC can't even make any  other types of mandates like that in the future.   That is very dangerous to tie their hands when we don't know exactly  where COVID and the variants are going to be going in the next few  months or the next few years. It is a mistake to do that.   So we will hear about some of these amendments that I think are  really important, but the bottom line is this is a bad bill.   It continues this policy of basically eliminating the protections  that we have been trying to put in place, that we have had in place,  and that have helped us get beyond the COVID pandemic, for the most  part.   I urge my colleagues, you know, for the sake of science, for the sake  of helping people, for the sake of public health to vote ``no'' on this  legislation.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   The reason I am opposed to the amendment is because I don't think it  is necessary or is even helpful to the issue at hand. It talks about a  report on the number of visitors denied entry under this policy.   The fact of the matter is that, on the Democratic side, what we are  concerned about is the public health. If the gentlewoman wanted to have  an amendment that said there would be a report that provides us with  public health data to justify lifting the mandate, I could see  something like that because the bottom line here is we are concerned  about the science.   The CDC says that this mandate is necessary to protect Americans, to  reduce the COVID cases, to make sure that people don't get sick and  that more people are hospitalized and be taxing on our public health  system. So I don't see how this amendment that talks about the number  of visitors gets to any of that.   Mr. Chair, I oppose the amendment, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   This is a 5-minute vote.   The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--yeas 227,  nays 201, not voting 6, as follows:                               [Roll No. 116]                                 YEAS--227       Aderholt      Alford      Allen      Amodei      Armstrong      Arrington      Babin      Bacon      Baird      Balderson      Banks      Barr      Bean (FL)      Bentz      Bergman      Bice      Biggs      Bilirakis      Bishop (NC)      Boebert      Bost      Brecheen      Buchanan      Buck      Bucshon      Burchett      Burgess      Burlison      Calvert      Cammack      Carey      Carl      Carter (GA)      Carter (TX)      Chavez-DeRemer      Ciscomani      Cline      Cloud      Clyde      Cole      Collins      Comer      Craig      Crane      Crawford      Crenshaw      Curtis      D'Esposito      Davidson      Davis (NC)      De La Cruz      DesJarlais      Diaz-Balart      Donalds      Duarte      Duncan      Dunn (FL)      Edwards      Ellzey      Emmer      Estes      Ezell      Fallon      Feenstra      Ferguson      Finstad      Fischbach      Fitzgerald      Fitzpatrick      Fleischmann      Flood      Foxx      Franklin, C.
