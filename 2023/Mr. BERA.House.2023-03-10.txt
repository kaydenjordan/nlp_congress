 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   This should be an easy vote because this is just about science. It is  about understanding the origins of this virus  [[Page H1257]]  that created this pandemic that took at a minimum 7 million lives-- probably many more than that. It is just about science. We are not  debating the geography of where this virus originated. We know that. We  are debating how this novel virus evolved. This is a brand-new virus,  and that should go without question.   I hope this is a strong ``yes'' vote by both Democrats and  Republicans.   I think about this as a doctor and a scientist, someone who has spent  a lot of my time in Congress looking at global health security, looking  at pandemic preparedness. I am proud to serve on the select committee  that is looking at coronavirus and the impact of this pandemic. My  colleague, another physician, Dr. Wenstrup, is the chairman of that  committee, and the ranking member is Dr. Raul Ruiz.   Again, I think if we can take the politics out of this, we can  actually understand what happened over these past 3 years, the impact  it had not just on the United States but on the entire world.   We can work together as Democrats and Republicans and hopefully the  global scientific community to prevent the next pandemic. That is what  this is about.                                time  0930    I don't know if we will ever find those origins if the Chinese  Communist Party doesn't work with us. It is in their interests as well  because they have suffered greatly. The Chinese people have suffered  greatly from this pandemic.   They ought to allow the best scientists in the world to go to ground  zero, to the hot zone, to Wuhan, and try to understand how this virus  evolved.   Maybe it was a wet market. Maybe it was a lab leak. It is important  for us to understand what it was because that then will allow us to  address and shore up the system.   If it was a lab leak, we ought to have the highest safety standards  in the world if we are doing this kind of research. We ought to look at  whether we should do gain-of-function research. That is a legitimate  question. There is scientific debate about that, et cetera, but if it  was a lab leak, we ought to understand that.   We ought to come together as a global community and make sure we have  the highest standards. If it was a wet market, if this was a naturally  occurring virus that came from an animal into a human, we ought to  understand that, as well. We ought to put in the safety and precautions  to make sure that doesn't happen in the future.   Let's take the politics out of it. Today, we have a chance as the  United States Congress to take a big vote, Democrats and Republicans,  to say: Let's try to figure out what happened.   It affected all of us, and we ought to do everything we can as the  United States Congress, Democrats and Republicans, and as a global  scientific community to prevent this from happening again in our  lifetime and, hopefully, ever again.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues, Democrats and Republicans, to  vote ``yes'' on this bill. It will allow us to share information with  the public because, again, this affected all of us. I hope we have a  strong ``yes'' vote on the COVID origins bill.
