 Mr. Speaker, Officer Tiffany-Victoria Enriquez, Officer  Kaulike Kalama, Sheriff Sheldon Gordon Whiteman, Officer Katherine Mary  Thyne, I could go on and on 113 times with the names of law enforcement  officers who died in the line of duty, who were killed last year in  2020--113.   And we are on the floor of the House of Representatives with a bill  gutting the qualified immunity that helps protect our law enforcement  officers without so much as a hearing, without so much as coming back  to talk to us and work with us since last June.   Why?   Because this is all political. This is all political.   We talk about defunding. I am from Austin, Texas; $150 million cut  from the police budget there.   And what did my Democrat colleagues do last Friday?   Jammed through $500 billion for State and local governments, funding  the very Democratic cities that are gutting our law enforcement  officers, taking away what they need to be able to exist.   And with what happened in Austin, a 50 percent increase in murder  rate. We lost the greatest cadet class we had.   This bill is a sham. We should oppose it.
