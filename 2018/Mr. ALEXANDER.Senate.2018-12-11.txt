 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for  up to 30 minutes.    Madam President, today I am asking experts at the  American Enterprise Institute and Brookings Institute, as well as other  leading experts, for specific ideas about how Congress and the  President can work together to reduce the cost of healthcare in the  United States. Here is why.   Last July, at the Senate HELP Committee's second in a series of five  hearings on reducing healthcare costs, Dr. Brent James, a member of the  National Academy of Medicine, testified that 30 percent--and perhaps as  much as 50 percent--of all the money spent in this country on  healthcare is unnecessary. That startled me, and I hope it startles  you.   So I asked another witness, Dr. David Lansky from the Pacific  Business Group on Health, if he agreed with Dr. James' estimate that 50  percent of all the money spent on healthcare is unnecessary. Dr. Lansky  said yes.   Then, in our next hearing on reducing healthcare costs, not one  witness on our distinguished panel disagreed with Dr. James. That means  we are spending as much as half of all we spend on healthcare on  unnecessary treatment, tests, and administrative costs.   As a country, we spend a huge amount on healthcare--$3.5 trillion in  2017, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. When  we use Dr. James' estimates, that means we spent roughly $1 to $1.8  trillion on unnecessary healthcare in 2017. That is more money than the  gross domestic product of every country in the world except nine. That  is three times as much as the Federal Government spends on all of our  national defense, 60 times as much as it spends on Pell grants for  college students, and about 550 times as much as the Federal Government  spends on national parks.   For the last 8 years, most of the debate about healthcare has not  been about this extraordinary fact that we may be spending up to half  of what we spend on healthcare unnecessarily. Instead, we have been  arguing about health insurance. In fact, really, we have been arguing  about 6 percent of the health insurance market--the individual  insurance market.   The truth is, we will never have lower cost health insurance until we  have lower cost healthcare. Instead of continuing to argue over a small  percentage of the insurance market, what we should be discussing is the  high cost of healthcare that affects virtually every American.   Here is something we ought to be able to agree on. We are spending  too much on healthcare, and too much of what we spend is unnecessary.  The five hearings we held reminded us of something else we should be  able to agree on. One major reason for the unnecessarily high cost of  healthcare is that the healthcare system does not operate with the  discipline and cost saving benefits of a real market.   Too many barriers to innovation drive up costs, and most Americans  have no earthly idea of the true price of healthcare services they buy,  which also drives up costs. Let me repeat that. One major reason for  the unnecessarily high cost of healthcare is, the healthcare system  does not operate with the discipline and the cost-saving benefits of a  real market.   Too many barriers to innovation drive up costs, and most Americans  have no earthly idea of the price of the healthcare services they buy,  so that also drives up costs. As a country--American families, American  Federal and State governments, and private companies--we spent $3.5  trillion on healthcare in 2017, according to CMS, almost as much as we  spent on the entire Federal Government in 2017, according to the  Congressional Budget Office.   High healthcare costs impact everyone; first, the taxpayer because  the Federal Government spends about one-third of all Federal dollars on  healthcare. According to the Congressional Budget Office, of the $3.98  trillion the government spent in 2017, $1.1 trillion of that was  mandatory spending for Medicare, Medicaid, and other healthcare  programs.   This Federal Government runaway spending is the principal cause of  the national debt. The principal cause of the national debt is not  national defense, national parks, and the National Institutes of  Health. The principle cause of the national debt is the runaway  government spending on healthcare, which is squeezing the budget for  national parks, national defense, and basic biomedical research.   Healthcare costs also impact States, all of which have to balance  their budgets. When I was Governor of Tennessee a few years ago,  Medicaid was about 8 percent of our State budget. That was in the  1980s. Today, it is 30 percent of Tennessee's State budget. That means  States have less to spend on fixing roads, educating children, and  helping adults and high school graduates get better job skills.   Second, healthcare spending adds to the cost of doing business in the  United States. Warren Buffett has called the ballooning cost of  healthcare ``a hungry tapeworm on the American economy.''   Third and most important, the rising cost of healthcare is squeezing  the budgets of American families. According to the Gallup poll, 80  percent of registered voters before this midterm election rated  healthcare as ``extremely'' or ``very important'' to their vote--a  higher percentage than every other issue polled, including the economy,  immigration, and taxes.   I imagine every Senator has heard stories from their constituents  about struggling to stretch paychecks to afford prescriptions or to  cover a surprise medical bill.   Any one of us who has received a medical bill in the mail has  wondered, what am I actually paying for?   Here is a story I heard recently. Todd is a Knoxville father who  recently took his son to the emergency room after a bicycle accident.  His son was treated. Todd paid a $150 copay because the emergency room  was ``in network'' for his health insurance, and they headed home. So  Todd was surprised when he received a bill in the mail for $1,800  because, even though the emergency room was in network, the doctor who  treated his son was not.   Todd wrote his Senator--me--trying to figure out why it is so hard to  understand what healthcare prices really are. ``If I am expected to be  a conscientious consumer of my own healthcare needs,'' he wrote, ``I  need a little more help.''   The issue of surprise billing is a widely recognized problem. It was  highlighted in a report from the White House on healthcare costs just  this last Monday.   We want Americans like Todd and his son to be able to access quality  care they can afford. So earlier this year, our Senate committee set  out, in a bipartisan way, to see what we could find out about lowering  healthcare costs. We held five hearings over 6 months.   In June, at our first hearing, we set out to better understand how  much healthcare actually costs in the United  [[Page S7392]]  States to see if we could get some agreement on the numbers.   At our second hearing in July, we heard from Dr. James, who told us  that up to half of what we spend on healthcare is unnecessary.   At our third hearing later in July, we looked at administrative tasks  imposed by the Federal Government and how those burdens lead to doctors  spending more time on paperwork, less time on treating patients, and  all of this also increases costs.   In September, we looked at why, when you check reviews and prices  before buying everything from a coffeemaker to a car, the cost or the  price of your healthcare has remained hidden in a black box.   This is something even the Federal Government's top healthcare  official knows personally. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex  Azar recently told a story of how his doctor ordered him to have a  routine echo cardio stress test. He was sent down the street and  admitted to the hospital, where, after a considerable effort on his  part, he learned the test would cost him $3,500. After using a website  that compiled typical prices for medical care, Secretary Azar learned  the same test would have cost just $550 in a doctor's office. Secretary  Azar said consumers are so in the dark, they often feel ``powerless.''   In an age where you can compare different prices and check a dozen  reviews when you are buying a barbecue grill, you should be able to  more easily understand what you are paying for healthcare.   Last month, at our fifth hearing, we heard about steps the private  sector is taking to disrupt the healthcare system and what kinds of  Federal barriers are preventing private companies from lowering costs.  As we held our five hearings, two conclusions became clear.   The first is that we spend more on healthcare than does any other  country, but we don't spend it well.   Again, Dr. James told us that 30 percent--maybe as much as 50  percent--of all of the money we spend on healthcare is unnecessary.  That is really astonishing. It echoes what Dr. Ashish Jha said, who was  a witness from our first hearing and is the Director of the Harvard  Global Health Institute. He said this:         The popular belief has been that the reason we spend so       much more on healthcare than other countries is that we just       use too much healthcare. Well, it turns out when you look at       the data . . . we are not using more healthcare. Why is it we       are spending twice as much? There are two reasons. One is       administrative complexity, [and second], every time we use       healthcare in America, we pay a lot more than any other       country in the world.''    That was Dr. Ashish from the Harvard Global Health Institute.   Second, while it would be convenient to have a moonshot to reduce  healthcare costs, this will require people other than the Federal  Government.   First, as the largest purchasers of health insurance, employers are  really leading the way in the effort to reduce costs. For example,  let's take International Paper, which is based in Memphis. It uses a  service called Best Doctors. Employees can use it for second opinions  on healthcare. Best Doctors reviews an employee's records, and then it  either reaffirms the treatment that has been recommended by a doctor or  it recommends a different course, such as physical therapy. The use of  this voluntary program saved International Paper over $500,000 in 2017  by preventing unnecessary treatments.   Another way employers reduce healthcare costs is through wellness  programs, which encourage employees to lead healthier lives. There is  probably no greater consensus in healthcare than that wellness-- lifestyle changes, such as eating healthier and stopping smoking--can  prevent serious illness and reduce healthcare costs. It is hard to  think of a better way to make a bigger impact on the health of millions  of Americans than to connect the consensus about wellness and reducing  health costs to the health insurance that 181 million people get on the  job. About 60 percent of insured Americans get our health insurance on  the job.   Second, States are taking an active role in the cost of healthcare.   In 2017, the State of Maine required health insurers to split the  savings with a patient if the patient shops around and chooses a doctor  who costs less than the average price the insurer pays. In Oregon, the  State compiles data on insured residents and uses this information to  run a tool that allows patients to compare the costs of procedures at  different hospitals.   Third, private companies are creating innovative tools to reduce  healthcare costs. For example, Healthcare Bluebook, a Nashville company  and a witness at one of our hearings, provides a tool that helps  patients find the best prices for the highest quality care in their  areas by using their employer-sponsored insurance, which, as I said, 60  percent of insured Americans have. This is useful in lowering costs  because, for example, the amount a patient pays for cataract surgery in  Memphis can range from as little as $2,000 to more than $8,000.   Fourth, hospitals, doctors, and other healthcare providers have the  potential to make a large impact on the cost of healthcare.   On a smaller scale, one of our witnesses, Dr. Gross from Florida,  runs a practice under what is called the direct primary care model. Dr.  Gross charges a flat membership rate of $60, in cash, per patient for  adults under the age of 65, $25 for one child, and $10 for each  additional child. His practice does not bill anything to an insurance  company for direct primary care members--not to ObamaCare, not to  Medicaid, not to Medicare. In return for this membership fee, members  receive an annual wellness exam, 25 office visits per year, including  same-day appointments, and some in-office testing and chronic disease  management without having to pay anything additional out of pocket.  This gives patients access to a defined level of healthcare at a  predictable price, which ranges from about $1,000 to $1,200 a year.   On a larger scale, HCA Healthcare, which also testified--it has 178  hospitals and 119 freestanding surgery centers that are located in the  United States and the United Kingdom--is implementing new techniques to  reduce the spread of MRSA, which is a drug-resistant bacterial  infection that occurs in intensive care units.   These new techniques have reduced cases of MRSA by 37 percent in HCA  facilities and have been so effective that the World Health  Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have  added them to best practices. According to HCA, this reduction in MRSA  infections saves $170,000 for every 1,000 patients. These savings are  shared among the hospitals, insurers, and patients.    Finally, information needs to be easily available so that patients,  consumers, can find out the prices of their care and take an active  role in choosing their healthcare and in planning for medical expenses  whenever they can.   There is also a role for the Federal Government to play. The Federal  Government spent, as I said earlier, $1.1 trillion on Medicare,  Medicaid, and other healthcare programs in 2017. About one-third of all  healthcare spending in America is by the Federal Government, so how we  spend those Federal dollars will obviously make a big difference to the  healthcare system. There may also be things Washington can do or is  doing to increase healthcare costs or to prevent private companies from  taking steps to lower those healthcare costs.   I want to find out what concrete, specific steps the Federal  Government can take to reduce unnecessary healthcare spending or to at  least stop making the problem worse. For example, after our committee  heard about gag clauses, which prohibit pharmacists from telling  patients their prescriptions would be cheaper if they paid in cash  instead of through their insurance, Congress was able to act and ban  those gag clauses earlier this year. In August, the CMS began to  require hospitals to post online the amounts they charge for services  and to keep that information up to date. These are the types of  specific recommendations I am looking for.   In working with experts, I have had some success in asking them for  recommendations in priority order and then turning those  recommendations into legislation.   In 2005, I was a member of the Budget Committee, and I had become  concerned about the rapid increase in the  [[Page S7393]]  Federal debt and how it was squeezing out some of the essential  programs that make our country competitive. So I stopped by a meeting  of the National Academy of Sciences on American competitiveness, and I  said to them: Most ideas fail in Washington, DC, for there being the  lack of an idea. If you, the academy, will give Congress 10 specific  ideas in priority order to improve American competitiveness, I believe  Congress will enact those ideas.''   The academy immediately got busy and recruited Norm Augustine and  then put together a task force of American leaders, called the  Committee on Prospering in the Global Economy of the 21st Century.  Under Norm's leadership, they produced a National Academies report  entitled ``Rising Above the Gathering Storm.'' They came up with 20  ideas, not just 10, and they were specific, such as doubling the  funding for basic science research and creating an energy agency to be  modeled after the Department of Defense's highly successful DARPA  agency, which would invest in the high-potential, high-impact energy  technologies--what we now call ARPA-E.   Congress used most of those ideas and put together a bill that we  called America COMPETES. We passed it in 2007 and reauthorized it in  2010. It was introduced by the majority and minority leaders and had a  large number of Republican and Democratic sponsors.   That is an example of what can happen when experts give us specific  recommendations toward an important public goal and give them to us in  a way that we can actually implement them.   That is what I am looking for in the letter that I am sending to  experts today at the American Enterprise Institute and at the Brookings  Institution--specific recommendations, preferably in priority order,  about what Congress and the President can do to reduce the staggering  healthcare costs, which is a problem in America. Our witnesses from the  National Academy of Sciences and all across the board tell us that  nearly half of everything we spend on healthcare is unnecessary.   I also want input from other leading policy experts, including  economists, doctors, nurses, patients, hospital administrators, State  regulators, legislators, governors, employers, insurers, and healthcare  innovators. I am asking, in writing, for as many specific legislative,  regulatory, or sub-regulatory solutions as possible by March 1, 2019.   I am especially interested in policies that bring to the healthcare  system the discipline and lower cost benefits of a real, functioning  market. One way to do that is to remove the barriers that discourage  innovators from coming up with new ways to reduce healthcare costs. A  second way is to make it easier for the consumers of healthcare to know  the true price of what they are buying.   I welcome suggestions of how those policy ideas could be  implemented--what law to amend, what regulation to change--and any  potential downsides to the policy recommendations. I will share the  recommendations with Senator Patty Murray, who is the ranking  Democratic member of the Senate's HELP Committee, and with all of the  members of our committee. I will share the recommendations with Senator  Grassley and Senator Wyden, who are expected to be the chairman and  ranking member of the Finance Committee. Our HELP Committee and the  Finance Committee have shared jurisdiction over healthcare costs. It  sometimes gets in the way of solutions, but there is no reason it  should. We should all be able to work together in a bipartisan way to  address this startling phenomenon that the experts tell us is true,  which is that we are spending nearly half the money--wasting it  unnecessarily on healthcare. Now we need the experts to tell us exactly  what to do about it.   The Federal Government is not going to lower the cost of healthcare  overnight, but I believe there are steps we can take to make a real  difference to American families. It might be two or three big steps, or  it might be a dozen smaller steps, but we shouldn't let this  opportunity to make progress pass us by.   I ask unanimous consent that the letter I have written and am mailing  today to experts at the American Enterprise Institute and the Brookings  Institution, as well as to other leading healthcare experts, be printed  in the Record following my remarks.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                  December 11, 2018.      James C. Capretta,      Resident Fellow and Milton Friedman Chair, American           Enterprise Institute, Washington, DC.      Paul B. Ginsburg, Ph.D.,      Director, Center for Health Policy, Brookings, Washington,           DC.        Dear Mr. Capretta and Dr. Ginsburg: I am writing to ask for       your specific recommendations to help address America's       rising health care costs. The Senate Committee on Health,       Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) I chair has held five       hearings on the cost of health care and heard from Americans       from across the country--from Alaska to Tennessee--that       health care costs are a growing burden on taxpayers,       employers, and family budgets.        At a hearing in July, we heard a startling estimate from       our witness, Dr. Brent James, a member of the National       Academy of Medicine, who said that 30 percent, and probably       over 50 percent, of all health care spending in America is       unnecessary. That means that American taxpayers, patients,       and businesses are wasting as much as $1.8 trillion a year. A       number of witnesses corroborated Dr. James' estimate,       pointing to causes such as excessive and duplicative federal       reporting requirements on doctors and hospitals and a lack of       accessible information on health care costs and quality.        I am sending this request to additional experts including       economists, doctors, nurses, patients, hospital       administrators, state lawmakers, governors, employers,       insurers, and health care innovators, on what steps the next       Congress should take to address America's rising health care       costs as well as any steps we can recommend that the Trump       Administration or state governments should take.        For the last eight years, Republicans and Democrats have       been locked in a stalemate over the cost of insurance in the       individual health insurance market, where six percent of all       Americans with health care purchase their insurance. This is       an important part of the discussion, but it puts the       spotlight in the wrong place. The hard truth is that we will       never get the cost of health insurance down until we get the       cost of health care down.        This is why the HELP Committee has been holding hearings on       how to reduce administrative burdens; how to reduce what we       spend on unnecessary health care tests, services, procedures,       and prescription drugs; how to reduce the prices of health       care goods and services; how to make available more       information on the cost and quality of care; and how the       private and public sectors have been able to lower health       care costs.        I am especially interested in trying to bring to the health       care system the discipline and cost saving benefits of a real       market. Too many barriers to innovation drive up costs. And       most Americans have no idea of the true price of the health       care services they buy--which also drives up costs.        I request that you provide written responses to the below       questions by email to LowerHealthCareC[email protected] by       March 1, 2019:        1. What specific steps can Congress take to lower health       care costs, incentivize care that improves the health and       outcomes of patients, and increase the ability for patients       to access information about their care to make informed       decisions?        2. What does Congress or the administration need to do to       implement those steps? Operationally, how would these       recommendations work?        3. Once implemented, what are the potential shortcomings of       those steps, and why are they worthy of consideration despite       the shortcomings?        Thank you for your consideration and attention to this       request.            Sincerely,                                                   Lamar Alexander,                                                          Chairman.     I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, along with my colleague, the ranking  member on the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, Senator  Murray, I wish to pay tribute to Carolyn Bolden, a nondesignated  employee on the HELP Committee staff. Ms. Bolden is retiring at the end  of this month after more than 23 years of distinguished service to the  Congress, including more than 12 years serving on the HELP Committee.   Ms. Bolden has served on the HELP Committee as an assistant editor on  detail from the Government Publishing Office since September 2006,  providing support in all aspects of editing and printing the  committee's many documents.   Ms. Bolden is well-regarded on both sides of the aisle, having proven  her professionalism, courtesy, and substantial expertise across four  chairs and both parties. Without the support of Ms. Bolden and the rest  of the nondesignated staff, the committee could not accomplish the  important work the American people expect us to get done on their  behalf. I, along with the ranking member and the rest of the  committee's members, want to recognize Ms. Bolden for that tremendous  contribution to the Committee as she exits her time in the Senate.   I would like to yield now to my colleague, the ranking member,  Senator Murray, for her remarks.
