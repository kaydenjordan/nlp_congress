 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for yielding time.   There is a reason that nearly every other level of government in  America has ceased to exercise executive authority. The emergency is  over.   Mr. Speaker, 1,100 days ago, the President declared a public health  emergency. We know this. Since then, that order has been extended a  dozen times, including twice after President Biden declared the  pandemic over during a ``60 Minutes'' interview on national television.   Mr. Speaker, 1,100 days ago, the public health emergency was  warranted. I know this. I lived it as a county executive where I took  immediate emergency action to protect our most vulnerable and help to  save lives. I saw  [[Page H537]]  firsthand the flexibilities granted under such an emergency, expanding  access to care and services during a time of essential need.   I also simultaneously saw how the absolute power granted within such  an order corrupted New York State government and enabled Governors and  the President to choose who was and was not essential.   It is important that we find bipartisan solutions and agreements to  extend those efficiencies and flexibilities we like, but it is past  time to end the executive and Presidential overreach.   Emergency executive authority should be limited and only for  extraordinary circumstances. This is no longer an extraordinary  circumstance.
