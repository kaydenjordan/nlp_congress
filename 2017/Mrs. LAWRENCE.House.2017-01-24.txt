 Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak against H.R. 7,  the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion and Abortion Insurance Full  Disclosure Act.   We are here to represent all of our constituents, even the ones we  don't agree with. It should be the woman alone who makes the decision,  not Republicans, not Democrats, not the Trump administration, no one  but the woman and her doctor.   I support choice so every woman in America could make the decision  that is right for her, her family, her God, her health, and her  reproduction.   Creating access issues and removing coverage does not stop abortions;  it drives them underground. H.R. 7 essentially creates a disparity  between poor women and rich women.   For women, children, foster youth, for the LGBT community, for the  middle class, working class, poor people, people of color, undocumented  residents, and people who see health care as a right and not as a  privilege for those who can afford it, they should have the right and  liberty to make their own health decisions.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, as the House considers this legislation,  I stand in support of expanding Internet access around the globe. In  this fast growing and ever changing world, the gap between those who  have and have not will be made even more dramatic for those without  internet access. Internet access is a valuable commodity that helps  millions of lives, and everyone should have access to it.   In the 21st century, one thing is crystal clear: Access to the  internet is critical. 4.2 billion people worldwide don't have access to  the internet. This includes children starting school, young women  starting businesses, and communities looking for ways to compete in the  global market.   Women are particularly impacted and left behind, something that  shouldn't go unnoticed by this body. UNICEF reports that nearly 90% of  the income women bring in is reinvested into their family, more than  double what men reinvest. Women build up their communities, and we must  do whatever we can to ensure they have the resources necessary to  succeed.   Not only will this bill reach those women who live in the dark  without web services, it will promote the rights and values that make  America exceptional. The freedoms of expression and assembly are  fundamental rights, and the Internet can be a critical medium for  promoting democracy. A report by the McKinsey Global Institute put it  best when it said ``The Internet has fundamentally empowered the  consumer [. . .] It saves the consumer time and gives customers access  to products.'' In this great body, I hope we continue to stand for  democracy, its values, and support those who wish to stand up for their  rights.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from California (Mr. Royce) that the House suspend the rules  and pass the bill, H.R. 600.   The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill was passed.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 601. As a  parent who was very involved in my children's education and served as  President of the Southfield Public Schools Board of Education, I firmly  believe the importance of promoting education to all regions of the  world. Education is a universal human right that should be obtained by  every young mind of the world.   Access to basic education is a human right that must be guaranteed to  all children. In my role as the Vice Chair of the Bipartisan  Congressional Women's Caucus during the 115th Congress, I will work  with my colleagues in a bipartisan manner to highlight barriers to  basic education, specifically focusing on girls' education in the  developing world. Providing girls with an education helps break the  cycle of poverty. Educated women are less likely to get married, more  likely to have healthy babies, and are more likely to understand the  value of education.   Mr. Speaker, this legislation would ensure that aid is prioritized  for the most vulnerable populations, particularly those living in  conflict zones. We must take the necessary steps to see that these  children are provided with the rights to develop their full potential  in order to be contributing members of their societies.   The enforcement of this bill will help bridge the gap with some  global issues that we still see today with marginalized groups seeking  education. Young children, regardless of gender have the right to gain  a quality education.  [[Page H666]]  Children with disabilities or illnesses should not be shunned away from  trying to learn because they are considered different.   I am grateful that our Chamber has taken this important step to  ensure that the United States dedicates our time and resources to  helping the future of the world gain an education. I want to thank my  colleagues on both sides of the aisle for their continued support of  universal education for all.   The SPEAKER pro tempore.
