 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Georgia for yielding me the  customary 30 minutes for debate.   Mr. Speaker, this is the 54th closed rule brought by the Republican  majority to the floor. Yesterday, in the Rules Committee, I pointed  that out, as well as the fact that there were 25 Members of this body  who offered amendments that were not made in order. Significant numbers  of them were germane, and they were bipartisan. We cannot continue to  ignore the importance of allowing full membership to participate on  behalf of their constituents.   Today's bill combines two bills: one, a bipartisan supported approach  to strengthening background checks; the other, a disgraceful handout to  the powerful gun lobby and gun manufacturers.   I also pointed out last night that the NRA, in many respects, is two  bodies: those at the top and the rank-and-file members. Many of the  rank-and-file members, for example, support universal background checks  that we could be talking about in this measure if an amendment seeking  to have that made in order had been made in order.   A month ago yesterday, this country grieved with our brothers and  sisters in Sutherland Springs, Texas, as they reeled from one of the  worst mass shootings this country has ever suffered. A man walked into  a house of worship as churchgoers prayed and sprayed bullets throughout  the building. He killed an 18-month-old baby; he killed eight members  of one family; he killed the pastor's 14-year-old daughter--a total of  26 people--and he was able to do so in a matter of minutes.   We learned later that this man had served in the Air Force and, while  there, had been court-martialed for committing acts of domestic  violence against his wife and infant child. As part of his sentence, he  was prohibited from purchasing or possessing firearms. Tragically, this  information was never put into the National Instant Criminal Background  Check System, and we call that NICS. He was able to pass a background  check and come into possession of several guns he would use to murder  26 innocent people in Sutherland Springs, Texas, on November 5, 2017.   This tragic event is instructive to the bill brought by us today.  Clearly, our background check system must be strengthened.   The problems with our background check system are more grave than we  previously could even imagine, as recent reports indicate that the FBI  has sought to retrieve guns from thousands of people that the  background check system should have blocked from buying a weapon but  who ultimately were allowed to do so.   I think we can all agree that, if we have a system through which  people  [[Page H9676]]  like the murderer in Sutherland Springs can buy a gun or one in which  thousands of people who should have never been allowed to buy a gun in  the first place are able to do so, then we really have no system at  all.   Today's bill, in part, would have been a good first step in  addressing those weaknesses. But, Mr. Speaker, my Republican  colleagues, in a fashion so common for their majority of this Congress,  have decided to sabotage a commonsense, bipartisan bill by combining it  with a reckless piece of legislation that will allow guns to be carried  all over this country.   Let us remember that the gunman in Texas was a known domestic abuser.  He abused his wife and he abused his child. Under today's concealed  carry bill, all we would have to do is change ``wife'' to  ``girlfriend,'' and in some States he would be able to obtain a  concealed carry permit for a handgun. Should today's bill become law,  he would then be allowed to bring that concealed handgun into your  State, even if your State does not allow convicted domestic abusers to  have concealed weapons.   For example, Mr. Speaker, the State that I am privileged and proud to  represent, Florida, stops abusive dating partners from carrying loaded,  hidden handguns in public. However, my friend from Georgia's State,  right over the border, does not have that same restriction. Under this  legislation, Florida would be mandated to allow abusive dating partners  with concealed permits from Georgia to carry their weapons in Florida.                                time  1245    Under H.R. 38, violent offenders and people with no firearms safety  training would be able to carry hidden loaded guns even if they could  not otherwise legally purchase a gun in the State.   Footnote right there: like my friend from Georgia, I, too, have a  concealed carry permit in the State of Florida, and I am a firm  believer in the Second Amendment and a person's right to own a weapon,  but I also think we should be discussing today matters such as the bump  stock, and there were amendments that dealt with that that were not  made in order. I think we should be discussing assault weapons in the  hands of the public. I, for the life of me, do not understand how  anybody, other than people in law enforcement and the military, need an  AK-47 or a multiple-firing gun.   Mr. Speaker, this idea that we are presented with here is so  terrible, so anathema to common sense and decency, that one has to  wonder aloud, where did such an idea come from.   Well, we have an answer, and it is probably not too surprising.  Today's concealed carry bill is brought to you by the Republican Party  via their very influential friends in the powerful gun lobby.   Footnote right there: the gun lobby does the bidding of gun  manufacturers, who benefit immensely. Why don't we just pass a mandate  that every woman, man, and child in America must buy a gun, and maybe  that would satisfy or satiate gun manufacturers with reference to how  they continuously cause us to do things that are not commonsense  matters as it pertains to guns.   In fact, this bill, which will allow domestic abusers to carry  concealed weapons across State lines, is the top priority for the gun  lobby. Well, happy holidays, fellows, but we here on this side of the  aisle are going to do everything that we can to make sure you don't get  it.   When this matter gets to the other body, I can assure my friend from  Georgia, and all of the speakers on either side today, that it is going  nowhere.   So what are we doing by bringing this measure in the first place? Is  it a distraction? Is it an absolute necessity that we do this?   Mr. Speaker, just so we are crystal clear, what is happening right  now in the people's House, let me reiterate, just over 2 months after a  gunman killed 58 people and wounded nearly 550 people in Las Vegas, and  just over a month after another gunman killed 26 people in their church  as they prayed, this Republican majority, in response to those  atrocities, saw fit to bring to the floor a bill that would allow  violent offenders to carry concealed weapons all across the country.  Let that sink in.   This isn't the only time that we have done something along these  lines. After Sandy Hook, after children were killed and their teachers  were killed, we did nothing. After Virginia Tech; where people were  killed in significant numbers at a military base; in Colorado in a  theater; in Orlando, Florida, in a nightclub, repeatedly we have seen  these multiple shootings, or mass shootings as they are referred to,  where three or more people are killed, 330 times this year alone we  have had mass shootings, yet we come here with a bill talking about  carrying concealed weapons.   Every day in America, 93 people on average are killed with a gun,  seven of them children, but in the midst of this gun violence epidemic,  and that is what it is, what do my Republican colleagues do? Did they  bring to the floor legislation to close the gun show loophole, or did  they close loopholes to prevent domestic abusers from purchasing guns,  or are they considering a ban on so-called bump stocks that do turn  semiautomatic weapons into illegal automatic guns, most recently used  to rain carnage down on innocent concertgoers in Las Vegas?   One country music singer pointed out that his band had legal guns,  but they were afraid to bring them out in Las Vegas because the  authorities couldn't ferret out who was doing the shooting. We had that  in a Wal-Mart that all of us saw posted, the shooting where people with  guns caused confusion among the police.   A footnote there: this bill proposes to study the issue of bump  stocks. Mr. Speaker, we don't need a study. As my colleague,  Congresswoman Dina Titus, who represents the city of Las Vegas, said  last night at the Rules Committee, the only study we need is to go look  at the 58 crosses in her district. That is what bump stocks do. That is  your study.   Did my Republican colleagues bring to the floor a bill that would  have addressed any of these commonsense proposals? Of course not,  because even though those proposals have the support of an overwhelming  majority of American people when it comes to guns, that is not what  motivates my Republican friends. What they care about is the gun lobby  and gun manufacturers and their wish list. That is why we are here  today.   Mr. Speaker, my friends on the other side of the aisle like to  compare a concealed carry permit to a driver's license, but let me set  the record straight, because that comparison is nothing but a gross  exercise in false equivalency. A driver's license must meet stringent,  uniform Federal criteria established under the REAL ID Act. This  includes a photo of the license holder and data including their date of  birth and their State of residence.   There are absolutely no such uniform standards when it comes to  concealed carry permits. In some States, they could look like a paper  library card. In others, they may have photo identification.   There is no national database, no hotline that contains permit  information from all 50 States, so law enforcement would be in a  position of having to find each individual issuing agency to verify  that a concealed carry permit is valid, and that is impossible.   My Republican colleagues often tout their support for our first  responders. Well, I urge them to heed the warnings of those brave men  and women. Major law enforcement groups understand how dangerous this  bill would be, and that is why so many of them oppose what the majority  is trying to do here today. Organizations like the Major Cities Chiefs  Association, Police Foundation, and Police Executive Research Forum all  stand in strong opposition to today's bill.    To make matters worse, this piece of legislation even exposes members  of the law enforcement community to personal litigation if they  mistakenly question someone's ability to carry a concealed weapon.   Mr. Speaker, this is not just some small issue limiting a law  enforcement officer's ability to carry out their job; this limit on  challenging concealed carry permits will cost lives. In fact, a recent  study conducted by Stanford University found that when States weaken  law enforcement's authority to deny a permit to those who pose a danger  to the community, violent crime goes up by 13 to 15 percent. This  research is clear, convincing, and not at  [[Page H9677]]  all difficult to fathom. When you lift limits on who can carry a  concealed weapon, gun-related crime goes up. It is that simple.   Mr. Speaker, among the many important issues this body must address,  the following stand out: as of this moment, we are roughly 72 hours  away from a government shutdown; we have 800,000 persons whom we refer  to as DREAMers who continue to wait for us to do the right thing and  bring them fully into the only country that they know as home; and we  have 9 million children and their parents facing an unconscionable  lapse in lifesaving funding for the incredibly important Children's  Health Insurance Program.   Given all that, what does the Republican-controlled Congress do? They  bring a bill to the floor that will make it easier for domestic abusers  to cross State lines with concealed weapons. This is shameful and no  way to run a government.   Last night, I thought actively too long trying to go to sleep about  the acronym GOP, Grand Old Party, the conservatives, the States' rights  conservatives, the fiscal conservatives who are about to dump serious  debt on our children should be called now by their acronym, rather than  GOP, in light of the choice that they make with reference to guns,  perhaps GOP should stand for ``Guns Over People.''   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Engel), a very good friend of mine.    Mr. Speaker, my friend from Iowa, Mr. King, had two  amendments that were rejected last night in the Rules Committee. I join  him in saying that we need to get back to regular order.   Mr. Speaker, would you be so kind as to inform me and my friend from  Georgia how much time we have remaining?   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Florida has 11\3/4\  minutes remaining. The gentleman from Georgia has 18 minutes remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Washington (Ms. Jayapal), a distinguished member of the Judiciary  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer), my good friend, who is a member  of the Ways and Means Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Price), my good friend.   Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, the bill before us creates  a dangerous race to the bottom, forcing States to accept concealed  carry permits from all other States, regardless of their training  standards, their background check system, or their safety requirements.   Make no mistake, this bill would make it easier to cross State lines  with hidden, loaded weapons, threatening local communities by making it  harder for law enforcement to determine who is lawfully caring a  firearm. No wonder sheriffs, police chiefs, and other law enforcement  agencies oppose this bill.   What a shame it is that, after the terrible mass shootings in Las  Vegas and Texas, the first gun-related bill this House considers would  actually make it easier for dangerous people to carry concealed weapons  in more places.   Mr. Speaker, these tragedies aren't inevitable. They are the result  of policy choices. We could be working together to enact commonsense  measures to respond to the gun violence epidemic facing our country.  But as long as Republicans are beholden to NRA extremism, these  proposals, I am afraid, will fall on deaf ears.   I urge my colleagues to reject this shameful proposal and to work,  instead, to address the root causes of gun violence in this country.                                time  1315     Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New  Jersey (Mr. Pascrell).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New  Jersey (Mr. Pascrell).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Massachusetts (Mr. Moulton).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Rhode Island (Mr. Langevin), my good friend    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Colorado (Mr. Perlmutter).    Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I am  going to offer an amendment to the rule to bring up H.R. 3440, the  Dream Act.   Mr. Speaker, a group of 34 of my Republican colleagues sent a letter  this week to Speaker Ryan urging a vote before the year's end on  legislation that would protect DACA recipients. I include in the Record  that letter.                                  Congress of the United States,                                   Washington, DC, December 5, 2017.      Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker of the House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Ryan: We write in support of passing of a       permanent legislative solution for Deferred Action for       Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients before the end of the       year. DACA recipients--young people brought to America       through no fault of their own--are contributing members of       our communities and our economy. For many, this is the only       country they have ever known. They are American in every way       except their immigration status.        Since DACA's inception, the federal government has approved       approximately 795,000 initial DACA applications and 924,000       renewals. Since being approved for DACA status, an       overwhelming majority of these individuals have enrolled in       school, found employment, or have served in the military.       Studies have shown that passing legislation to permanently       protect these individuals would add hundreds of billions to       our country's gross domestic product (GDP). That is why the       business community, universities, and civic leaders alike       support a permanent legislative solution.        We agree with President Trump that executive action was not       the appropriate process for solving this issue, as was done       under the previous administration, and we believe Congress       should act. We are compelled to act immediately because many       DACA recipients are about to lose or have already lost their       permits in the wake of the program's rescission. Not acting       is creating understandable uncertainty and anxiety amongst       immigrant communities.        While we firmly believe Congress must work to address other       issues within our broken immigration system, it is imperative       that Republicans and Democrats come together to solve this       problem now and not wait until next year. We all agree that       our border must be enforced, our national security defended,       and our broken immigration system reformed, but in this       moment, we must address the urgent matter before us in a       balanced approach that does not harm valuable sectors of our       economy nor the lives of these hard-working young people. We       must pass legislation that protects DACA recipients from       deportation and gives them the opportunity to apply for a       more secured status in our country as soon as possible.       Reaching across the aisle to protect DACA recipients before       the holidays is the right thing to do.            Sincerely,          Scott Taylor; Dan Newhouse; Mia Love; Mark Amodei; David             G. Valadao; Dave Reichert; Brian Fitzpatrick; Mike             Coffman; Charlie Dent; Frank A. LoBiondo; Peter T.             King; Carlos Curbelo; Ileana Ros-Lehtinen; Ryan A.             Costello; Fred Upton; Jeff Denham; Rodney Davis; John             J.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text  of my amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material,  immediately prior to the vote on the previous question.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Florida?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Arizona (Mr. Grijalva) to discuss our proposal.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I have watched this year as members of the Republican  majority have worked diligently to repeal the Affordable Care Act,  which would have been a failure for the American people but great for  special interests.   I have watched members of the Republican majority work relentlessly  to push a tax scam bill through this body that will certainly be a  failure for the American people but great for corporate America and the  ultrawealthy.   I have watched members of the Republican majority here today and  yesterday in the Rules Committee champion a bill that will be a failure  for the American people, especially survivors of domestic violence, but  great for the powerful corporate gun lobby and gun manufacturers. I  sense a theme for my friends across the aisle, and it is a shameful  one.   Mr. Speaker, our country faces a gun violence epidemic, and we here  in Congress should be doing all that we can to put it to an end.   The opportunity to pass a bipartisan measure to strengthen our  background  [[Page H9681]]  check system has presented itself, but apparently the majority, without  hearings, would rather drown bipartisanship in the dirty waters of the  corporate gun lobby and gun manufacturers.   I have said it before, and I will say it again here today: Those who  stand in the way of legislation that will address our country's gun  violence epidemic are increasingly culpable for its needless  continuation. That is why I dubbed and gave the acronym GOP, ``Guns  Over People,'' but I guess I should have used the acronym ``Good Old  Puppets'' of the gun lobby and gun manufacturers.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on the rule and underlying bill,  and I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1330     Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further  proceedings on this question will be postponed.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. This is a 5-minute vote.
