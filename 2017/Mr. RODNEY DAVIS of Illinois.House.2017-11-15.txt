 Will the gentleman yield?    It is a privilege to be able to work  with the gentleman on this issue, and, Mr. Chairman, it is a privilege  to work with you.   With eight colleges and universities in my district, I cannot ignore  the impact that eliminating this section that Mr. Turner eloquently  explained--the impact it may have on the students and the employees in  my district at all of those institutions.   The University of Illinois, the largest university in my district,  provided $184 million in tuition waivers to 1,387 faculty and staff  last year alone; 1,100 of those employees made less than $75,000.   I am worried, too, that that is going to have a tremendous impact on  graduate students. I am worried it is going to have an impact on the  custodians and the assistants in the Registrar's Office who are just  working at these institutions to be able to send their son or daughter  to college. So I look forward to working with Mr. Turner and Mr.  Chairman and working toward a solution.
