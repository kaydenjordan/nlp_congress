 Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition to the  partisan impeachment inquiry currently under way by House Democrats.  They have elected to make this a closed-door, partisan process with no  fairness, transparency, due process, or accountability to the American  people.   It is absolutely necessary for the Speaker to hold a vote in the full  House to formally authorize an impeachment inquiry. Regardless of which  party held the majority in the past, there has been an authorization  vote because it allows the House to adopt procedures that will provide  for the minority to be an equal part of this process.   We cannot even get access to testimony from the secret hearings.  Considering impeaching a duly elected President should be significant  enough to demand transparency, due process, and an open and fair  proceeding.   In wake of this partisan exercise, we have abandoned the work of the  people. We should be passing legislation that is bipartisan to lower  the price of prescription drugs and approving the USMCA that will  create millions of jobs for hardworking Americans.   We cannot afford to put these priorities on the back burner, and I  know the folks in my district agree.                            ____________________
