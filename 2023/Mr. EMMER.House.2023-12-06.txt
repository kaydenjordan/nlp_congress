 Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor U.S. Air Force Major Jeff  Hoernemann of Andover, Minnesota. Jeff lost his life last week along  with seven other airmen during a routine training mission off the coast  of Japan. He was just 32 years old.   Throughout his life, Jeff had a competitive spirit and was uniquely  disciplined. A graduate of Andover High School, Jeff broke school and  conference records in the indoor 800 meters and the 4 x 800-meter  relay.   As a teenager, he won a $15,000 scholarship with an essay describing  his careful budgeting to purchase a bike for triathlons.   After competing in cross country and earning a degree in mechanical  engineering from North Dakota State University, Jeff entered the Air  Force. In 2016, he became a pilot after completing Columbus Air Force  Base's Specialized Undergraduate Pilot Training class.   Jeff dedicated his life to service and made the ultimate sacrifice.  Today, across the city of Andover, the State of Minnesota, and this  country, we honor his life and preserve his memory. Our prayers are  with Jeff's wife, Jess; his parents, Thomas and Catherine; and his  brother, Jared.                            ____________________
