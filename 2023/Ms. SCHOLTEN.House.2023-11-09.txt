 Madam Speaker, I rise ahead of Veterans Day to honor  the incredible life and sacrifice of an amazing veteran from west  Michigan who gave his life in service to our Nation, Specialist Four  Lloyd Slack.   Earlier this year, I had the honor of hosting a ceremony in his honor  at the brand-new veterans home in Grand Rapids, Michigan.   Lloyd Slack paid the ultimate sacrifice while serving in Vietnam,  drawing enemy fire upon himself and thereby saving his team.   My team learned that Lloyd's mother, 96-year-old Lola Mondy, a Gold  Star mother, never received the medals that he was due. We got right to  work to make sure she could see those medals and receive the  commemoration of her son's service before she died.   Ms. Mondy turned unimaginable loss into purpose, serving other Gold  Star families while also living with her own grief.   Presenting these medals to her in the ceremony was the honor of my  time in Congress. Our military families sacrifice so much, and on this  Veterans Day, I give my thanks to west Michiganians who have served and  their families. We are the home of the free because of the brave.                            ____________________
