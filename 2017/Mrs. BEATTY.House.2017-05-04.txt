 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to the  Republicans' latest version of Trumpcare.   Trumpcare will cover fewer people, provide weaker protections, and  result in higher costs.   Trumpcare will eviscerate essential health benefits and protections  for pre-existing conditions and make it all but impossible for millions  of Americans fighting illness to afford the health coverage they  desperately need.   Trumpcare will mean higher costs for less coverage.   It will result in 24 million hard-working Americans losing health  coverage.   It will destroy protections for Americans with pre-existing  conditions and gut Essential Health Benefits, such as maternity,  prescription drug coverage, and emergency coverage.  [[Page H4169]]    Trumpcare will create a crushing age tax--it will force Americans  aged 50-64 to pay premiums five times higher than what others pay for  health coverage, no matter how healthy they are.   Mr. Speaker, healthcare should be a right for all, not just the  privileged few. I will vote against Trumpcare and urge all my  colleagues to vote no.
