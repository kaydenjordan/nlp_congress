 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman  from Michigan for yielding and for his efforts to share the stories of  Americans who are seeing the positive impacts of tax reform.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to set the record straight on the Tax Cuts  and Jobs Act. From day one, misinformation about the benefits of this  historic tax reform plan have circulated. The truth is that Americans  across the country are receiving bonuses, pay increases, and other  benefits that are helping them support their families and save for  their futures.   Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from Michigan and I started the Truth  Tellers Initiative on Tax Reform to highlight the many ways this bill  helps the American people.   Since December, we have witnessed the positive impacts of tax reform.  Small businesses are expanding, jobs are being created, retirement and  benefit packages are increasing in value, and the American people are  keeping more of their hard-earned paychecks.   Over the coming months, Representatives from each State will have the  opportunity to share how tax reform has helped their constituents.
