 Madam Speaker, historically, under the Occupational  Safety and Health Act, covered employers were required to maintain an  annual log of all work-related illnesses and injuries.   An illness or injury is recordable if it is work-related, a new case,  and the incident involves days away from work or medical treatment  beyond first aid, among other things.   On May 21, OSHA changed these requirements. This new OSHA policy  effectively removes legal liability from employers that require a  vaccine at least through May 2022. Now, if a worker decides to get a  vaccine to keep their job and experiences an adverse reaction, the  employer is not responsible for this injury.   OSHA stated it changed this requirement only because they do not want  to give any suggestion of discouraging workers from receiving the  COVID-19 vaccinations or to disincentivize employers' vaccination  efforts.   Why are they trying to hide statistics related to the vaccine? While  this policy change appears to be a mere sidenote for OSHA's lengthy  guidelines, we have to ask President Biden and OSHA: Why is the ethical  burden on the workers and not on the government?                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, today marks exactly 9 months in of the  Biden administration. The motto was Build Back Better. So, where do we  stand? What have we built back better on behalf of the real American  people out there?   He talked about unity in his inauguration speech. It only seems to be  that he has unified the American people in anger at the cost of doing  business. Everything has gone up for American families, as you see from  this chart here.   In my home State of California, everything is going up. We see fuel.  We heard the national average is $3.30. In my home State, it is  anywhere from $4.20 to $5. Now, it is not the rest of the country's  problem how the State runs itself, but it kind of underlines that we  have big problems.   What is the focus going to be? The Biden administration is going to  make it where farming in California is even more difficult. We are  going to have fewer of the crops California grows, therefore driving  inflation even more on everything when these crops have to be replaced  with foreign imports.   I mean, come on. The inflation is being caused by this government,  when you pull just $4 trillion or $5 trillion of spending out of  midair. Now they are threatening to have tax increases on certain  people, whether it is corporations or the rich or whoever. But then  they back off on that, and they say no tax increases on those under  $400,000.   It is going to be impossible to pay for this without doing that. Show  us how you are going to do it. The inflation is going to kill the  American worker, especially middle- and lower-income folks.   It is irresponsible what is going on. Just throwing these terms,  trillions of spending--stimulus spending is basically what it is  because it isn't infrastructure. Trying to sneak it through in budget  reconciliation by getting a mere 50 votes over in the Senate is really  a sleight of hand that is going to hurt this country.   This country is already hurting compared to a year, year and a half  ago, the way our economy is right now, our energy reliability, our food  reliability. You want to talk supply chain? All the ships are sitting  off California, waiting to be unloaded.   There is one thing about it: If we were building it here, if we were  producing it here, manufacturing it here, we wouldn't have to be  worried about unloading ships. But when you chase the jobs out of the  country with horrendous regulations and the taxation  [[Page H5714]]  that is going to be upon business, farmers, timber fallers, you don't  get a good result.   The Biden administration needs to take a real good hard look at how  economics actually work and quit doing this to the American people  because, I will tell you what, we are not going to have much left after  4 years of all this.   I appreciate my friend here from Louisiana trying to bring this to  the American people with the time here tonight on seeing how this 9  months in of the Biden administration is costing and hurting regular  Americans.
