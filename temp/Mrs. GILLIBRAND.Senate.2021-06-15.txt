 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I rise for the ninth time to once  again call for this entire body to have the opportunity to consider and  to cast their votes for the Military Justice Improvement and Increasing  Prevention Act.   This commonsense reform would ensure that people in the military who  have been subjected to sexual assault and other serious crimes get the  justice they deserve.   I have been calling for a full floor vote on this bill since May 24.  That was 22 days ago. Since then, an estimated 1,232 servicemembers  will have been raped or sexually assaulted.   Two in three of those survivors will not even report it because they  know they are more likely to face retaliation than to receive justice.   Tonight, I want to share the story of just one of these countless  survivors of sexual assault in our military who bravely shared her  story with me.   A husband and a wife both served in the Marine Corps when the wife  was assaulted by another marine. Her commander concluded that she  deserved ill treatment for wearing running shorts and makeup. Her  husband said that when he read the opinions of the command-appointed  investigator, he found that he compared rape to prostitution or  marrying a rich man. The wife said of the retaliation after she  reported the assault that ``[t]he humiliation of the retaliation was  worse than the assault because it was sanctioned from those same  leaders I once would have risked my life for.''   I ask my colleagues--I ask my colleagues to imagine living through  the worst day of your life and knowing that nothing would happen to  your assailant. Imagine knowing that there was a bill that could change  this system that failed you, knowing that Senators from both sides of  the aisle have come together to advocate for it, knowing that if it  were allowed to be voted on, it would pass.   Now imagine the vote getting denied night after night after night,  watching the government that you volunteered to serve and defend  continue to fail you.   We have to do better. We can start by bringing this legislation to  the floor.   I ask unanimous consent that at a time to be determined by the  majority leader in consultation with the Republican leader, the Senate  Armed Services Committee be discharged from further consideration of S.  1520 and the Senate proceed to its consideration; that there be 2 hours  for debate, equally divided in the usual form, and that upon the use or  yielding back of that time, the Senate vote on the bill with no  intervening action or debate.    Madam President, I respect the chairman and his need  to carefully review this legislation, but we have been reviewing the  legislation for 8 years, and we have been having hearings on this  legislation and the issue of sexual assault in the military for 8  years.   We have been passing legislation through the committee for 8 years,  but this vote has been denied every time.   In fact, when don't ask, don't tell repeal was being filibustered by  the Armed Services Committee chairman and other Members of that  committee, we ultimately took that vote to the Senate floor. It was an  up-or-down vote to repeal don't ask, don't tell.   In this case, the committee has been considering this thoroughly and  carefully for 8 years. And even if the chairman believes that he hasn't  fully vetted it or reviewed it or had the careful consideration, many  of the Members of the committee have. We have been diligently looking  at this issue for 8 straight years. It is time to bring this to the  floor.   I am confident that if we bring this to the floor, we will be able to  reform how we deal with these cases; we will be able to change the  system for the better; and that we will be able to finally begin to  overcome the scourge of sexual violence in the military.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I have 10 requests for committees to  meet during today's session of the Senate.
