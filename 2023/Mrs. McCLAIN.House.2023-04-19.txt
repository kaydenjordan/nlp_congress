 Mr. Chairman, I stand here today enraged that we are  debating a bill to protect women and girls in sports.   I am enraged not because I disagree with the legislation, in fact, I  fully support the legislation. I am enraged by the fact that we have  reached a point in this country where we have to talk about a bill to  protect women and women's sports is even necessary.   When Congress passed Title IX in this very Chamber a half a century  ago, I thought it was supposed to be a victory for women across the  United States.   At what point did we throw it away and make it meaningless?   Do we not care about women?                                time  1345    Did we forget about the women and the young girls?   Listen, as a wife, as a mother, as a female athlete, and as a coach  of female athletes, I take offense to this, because now 50 years later,  we are in the same Chamber, debating the merits of protecting women's  sports, once again.   The left's hypocrisy on this issue has resulted in women being  demolished in competitions, physically brutalized going up against  stronger opponents. They are losing individual games, State  championships, and NCAA's championships to biological males that have  decided to become a woman.   That is their right, but what about the women's rights? What about  the rights of the young girls? Do they not have any rights anymore?   Let's be clear about something: My Democratic colleagues can see what  is going on and what is happening, and I believe they know that this is  wrong, as well. That is why they hide behind it and don't deal with the  real issue.   Because of that reason, I am enraged today that we are debating a  bill that should not require any debate at all.
