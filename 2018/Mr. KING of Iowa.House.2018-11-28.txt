 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Colorado  for recognizing me to speak here on this Special Order to honor  National Bible Week.   It starts off, for me, this way, Mr. Speaker. I will go to Psalm  139:13: ``For you created my inmost being; you knit me together in my  mother's womb.''   God knew us all in the womb. At the moment that we were formed in our  mother's womb, from that moment of fertilization, that moment of  conception, He gave us life. I believe that is also the instant that He  places the soul in all of us who are created in His image.   Once we recognize that and we recognize also that our Founding  Fathers understood this as well when they laid out the prioritized  rights in the Declaration of Independence--and they prioritized these  rights as the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. It  wasn't just pulling three different words out of a grab bag and putting  them up there in the Declaration of Independence, but, instead, they  were prioritized.   Our pursuit of happiness cannot trample on anyone else's liberty or  life, and exercise of our liberty cannot take someone else's life. Life  is the paramount right, and this is natural law. It is God's law. It is  the laws of nature and nature's God.   I serve here in this Congress, and, for all the time that I have been  here, the priority has always been to protect innocent unborn human  life. That has brought about H.R. 490, the Heartbeat bill.   I wear this pin on my lapel, Mr. Speaker, every day because I believe  it saves those lives. H.R. 490 protects every baby that can be detected  with a heartbeat. If a heartbeat can be detected, the baby is  protected.   I want to announce here tonight that we are very close to being able  to say that we will have a markup in the Judiciary Committee very soon  on the Heartbeat bill, H.R. 490, which protects the life of every baby  with a heartbeat, a certain indicator of life.                                time  1800
