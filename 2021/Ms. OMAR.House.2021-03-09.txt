 Mr. Speaker, I rise in solidarity with labor unions that,  throughout history, have fought the greed of their bosses and  corporations in order to have a better life.   I rise in solidarity with workers in the Marathon Petroleum plant in  Minnesota who are striking for safer working conditions and with the  workers at the Minneapolis Institute of Art, Walker Art Center, and  many more workplaces that have recently unionized in my district.   I rise in solidarity with the 5,800 mostly Black workers in Alabama  who are currently fighting one of the most predatory corporations in  the world, Amazon, to form a union.   Labor unions have been the driving force for all positive change for  workers in modern history. As a former union member myself, I can  attest to the power that workers wield when they exercise their right  to organize. That is why we need the PRO Act and why we must pass it  this week and pressure the Senate to do the same.   The PRO Act puts power back where it belongs, in the hands of  workers.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from National Nurses  United.                                          National Nurses United,                                      Washington, DC, March 8, 2021.        Dear Representative, The House of Representatives is       scheduled to vote on H.R. 842, the Protecting the Right to       Organize (PRO) Act this week. On behalf of the 170,000 nurses       represented by National Nurses United, the largest union of       registered nurses in the United States, we strongly urge you       to vote YES on the PRO Act, which would implement critical       improvements to current labor law in order to protect the       right for workers to organize collectively and form a union.        A union gives workers the ability to act together to       advocate for safe working conditions, to improve their wages       and benefits, and to protect their workplace rights through       collective bargaining and concerted activity. For registered       nurses, union advocacy and representation allow us to focus       on what we do best: caring for our patients. Across the       country, nurses have been subject to intimidation and       retaliation from their employers because of their efforts to       unionize. The PRO Act would provide critical protections for       nurses who want to organize collectively.        The dire need for this legislation has been made all the       more clear during this pandemic as nurses have been forced to       struggle  [[Page H1144]]       together for the most basic safety protections at their       hospitals and clinics. The formation of a union in the       hospital not only offers protections to nurses and other       health care workers, but just as importantly, it leads to       health and safety protections that improve patient care. For       example, union organizing has led to improvements in       infectious disease protocols, staffing levels, workplace       violence prevention programs, and safe patient handling       programs, all of which directly improve patient care.        Attacks on unions and the right to unionize have hurt       efforts to protect patient care in the hospital, and to       improve the lives of working families outside the hospital.       While the latest Gallup poll shows support for unions at its       highest point since 2003, with 65% of Americans approving of       labor unions, these attacks on unions and the right to       organize have continued unabated. The PRO Act would provide       the legislative reform needed to protect American workers.        The PRO Act would have a direct impact on registered nurses       and all other workers by making the following improvements to       current labor law:        Prevent employers from interfering in union elections,       including prohibiting employers from holding captive audience       meetings;        Facilitate first contracts by requiring mediation and       arbitration to settle disputes;        Strengthen support for workers who suffer retaliation and       require the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) to       immediately seek an injunction to reinstate employees while       their cases are pending;        Prevent employers from forcing employees to waive their       right to collective or class-action litigation;        Close loopholes in the federal labor law that allows       employers to deny pay, benefits, or workers' rights to       employees;        Put an end to the misclassification of employees as       supervisors or independent contractors;        Enhance the right to support boycotts, strikes, and other       acts of solidarity.        This legislation is of high priority for registered nurses       across the country, and we hope you will join with us in       supporting it by voting yes. If you have any questions,       please do not hesitate to contact our Lead Legislative       Advocate.            Sincerely,      Bonnie Castillo, RN,        Executive Director, National Nurses United.      Deborah Burger, RN,        President, National Nurses United.      Zenei Cortez, RN,        President, National Nurses United.      Jean Ross, RN,        President, National Nurses United.
