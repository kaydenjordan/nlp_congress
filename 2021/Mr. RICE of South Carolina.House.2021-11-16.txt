 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor  former South Carolina State Senator Hugh Leatherman. Senator Leatherman  represented Florence, and I was proud to join him in many opportunities  to serve our constituents in the Pee Dee.   Senator Leatherman passed away recently at age 90, while still  holding office. He worked on behalf of South Carolinians nearly half  his life, right up until his passing. And I have been told he even took  next year's budget briefing from his hospital bed, exemplifying his  true dedication to our State.   Senator Leatherman didn't hesitate to work across the aisle to get  things done for the Seventh District and all South Carolinians. I have  always known him to pursue smart, reasonable solutions and work hard to  fix problems.   Senator Leatherman was the epitome of a public servant. He will be  dearly missed in the halls of the South Carolina State House, and we  will remember him as an accomplished and honorable man.   Rest in peace, Mr. Chairman.                            ____________________
