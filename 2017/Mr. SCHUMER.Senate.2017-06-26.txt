 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, this week, the eyes of the American  people should be and are on the Senate. The Republican majority  endeavors to pass a massive remake of our Nation's healthcare system  with the votes of only one party and the ideas of only one wing of one  party in just 4 short days.   The Republican majority kept their healthcare bill shrouded in  darkness for as long as possible, only dragging it into the light last  Thursday morning after it was forced to because there was so much  outcry over the secrecy. That was only a week before it was set for a  vote. There are still no hearings and no opportunity for a robust  discussion of amendments. Just a few hours ago, they released a revised  version, which, at the moment, is what we will apparently consider on  the floor.   There is a reason my Republican colleagues labored in secret. There  is a reason they forsook the committee process and regular order and  open debate. There is a reason they want to jam this bill through in  just 1 week. They are ashamed of their bill. Now that we have seen it,  we finally know why.   The Republican healthcare bill--this new TrumpCare--unwinds the  healthcare protections and programs that are designed to help the  Americans who need it the most in order to give a tax break to the  Americans who need it the least.   The bill would gut Medicaid, making it harder for families with a  loved one in a nursing home or for families with a disabled child to  afford his care, so that they can give a massive tax cut to the  wealthy.   This bill would defund Planned Parenthood, making it harder for  millions of women to obtain care, so that they can give people who make  over $1 million a $57,000 tax cut, on average.   The bill would slash tax credits, which help families afford health  insurance, in order to give a nearly $1 trillion tax cut to the  wealthiest Americans.   The bill would also punish any Americans who experience a gap in  coverage, locking them out of health insurance for 6 months. Every  year, tens of millions of Americans have a gap in coverage through no  fault of their own. Some lose their jobs, and others have temporary  financial problems. It is inhumane to say to those Americans: You now  have to wait an additional 6 months without insurance.   Imagine someone who is struggling with cancer, and he has a lapse in  coverage. The 6-month wait this Republican penalty imposes could well  become a death sentence.   That is why Republicans are ashamed of this bill--it carries a  staggering human cost. You do not have to take my word for it; the  bipartisan National Association of Medicaid Directors came out today in  opposition to the bill, saying it would ``divert critical resources  away from what we know is working today,'' particularly for opioid  treatment.   Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that their statement be  printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:    [From the National Association of Medicaid Directors, June 26, 2017]  Consensus Statement From the National Association of Medicaid Directors  (NAMD) Board of Directors on the Better Care Reconciliation Act of 2017         Washington, DC.--The following statement represents the       unanimous views of the National Association of Medicaid       Directors (NAMD) Board of Directors. NAMD is a bipartisan,       nonprofit, professional organization representing leaders of       state Medicaid agencies across the country.        Medicaid is a successful, efficient, and cost-effective       federal-state partnership. It has a record of innovation and       improvement of outcomes for the nation's most vulnerable       citizens.        Medicaid plays a prominent role in the provision of long-      term services and supports for the nation's elderly and       disabled populations, as well as behavioral health services,       including comprehensive and effective treatment for       individuals struggling with opioid dependency.        Medicaid is complex and therefore demands thoughtful and       deliberate discussion about how to improve it.        Medicaid Directors have long advocated for meaningful       reform of the program. States continue to innovate with the       tools they have, but federal changes are necessary to improve       effectiveness and efficiency of the program. However, these       changes must be made thoughtfully and deliberately to ensure       the continued provision of quality, cost-effective care.        Medicaid Directors have asked for, and are appreciative of,       improved working relationships with HHS and are working hard       to streamline and improve the administration of the program.       The Senate bill does formalize several critical       administrative and regulatory improvements, such as giving       Medicaid Directors a seat at the table in the development of       regulations that impact how the program is run, and the       pathway to permanency for certain waiver programs. However,       no amount of administrative or regulatory flexibility can       compensate for the federal spending reductions that would       occur as a result of this bill.        Changes in the federal responsibility for financing the       program must be accompanied by clearly articulated statutory       changes to Medicaid to enable states to operate effectively       under a cap. The Senate bill does not accomplish that. It       would be a transfer of risk, responsibility, and cost to the       states of historic proportions.        While NAMD does not have consensus on the mandatory       conversion of Medicaid financing to a per capita cap or block       grant, the per capita cap growth rates for Medicaid in the       Senate bill are insufficient and unworkable.        Medicaid--or other forms of comprehensive, accessible and       affordable health coverage--in coordination with public       health and law enforcement entities, is the most       comprehensive and effective way address the opioid epidemic       in this country. Earmarking funding for grants for the       exclusive purpose of treating addiction, in the absence of       preventative medical and behavioral health coverage, is       likely to be ineffective in solving the problem and would       divert critical resources away from what we know is working       today.        Medicaid Directors recommend prioritizing the stabilization       of marketplace coverage. Medicaid reform should be undertaken       when it can be accomplished thoughtfully and deliberately.     Madam President, the nonpartisan American Medical  Association--a conservative organization--came out today in opposition  to the bill, saying it ``will expose low and middle income patients to  higher costs and greater difficulty in affording care.''   I ask unanimous consent that their letter be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                   American Medical Association,                                         Chicago, IL, June 26, 2017.      Hon. Mitch McConnell,      Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Charles Schumer,      Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.        Dear Majority Leader McConnell and Leader Schumer: On       behalf of the physician and medical student members of the       American Medical Association (AMA), I am writing to express       our opposition to the discussion draft of the ``Better Care       Reconciliation Act'' released on June 22, 2017. Medicine has       long operated under the precept of Primum non nocere, or       ``first, do no harm.'' The draft legislation violates that       standard on many levels.        In our January 3, 2017 letter to you, and in subsequent       communications, we have consistently urged that the Senate,       in developing proposals to replace portions of the current       law, pay special attention to ensure that individuals       currently covered do not lose access to affordable, quality       health insurance coverage. In addition, we have advocated for       the sufficient funding of Medicaid and other safety net       programs and urged steps to promote stability in the       individual market.  [[Page S3745]]         Though we await additional analysis of the proposal, it       seems highly likely that a combination of smaller subsidies       resulting from lower benchmarks and the increased likelihood       of waivers of important protections such as required       benefits, actuarial value standards, and out of pocket       spending limits will expose low and middle income patients to       higher costs and greater difficulty in affording care.        The AMA is particularly concerned with proposals to convert       the Medicaid program into a system that limits the federal       obligation to care for needy patients to a predetermined       formula based on per-capita-caps. At the recently concluded       Annual Meeting of the AMA House of Delegates, representatives       of more than 190 state and national specialty medical       associations spoke strongly in opposition to such proposals.       Per-capita-caps fail to take into account unanticipated costs       of new medical innovations or the fiscal impact of public       health epidemics, such as the crisis of opioid abuse       currently ravaging our nation. The Senate proposal to       artificially limit the growth of Medicaid expenditures below       even the rate of medical inflation threatens to limit states'       ability to address the health care needs of their most       vulnerable citizens. It would be a serious mistake to lock       into place another arbitrary and unsustainable formula that       will be extremely difficult and costly to fix.        We are also concerned with other provisions of the       legislation beyond those directly affecting insurance       coverage. The Affordable Care Act's Prevention and Public       Health Fund was, according to the Department of Health and       Human Services, established to ``provide expanded and       sustained national investments in prevention and public       health, to improve health outcomes, and to enhance health       care quality.'' These activities are key to controlling       health care costs and the elimination of support for them       runs counter to the goal of improving the health care system.       We also continue to oppose Congressionally-mandated       restrictions on where lower income women (and men) may       receive otherwise covered health care services--in this case       the prohibition on individuals using their Medicaid coverage       at clinics operated by Planned Parenthood. These provisions       violate longstanding AMA policy on patients' freedom to       choose their providers and physicians' freedom to practice in       the setting of their choice.        We do appreciate the inclusion of several provisions       designed to bring short term stability to the individual       market, including the extension of cost sharing reductions       payments. We urge, however, that these provisions serve as       the basis of Senate efforts to improve the ACA and ensure       that quality, affordable health insurance coverage is within       reach of all Americans.        We sincerely hope that the Senate will take this       opportunity to change the course of the current debate and       work to fix problems with the current system. We believe that       Congress should be working to increase the number of       Americans with access to quality, affordable health insurance       instead of pursuing policies that have the opposite effect,       and we renew our commitment to work with you in that       endeavor.            Sincerely,                                               James L. Madara, MD.     Madam President, even several Republican Senators are  expressing concerns.   Republican Senator Heller said: ``The bill doesn't protect the most  vulnerable Nevadans--the elderly, Nevadans struggling with mental  health issues, substance abuse, and people with disabilities.''   He continued: ``The goal of healthcare reform should be to lower  costs here in Nevada, and I'm not confident--not confident--it will  achieve that goal.''   Republican Senator Susan Collins said about the bill: ``I'm very  concerned about the cost of insurance for older people with serious  chronic illnesses, and the impact of the Medicaid cuts on our state  governments, the most vulnerable people in our society, and health care  providers such as our rural hospitals and nursing homes.''   Even my friend the junior Republican Senator from Texas said that  under this bill, ``premiums would continue to rise.''   My Republican friends are right to have these concerns. The bill will  not lower costs for working families. It will leave the most vulnerable  Americans out in the cold, devastate rural areas, and set us even  further back in combating the opioid epidemic.   This week, the Senate will witness a political exercise in that the  majority leader will attempt to coerce the votes of these Senators and  any other holdouts by adjusting the dials on the legislation a bit.  There will be buyouts and bailouts and small tweaks that will be hailed  as ``fixes'' by the other side.   The truth is that the Republicans cannot excise the rotten core at  the center of their healthcare bill. No matter what tweaks they add, no  matter how the bill changes around the edges, it is fundamentally  flawed at the center. No matter what last-minute amendments are  offered, this bill will force millions of Americans to spend more of  their paychecks on healthcare in order to receive fewer benefits simply  so that the wealthiest Americans can pay less in taxes. That is why our  Republican colleagues are ashamed of this bill and are rushing it  through in 4 short days.   Before we vote on the motion to proceed, I would ask my Republican  friends to do one simple thing: Reflect on how this bill would impact  your constituents. We are all sent here to serve the people of our  States--to do right by them, to ease their burdens where possible and  make sure our laws reflect a country that gives everyone an equal  opportunity to succeed. The first rule of medicine is ``do no harm.''  So it should be with government. So it should be with this healthcare  bill.    But this bill will harm the middle-class family with a parent in a  nursing home. It will harm the father whose son is struggling with  opioid addiction and who is having trouble finding the money to put him  through treatment. It will harm the child born with a preexisting  condition, who may hit the lifetime cap on healthcare coverage before  he or she even enters kindergarten.   As the American Medical Association said today, this bill violates  the ``do no harm'' standard on many levels. I believe my friends and  colleagues on the other side of the aisle are men and women of good  conscience. I would ask that they think with their conscience before  they vote on the motion to proceed on Wednesday.   Any bill that does this much harm to the American people ought to  receive a ``no'' vote.    Mr. President, I just want to salute, on behalf of all  of us in the Senate, our great, great Senator from Hawaii. Her courage,  her strength, her conviction to help people who need help is just  inspiring--that is the only word I could think of, ``inspiring''--to  every one of us.   We love you, Mazie. We wish you well, and we can't wait for you to  come back and rejoin the fight doubly invigorated.   I yield the floor.
