 Mr. Speaker, sadly, I rise today to honor a fallen U.S.  marine from my district in northern California.   Staff Sergeant Joshua Braica from Auburn, California, tragically died  on Sunday, April 14, when his vehicle rolled over during a training  accident at Camp Pendleton in California.   We, like many in Placer County in northern California, are mourning  the loss of one of our own, one of our best and brightest.   Joshua had been in the Marine Corps for more than 8 years, deploying  twice and serving as a critical skills operator with the 1st Raider  Battalion.   By all accounts, Joshua was an all-American guy who was greatly  admired by his friends, neighbors, and his fellow Marines.   At such a young age, he is a decorated and highly trained soldier,  with many awards and many medals to his name.   He is the oldest of five siblings and is survived by his wife and his  son.   I am praying for all of them, and I hope that all Members will join  me in doing so as well at this difficult time.   One thing is for sure: Joshua has certainly made his community and  his country proud.   God bless Joshua and his family again at this time of need and  tragedy.                            ____________________
