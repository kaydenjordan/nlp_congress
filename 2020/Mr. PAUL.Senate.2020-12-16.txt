 Madam President, reserving the right to object, I agree  that members of the judicial branch need better protection. In fact, I  have been active in this issue for the last couple of years, and each  time this has come forward, at the end of the year, with very little  time to do the normal process, I have advocated that an amendment be  added that would include protection of Members of Congress. I really  think that it is important that we protect addresses for our judges,  but it is also important that we do this for our elected officials.   In recent years, what has happened has taught us that the legislative  branch needs better protection as well. That was clear in 2011, when  Congresswoman Gabby Giffords was tragically shot while doing the most  important part of the job--meeting with constituents.   Words cannot express how happy and inspiring it was to see  Congresswoman Giffords here in the Chamber as her husband, Senator  Kelly, was recently sworn in as a Member of the body. But words also  cannot express the pain felt by the family of the people who were  killed and wounded that day. That should have been a wakeup call to  better protect Members of Congress and, in doing so, better protect the  people around them.   But just a few years later, a shooter nearly killed Congressman    Steve Scalise during baseball practice for the annual charity baseball  game. I was there, and I said at the time that our lives were saved by  the Capitol Hill police. Had they not been there, things might have  gone much worse.   But the Capitol Hill police are not stationed at our homes where our  families live while we serve in Washington. Extending the provision of  this bill to the Members of Congress would better protect all of us-- our families, our neighbors, and our constituents.   It is a very minor request that I am asking. It is an amendment that  would not change anything or lessen anything about the bill. It is a  very reasonable request, and I don't understand exactly why we can't  make this bill better by applying it to both judges and Members of  Congress.   My substitute amendment, which I will offer for unanimous consent,  will make simple changes to the legislation. It would extend the same  protections it would offer to the judicial branch to the legislative  branch.   Second, the laudable goal of this legislation is to protect  personally identifiable information from being sold and posted online  by data brokers. Allowing at-risk individuals to file private action  against data brokers for declaratory and injunctive relief, plus  reasonable attorney's fees, will achieve that goal.   I ask the Senator to modify his request to, instead, include my  substitute amendment at the desk, and that my substitute amendment be  considered and agreed to; the bill, as amended, be considered read a  third time and passed and that the motions to reconsider be considered  made and laid upon the table.    Reserving the right to object, I would like to offer across  the aisle that we are willing to compromise with the Senator from New  Jersey. We are willing to work with him on getting the bill passed. The  only thing that we would like to do is to have it include Congress, as  well.   The other points you had mentioned that you object to, as far as  changing, I would be willing to discuss. I think there would be a  middle ground.   I think this could be passed. When we pass something unanimously,  there has to be a little give and take. No one gets their way. I am not  saying that you can't have it. I am for your bill in general.   I think it ought to be expanded to Congress. We had at least two  people shot. Gabby Giffords was shot. We had   Steve Scalise shot. We  had other threats. Congress is threatened and families are frightened.   I don't know about you, but, routinely, the sheriff and police have  to come to our house for threats to my house. I am not alone. This  happens to other people. There is no reason why we should do this only  for one branch of government. They put the satellite picture of my  House on the nightly news, basically pointing out where every crazy  person in the world can go to find my house.   We do need to do something. This isn't a new request. I requested  this a year ago when a very similar bill came up a year ago for special  protections for the judiciary. I said, once again: Good idea, we should  apply it to Congress.   We go forward a whole year, and now we are doing the same thing  again, and nobody seems to be listening.   I will tell you that I am willing to compromise on this and willing  to work with you to pass it, but I think we should extend it. It is not  that hard. If we extend it to Congress and flip it back, then, I think  it would pass unanimously in the House, as well. But I object to this  version.    Mr. President, today I recognize the tremendous  dedication of Jeremy Wayne Harrell, of Louisville, KY, the founder of  an all-volunteer organization called the Veterans Club. Already  nationally celebrated for its Equine Therapy Program and for efforts to  create a recovery center for homeless veterans, this unique Kentucky  nonprofit has made veteran isolation its singular focus during the  coronavirus pandemic. A veteran himself, Mr. Harrell recognizes that  social isolation created by the pandemic can amplify the sense of  loneliness already experienced by many veterans as they transition into  civilian life following multiple deployments. Mr. Harrell was recently  honored by Metro Louisville government with its Distinguished Veteran  and Citizen Award and by Humana as the winner of its Boots on the  Ground Campaign Award. I am proud to represent veterans like Jeremy  Harrell in the U.S. Senate and in particular to recognize him today for  his steadfast commitment to our veterans and their families. The great  work of the Veterans Club is an inspiration to us all to find and  connect with those in our communities who struggle with a sense of  isolation.                            ____________________
