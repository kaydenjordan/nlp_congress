 Madam President, I rise today in celebration of  the George Washington University's bicentennial. As a proud alumna of  this great institution of higher education, I would like to recognize  the GW's achievement in reaching this historic milestone.   Founded as a modest Columbian College 200 years ago, there was no  guarantee that the George Washington University would succeed.  Ultimately, it was the dedication, ingenuity, and hard work of many  generations of world-class faculty, impressive students, and  accomplished alumni over the past two centuries that accounts for why  GW evolved into the preeminent, global research university it is today.   Aspiring citizen-leaders worldwide attend the George Washington  University precisely because of the opportunities GW provides its  students to not only learn inside the classroom from leading thinkers  and researchers, but to grow by applying this academic knowledge  outside the classroom in a wide-range of settings throughout our  Nation's Capital.   In fact, the George Washington University's vast network of world- class academic opportunities, partnerships, and policy-research  initiatives is not only responsible for educating our future leaders,  but also for advancing technological innovation, driving improvements  in public health and policy, and developing a greater understanding of  both our world and humanity in ways that have made an impact on  millions of lives.   At this moment, GW faculty are conducting pioneering research to  fight global poverty, HIV/AIDS, cancer, climate change, terrorism and  many other urgent challenges. Many of GW's researchers, doctors, and  public health officials have been at the forefront in responding to the  deadly Coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.   As the George Washington University celebrates its bicentennial, it  is a good time to reflect on the incredible legacy established by  thousands of distinguished GW alumni. Graduates include current and  former heads of state from around the world, scores of dedicated public  servants, and leading experts that have accumulated a vast record of  accomplishments across many academic fields.   Last, but certainly not least, and a point of great personal  appreciation for this GW alum, is GW's longstanding commitment to U.S.  servicemembers, veterans, and military families. Indeed, the very first  recipient of the original Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944--more  commonly known as the GI Bill of Rights--was Donald Balfour, a GW  student. Today, GW is consistently recognized as one of our Nation's  best institutions of higher education for veterans and military- affiliated students because it recognizes the invaluable leadership  experience and unique perspectives these men and women bring to the  classroom.   As GW enters its third century, I look forward to watching as the  George Washington University builds on its 200-year legacy of academic  excellence and ground-breaking research by attracting, educating, and  inspiring future generations of leaders who will make a positive impact  on the world.                            ____________________
