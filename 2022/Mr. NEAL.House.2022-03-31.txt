 Madam Speaker, Americans pay too much for insulin. With the  price hovering at three times what it was 15 years ago, this vital  medication is not just expensive, it can be completely out of reach.   Every day, the more than 37 million Americans living with diabetes  must choose between the insulin they need to stay alive and other basic  necessities. Just last week, I heard about this issue from a couple who  live in my district. Both people have diabetes, but one is forgoing  insulin for the time being due to cost. Last year alone, their  prescription costs topped $10,000.   This outrageous expense is unacceptable, particularly since Americans  pay far more for insulin than patients in similar countries. In some  cases, American patients pay as much as 10 times the price of their  counterparts in other nations.   Today's legislation finally rights this wrong. Capping the cost of  insulin at $35 per month will put the medicine within reach for  millions of Americans. And we do this responsibly, by delaying the  prior administration's Rebate Rule. Bringing down the cost of insulin  will also help to close health inequities that skyrocketing drug costs  exacerbated.   This is an important and welcome step in lowering the cost of  prescription drugs in this country. More must be done, and that's why  in the Build Back Better Act, we empowered the Secretary to negotiate  prescription drug prices for Medicare, capped Medicare Part D out-of- pocket costs, and required drug companies to pay a rebate if their  prices outpace inflation. We will not stop until these commonsense  reforms are signed into law.   I applaud Ways and Means member, Congressman Dan Kildee, for his work  in bringing this legislation to the floor, and I urge all of my  colleagues to support the Affordable Insulin Now Act.
