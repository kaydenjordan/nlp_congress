 Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 1425, which  should be called the expanding government and killing cures act.   With this legislation, my colleagues across the aisle are bending  American healthcare to the will of Washington bureaucrats.   Any way you look at this, House Democrats took a bipartisan issue,  improving healthcare and lowering prices, and botched it. We are now  left with bad policy that will stifle innovation for new treatments and  therapeutics and do what government does worst: pick winners and losers  in the private sector.   This absolutely will not fix ObamaCare's failed policies. This bill  gives billions in taxpayer-funded bailouts and subsidies, while doing  nothing to streamline services, lower costs, or cut taxes.   Today, House Democrats are wasting everyone's time pushing a bill  with price controls, punitive taxes, blank checks, bailouts, and more  red tape and bureaucracy.   I want a bill that protects preexisting conditions, lowers drug  pricing, incentivizes innovation, fixes our healthcare system, cuts  taxes, and actually lets you keep your own doctor--but this is not it.   For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to oppose this legislation so  we can get to work and actually pass a bill that improves the lives of  our citizens.  [[Page H2629]]
