 Mr. Speaker, for days the media has saturated the  news with stories savaging President Trump for his immigration  executive orders.   The President wants to protect Americans by temporarily halting the  admission of refugees from seven countries considered security threats  to the United States.   Despite the media's heavily biased coverage, the American people  still agree with the President. A USA Today poll found that 53 percent  support ``registering immigrants from Muslim-majority countries.'' Only  41 percent oppose it.   Even the poll was slanted against the President. The question asked  implied that all Muslim-majority countries were affected, which is not  true. It also used the word ``register,'' which has negative  connotations and besides is not accurate.   A more factual question that inquired about stricter vetting of  refugees from the seven countries that pose security risks likely would  have garnered even more support for the President's executive actions.   The media did everything they could to turn the public against the  President, but it didn't work. The American people are smarter than the  media thinks.                            ____________________
