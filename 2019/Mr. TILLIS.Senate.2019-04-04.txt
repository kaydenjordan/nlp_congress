 Thank you, Madam President.   Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to waive the mandatory  quorum call.    Thank you, Madam President.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I want to speak briefly about a historic  day, April 4. It was the day the agreement in Washington was signed to  create the NATO alliance after the Second World War.   I want to start by repeating what President Truman said on that day.  He said:         We hope to create a shield against aggression and the fear       of aggression--all bulwark which will permit us to get on       with the real business of government and society, the       business of achieving a fuller and happier life for all of       our citizens.    That agreement was signed on April 4, 1949. Since the 70 years that  have followed, the alliance has gotten stronger. The alliance has  grown. In fact, there are a number of countries that hope someday to  also be a member of the NATO alliance. It has been important and what I  believe is the most important alliance in the history of mankind.   This week is NATO Week. Yesterday we had the Secretary General speak  to us before a joint session of Congress. The Secretary General was  actually very optimistic about the future of NATO, and I am as well.   I was with a group a couple of weeks ago who were wondering about  NATO and some of the discussions or disagreements we have among our  NATO allies. I liken it to the kind of disagreements I have with  family. I grew up in a family of six kids. It is a big family. All of  us have very different views, are of very different ages and life  experiences. I really believe the disagreements we have among our  allies are like the disagreements you have among your family members,  but at the end of the day, make no mistake about it, an attack on any  one of us is viewed as an attack on every one of us, and every country  takes that seriously.  [[Page S2256]]    In fact, in the 70 years since NATO was created--there is an  obligation within article 5 of the agreement that if there is an attack  on any one of us, then we consider it an attack on every one of us. It  happened on 9/11. The only time in the history of the alliance that the  article 5 obligation under the treaty has been exercised is when NATO  countries joined with the United States in the War on Terror.   Many people may not realize it, but there was a huge human toll for  living up to their commitment. Many nations sent their men and women  into harm's way, and over 1,000 of them have died since 9/11. Many  others have been gravely wounded, but they lived up to their  commitment. It was the first test of the treaty. That happened only  less than 20 years ago.   Senator Shaheen and I are now cochairs of the Senate NATO Observer  Group. I want to compliment Senator Shaheen for actually coming up with  the idea to reconstitute the group because we need to make sure our  partners, our allies, understand that Congress believes NATO is a very  important alliance to ensure our mutual safety and security.   There was another interesting point that the Secretary General made  in his speech yesterday before Congress. Some people have criticized  President Trump for telling our partners that they need to pay their  agreed-to fair share. The Secretary General said the President's call  has actually been answered and that it was a positive step that he took  to make these other nations recognize we must invest in our mutual  defense and our mutual security. That can only come through innovating  technologies that will defend the regions within the NATO alliance,  making sure our troops are working together and working very well on a  military-to-military basis, and we are doing that, but without that  sustained commitment from our NATO allies, we could lose ground, and it  is in their best interest to do it.   As I said earlier, NATO is growing. We have a long list of countries  that hope they can meet the requirements to someday come into NATO.  Many of them were within the sphere of influence for the Soviet Union  before the end of the Cold War.   We all know Russia is the greatest threat to Europe. We all know  Russia has done things that are illegal, according to international  law. They have annexed the Crimean region of the Ukraine. Every week,  Ukrainians are dying in a war that very few people know about. We have  to make sure that we actually confront Russian aggression, and the best  way to do that is to have a strong NATO alliance.   On this historic day, April 4, 70 years later, I believe the alliance  is strong. I believe that is what the Secretary General talked about  yesterday, and I believe every Member of Congress shares the view that  the NATO treaty, the NATO alliance, is the most important bulwark  against aggression and threats to freedom.   I look forward to continuing to serve with Co-Chair Shaheen to make  sure our partners know this Congress is prepared to support them and to  make sure the alliance grows and remains strong.   Thank you.
