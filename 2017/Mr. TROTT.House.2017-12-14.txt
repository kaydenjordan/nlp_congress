 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Hensarling), the chairman of the Financial Services Committee, for  yielding me time and for bringing this bill to the floor.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2396, the Privacy Notification  Technical Clarification Act.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend, Mr. Clay, for his leadership on  this bill. It has been a pleasure to work across the aisle on this  commonsense measure with someone for whom I have such great respect.   This bill makes a simple technical correction to Federal law. Under  the legislation, financial institutions are no longer required to mail  duplicative and confusing privacy notifications every year when no  changes have been made to the policy. Privacy information must be made  available on the company website, and financial institutions must send  paper copies to consumers upon request.   Under this legislation, companies are required to provide a toll-free  number so customers can request the policy at any time.   Additionally, consumers will be reminded of their right to opt out of  information-sharing when they receive their bills. If you are like me,  you throw away these documents. They are confusing, dense, and full of  fine-print legalese. I can never tell if anything has changed, and I am  a lawyer.   This legislation will ensure that consumers are alerted of changes  and will no longer be inundated with junk mail.   This measure will also help companies provide better service to their  customers. Some companies spend over $2 million annually on these  mailings--money that could be put to better use making more car loans  or perhaps even lowering the cost of their product.    During a recent hearing on this bill, a community banker told us  about a similar provision that had passed for banks last year. He spoke  about how positive it had been for his community and his customers. He  took the money he would have spent on postage and paper and gave it  back to the community in the form of more loans. This, in turn, helped  people start new businesses, create more jobs, and even resulted in a  few mortgages being made to purchase new homes.   I believe every Member should support getting rid of outdated,  unnecessary regulations. This bill will allow those who lend money when  we buy a new car to realize the same savings and efficiencies as banks.  Not only will this legislation reduce unnecessary costs, it will  improve transparency and accountability, and ensure individuals better  understand when a company has actually changed its privacy policy.   A few minutes ago, the ranking member spoke in opposition to this  bill. I am not sure what bill she read, but it was not H.R. 2396. The  bill in no way puts consumers' privacy information at risk. It in no  way denies consumers important privacy protections. It in no way has  anything to do with Equifax. It has nothing to do with Wells Fargo. It  has nothing to do with servicemembers having their cars improperly  repossessed. It has nothing to do with consumer profiling. It has  nothing to do with fraud. And--she didn't bring it up--it has nothing  to do with the President's tax returns.   This bill should have been on the suspension calendar. There are only  two groups that can oppose this bill: the United States Postal Service,  because it is going to mean less business for them; and, as the  chairman mentioned, paper mills.   The ranking member did, in fact, offer an amendment. The amendment  was so convoluted that if I was a bank, a financial institution, or a  car lender, I would prefer to do the mailings, because the amendment,  at the end of the day, was really just a haven for class action lawyers  to file frivolous lawsuits when someone didn't put something on their  website exactly as outlined in the amendment.   This is a pro-consumer piece of legislation. I have letters from the  American Financial Services Association, the National Bankers  Association, the American Bankers Association, the Consumer Bankers  Association, and the National Association of Minority Automobile  Dealers. I also have a letter signed by the Ford Motor Credit Company,  General Motors Financial Company, Nissan Motor Acceptance Corporation,  Toyota Financial Services, and VW Credit in support of H.R. 2396.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record these letters.                                                 American Financial                                            Services Association,                                     Washington, DC, April 20, 2017.      Hon. Dave Trott,      Washington, DC.        Dear Rep. Trott: The American Financial Services       Association (AFSA) supports the ``Privacy Notification       Technical Clarification Act,'' which amends the Gramm-Leach-      Bliley Act (GLBA) to update the exception for certain annual       notices provided by financial institutions.        The GLBA requires financial institutions (FIs) to issue       privacy notices to consumers if the FIs share consumers' non-      public personal information with affiliates or third parties.  [[Page H9908]]       Such disclosures are required to occur when a relationship is       first established between the FI and the consumer, as well as       annually in written form as long as the relationship       continues, even if no changes to the disclosure policies have       occurred.        Annual privacy notices without policy changes are       redundant, unnecessary, and confusing. They contain several       pages of small-print legalese, which have little value for       consumers. In fact, they are largely discarded--unread--      immediately upon receipt. However, producing and mailing       these notices costs millions of dollars.        In the fall of 2014, the CFPB finalized a rule allowing FIs       to post their annual privacy notices online instead of       delivering them individually if they meet a series of       conditions, including not sharing the consumers' nonpublic       personal information with unaffiliated third parties. In       December 2015, Congress went further by enacting an outright       exemption from the mailing requirement for FIs that: (1) do       not share non-public personal information about consumers to       unaffiliated third parties, and (2) have not changed its       disclosure policies and practices since the most recent       disclosure was sent to consumers.        Unfortunately, certain FIs cannot take advantage of the       exemption. We ask Congress to pass the Privacy Notification       Technical Clarification Act to level the playing field for       all FIs. If a financial institution's privacy policy has not       materially changed, the institution should be permitted to       satisfy the intent of GLBA by delivering its privacy notice       through an electronic medium, or by mail upon request.            Sincerely,                                                      Bill Himpler,      Executive Vice President.                                   ____                                     National Bankers Association,                                  Washington, DC, December 12, 2017.      Hon. William Lacy Clay,      Washington, DC.      Hon. David Trott,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representatives Clay and Trott: On behalf of the       National Bankers Association (NBA), I write to express our       member banks' support for H.R. 2396, the Privacy Notification       Technical Corrections Act. The NBA is the nation's leading       trade organization for the country's minority and women-owned       depository institutions. We write in support of H.R. 2396       because our member banks believe updating the delivery of       privacy notices should be modernize and reflective of the       technological choices available to institutions and       customers. As you are aware, the CFPB and Congress have made       changes to the privacy notification process in 2014 and 2015.       These changes excluded specific financial institutions and we       believe a simple method for alternative delivery for these       companies is warranted.        Producing and mailing privacy notices costs millions of       dollars. Eliminating the requirement would reduce the cost of       delivering financial services, save paper and discontinue       this annual nuisance. At the same time, it would also make       the mailings more significant to the consumer because they       would only come after a change in policy. The primary       function of the annual notice is to remind consumers of their       right to opt out of information-sharing for marketing       purposes, but it is not obvious that mailing a paper       disclosure is the most effective or reliable medium for       accomplishing this objective.        H.R. 2396 is a sensible and balanced approach that enjoys       broad bipartisan support, that we believe addresses concerns       shared by our bankers regarding the need for modernization in       the delivery of privacy notifications. We commend you for       your leadership on this important issue, and we would urge       your colleagues to support this legislation.            Respectfully,                                                  Michael A. Grant,      President, National Bankers Association.                                   ____         H.R. 2396, the Privacy Notification Technical Clarification       Act, a bipartisan bill introduced by Rep. David Trott (MI)       and Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit Subcommittee       Ranking Member William Lacy Clay Jr. (MO) and the substitute       language, would simplify the notice requirements for       financial institutions that have not changed their privacy       policies. In addition to the relief provided by the FAST Act       for financial institutions that only share information within       the statutory exceptions, it would create a simple disclosure       mechanism using the Internet for financial institutions that       have not changed their privacy practices. The ABA supports       H.R. 2396.        H.R. 2706, the Financial Institution Customer Protection       Act. This legislation, as introduced by House Financial       Institutions and Consumer Credit Subcommittee Chairman Blaine       Luetkemeyer would dictate that federal banking agencies could       not request nor order a financial institution to terminate a       banking relationship unless the regulator has material       reason. The legislation further states that account       termination requests or orders would be required to be made       in writing and rely on information other than reputational       risk. We thank Chairman Luetkemeyer for his attention to this       issue as he well knows that banks are in the business of       providing financial services for law-abiding customers, and       they share a common goal with law enforcement of maintaining       the integrity of the payments system. If there is reasonable       concern regarding a customer, it works best when banks work       together with our regulatory agencies and law enforcement.       This legislation supports that concept. The ABA supports H.R.       2706.        H.R. 2954, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Adjustment Act.       This legislation, as introduced by Rep. Tom Emmer (MN), would       provide community banks with relief from compliance burdens       that are ill-suited and unnecessary for community banks.        Specifically, the bill exempts small banks and credit       unions from new reporting requirements of the Home Mortgage       Disclosure Act (HMDA) if they are lenders that have       originated 1,000 or fewer closed-end mortgages in each of the       two preceding calendar years or are lenders that have       originated 2,000 or fewer open-end lines of credit (such as a       typical home equity loan) in each of the two preceding       calendar years. Additionally, the bill repeals the HMDA       amendments included in the Dodd-Frank Act and withdraws the       CFPB's rule to impose the new and modified HMDA data points       scheduled to take effect in January of next year.        The pending HMDA changes were imposed after the financial       crisis. Although well-intentioned, the new reporting       requirements were overly broad in their coverage and have the       potential to add significant cost and regulatory burden, as       well as privacy concerns for customers, to small institutions       which have an excellent track record of fairly and honestly       serving their customers' needs.        So great is the cost of compliance with these new       regulations that many smaller banks may be forced to       reconsider their ability to continue to make mortgage and       other covered loans. H.R. 2954 provides needed relief to keep       more lending options available in the markets that these       banks serve. The ABA supports H.R. 2954.                                   ____     H.R. 3299, the ``Protecting Consumers' Access to Credit Act of 2017''         The decision by the Second Circuit Court in the Madden v.       Midland Funding, LLC case undermined a long-standing legal       principle, the ``valid-when-made'' doctrine, which       establishes that if a loan is valid when it is made with       respect to its interest rate then it cannot become invalid or       unenforceable when assigned to another party. CBA strongly       supports H.R. 3329 that solidifies the ``valid-when-made''       doctrine, which has been a cornerstone of U.S. banking law       for over 100 years and prevent uncertainty for financial       institutions.      H.R. 2706, the ``Financial Institution Customer Protection Act of                                   2017''         CBA strongly supports H.R. 2706, the ``Financial       Institution Customer Protection Act,'' that would require       federal banking regulatory agencies to establish requirements       for the termination of bank accounts and prohibit federal       banking regulators from formally or informally suggesting,       requesting, or ordering a depository institution to terminate       a customer account except in circumstances affecting the       security of our country or specific illegal activity.     H.R. 2396, the ``Privacy Notification Technical Clarification Act''         CBA supports H.R. 2396, the Privacy Notification Technical       Correction Act, to reduce unnecessary paperwork by       streamlining the reporting of bank privacy policies.       Specifically, H.R. 2396 would relieve a bank of its annual       privacy policy notice requirement if it has not changed its       policies and practices, makes its current policy publically       available, notifies customers of the availability of the       notice on periodic billing statements or electronically, and       posts all notices if it maintains more than one policy.                                  Conclusion         CBA stands ready to work with Congress to ensure a sound       regulatory framework for financial institutions and promote       competition in the financial marketplace. On behalf of the       members of CBA, we appreciate the opportunity to submit this       letter in support of a number of legislative proposals that       would ease regulatory burdens and provide greater access to       capital for consumers.                                   ____                                             National Association of                                     Minority Automobile Dealers,                                       Largo, MD, December 12, 2017.      Hon. David Trott,      Washington, DC.      Hon. William Lacy Clay,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representatives Trott and Clay: On behalf of the       National Association of Minority Automobile Dealers (NAMAD),       I write to express our members support for H.R. 2396, the       Privacy Notification Technical Corrections Act. NAMAD is the       nation's leading trade organization for the country's ethnic       minority dealers. Our primary objective is to pursue the       meaningful presence and participation of minority businesses       and diverse employees across all aspects of the automotive       economic sector, including:        Increasing the number of minority-owned dealerships in       communities across America.        Advocating workplace and supplier diversity in the       automotive manufacturing environment.        Supporting minority engagement in the automotive retail       sales and service sectors.        We write in support of H.R. 2396 because it is a sensible       and balanced approach that enjoys broad bipartisan support,       which we believe addresses concerns related to modernizing       the delivery of privacy notifications shared by the indirect       auto financing companies that work with our dealers as well       as  [[Page H9909]]       those dealers that also provide in-house financing of their       own directly to consumers.        As you all know, the CFPB and Congress have made changes to       the privacy notification process in 2014 and 2015. These       changes excluded specific financial institutions and we       believe a simple method for alternative delivery for these       companies is warranted. Eliminating this requirement would       reduce the cost of delivering financial services, save paper,       and discontinue this annual nuisance. At the same time, it       would also make the mailings more significant to the consumer       because they would only come after a change in policy. The       primary function of the annual notice is to remind consumers       of their right to opt out of information-sharing for       marketing purposes, but it is not obvious that mailing a       paper disclosure is the most effective or reliable medium for       accomplishing this objective.        NAMAD appreciates the commonsense solution proposed in H.R.       2396 as our members believe the delivery of privacy notices       should be modernized and reflective of the current suite of       technological choices available to institutions and       customers. We commend you for your leadership on this       important issue, and we would urge your colleagues to support       this legislation.            Sincerely,                                                      Damon Lester,      President.                                   ____                                                  December 13, 2017.        Dear Member of Congress: The undersigned vehicle financial       institutions (FIs), consisting of captive finance companies       directly affiliated with a manufacturer and who engage in       dealer facilitated financing or indirect auto financing, are       pleased to express our support for H.R. 2396, the Privacy       Notification Technical Clarification Act. We thank       Representatives David Trott (R-MI) and William Lacy Clay, Jr.       (D-MO) for introducing commonsense legislation to amend the       Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) by updating the exception for       certain annual notices provided by vehicle FIs to allow for       an electronic delivery mechanism. We urge Members of Congress       to support this important bipartisan legislation.        The GLBA requires FIs to issue privacy notices to consumers       if the FIs share consumers' non-public personal information       with affiliates or unaffiliated third parties. These       disclosures are required to be sent annually by mail, even if       no changes to the policy have occurred. Unfortunately, annual       privacy notices without policy changes are redundant,       unnecessary, and confusing to our consumers. They contain       several pages of small-print legalese, which have little       value for consumers. In fact, they are largely discarded--      unread--immediately upon receipt. However, producing and       mailing these notices is financially costly and time       consuming.        For background, in December 2015, Congress provided for an       outright exemption from the mailing requirement for FIs that:       (1) do not share non-public personal information about       consumers to unaffiliated third parties, and (2) have not       changed disclosure policies and practices since the most       recent disclosure was sent to consumers. Unfortunately,       vehicle FIs remain unable to even utilize an electronic       delivery mechanism for these notices.        We ask members of the House of Representatives to pass H.R.       2396 to help level the playing field. Specifically, if a       vehicle FI's privacy policy has not materially changed, the       company should be permitted to satisfy the intent of GLBA by       delivering its privacy notice through an electronic medium,       or by mail upon request. The legislation also includes a       requirement that a website address or toll-free number would       be included in regular communications to consumers, such as       monthly statements, as well as a description of where to       locate procedures for the consumer to opt-out at any time.       This would ensure that our consumers have ready access to       privacy policies 365 days a year, including a paper notice if       they choose to receive it.        We respectfully request your support in favor of H.R. 2396.       Thank you for your consideration.            Sincerely,      Ford Motor Credit Company.      General Motors Financial Company, Inc.      Nissan Motor Acceptance Corporation.      Toyota Financial Service.      VW Credit, Inc.     Mr. Speaker, it will lower the costs for these companies,  which will help consumers obtain more loans. This is a bipartisan,  commonsense piece of legislation with true community benefits.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support H.R. 2396.    Mr. Speaker, we are having an argument here about a bill  that has strong bipartisan support. When you boil it all down, the  argument is pretty simple, and the question for us to consider this  morning, and I would submit we have more important things to work on  than that question, but that is what we are debating this morning, so  let's consider it.   The question we are arguing about is: Do consumers, when they get  their mail and they find an envelope filled with 30 pages of small- print legalese, boilerplate language, do they open up that envelope and  pour themselves a cup of coffee and settle in--we have 9 inches of snow  today back in Michigan, so they settle in next to a fire and spend the  next 2 hours reading that privacy notice? That is the question.   The ranking member has been quite critical of the speeches that have  been given this morning, submitting that people do read these notices,  and who are we to judge whether people read these notices.   We are not making judgment, we are just submitting, on a commonsense  basis, an argument that people don't read these notices; people throw  these notices away. And that logic and common sense would dictate that  if the privacy notice changes, and a new notice arrives, and the  consumer realizes, gosh, I got a new privacy notice because the policy  changed; I don't get it when the policy doesn't change; I'd better read  this. If they are ever going to read it, that is the time they are  going to read it.   But if the ranking member is correct in her analysis, and that  millions of consumers are waiting by the mailbox each and every day so  that they can study, dissect, compare, and contrast these privacy  notices, then she is correct. This bill would add an extra step  because, instead of going to the mailbox, they would have to click on  the website or perhaps call a toll-free number and have the document  mailed to them. So if that burden is more important, because people are  reading these notices, then her arguments are compelling.    Now, let's examine all those groups that she spent so much time  telling us about this morning, all those proconsumer watchdog groups.  All those groups are interested in one thing. They are interested in  making sure the laws are as complicated and convoluted as possible  because all those groups, including the ranking member, believe,  incorrectly, all business is bad; all banks are bad; we have to make it  as convoluted and as complicated as possible so that class action  lawyers can find a reason to file frivolous lawsuits to sue them,  because that is what consumers need.   That is illogical because when these class action lawsuits and all  these convoluted regulations get placed on the books and the banks have  to hire hundreds of lawyers to deal with compliance, who do you think  pays for that? The consumer pays for it.   So this bill saves a little money, saves a few trees. Maybe we will  have a few more forests for our grandchildren. It is a simple bill, and  I feel bad for some of the Democrats, the 20 in our committee----    I feel bad for all those Democrats who support this bill  because, apparently, they are against consumers, too. This bill has got  nothing to do with any of the arguments that the ranking member has  proffered this morning. I ask for strong support for H.R. 2396.
