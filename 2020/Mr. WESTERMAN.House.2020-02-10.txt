 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Mr. Thomas  May on receiving the University of Arkansas System President's Medal  for Service.   This award is given by the school's president and cabinet to  recognize those who have committed to helping the UA System through  their time, knowledge, and philanthropy.   Tommy May has long been a resident of the Fourth Congressional  District and was previously the president and CEO of Simmons Bank. Mr.  May is also the only person in Arkansas history to have served as both  chairman of the board and acting president of the University of  Arkansas System.   His contributions to the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences  and the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff have led to growth,  development, and successes at both institutions.   Mr. May is a dedicated leader, and his service shows how much wise  stewardship can accomplish in the lives of others. Tommy has been an  inspiration to many as he continues to serve others and make a  difference in many lives, all while dealing with ALS in his own life.   I take this time to congratulate Tommy May once again on this  tremendous honor and thank him for his tremendous courage and service  to our district and our State.                            ____________________
