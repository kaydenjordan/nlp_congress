 Madam President, it has been more than 200 days since the  U.S. Capitol was attacked by mobs of anti-government insurrectionists.  It was the darkest day for Congress in more than 200 years, since  invading troops set this magnificent building on fire 200 years ago.   Americans in uniform that day stepped up to protect Congress. The  officers of the Capitol Police and other law enforcement agencies  literally put their lives on the line to protect Senators, Congressmen,  and to protect our Constitution.   More than 25,000 members of the National Guard also came from across  the country to secure Capitol Hill, including from my home State of  Montana.   Words cannot express my thanks for what these men and women did on  behalf of our Nation, and their service was not without sacrifice.   Police officers were assaulted by an angry mob, and we know that  post-traumatic stress is a real problem for many who had been to hell  and back. The citizen soldiers of the National Guard stood watch day  and night.   Now, today, we find out that pay is running short for both Capitol  Police and the members of the National Guard. The good news is that  after weeks of Senate negotiations, we are on the verge of a bipartisan  deal that ensures that the Capitol Police will have the money to pay  its officers for the rest of the year.   And as chairman of the Defense Appropriations Committee, I have  worked with Vice Chairman Shelby on two critical funding items to be  included in this bill.   First, we have agreed that the National Guard urgently needs $521  million to pay them for securing this Capitol. This funding will allow  the summer drill season to proceed without interruption. We need a  prepared Guard.   Second, we have learned of the substantial costs of moving Afghans  who helped our military get out of that country safely. We owe a debt  to those brave Afghans, who risked their lives to support our American  troops. That debt can never be fully repaid.   I would like to thank Chairman Leahy and Vice Chairman Shelby for  working with me on this important bill. I hope we can seal the deal  very soon and have this measure approved by the Senate today because it  is our job to defend the brave officers who defended us on January 6  and who continue their tireless work to keep us safe today.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, in Montana, public lands are a way of  life. They create thousands of jobs; they bring billions of dollars  into our State; and they form the backbone of our outdoor heritage.   Today--today--we have an opportunity to take another important step  forward in putting a real public servant who will hold herself  accountable to the taxpayer once confirmed to lead the Bureau of Land  Management.   I know Tracy Stone-Manning. Tracy Stone-Manning is a tireless  advocate for the outdoor spaces that make Montana special. She is a  collaborative--collaborative--responsible leader, and at the BLM she  will bring nonpartisan stewardship to our Nation's greatest treasures.   Tracy is dedicated to smart management of our public lands. She is  dedicated to the habitat and to the outdoors and is one of the hardest  working people that I know.   But, unfortunately, Members of this body have played politics with  her nomination. They have dragged a good person's name through the muck  in a cynical smear campaign ginned up by folks who would rather play  politics than see a qualified, competent woman running the Bureau of  Land Management.   Now, it is particularly galling that these same folks stood by  silently--or, worse, cheered--as William Perry  [[Page S5094]]  Pendley led the Agency illegally, without Senate confirmation, under  the previous administration: Pendley, a fringe climate change denier  who explicitly called for the Federal Government to sell off all its  public lands and who actively encouraged armed standoffs between law  enforcement and ranchers.   It is a shame that we have people who put politics above people and  our public lands, but that is the unfortunate reality of the U.S.  Senate in Washington, DC.   The person these folks have made Tracy out to be is not the person  that I have known and worked with over the last decade-plus. If she  were that, I would not be standing here supporting her today. She will  bring good old-fashioned Montana common sense to the Bureau of Land  Management, along with a steadfast dedication to manage our public  lands and the thousands of jobs that rely on those public lands. She  will lead the Agency with dignity and honor and integrity.   And, as she has done her entire career, Tracy will bring folks  together, from both sides of the aisle and all sides of the issue, to  get things done and make a real impact on our public lands.   I am proud to support Tracy Stone-Manning, and I look forward to  seeing the great work that she will do as the next leader of the Bureau  of Land Management. I urge my colleagues to do the same.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all remaining time be  yielded back.    I ask for the yeas and nays.
