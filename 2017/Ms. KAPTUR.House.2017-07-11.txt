 Mr. Speaker, Russia's ongoing assault on our democracy  and democracies around the globe cannot go unanswered.   It has been a month since Russian sanctions passed the Senate 97-2,  yet House Republican leaders continue to stall on bringing that worthy  bill forward here. Why? Who or what are they protecting? Surely not  liberty.   Putin's Russia targets journalists and political opponents for death.  He shelters hackers that target democratic nations, including ours, and  Russia hacks businesses to enrich Putin's cronies.   Russia's illegal invasion of sovereign nations, the latest being  Ukraine, with over 10,000 dead and over 2 million displaced, reminds us  of the evil brutality of Russia's kleptocratic rulers. Russia's  damaging expansionism needs to be stopped.   Despite earlier denials, reports state that Donald Trump, Jr., Jared  Kushner, and Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort knowingly met with a  Kremlin-aligned lawyer to secure damaging information about Hillary  Clinton. This administration is not acting in the national interest,  and the victim of their encounters is liberty herself.   Let House Republican leaders stop the delays and bring forward strong  sanctions legislation on Russia. Let us defend liberty and our rule of  law as a beacon of hope for people everywhere, even those living in the  grim reality of Russia.                            ____________________
