 Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Smith for yielding. I  am proud to be amongst my colleagues this evening.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of the constituents of the First  District of Michigan who are--I repeat--the voice for those who have no  voice.   2018 marks the 45th anniversary of the infamous Roe v. Wade decision.  Since that day, as you have heard several of my colleagues say, almost  60 million abortions have occurred in our country, our United States.  Today, this timeframe is an appropriate time for us to pause, reflect,  and plan a path forward for the pro-life movement.   The most important question we must ask ourselves is: Why? Why do we  stand for life? Why is this cause so important to us? Why do we fight  for not only all of our citizens, but for the unborn?   For me, my why is simple: every life--every life--has immense value,  regardless of wealth, stature, or fame. Whether you were born in rural  northern Michigan or in a large city, we all were put here on this  Earth for a purpose: to fulfill God's purpose.   As the father of two wonderful daughters and eight beautiful  grandchildren, I know firsthand the joy, love, and inspiration that  every single life brings.   Life is precious and should never be taken for granted. As a nation,  we must offer hope to those who have no hope. We must remind others of  the hope offered by an adoptive family and continue together as the  voice for those who have no voice. We must and will continue to fight  for those who have no voice.
