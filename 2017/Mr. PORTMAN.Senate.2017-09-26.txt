 Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Florida for the  report from his State and for his words about the devastation in Puerto  Rico. Our hearts go out to those in Florida, Texas, the Virgin Islands,  and Puerto Rico. We do have a responsibility to respond quickly. They  are responding to some devastating storms, especially when they are  combined.   Our thanks also go to the first responders and the many volunteers,  including some in the State of Ohio and those from my hometown, who  stepped forward to help the people in need. It is extraordinary.   Again, I look forward to working with my colleagues to come up with  additional assistance as we have done  [[Page S6120]]  already for some of the initial damage in Texas. There is so much more  now that we must do.                            Tribute to Tim O'Neill    Mr. President, I rise today to talk about one of our colleagues here  in the Senate, who has an inspiring story and is celebrating an  important anniversary this week.   I want to mention this week Doorkeeper Tim O'Neill, who works with us  in the Senate and celebrates 27 years of Government service. He has  been a doorkeeper since 2010, during which time I have had the pleasure  of getting to know him, as have many of my colleagues in the Senate.   His career has been a remarkable journey. He started in the Senate as  a legislative director, and he later went on to work in the White  House--not during one Presidential administration but during four  Presidential administrations. Tim worked for President Ronald Reagan,  President George H.W. Bush, President Bill Clinton, and President  George W. Bush.   He worked in the Department of Treasury and at the Federal Housing  Finance Board, eventually becoming the chairman of that agency. After  that he went to the House of Representatives, where he was senior  legislative counsel for the Financial Services Committee. We are happy  to have Tim back here on the Senate side, where he works today.   Tim has had an impressive career which I outlined, but the most  amazing thing about his career doesn't reside in what he has done but  what he has overcome.   One weekend in January of 1989, when Tim was at the Treasury  Department, his life was altered forever. Tim's life had first changed  on Friday morning when he found out his wife Ginny was pregnant with  their first child. But later that weekend, on a Sunday, as he was  putting on his shoes to go jogging, at 34 years old, he suffered a  major stroke that affected two-thirds of his brain.   The doctors didn't immediately tell Ginny how serious it was. Later  she would find out that they did not believe he would live through the  night, and, if he did, they believed his lasting brain damage would  mean he would never walk again and never talk again.   Despite this very grim prognosis, Tim had a few things going for him.  First, there was an incredible positive attitude that we all see in the  Senate. Second, he was young and athletic, which improved his chances  of recovery. He also talks about his Irish determination, which made  him resilient. And he had the knowledge of knowing that Ginny was  pregnant, and he was absolutely committed to being part of his  daughter's life. In fact, one of the few things he said he remembered  in his initial stages of recovery was that Ginny was pregnant and that  he had a daughter coming. And when he began regaining his speech, the  first thing he told Ginny was that he was going to recover.    The path was not easy. In those first few months, he worked 8 hours a  day, trading his government job for a rehabilitation facility. He  worked with speech and physical therapists. And with Ginny at his side,  he put in overtime every day. The extensive road to recovery was  daunting. Tim, a Harvard-educated lawyer in the middle of a successful  career, had to totally relearn things. He had to relearn how to read,  and he had to relearn how to write.   I know Tim will agree with me that his wife Ginny was the unsung hero  of this story of recovery.   The O'Neills felt the support and generosity of those around them. As  I mentioned, he worked at the Treasury Department. Those close to Tim-- and some who hardly knew him at all--donated their personal leave time  to allow him to keep receiving a paycheck during this recovery process,  and the Treasury Department assured him that his job would be waiting  when he was ready and able to return.   Shortly after the stroke that he wasn't supposed to ever recover  from, Tim was home, self-mobile in a wheelchair. Soon he taught himself  how to walk again. He never regained use of his right hand at all--one  of his only lasting handicaps to this day--so do you know what he did?  He learned to write with his left hand. His resilience and  determination are really amazing.   He went back to work. His stroke was in January of 1989. Again, that  Sunday, doctors didn't think he would live through the night, and if he  did, they thought his life would be in a wheelchair. In 1995, only 6  years later, he was sworn in as a Director of the Federal Housing  Finance Board, a position he was nominated for by President Clinton.  Later, in 2001, President George W. Bush elevated him to Chairman of  that Board. In 2005, he became a senior legislative counsel to the  House Financial Services Committee, until his first retirement from  government in 2007. He had 20 years of service.   He had had a good career and a recovery story that was respected by  everyone who knew about it. He could very well have sat back and  enjoyed that retirement after those 20 years, but Tim's life is defined  by purpose and service and people. So after trying retirement for a  little while, Tim returned to the place he loved and the people he  knew, coming back here to the U.S. Senate as a doorkeeper in 2010.   Tim's extensive knowledge of Capitol Hill has benefited the U.S.  Senate, and I will tell you what--his good spirits have had an effect  on countless Senators, including me, countless members of our staff,  and many visitors. His attitude is infectious. He exemplifies the power  of positive thinking. He certainly brightens my days, and I know he has  inspired many.   By the way, I just heard today that he is also a leader among  doorkeepers, including organizing periodic team-building events at the  Nats games with his fellow doorkeepers.   This month, as we recognize Tim's 27 years of public service, we also  recognize his incredible life journey and his resilience in the face of  adversity. Strokes can affect people in a variety of ways. In Tim's  case, I must say I think it made him a stronger person.   Guided by his love for his wife Ginny and their three children now  and his dedication to public service, Tim has had a career and a life  worthy of celebration and recognition.   So, Tim, today, this week, we all congratulate you on 27 years of  honorable service and wish you many more to come.   Thank you, Mr. President.   I yield the floor.
