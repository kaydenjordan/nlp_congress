 Mr. Speaker, on December 31 of this year, the FISA 702  surveillance program expires.   Ostensibly, this program allows our intelligence agencies to spy on  and stop terrorism. However, it is a well-known fact that the FBI has  used this program as a back door to our Constitution to spy on  Americans.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues not to reauthorize this program  before December 31 without significant reforms. We all took an oath to  uphold and defend the Constitution. We need to stay true to that oath  and require the FBI to get a warrant if they want to go into the 702  database to surveil Americans.                            ____________________
