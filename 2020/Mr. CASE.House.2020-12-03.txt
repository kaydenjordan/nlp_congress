Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1049, sponsored by my friend,  Representative Tonko of New York, a fellow member of the Natural  Resources Committee.   Mr. Speaker, since 1984, Congress has established 55 National  Heritage Areas. These incredible sites protect our diverse historical,  cultural, and environmental treasures, from the Erie Canalway to the  Great Basin of Utah and beyond, preserving and interpreting unique  aspects of our American story.   Heritage Areas are also a major boon for local economies, supporting  cultural tourism and driving investment. They are also a great deal for  the taxpayer, ensuring that every Federal dollar spent on the program  is matched with at least $1 of non-Federal funding.   However, Congress has so far failed to pass a law standardizing the  management of this important program, meaning that each site operates  under its own authorization.   Both the Obama and Trump administrations have asked Congress to enact  a programmatic bill to improve site management and ensure a continued  consistent commitment to our National Heritage Areas.   The bill offered today by our colleague would address that need by  providing a standard under which these sites would be designated,  reviewed, funded, and overseen.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Tonko for his continued work in  support of our National Heritage Area program, and I thank Ranking  Member Bishop for working with us to improve this bill in committee.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to vote in support of H.R.  1049, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I certainly appreciate the overview of the ranking member in his  initial remarks today. I would note that the bills before us today,  these 12 bills, are all coming to the floor from the Natural Resources  Committee. They are  [[Page H6096]]  critical bills in many areas, from natural resources to indigenous  peoples and beyond.   Many of these bills actually come to us from the Senate and, if  passed here, will go on directly to the President, so this is a  productive agenda that we have here with every expectation that these  bills will advance.   I also want to say, on behalf of the majority, that I fully endorse  the ranking member's commendations to the staff that are with us today  and in our Natural Resources Committee. He makes an important and vital  point. We all appreciate our staff. We are blessed by their service. We  are blessed by their expertise, and I would be remiss if I did not say,  on behalf of our chair, Chair Grijalva, that we all endorse those  comments, and I thank him for those very kind comments.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr.  Tonko).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Rhode  Island (Mr. Cicilline).     Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (S. 199) to provide for the transfer of certain Federal land in the  State of Minnesota for the benefit of the Leech Lake Band of Ojibwe.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, S. 199, the Leech Lake Band of Ojibwe Reservation  Restoration Act, introduced by Senator Tina Smith from Minnesota,  directs the Department of Agriculture to transfer approximately 11,760  acres of Federal land in the Chippewa National Forest to the Department  of the Interior to be held in trust for the benefit of the Tribe.   The Leech Lake Band of Ojibwe is a federally recognized Tribe with  approximately 10,660 members with a reservation located within the  National Chippewa Forest in Cass County, Minnesota. The Leech Lake Band  has the largest population of all the Minnesota Tribes yet the smallest  amount of land available for its use.   Much of the Tribe's land was lost when many of its members were  illegally dispossessed of their land via ``secretarial transfers''  during the 1950s. Secretarial transfers were a transaction where the  Department of the Interior approved the sale or transfer of Tribal land  and/or individually owned Indian allotments without the consent of the  Tribe or the individual Indian allottees. This practice resulted in the  Tribe having insufficient land to meet the current needs of its  membership.   The return of the land through S. 199 will assist the Tribe in  rebuilding its land base, enable the protection of sacred sites, and  allow the construction of housing on some of the tracts near the  Tribe's existing communities.   The Tribe intends to respect all existing easements, rights of way,  and other encumbrances on the land and does not intend to immediately  modify the current land uses. Additionally, the land will stay in tax- exempt fee status as part of the Chippewa National Forest until the  Tribe develops a plan for future economic and residential use.   I want to especially commend the Tribe for working together with  local electric co-ops on a memorandum of understanding regarding some  of the last remaining issues so that we could bring the bill before us  today in a bipartisan fashion.   I want to also extend sincere appreciation to our colleague from  Minnesota (Ms. McCollum) for introducing the House companion of the  legislation, H.R. 733, and for working diligently with the Natural  Resources Committee, the Tribe, and the local interests to ensure that  passage of this bill could become a reality.   Mr. Speaker, I urge quick adoption of S. 199, and I reserve the  balance of my time.   Miss GONZALEZ-COLON of Puerto Rico. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to  the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Stauber).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Minnesota (Ms. McCollum), who is the principal introducer of the House  companion bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Minnesota (Ms. McCollum).    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this valuable  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (S. 212) to amend the Native American Business Development, Trade  Promotion, and Tourism Act of 2000, the Buy Indian Act, and the Native  American Programs Act of 1974 to provide industry and economic  development opportunities to Indian communities, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                   S. 212         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Indian Community Economic       Enhancement Act of 2020''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds that--        (1)(A) to bring industry and economic development to Indian       communities, Indian Tribes must overcome a number of       barriers, including--        (i) geographical location;        (ii) lack of infrastructure or capacity;        (iii) lack of sufficient collateral and capital; and        (iv) regulatory bureaucracy relating to--        (I) development; and        (II) access to services provided by the Federal Government;       and        (B) the barriers described in subparagraph (A) often add to       the cost of doing business in Indian communities;        (2) Indian Tribes--        (A) enact laws and exercise sovereign governmental powers;        (B) determine policy for the benefit of Tribal members; and        (C) produce goods and services for consumers;        (3) the Federal Government has--        (A) an important government-to-government relationship with       Indian Tribes; and        (B) a role in facilitating healthy and sustainable Tribal       economies;        (4) the input of Indian Tribes in developing Federal policy       and programs leads to more meaningful and effective measures       to assist Indian Tribes and Indian entrepreneurs in building       Tribal economies;        (5)(A) many components of Tribal infrastructure need       significant repair or replacement; and        (B) access to private capital for projects in Indian       communities--        (i) may not be available; or        (ii) may come at a higher cost than such access for other       projects;        (6)(A) Federal capital improvement programs, such as those       that facilitate tax-exempt bond financing and loan       guarantees, are tools that help improve or replace crumbling       infrastructure;        (B) lack of parity in treatment of an Indian Tribe as a       governmental entity under Federal tax and certain other       regulatory laws impedes, in part, the ability of Indian       Tribes to raise capital through issuance of tax exempt debt,       invest as an accredited investor, and benefit from other       investment incentives accorded to State and local       governmental entities; and        (C) as a result of the disparity in treatment of Indian       Tribes described in subparagraph (B), investors may avoid       financing, or demand a premium to finance, projects in Indian       communities, making the projects more costly or inaccessible;        (7) there are a number of Federal loan guarantee programs       available to facilitate financing of business, energy,       economic, housing, and community development projects in       Indian communities, and those programs may support public-      private partnerships for infrastructure development, but       improvements and support are needed for those programs       specific to Indian communities to facilitate more effectively       private financing for infrastructure and other urgent       development needs; and        (8)(A) most real property held by Indian Tribes is trust or       restricted land that essentially cannot be held as       collateral; and        (B) while creative solutions, such as leasehold mortgages,       have been developed in response to the problem identified in       subparagraph (A), some solutions remain subject to review and       approval by the Bureau of Indian Affairs, adding additional       costs and delay to Tribal projects.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, S. 212, the Indian Community Economic Enhancement Act,  amends current laws to provide industry and economic development  opportunities to Indian communities.   Indian Tribes face many unique obstacles in their mission to bring  industry and economic development to Indian Country. This includes  geographic isolation, lack of infrastructure, and lack of sufficient  collateral and capital. The end result is an increased cost of doing  business in Indian Country, which stifles outside investment.   S. 212 seeks to address these issues by amending three existing  Federal laws, the Native American Business Development, Trade  Promotion, and Tourism Act of 2000, the Buy Indian Act, and the Native  American Programs Act of 1974.   These laws have been supporting Native businesses and economic  development for years. However, they need to be updated to reflect the  21st century economy, as well as the realities in Indian Country today.   To that end, enactment of S. 212 will increase access to capital for  Indian Tribes and businesses, increase opportunities for Indian  business promotion, and create mechanisms and tools to address  investments in Indian communities.   At the request of the Appropriations Committee, we are making some  small changes to the current bill to update the fiscal year  authorization language for some of the programs. This means that the  bill will have to go back to the Senate, where I hope and believe they  will move swiftly to enact it, as amended, before the end of this  Congress.                                time  1745    I commend the sponsor of the bill, the chair of the Senate Committee  on Indian Affairs, Senator Hoeven from North Dakota, for his work on  this legislation.   I also recognize our own colleague, Representative Norma Torres from  California for her work on the bill and for carrying the House  companion, H.R. 1937.   I urge my colleagues to support S. 212, and I ask for its adoption.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                   Committee on Education and Labor,                                        House of Representatives,                                  Washington, DC, November 30, 2020.      Hon. Raul M. Grijalva,      Chairman, Committee on Natural Resources,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Grijalva: I write concerning S. 212, the       Indian Community Economic Enhancement Act of 2019. This bill       was primarily referred to the Committee on Natural Resources,       and additionally to the Committee on Education and Labor. As       a result of Leadership and the Committee on Natural Resources       having consulted with me concerning this bill generally, I       agree to forgo formal consideration of the bill so the bill       may proceed expeditiously to the House floor.        The Committee on Education and Labor takes this action with       our mutual understanding that by forgoing formal       consideration of S. 212, we do not waive any jurisdiction       over the subject matter contained in this or similar       legislation, and we will be appropriately consulted and       involved as the bill or similar legislation moves forward so       we may address any remaining issues within our Rule X       jurisdiction. I also request that you support my request to       name members of  [[Page H6102]]       the Committee on Education and Labor to any conference       committee to consider such provisions.        Finally, I would appreciate a response confirming this       understanding and ask that a copy of our exchange of letters       on this matter be included in the committee report for S. 212       and in the Congressional Record during floor consideration       thereof.            Sincerely,                                         Robert C. ``Bobby'' Scott,      Chairman.                                   ____                                     Committee on Natural Resources,                                        House of Representatives,                                  Washington, DC, November 30, 2020.      Hon. Bobby Scott,      Chair, Committee on Education and Labor,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chair Scott: I write to you concerning S. 212, the       ``Indian Community Economic Enhancement Act of 2019.''        I appreciate your willingness to work cooperatively on this       legislation. I recognize that the bill contains provisions       that fall within the jurisdiction of the Committee on       Education and Labor. I acknowledge that your Committee will       not formally consider S. 212 and agree that the inaction of       your Committee with respect to the bill does not waive any       future jurisdictional claim over the matters contained in the       bill that fall within your Committee's Rule X jurisdiction.        I will ensure that our exchange of letters is included in       the Congressional Record during floor consideration of the       bill. I appreciate your cooperation regarding this       legislation and look forward to continuing to work with you       as this measure moves through the legislative process.            Sincerely,                                               Raul M. Grijalva,                                                              Chair,                                 House Natural Resources Committee.    Miss GONZALEZ-COLON of Puerto Rico. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I think it is important that, for decades, the Native  American communities have struggled with a wide array of difficulties  relating to economic development on their own land, including poor  access to capital, remote and rural locations, and degradation of the  local infrastructure. Only around half of all Native Americans residing  or near Tribal communities have jobs, and a quarter of Native families  earn an income that is below the American poverty line.   Tribal economic development is also hampered by the need for Federal  approval before leasing of trust lands, legal systems that are not  business friendly, and issues raised by sovereign immunity.   This bill, S. 212, amends three Federal laws relating to business,  economic, and trade development in Indian communities: the Native  American Business Development, Trade Promotion, and Tourism Act of  2000, the Buy Indian Act, and the Native American Programs Act of 1974.   The amendments are intended to increase access to capital for Indian  Tribes and businesses, increase opportunities for Indian business  promotion, and create mechanisms and tools to attract investments in  Indian communities.   Mr. Speaker, I fully support the intent behind this legislation and  appreciate the work that has gone into it over the last several years.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I very much appreciate the comments of my  colleague from Puerto Rico.   Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers. I am prepared to close, and  I reserve the balance of my time.   Miss GONZALEZ-COLON of Puerto Rico. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (S. 914) to reauthorize the Integrated Coastal and Ocean Observation  System Act of 2009, to clarify the authority of the Administrator of  the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration with respect to  post-storm assessments, and to require the establishment of a National  Water Center, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                   S. 914         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, S. 914, the Coordinated Ocean Observations and Research  Act, would reauthorize the Integrated Coastal and Ocean Observation  System Act of 2009, called IOOS for short.   For over 10 years now, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric  Administration, or NOAA, has implemented this data-driven national  regional partnership to successfully improve safety, enhance the  economy, and protect the environment.   IOOS is a coordinated network of people and technology consisting of  Federal partners and regional associations that generates and  disseminates continuous data and models for our oceans and the Great  Lakes. These data give us a crucial understanding of environmental  variables, like temperature, salinity, currents, nutrient  concentrations, contaminant levels, and more.   This bill would also clarify the authority of NOAA in regards to  post-storm assessments, which NOAA has been doing the work for since it  was appropriated funds in 2016. The bill makes technical challenges to  the COASTAL Act of 2012 so that NOAA can successfully collect the  required data to perform post-storm assessments and then provide that  information to FEMA.   And finally, this legislation would codify establishment of the  National Water Center as the primary facility for hydrologic decision  support services. As we saw from the historic flooding events last  year, it is critical that NOAA has these decision support tools.   In the face of climate change, it is so important that our  environmental planners and managers have the tools they need to ensure  safety for the American people and the longevity of our coastal natural  resources. The Coordinated Ocean Observations and Research Act will put  us on that path.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Miss GONZALEZ-COLON of Puerto Rico. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of S. 914.   This bill, the Coordinated Ocean Observations and Research Act, will  reauthorize the U.S. Integrated Ocean Observing System, better known as  IOOS, and increase Federal support for ocean data collection and  monitoring efforts, which are vital to coastal and island communities  across the Nation.   Why this bill is important is, as you may know, living in Puerto Rico  and after the hurricanes, this program, it was so important for  communities in the Caribbean as well as many other coastal communities  across the Nation.   This network consists of 17 Federal agencies and 11 regional  associations that provide quality information about our coasts, oceans,  and Great Lakes. And through the use of tools such as satellites,  buoys, and underwater gliders, the system delivers accurate data that  is critical to support coastal economies, maritime commerce, and  navigation safety.   These products are also used to improve hurricane tracking and  weather forecasts, monitor water quality, conduct research on coastal  ecosystems, and support the U.S. Coast Guard search and rescue  operations. That was the reason I was supporting this, and, of course,  the dean of the House, Mr.   Don Young, who is showing the way for many  of us arriving to the House after him.   In the case of Puerto Rico, we know firsthand the importance of this  system. The Caribbean Coastal Ocean Observing System is one of the  networks's 11 regional associations that is based on the island. Among  other things, it helps support port and harbor operations, as well as  interisland shipping and cruising, by providing observations and models  of coastal weather, waves, wind, and currents in the waters surrounding  Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.   These system assets were particularly instrumental when Hurricanes  Irma and Maria struck in 2017. While Puerto Rico was without power and  communications, our buoys kept reporting data via satellite, providing  crucial information that was utilized by NOAA's National Hurricane  Center in Miami and other stakeholders. Reauthorizing this system  network is necessary to continue supporting this and other similar  efforts across the country and to ensure that we are delivering  accurate and continuous data on our oceans and coast.   Mr. Speaker, I should mention, as well, that while we are taking up a  Senate bill, the dean of the House,   Don Young, has been a dedicated  supporter of this program for many, many years and has sponsored a  House companion bill. You may have all heard that the dean of the House  recently tested positive for COVID, as I did in August, and we are all  hoping that he remains strong, as he is, fierce, and well after his  resounding reelection victory.   Mr. Speaker, in conclusion, I know many folks living in coastal  communities around the Nation will benefit from the enactment of this  legislation here today. So not just by the people living in the islands  or in coastal communities, but in solidarity with Congressman Young, I  urge the adoption of the measure and reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I certainly do deeply appreciate the comments  of my colleague from Puerto Rico, and she knows, as well as I do, as  members of the Island Caucus--and we include in the Island Caucus the  largest island of all, Alaska, Mr. Young's island--the deep importance  of this system. It is a matter of life and death to us in many areas  and many ways, and so we all fully endorse this bill from that  perspective.  [[Page H6108]]    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers. I am prepared to close, and  I reserve the balance of my time.   Miss GONZALEZ-COLON of Puerto Rico. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to  the gentleman from Alaska (Mr. Young), dean of the House.   (Mr. YOUNG asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this  invaluable legislation for our oceans and all of us, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (S. 1342) to require the Under Secretary for Oceans and Atmosphere to  update periodically the environmental sensitivity index products of the  National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration for each coastal area  of the Great Lakes, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 1342         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

(e) Funding.--Funds to carry out the activities under this       section shall be derived from amounts authorized to be       appropriated for the Under Secretary that are enacted after       the date of the enactment of this Act.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am very happy today to rise in support of S. 1342, the  Great Lakes Environmental Sensitivity Index Act. I commend my  colleagues, Senators Peters and Young and Representatives Kildee and  Joyce, for their bipartisan, bicameral efforts on this legislation.   The Great Lakes are the largest freshwater system by area in the  world and are home to highly productive commercial and recreational  fisheries, thriving coastal communities, and unique aquatic and  terrestrial species.   This legislation ensures that the Great Lakes are not left behind in  environmental planning. The bill requires that the National Oceanic and  Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA, update at least once every 7 years  its environmental sensitivity index products for each coastal area of  the Great Lakes.   These environmental sensitivity indexes, or ESI maps, are crucial  tools used in identifying sensitive coastal shorelines, biological  resources, and human-use resources prior to a disaster like an oil  spill. In emergencies, coastal managers and responders can then use  these ESI maps to properly assess the situation, allocate and  prioritize resources, and plan cleanups.   The last time the Great Lakes environmental sensitivity indexes were  updated was in the 1980s. As we all know, between the climate crisis  and human development, our environment has changed dramatically across  our country and world in that time.   In the Great Lakes, for example, we are seeing record-setting water  levels and harmful algal blooms. How these environmental factors would  interact with a disaster like an oil spill is, unfortunately, largely  guesswork with our outdated information.   It is so important that we pass this much-needed, commonsense  legislation so that the Great Lakes region is prepared in the event of  an unthinkable oil spill or other natural disaster.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the Great  Lakes Environmental Sensitivity Index Act, and I reserve the balance of  my time.   Miss GONZALEZ-COLON of Puerto Rico. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to  the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Huizenga).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Kildee), the co-introducer of this important legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Kildee).    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I reserve the  balance of my time.   Miss GONZALEZ-COLON of Puerto Rico. Mr. Speaker, the Senate passed  this bill twice, without even holding a hearing. The House has not  taken any action on its version of the bill, H.R. 2551, even though it  has been referred to the Natural Resources Committee since last May.    The Senate Committee report on S. 1342 justified its need by stating  that the environmental sensitivity index maps for the Great Lakes  haven't been updated since the 1980s. It also states the maps haven't  been updated since between 1985 and 2004. It just depends on which  paragraph of the report you read.   Clearly, no one knows or could be bothered to find out when these  maps were updated. Apparently, it doesn't matter for some people.   CBO scores this bill as costing taxpayers $2 million, but we have no  idea where the administration is on this issue. No money was  appropriated for these indexes in 2019, and, clearly, we don't have an  answer to those questions still in this report.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 306) to direct the Secretary of the Interior to conduct a special  resource study of the site of the Kettle Creek Battlefield in Wilkes  County, Georgia, and adjacent property, and for other purposes, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 306         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. KETTLE CREEK BATTLEFIELD SURVEY.         (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the ``Kettle       Creek Battlefield Survey Act''.        (b) Reconnaissance Survey.--        (1) Survey.--The Secretary of the Interior (referred to in       this section as the ``Secretary'') shall conduct a       reconnaissance survey of the site of the Kettle Creek       Battlefield in Wilkes County, Georgia, and adjacent property       (referred to in this section as the ``site'').        (2) Requirements for survey.--In conducting the survey       under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall evaluate the       likelihood that resources within the site boundary would meet       the four criteria for new parklands--        (A) national significance;        (B) suitability;        (C) feasibility; and        (D) need for National Park Service management.        (3) Report.--Not later than 1 year after the date on which       funds are made available to carry out the survey under       paragraph (1), the Secretary shall submit to the Committee on       Natural Resources of the House of Representatives and the       Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the Senate a       report that describes--        (A) the results of the survey; and        (B) any conclusions and recommendations of the Secretary.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous materials on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 306, the Kettle Creek  Battlefield Survey Act, introduced by our colleague, Representative  Jody Hice.   This bill would require the Secretary of the Interior to conduct a  reconnaissance survey of the Kettle Creek Battlefield in Wilkes County,  Georgia.   On February 14, 1779, at the Battle of Kettle Creek, approximately  350 patriots defeated more than 800 British loyalists in a surprise  attack. The battle  [[Page H6111]]  marked the only significant victory in Georgia by forces opposed to  British rule and impacted the course of the American Revolutionary War.   In 1975, the battlefield was added to the National Register of  Historic Places to protect the site's historic and archeological  resources.   This bill tasks the National Park Service with determining the best  management options for these historic resources, and I would like to  thank Representative Hice for his efforts on this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support its adoption, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I certainly do appreciate my colleague's very  emotional description of the rich history of Battle Creek and his  commitment to its preservation. I join him in that.   Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I reserve the balance of  my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the adoption of this  measure, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (S. 2981) to reauthorize and amend the National Oceanic and Atmospheric  Administration Commissioned Officer Corps Act of 2020, and for other  purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 2981         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of this bipartisan,  bicameral measure to treat the commissioned officers of one of our  Nation's seven uniformed services, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric  Administration Commissioned Officer Corps, with the same basic  statutory recruitment, advancement, retention, and benefit structure,  and with the same respect, as is accorded to commissioned officers of  our other six armed services, the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, Coast  Guard, and United States Public Health Service Commissioned Corps.   The bill before us today is led by a Republican, Alaskan Senator  Sullivan. It passed through the Senate committee and the Senate itself  by unanimous consent. It is a virtual companion with improvements to  H.R. 2406, which was introduced by me and both Democratic and  Republican colleagues, and reported out of our Natural Resources  Committee.   If passed today, it will go straight to the President, whose  Department of Commerce testified to our Natural Resources Committee:  ``The Department believes this bill would improve NOAA's ability to  administer the NOAA Corps. The Department is very supportive of the  ability to retain veterans of the NOAA Corps and the unique skill sets  they possess. The Office of Management and Budget has advised that  there is no objection to the transmittal of these views, from the  standpoint of the administration's programs.''   The bill is also supported wholeheartedly by two of our Nation's  foremost servicemember organizations, the 350,000-strong Military  Officers Association of America, representing all military officers of  all services, and the 5.5-million-strong Military Coalition, whose  motto is, ``Proudly serving all seven uniformed services.''   In fact, but for the isolated objections of a few Members, which we  may hear from shortly, which appear to arise from some combination of a  fundamental misunderstanding or lack of appreciation for the mission of  NOAA and its Uniformed Officer Corps, one could scarcely imagine a more  broadly supported measure.   The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA,  celebrates its half-century anniversary this year as ``America's  environmental intelligence agency.'' Never, during that half-century,  has its mission been so important, and never has it been growing so  fast.   NOAA now operates oceanic observation and research throughout our  world's oceans, measuring the health of our oceans, the health of our  fisheries, and weather prediction. It operates atmospheric research and  observation, weather prediction, and, again, national hazard warnings.   It operates fisheries enforcement increasingly throughout our world,  including in partnership with our friends and allies. It increases  partnerships with foreign countries, projecting part of our soft power  throughout this world. It does its vital work with a critical team,  including the structured, uniformed Commissioned Officer Corps.   The women and men of the NOAA Corps operate NOAA's highly specialized  international fleet of research and survey ships and aircraft. They  conduct international world-class oceanic  [[Page H6120]]  and atmospheric research, including the famous Hurricane Hunter  aviators who fly into, above, and around hurricanes to give NOAA's  National Weather Service forecasters accurate data for their storm  forecasts and warnings used by emergency managers as they make life and  death decisions.   Like the other uniformed services, Active Duty NOAA Corps officers  spend most of their careers away from home, at sea, in the air, and in  remote locations such as Antarctica, conducting this important work.  Their work is frequently in increasingly hazardous conditions.   However, the corps is often overlooked in the legislative process,  resulting in a patchwork of statutory authorities, benefits, and  service obligations.   This bill will help the NOAA Corps improve recruitment, retention,  and diversity to attract the best and the brightest commissioned  officers and better align the NOAA Corps with the other uniformed  services as they continue their service to NOAA and our Nation.                                time  1830    The NOAA Corps Amendments Act is an important step to make sure that  the NOAA Corps has the authority it needs to continue as an effective  service for our country.   The bill gives the NOAA Corps officers employment rights in line with  other uniform services, authorizes education loan repayment programs  for NOAA Corps officers, tuition support for prospective officers, and  gives NOAA updated authority to manage the size and composition of the  corps.   In their letter supporting the NOAA Corps Amendments Act, the  Military Officers Association of America, the Nation's leading voice  for commissioned officers of all seven uniformed services, highlighted  the importance of the NOAA Corps for national defense.   They stated that, ``The unique scientific and operational expertise,  flexibility, and deployment capability of the NOAA Corps continues to  be a force multiplier for U.S. and ally air, land, and sea operation.''   This first reauthorization of the NOAA Commissioned Officer Corps  since 2002, under the House counterpart bill's co-introducer of the  dean of the House, Mr. Young, further improves the diversity of the  corps by authorizing financial aid for a student precommissioning  education in exchange for service, which will prioritize underserved  populations to undertake careers in NOAA and addresses sexual  harassment issues by strengthening the corps' policies, including  required reporting of potential offenses.   Mr. Speaker, we may shortly hear objections that, as noted, represent  a distinct minority in Congress and the uniformed services community.  They recite three decades'-old arguments that we have long moved past.  They recite various arguments that could just as easily be made for any  other uniformed service.   If we are going to go down that road, should we not make those  arguments globally, not selectively and discriminatorily as to one of  our seven services?   They recite arguments that are simply inaccurate and, again, that  seem to reflect a deep misunderstanding of NOAA's mission.   Here is the bottom line for this bill: NOAA does exist. It has  existed for 50 years. It has done its work with a committed officer  corps for 50 years. It is not being abolished. That mission, that corps  will continue. That mission is critical and its personnel must be  recognized and improved. And NOAA officers are commissioned officers in  our services and should be fully recognized as such, similar to all  others.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this bipartisan,  bicameral, needed, and fair bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I deeply appreciate the support of my friend  and colleague from Alaska, the dean of the House, on this bipartisan,  bicameral measure.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I express my appreciation to new colleague,  Mr. Palazzo, for his support of this critical bill.   Those of us that live in the oceans and on the coasts completely  understand the value of NOAA, again, as a matter of life and death in  many cases, and we understand that NOAA can only do its job with a  motivated, high-expertise Corps.  [[Page H6121]]    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I certainly regret to hear the words from my friend, the  ranking member's mouth on this bill, because in scattershotting 9 or 10  cherry-picked arguments, he ignores the big picture.   He ignores, again, the big picture that the NOAA Corps are doing  serious work for our country, are commissioned officers, one of our  seven commissioned officer corps, and are not recognized the same as  the other six, to include the Public Health Service, which is a  commissioned officer corps and is entitled to the same benefits as the  Army, Navy, Marines, Air Force, and Coast Guard.   I think, in all honesty--and I don't think he means to do this--he  does a great disservice to the people who are serving in the NOAA Corps  by some of his statements, because these people are trying to do their  best for our country.   I am not sure that the Member has ever spent time on a NOAA ship in  the high seas as I have, but if you do that, you know that there is  nothing really to distinguish them from any of their fellow officers in  any of the other services.   It would take a lot of time to go through each of my colleague's 9 or  10 cherry-picked arguments. I want to make a couple of quick comments  and then some big picture observations.   First of all, if I am not mistaken, the GAO report that he refers to  is dated 1996, a whole generation ago. That report itself was disputed  by subsequent studies and, I submit, is really no longer relevant.   He says, twice: Why should we greatly expand the unprecedented  benefits that the NOAA Corps receives?   There is a very simple answer to that: Because they don't get today  what the other six do. All we are doing today in expanding is bringing  them up to the same level as the other six corps.   He says that the mission of NOAA is a minor mission, so why should we  reward them--I suppose is what he is saying--with the same promotion  benefits, the same educational benefits, the same retirement benefits,  the same respect as the other six.   I would say to him, first of all, because that mission is worthy of  that treatment. And, number one, if he is referring to the GAO report  from a generation ago, the NOAA Corps does so much more today.   I think we would all agree that the mission that the NOAA Corps works  on, which is the basic health and quality of our oceans, of our  atmosphere, of our ability to predict the weather, of our ability to  protect our shorelines, of our ability to protect and sustain our  fisheries, is so much greater than it ever was.   He complains that some of the members of the NOAA Corps spend time  onshore. Is that any different from the Navy? I don't think the Navy  has all of its officers out at sea all the time, and neither does the  NOAA Corps. The Army doesn't have all of its officers overseas in  battle zones.   He says a number of times: This is a 55 percent increase in the size  of the corps.   Yes, it does authorize an increase in the size of the NOAA Corps from  320 to a maximum of 500--by the way, the last authorization, as already  noted, was almost 20 years ago--but that increase is subject to two  conditions: First of all, it can only be increased on the certification  of need by the Secretary of Commerce; and it is subject to  congressional oversight, both general oversight authority and, most  importantly, funding.   So there are lots of steps between 320 and 500, but this gives them  the authority to move if it is needed. Frankly, I believe that we  should move it up, but that is up to us to decide with the Secretary of  Commerce and with the Congress.   He says: Well, we are not building any new NOAA ships.   Well, I think we should build a lot more new NOAA ships. I believe  that NOAA's mission is going to be--I think that when we look back on  today 25 years from now at the size of this effort for our Federal  Government, we are going to say to ourselves: That was so insufficient  given the challenge that we faced.   There is a dire need for additional NOAA-related research, NOAA- related activities across this country, across this world. So the fact  that we have not authorized and built a sufficient number of new NOAA  ships for its mission is no reason to treat the NOAA Officer Corps  differently from the other six services.   My colleague rightly raises the issues NOAA has had of sexual assault  within its ranks, as have other uniformed services, and, as he points  out as well, this Congress responded with an act specific to the NOAA  situation. This bill goes further and strengthens that act. So we are  responding to the concern in Congress, as has NOAA itself.    Finally, he seems to have some continuing issues with a staff member  from NOAA assigned to the committee. It is not unusual, of course, for  departments in the administration to second members for some work. We  have had fellows do it all the time. But if that is an issue we have to  look at, that is an issue we have to look at, but that is not an issue  that should stand in the way of a constructive and fair adjustment of  the benefits and position afforded to NOAA officers.   I would conclude by going back to the fact that, if the gentleman's  concerns are so widespread, if his concerns are so deep, then why do we  have the principal military uniformed services associations of our  country supporting this bill without qualification?   I refer to the Military Officers Association of America. I also refer  to The Military Coalition, 5.5 million members, consisting of--and I am  not going to read all their names because I think it is about 30 here.  I will just read maybe the first 10 or so--the Air Force Association,  the Air Force Sergeants Association, the Army Aviation Association of  America, the Association of Military Surgeons, the Association of the  United States Navy, the Blinded Veterans Association, the Coast Guard,  the Public Health Service, the Fleet Reserve Association, the Gold Star  Wives of America, the Iraq Afghanistan Veterans Association.   It is very clear that military officers and their community view  their NOAA colleagues and the corps as being treated substantially  unfairly in the big picture and want them to be afforded, again, the  same benefits, the same respect that is due the other six services.  That is why, Mr. Speaker, we have a situation where the Senate passed  this bill, a Republican Senator's bill, by unanimous consent. That is  why this House should pass this bill, as well, and send it to the  President.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, the ranking member, for his  passion on this matter.   I think he is wrong, and I think the entire Senate thinks he is  wrong, and I think the majority of this House thinks he is wrong. He  is, of course, entitled to his opinion, but I think that the statement  that this bill is wrong is not borne out by the facts; it is not borne  out by the sentiment, again, of the broader community.   If there is a problem with NOAA or any other commissioned officer  corps, the way to solve that problem is not to kill the corps itself.  The way to solve that problem is not to deprive it of the resources  that it needs to fix its problem and to continue its mission.   For me to accept the ranking member's argument would be for me to  accept that, in fact, NOAA itself is not relevant, and I don't believe  that. I believe NOAA is entirely relevant, and it needs to be staffed  by people who are incentivized to be recruited, who are incentivized to  stay and to want to do their job, and who are recognized as such.   This is not about the military, per se. I would disagree with his  characterization that the NOAA Corps does not perform a military  function. It is certainly quasi-military in many ways, but that is not  what this is about. This is about fairly recognizing one of our seven  commissioned officer corps organizations in our country.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 3682) to provide for greater consultation between the Federal  Government and the governing bodies of land grant-mercedes and acequias  in New Mexico and to provide for a process for recognition of the  historic-traditional boundaries of land grant-mercedes, and for other  purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3682         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Land Grant-Mercedes       Traditional Use Recognition and Consultation Act''.       SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.         In this Act:        (1) Acequia.--The term ``acequia'' has the meaning of the       term ``community ditch'' as that term is construed under New       Mexico Stat. 73-2-27.        (2) Community user.--The term ``community user'' means an       heir (as defined under the laws of the State) of a qualified       land grant-merced.        (3) Governing body.--The term ``governing body'' means the       board of trustees authorized under State law with the       control, care, and management of a qualified land grant-      merced.        (4) Historical-traditional use.--The term ``historical-      traditional use'' means, for a qualified land grant-merced,       for noncommercial benefit--        (A) the use of water;        (B) religious or cultural use and protection;        (C) gathering herbs;        (D) gathering wood products;        (E) gathering flora or botanical products;        (F) grazing, to the extent that grazing has traditionally       been carried out on the land, as determined by the Secretary       concerned in consultation with the governing body of the       affected land grant-merced;        (G) hunting or fishing;        (H) soil or rock gathering; and        (I) any other traditional activity for noncommercial       benefit that--        (i) has a sustainable beneficial community use, as       determined by the Secretary concerned in consultation with       the governing body of the affected land grant-merced;        (ii) supports the long-term cultural and socioeconomic       integrity of the community, as determined by the Secretary       concerned in consultation with the governing body of the       affected land grant-merced; and        (iii) is agreed to in writing by the Secretary concerned       and the governing body of the qualified land grant-merced.        (5) Indian tribe.--The term ``Indian Tribe'' has the       meaning given the term in section 4 of the Indian Self-      Determination and Education Assistance Act (25 U.S.C. 5304).

(7) Secretary concerned.--The term ``Secretary concerned''       means the relevant Secretary of the Department of Agriculture       or the Department of the Interior, with respect to land under       the jurisdiction of that Secretary.        (8) State.--The term ``State'' means the State of New        Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3682, sponsored by our  friend and colleague, Representative Lujan of New Mexico.   This bill would support land grant communities and acequias across  New Mexico and Texas by providing guidance on certain allowable land  uses.   Since the end of the Spanish-American War and the signing of the  Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, these communities have faced challenges  accessing basic resources like fuel wood and grazing land and clarity  on their infrastructure maintenance obligations.   These challenges continue to the present day, and this bill would  help provide some certainty and clarity in order to better support  these communities and hopefully improve relations with Federal land  managers.   I want to thank Representative Lujan for his tireless service and  support on behalf of land grant communities and acequia owners, and I  urge all of my colleagues to vote in support of H.R. 3682.   I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1900     Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from New  Mexico (Mr. Lujan).    Madam Speaker, I am very happy to yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from New Mexico (Ms. Haaland), chair of the subcommittee of  jurisdiction, National Parks, Forests, and Public Lands, my friend and  colleague.     Madam Speaker, I certainly endorse and agree with my  colleague's comments on Mr. Lujan's service in the House. The House's  loss is the Senate's gain.   And I would also note that I personally enjoyed Mr. Lujan's personal  testimony from an acequia before the committee. That is the way to do  it, where you have a real sense of what the actions are that you are  taking.   I urge passage of this legislation, and I yield back the balance of  my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4153) to amend the Indian Health Care Improvement Act to  authorize urban Indian organizations to enter into arrangements for the  sharing of  [[Page H6127]]  medical services and facilities, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4153         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Health Care Access for Urban       Native Veterans Act''.       SEC. 2. SHARING ARRANGEMENTS WITH FEDERAL AGENCIES.         Section 405 of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act (25       U.S.C. 1645) is amended--        (1) in subsection (a)(1), by inserting ``urban Indian       organizations,'' before ``and tribal organizations''; and        (2) in subsection (c)--        (A) by inserting ``urban Indian organization,'' before ``or       tribal organization''; and        (B) by inserting ``an urban Indian organization,'' before       ``or a tribal organization''.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, H.R. 4153, the Health Care Access for Urban Native  Veterans Act, will ensure that Native American veterans have equal  access to healthcare, regardless of their location of residence, by  expanding Department of Veterans Affairs, VA, funding to include urban  Indian health centers.   The Indian Health Service acts as the primary Federal agency  responsible for providing healthcare to federally recognized Indian and  Alaska Native communities. Currently, there are three types of  facilities that make up the IHS system: Federally-operated facilities,  tribally-operated facilities, and urban Indian organization-operated,  UIO, facilities.   As opposed to the federally-operated and tribally-operated  facilities, which are often located in remote areas, UIO facilities  have been established in larger cities in order to accommodate the  large populations of tribal members located in urban areas.   By law, a Native veteran is eligible to receive services under both  the VA and IHS and can choose which one to use at any given time.  Section 405 of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act, or IHCIA,  authorizes the VA to reimburse federally-operated and tribally-operated  IHS facilities for any services that they provide to eligible Native  veterans.   To that end, the VA has entered into one national reimbursement  agreement that encompasses 74 federally-operated IHS facilities, as  well as 114 individual reimbursement agreements with tribally-operated  IHS sites.   However, because Section 405 does not explicitly reference UIOs,  these facilities are excluded from receiving any reimbursements from  the VA. This has severely hampered the ability of urban Indian health  organizations to properly care for the Native veterans living in urban  centers and has forced these veterans to travel great distances to  reach an IHS facility or, sadly, to abstain from treatment altogether.   We can all agree that Native veterans should have equal access to  healthcare, regardless of where they choose to reside. As such, H.R.  4153 will bring parity to the IHS system by allowing UIOs to enter into  reimbursement agreements with the VA.   I want to thank the sponsor of the bill, Representative Ro Khanna  from California, for advocating on behalf of Native veterans  everywhere, and I urge quick adoption of this bipartisan legislation.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I urge adoption of this measure, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 7045) to require the Secretary of Agriculture to conduct a  study on lands that could be included in a National Forest in Hawai'i,  and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 7045         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. HAWAI'I NATIONAL FOREST STUDY.         (a) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to identify lands       within the study area that would--        (1) support the conservation of biodiversity not found       elsewhere in the National Forest System;        (2) support or expand the research mission of the Institute       of Pacific Islands Forestry;        (3) promote shared stewardship with local communities,       including indigenous populations, the State of Hawai'i, and       non-profit groups; and        (4) support or expand the international programs of the       Forest Service related to conservation of forest ecosystems,       sustainable forestry, protection of threatened, endangered,       and migratory species, controlling the spread of invasive       species, international reforestation, and other forest       restoration efforts.        (b) Study Required.--        (1) In general.--Not later than 3 years after the date of       the enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall conduct a       study to identify available land within the study area that       could be included in a National Forest in Hawai'i.        (2) Coordination requirement.--The Secretary shall conduct       the study under paragraph (1) in coordination the Hawai'i       Department of Land and Natural Resources.        (3) Consultation requirement.--In carrying out the study       under paragraph (1), the Secretary--        (A) shall consult with--        (i) the Hawai'i Department of Land and Natural Resources;       and        (ii) the Hawai'i Department of Agriculture; and        (B) may consult with such other governmental or nonprofit       entities as the Secretary determines appropriate.        (4) Report.--Not later than 3 years after the date of       enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall submit a report to       the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the Senate       and the Committee on Natural Resources of the House of       Representatives that identifies--        (A) available land within the study area that could be       included in a National Forest in Hawai'i;        (B) the ownership of the land within the study area;        (C) any undeveloped land in the study area that may be at       risk of development; and        (D) any actions that could be carried out to preserve the       open and undeveloped character of the land within the study       area.        (c) Effect.--Nothing in this section authorizes the       Secretary to take any action that would affect the use of any       land not owned by the United States.        (d) Definitions.--In this section:        (1) Available land.--The term ``available land'' means any       land within the study areas that is--  [[Page H6128]]         (A) Federally owned;        (B) managed by a Federal land management agency in       partnership with a non-Federal entity; or        (C) land not described in subparagraph (A) or (B) that       fulfills the purpose of this section, as determined by the       Secretary.        (2) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary       of Agriculture, acting through the Chief of the Forest       Service.        (3) Study area.--The term ``study area'' means the islands       of Hawai'i, Maui, Moloka'i, Lana'i, O'ahu and Kaua'i in the       State of Hawai'i.        (4) Undeveloped land.--The term ``undeveloped land'' means       land--        (A) that is located within the study area;        (B) that is free or primarily free of structures; and        (C) the development of which is likely to affect adversely       the scenic, research, wildlife, or recreational value of the       study area.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of my bill, H.R. 7045. This  legislation would require the Secretary of Agriculture, in coordination  with the Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources, to conduct a  study to identify lands in the State of Hawaii that merit inclusion in  the National Forest System.   Hawaii is the most isolated island chain and one of the most  ecologically diverse places in the world. Within these constrained  borders, we have 10 of the 13 world climate zones and ecosystems,  ranging from the deserts to the tropics, where plants and animals that  found their way to Hawaii evolved like nowhere else. The study would  consider how a Hawaii national forest, which we do not currently have,  could contribute to the conservation of this biodiversity not found  elsewhere in the National Forest System while supporting the research  mission of the Institute of Pacific Islands Forestry.   My bill provides the first step in establishing a national forest in  Hawaii. It would help inventory where Hawaii's native koa, ohia, and  sandalwood forests can be conserved and expanded for cultural and  commercial practices. It would help identify where cultural sites could  be better conserved and access expanded to the public and  practitioners. It would help provide the basis to bring together local  stakeholders to move forward the conversation of how to responsibly  establish a national forest in Hawaii in a manner that will benefit  both Hawaii's island communities and the National Forest Service.   As we continue to identify solutions to our climate and biodiversity  crises, I hope we can all see the value in taking this step toward  protecting Hawaii's unique forest resources and our native species.   Madam Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to support this bill.    I yield to the gentleman from Utah.    Yes.    Madam Speaker, I accept the offer of Mr. Ranking Member. I  will look the gentleman up in 20 years.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 8810) to establish a national program to identify and reduce  losses from landslide hazards, to establish a national 3D Elevation  Program, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, the National Landslide Preparedness Act sponsored by  my colleague, Ms. DelBene, would establish a national landslide hazards  reduction program through the United States Geological Survey to better  identify landslide risks and to improve emergency preparedness for  communities. This bill also directs USGS to implement a 3D elevation  program to update and produce high-resolution elevation data across the  country.   The House passed a version of this legislation by voice vote last  year, but after further negotiation with both the majority and the  minority in the Senate, we have agreed to a few changes in the language  and are passing this revised bill to allow the Senate to move this  compromise to the President before it adjourns.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this important  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Washington (Ms. DelBene).    Madam Speaker, I urge adoption of this measure, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1380) to amend the Lacey Act Amendments of 1981 to clarify  provisions enacted by the Captive Wildlife Safety Act, to further the  conservation of certain wildlife species, and for other purposes, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1380         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 1380, the Big  Cat Public Safety Act.   At the beginning of this hectic year, many Americans were introduced  to the issue before us today and this legislation for the first time  through the ``Tiger King,'' which in addition to a plethora of colorful  real-life characters also shined a spotlight on the dark side of  keeping lions, tigers, and other big cats in captivity.   The Big Cat Public Safety Act ends the ownership of big cats as pets  and prohibits exhibitors from allowing public contact with big cats,  including cubs.   In 2003, Congress unanimously passed the Captive Wildlife Safety Act,  which amended the Lacey Act to prohibit the import, export, buying,  selling, transport, receiving, or acquisition of big cats across States  to the U.S. border. However, the existing law did not include  prohibitions for the private possession or breeding of big cats.   Currently, State laws vary quite a bit. Some States have no  restrictions; some simply require registration; and some completely  prohibit ownership of big cats as pets.   The Big Cat Public Safety Act builds on the Captive Wildlife Safety  Act by making it illegal to privately possess or breed lions, tigers,  leopards, cheetahs, jaguars, cougars, or any hybrid. The bill is  narrowly focused on privately owned animals and includes exemptions for  exhibitors with U.S. Department of Agriculture class C licenses, such  as zoos, State universities, and sanctuaries.   This bill, championed by my colleague, Representative   Mike Quigley,  along with an astounding 230 cosponsors, is a commonsense solution to  address public safety and animal abuse concerns. It enjoys wide  bipartisan support, and it is time we passed it into law.   It is unknown how many big cats, including tigers, lions, jaguars,  leopards, cougars, and hybrids, are currently kept in private ownership  in the United States, but estimates are in the range of 5,000 to  10,000. That means an average of up to 200 big cats are in private  ownership in every State in America.   I don't know about you, Madam Speaker, but I wouldn't feel safe with  my children or grandchildren living next door to a tiger, nor does that  seem humane for the animals whose ancestors roamed vast expanses of the  savannahs and jungles.   As we saw in ``Tiger King,'' the top priority for private big cat  owners is not the best interests of animals or public safety but rather  greed, profit, or glory.   Since 1990, there have been around 300 dangerous incidents involving  big cats in the United States--including one just today--that have  resulted in human injuries, mauling, and even death. When these  incidents occur, first responders are also put at risk since they are  not trained or equipped to handle situations involving big cats.   Madam Speaker, I hope you can all agree with me that the private  ownership of big cats opens the door for rampant animal abuse and also  presents a dangerous and significant risk to public safety.   This bill is endorsed by over 27 organizations, including the  Association of Zoos and Aquariums and the National Sheriffs'  Association. Of special note as well is that the Zoological Association  of America, which previously opposed this measure, has withdrawn its  opposition and is now neutral because its board has now banned public  contact with big cats at its accredited zoos.   Please join me in voting for this legislation to stop animal abuse  and bad actors like those we saw in ``Tiger King.'' In the midst of a  roller coaster of a year, here is one thing we can do to reduce the  mayhem.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Quigley).    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to my colleague from  Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I appreciate, again, the comments from the ranking member, but I  think he is out of step with the majority in this House, given the  bipartisan nature of this particular legislation.   A couple of quick points to answer some of his objections.   First of all, as I mentioned earlier, the Zoological Association of  America has withdrawn its opposition to this bill. The Zoological  Association of America, contrary to the statement, is not opposed to  this bill.   Second, he talks about the guidelines by the USDA being sufficient.  They are obviously not sufficient when the status quo across this  country still has such a tremendous and deleterious impact on animal  welfare, as well as presents a continued risk for public safety. As was  noted in some of the comments earlier, in fact, we have a patchwork of  regulation across this country; whereas, it is time for us to have one  uniform standard across this country that would apply everywhere.   He complains that this bill is a matter of special interest. I would  submit, if the special interests are those special interests that are  concerned about the welfare of animals and are concerned about public  safety, then those are good special interests to be aligned with.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
