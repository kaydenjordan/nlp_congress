 Madam Speaker, the Democrats forgot two key things. They  forgot about the facts, and they forgot about fairness. Four facts will  never change: We have the call transcript, no quid pro quo; we have the  two guys on the call who have repeatedly said there was no pressure and  there was no pushing; we have the fact Ukraine didn't know aid was held  up at the time of the phone call; and, most importantly, Ukraine took  no action and no announcement of investigation to get the aid released.   But Democrats don't care. They don't care about the facts, and they  sure don't care about the process.   There was no subpoena power for Republicans and no Republican  witnesses. During the depositions Republicans were prevented from  getting all their questions answered, but Democrats got every one of  their questions, the witnesses responded to every one of theirs, but  not Republicans'. The chairman wouldn't let them.   Of course, there was the whistleblower, the anonymous whistleblower,  with no firsthand knowledge, who was biased against the President, who  worked for Joe Biden, and who was never compelled to testify--the guy  who started it all.   This is really about that the President has been driving these guys  crazy because he is getting things done. He is doing what he said he  was going to do. He is having results. Taxes have been cut, regulations  have been reduced, unemployment is at its lowest level in 50 years, the  economy is growing, Gorsuch and Kavanaugh are on the Court, we are out  of the Iran deal, the embassy is in Jerusalem, hostages are home from  North Korea, and a new NAFTA agreement coming tomorrow.   But guess what, Madam Speaker?   When you drain the swamp, the swamp fights back. And they started  attacking the President before the election even. On July 31, 2016,  they opened the Russian investigation. The FBI spied on four American  citizens associated with the Trump campaign. The FBI took the dossier  to the FISA court. The dossier they already knew was false, they took  to the court and lied to the court 17 times.   Guess what, Madam Speaker?   Three days ago on national television, even James Comey had to admit  the FBI was wrong. Yesterday--1 day ago--the FISA court sends the FBI a  letter and says: Straighten up and get your act together when it comes  to the FISA application process.   Think about this: the attacks started then, and they have continued  right up until today. But, Madam Speaker, I want you to think about  something: the individual who said that the FISA process was fine, the  dossier was fine, and the Russian investigation was fine, that same  individual ran the impeachment process. That same individual's staff  met with the whistleblower, that same individual is the only guy in  Congress who knows who the whistleblower is for sure, and that same  individual released the phone records of the President's personal  attorney, released the phone records of a member of the press, and  released the phone records of a Republican Member of the United States  Congress.   This process has been unfair, it has been dangerous, and it has been  harmful to our country.   Democrats have never accepted the will of the American people. Nancy  Pelosi made that clear 4 weeks ago when she called the President of the  United States an imposter. The will of we the people, the 63 million  folks who voted for this guy and made him President in an electoral  college landslide, they never accepted that fact.   We are less than 11 months away from the election. Let the American  people decide who should be President. Let the American people decide.                                time  1845
