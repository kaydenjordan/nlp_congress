 Mr. Speaker, the Supreme Court is supposed to be above  politics. Justice is supposed to be blind.   But rather than nominate a fair and balanced jurist to the Supreme  Court, the man in the White House has nominated a right-wing operative  to replace Justice Kennedy.   Not only that, the nominee is someone who apparently believes that  the President is above the law.   Make no mistake. Judge Brett Kavanaugh is no Justice Kennedy.   Whether we are talking about the disgraceful Starr Commission or Bush  vs. Gore or the scandalous George W. Bush administration, Judge  Kavanaugh has been there. His hands are covered in right-wing muck.   This nomination threatens the rights and liberties the people of this  Nation have died for. Confirming Judge Kavanaugh would destroy Roe vs.  Wade. It would put ObamaCare at risk, and it would threaten the rights  of same-sex couples to marry.   The American people demand justice, and justice is fair, not a  justice who is full of hot air.                            ____________________
