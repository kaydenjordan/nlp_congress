 Mr. President, today, the Senate will pass an  important measure to provide relief for communities that are struggling  to rebuild after the natural disasters that have affected many  different parts of our country. Soon, this emergency funding  legislation will be on its way to the President for his signature.   With these new resources, Federal aid workers from FEMA and the rest  of the administration can continue their critical recovery operations,  including search and rescue missions, debris removal, and  infrastructure repair, as well as providing much needed assistance to  individuals and to families.   I will continue to monitor these disaster response efforts, and I  will continue to engage with leaders both in Washington and on the  ground. The Senate will also continue doing its part to help the  victims recover.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on another matter, as we continue our  work in the Senate, we look forward to hearing the President's  perspectives on how to advance our shared agenda, particularly the  upcoming debate on bringing tax relief, economic growth, and jobs to  Americans through tax reform.   Last week, the Senate passed a comprehensive, responsible budget that  will help put the government on a path to balance and help put our  economy on a road to robust growth. This week, the House plans to bring  the budget to the floor for passage by Thursday. Once they pass it, we  will have important legislative tools to help our economy grow through  tax reform.   As we all know, after years of an economy that failed to live up to  its full potential, the time is now to pass tax reform so that we can  get America going again and growing again. We want to make taxes lower,  simpler, and fairer. We want to close loopholes that are exploited by  the wealthy. We want to make it easier to create new jobs in America  and keep them here. In short, we want to take more money out of  Washington's pockets and put more in yours.   These are the ideas that drive tax reform. They are shared by the  President. They are shared by Americans in both political parties. They  should be shared by Senators of both political parties, as well, and  for many years, they actually were. The former chairman of the Finance  Committee, Senator Wyden, called our current Tax Code an  ``anticompetitive mess.'' The senior Senator from Michigan, Ms.  Stabenow, expressed her concern for a tax code that incentivizes jobs  to be shipped overseas, and our friend, the Democratic leader, wrote  about our Tax Code's failure to help American workers compete.   Many Democrats called for action to get tax reform done. I hope that  our Democratic friends will work with us now in a serious way to  actually do it. After all, it is not as if the need for tax reform has  changed since our friends  [[Page S6720]]  made these statements as recently as a few years ago. The only thing  that has changed is the occupant of the White House. That is the only  difference. So let's get this done. The American people are counting on  us.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on one final matter, in addition to our  important legislative priorities, the Senate is also working hard to  confirm the President's excellent judicial nominees.   Last night, I filed cloture on two nominees for U.S. district courts.   Scott Palk has been nominated to serve as a district judge for the  Western District of Oklahoma. He has served in multiple roles in the  U.S. attorney's office in prosecuting organized crime and terrorism  cases, and the Senate Judiciary Committee sent his nomination to the  floor with an overwhelming bipartisan vote.   Another nominee, Trevor McFadden, was voted out of the Judiciary  Committee with no opposition at all. He has been tapped to serve as a  district judge for the District of Columbia, and as a former police  officer, Mr. McFadden will bring a wealth of law enforcement experience  to the bench.   The Senate will vote on both of these nominees this week, and then we  will continue working to confirm President Trump's outstanding judicial  nominees. I look forward to supporting these nominees, and I urge my  colleagues to join me in voting to confirm them.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, colleagues, we regret to hear that our  friend from Arizona will conclude his Senate service at the end of his  6-year term.   I would like to say, on behalf of myself and I think many of my  colleagues, we just witnessed a speech from a very fine man--a man who  clearly brings high principles to the office every day and does what he  believes is in the best interest of Arizona and the country.   I am grateful the Senator from Arizona will be here for another year  and a half. We have big things to try to accomplish for the American  people. From my perspective, the Senator from Arizona has been a great  team player, always trying to get a constructive outcome no matter what  the issue before us.   So I thank the Senator from Arizona for his service, which will  continue, thankfully, for another year and a half, and for the  opportunity to listen to his remarks today    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that  notwithstanding rule XXII, all postcloture time now be considered  expired, all pending motions and amendments be withdrawn, except for  the motion to concur, and that Senator Paul be recognized to speak for  up to 5 minutes and then make a budget point of order; that myself or  my designee be recognized to make a motion to waive; that following  disposition of the motion to waive, the Senate vote on the motion to  concur in the House amendment to the Senate amendment to H.R. 2266; and  that if the motion is agreed to, the motion to reconsider be considered  made and laid upon the table.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  be in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak  therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text  of the resolution be printed in the Record.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        On page S6770, on October 24, 2017, in the third column, the  following appears:  Mr.  President . . .    ========================= END NOTE =========================     There being no objection, the text of the resolution was ordered to  be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S.
