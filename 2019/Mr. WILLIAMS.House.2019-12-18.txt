 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me  time.   Today's vote to impeach the duly elected President of the United  States is truly historical. However, its unique place in history is not  for the reasons the Democratic Party and their mainstream media  overlords are so desperately trying to convey.   Today, will be remembered as the day that the Democrats, claiming a  false moral supremacy over the desire of the American people, executed  a deliberate and orchestrated plan to overturn a Presidential election.   It will be the first time in history that a party paraded out their  Ivy League academics to explain to 31 States and almost 63 million  people that their voice should not be heard and why their votes should  not be counted.   I pray for our Nation every day, but today, I am praying for my  colleagues across the aisle who arrived at this partisan and self- directed fork in the road and chose the road never before traveled and  one that has a dead end.   Donald J. Trump is our President, chosen by the American people, fair  and square. As we say in Texas: ``It's a done deal.'' Democrats'  attempt to change history will never undo that.   May God bless the greatest country in the world, the United States of  America.
