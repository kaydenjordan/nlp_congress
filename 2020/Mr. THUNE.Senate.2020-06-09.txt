 Madam President, as I begin this morning, I would like to  just briefly comment on the outlandish idea of dismantling police  departments that has seen substantial coverage in recent days. While  there are exceptions, the vast majority of our Nation's police officers  are men and women of character who care deeply about protecting  everyone in their communities, and they provide an essential service--a  service that we cannot do without.   The idea that any city can exist without a police force is so absurd  that it is difficult to believe anyone is seriously discussing it. We  absolutely need to look at policies at the State, local, and Federal  levels to ensure that we are holding police officers to the highest  standards, and I hope we will be having serious bipartisan discussions  on these issues in the coming weeks.   I know at least one Senate Republican has already introduced  legislation to require law enforcement agencies to report the use of  lethal force. But bipartisan discussions will not be forwarded by  extreme and irresponsible proposals like abolishing the police  departments that help protect our communities. I hope that such  proposals will not gain any traction here in the U.S. Senate.                          Business Before the Senate    Madam President, we are very busy--hard at work--here in the Senate.  Our main business on the floor this week will be the Great American  Outdoors Act, legislation crafted by Senators Daines and Gardner and  others, that will help address the significant maintenance backlog in  our national parks, among other things.   Out of the limelight, Senators will also be discussing how best to  respond at the Federal level to the tragedy of George Floyd's killing.   Responding to the coronavirus continues to be at the top of our  agenda. Right now, we are focused on monitoring the implementation of  the $2.4 trillion that Congress has provided so that we can identify  what more we need to do to fight this virus.   Our committees play a leading role in this, and they have kept up a  steady stream of hearings examining implementation and identifying next  steps.   This week, we have no fewer than eight--eight--committee hearings on  various aspects of the COVID crisis, including unemployment insurance,  a Senate Finance Committee hearing later today that I will be  participating in, reopening schools, and the Federal Government's  procurement and distribution strategies.   The Democratic leader has spent a lot of time on the floor lately,  complaining about what is happening in the Senate. He is, apparently,  not happy that we are in session, and he claims we are not doing  anything on the coronavirus.   Well, on the first point, I would just like to say that the majority  leader brought the Senate back into session because we have  responsibilities that we need to fulfill. One of the issues that we  have to respond to, as a matter of our constitutional obligation, is  the issue of dealing with nominations, both to judicial and executive  branches of our government. We continue to have to do that.   There are important vacancies that we need to fill, some important  national security vacancies, judicial vacancies. Last week, we  confirmed the inspector general for the pandemic, somebody who was  confirmed by a 75-to-15 vote.   Now, it is possible that we could do those and not be here. The  Democratic leader has said on various occasions he doesn't know why we  are here doing these types of nominations. Well, the reason we are here  doing these types of nominations is that they insist on it.   Even in cases where the nominee has broad bipartisan support--in some  cases, overwhelming support--we continue to have to stay here and go  through the procedural roadblocks that Democrats throw up to getting  these nominees across the finish line.   In fact, if you look at the historical context of nominations, we are  living in unprecedented times. The Democrats have filibustered now-- totaled--314 nominees that President Trump has put forward. For all of  the previous Presidents combined--all of the previous Presidents  combined in our Nation's history--only on 244 occasions did cloture  have to be invoked to shut down a filibuster on nominees.   Think about that. In the first 3\1/2\ years of President Trump's  term, we now have had 314 nominees--judicial or executive-- filibustered. In the rest of the history of the U.S. Senate, even if  you go back and say that the advent of the filibuster is only in the  last half century or so. Think about that: 244 times, throughout all of  the Presidencies combined--combined--in our history, but this President  has seen his nominees filibustered 314 times.   So if the Democratic leader wants to know why we are here doing  nominees, that is why. We have to. It is our job. It is our  constitutional responsibility. If the minority continues to make it as  difficult as they have and continues to filibuster and force the leader  to file cloture on all these nominees, we have to be here to vote. That  is our job, and that is why we are here.   Of course, there is also the work, as I said, of responding to the  coronavirus. There is also work we have to do that doesn't stop just  because there is a pandemic.   If you look at the Paycheck Protection Program, when it ran out of  money, it took way too long to convince Democrats to do something as  simple as appropriate more funding for pandemic-stricken small  businesses.   Funding our government, protecting our Nation, making sure these  important positions in the government, as I mentioned, are filled--we  just can't skip those things because of the coronavirus, and they have  made it increasingly difficult--virtually impossible--for us to do any  of this by unanimous consent while the Senate was out of session.   As for the Democratic leader's charge that the Senate hasn't been  doing anything on coronavirus, as I pointed out, that is just a simply  ridiculous charge to make. Coronavirus has been at the forefront of  the Senate activity since we returned in May.    Our committees have held a constant stream of hearings examining  implementation of the coronavirus assistance that we have already  passed and looking forward to what will be needed in the future.   As I mentioned, last week, we confirmed the nomination of Brian D.  Miller to be Special Inspector General for Pandemic Recovery at the  Treasury Department, a key position with responsibility for ensuring  the coronavirus funding is spent properly.   We also passed last week legislation to update the Paycheck  Protection Program to give additional flexibility to small businesses.  Clearly--clearly--the Senate has been making coronavirus a priority.   I would argue that much of what we have already done is having the  desired result. The jobs numbers that came out last week are  encouraging. Obviously, we have a lot of work to do. We have to keep it  in perspective. It is no time to be spiking the football. But those job  numbers were encouraging.   I think one of the reasons we had those strong numbers is because we  have a very resilient economy, No. 1, and, No. 2, because of policies  we have put in place--tax and regulatory policies that have encouraged  businesses to invest, consumers to spend.  [[Page S2775]]    The PPP program, the Paycheck Protection Program, obviously, I think  has done a lot of good out there. It has kept, literally, millions of  businesses in business. It has kept, literally, tens of millions of  workers employed, and that is exactly what we wanted to see happen.   Those dollars were among the best spent dollars, I think, of all the  several trillion dollars that we put out there. My State of South  Dakota is a good example. We have over 21,000 businesses that have  benefited from the Paycheck Protection Program, to the tune of about  $1.6 billion. I bet, if you look at the numbers in every other State  around the country, you would see the same thing. It is one of the  reasons, I believe, that we are seeing some encouraging economic  numbers and employment numbers. Let's hope that we can continue to  build on that.   I guess that when the Democratic leader complains that the Senate  hasn't been doing anything on coronavirus, what he actually means to  say is the Senate hasn't passed another $3 trillion bill. The House of  Representatives, the Democrat majority there, in a very partisan way  with zero Republican support and, in fact, some Democrats opposing it,  passed another $3 trillion.   Well, it is true we haven't done that here in the Senate. It is  because we don't believe we should be playing fast and loose with the  American people's money like that. As I pointed out, Congress has  already provided $2.4 trillion in funding to respond to the virus,  which is a staggering amount of money, equal to roughly half of the  2020 Federal budget.   It was money we needed to spend, and we were glad to do it. We will  probably have to spend more before this crisis is over, but we have to  make sure that we are appropriating what is really needed and not  mindlessly throwing around trillions of dollars. The way we do that is  by monitoring the implementation of the funding that we have already  put out there, that has already been delivered, which is exactly what  we have been doing.   I have to say, for a lot of the funding that has been authorized,  some of it hasn't even been put out there yet. The $175 billion that we  have authorized to help healthcare providers--hospitals, nursing homes,  those folks on the frontline--only about $75 billion of that has been  made available already. So less than 50 percent of those dollars are  even out there yet.   It is pretty hard to decide whether you are going to throw more money  at something before you have determined whether the money you have  already spent is having the desired effect and whether there is a need  for more. So we need to see where that money goes before we decide what  else we need to appropriate.   I have said it before, and I will say it again. Every dollar that we  have provided to fight the coronavirus is borrowed money, a significant  addition to an already massive amount of national debt.   Democrats may like to pretend that we can continue to borrow more and  more money forever, but the truth is we cannot. The greater our  national debt, the greater the threat it represents to the health of  our economy, not to mention the future of today's younger workers.   So while we may need to borrow more money to meet our needs before  the crisis is over, it is crucial that we keep that borrowing as low as  possible and spend only what is absolutely necessary.   So far, the Democrats' major proposal for the next phase of our  coronavirus response is a $3 trillion bill produced by the House of  Representatives that mentions the word ``cannabis'' more often than it  mentions the word ``job,'' which I think tells you all you need to know  about how seriously some are taking this issue.   If Democrats really wanted to move additional relief forward, they  would be sitting down with Republicans to develop reasonable  legislation that actually has a chance of passing Congress and being  signed by the President, but they are not. Instead, they are proposing  outlandish, far-left messaging bills and engaging in the kind of  partisanship that has become the modus operandi during this  administration.   While I am talking about Democrats' unhelpfulness, I just want to  mention the Democratic leader's offensive suggestion on the floor last  week that the judges that we are confirming in the Senate will not  protect civil rights. This is, unfortunately, right in line with their  general attitude that the only legitimate judges are Democrat judges,  but it is, nevertheless, particularly irresponsible to be fanning the  flames of division in this country right now by suggesting,  untruthfully, that only Democrats' preferred judicial candidates will  show a commitment to upholding civil rights.   The continued partisanship, even during a national crisis, has been  pretty disheartening. But I am a hopeful guy, and I like to think that  at least some Democrats are more interested in actually helping  Americans than in far-left messaging bills, and I would invite those  Democrats to work with us.   There is a lot more that we need to do before this pandemic is over,  and Republicans are committed to getting our country through this  crisis and to helping Americans thrive on the other side.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 3918         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.
