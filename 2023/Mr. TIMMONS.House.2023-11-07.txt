 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor Mary Ann Riley of  Inman, South Carolina, for her decades of service to our community and  dedication to the South Carolina Republican Party.   Ms. Riley moved to South Carolina in 1982. That same year she began  attending community meetings, getting involved in local campaigns, and  was appointed president of the Spartanburg County Republican Women  where she has served ever since.   More than politics, Ms. Riley is a major contributor to her local  pregnancy center and supports upstate veterans undergoing hospice care.  She is also active in her church and other organizations that work to  assist our fellow South Carolinians every single day.   A former teacher, her life's work has been to make the world a better  place for her students, her neighbors, and future generations.   Ms. Riley is a true public servant who has made a significant and  lasting impact on South Carolinians. I thank Mary Ann for over 30 years  of service to the people of Spartanburg County and the upstate as a  whole.                            ____________________
