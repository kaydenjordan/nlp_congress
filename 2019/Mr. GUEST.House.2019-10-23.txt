 Madam Speaker, the impeachment of a President is a serious  process that will have lasting effects on our Republic. It requires a  transparent and trustworthy Congress to conduct a proper investigation  because of the attempts to undo the will of the American people.   As a former prosecutor, I know that holding hearings behind closed  doors is not transparent. Withholding information from the American  people does not promote trust. Misconstruing the facts to the American  public is not proper.   These actions alone point to an illegitimate process that will  continue to  [[Page H8397]]  divide our Nation for the sake of partisan politics.   I ask, is the political gamesmanship worth letting our infrastructure  continue to crumble? Is it worth ignoring the opioid crisis in our  country? Is it worth undermining our democracy to attack a duly elected  President?   We have real problems in this country that the American people  elected us to solve, and we cannot ignore these problems while we focus  on this improper and partisan political process.   Madam Speaker, I encourage my colleagues across the aisle to stop the  political games so that we can get back to work on the issues that are  important to the American people.                            ____________________
