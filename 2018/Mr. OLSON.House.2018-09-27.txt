 Mr. Speaker, like every American, every Member of Congress  has a lower tax rate because of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Every  Democrat voted against this law. It was mocked as mere crumbs.   Well, folks back home have a question for House Democrats:  #keepingthecrumbs?   The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ended the death tax. The junior Senator  from California said repealing the death tax is ``a giveaway to those  at the top, not something that will create jobs.''   Here is a response from a friend back home in Fort Bend County, Dan  McDonald. Dan says, ``E-I-E-I-O.'' Dan's comments are echoed by those  of Rosenberg Tractor's Gary Allred. Gary says, ``Getting rid of the  death tax keeps jobs right now and adds jobs in the future because  Texans can keep their lands, pass them on to their kids, grandkids, and  great-grandkids for all eternity.   Let's step up and pass version 2 and get #keepingthecrumbs.                            ____________________
