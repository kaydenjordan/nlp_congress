 Mr. Speaker, I want to take a moment to highlight  California State University San Marcos, located in my district in San  Diego County.   Recently, the university was ranked number one in the Nation in the  2022 Social Mobility Index out of 14,000 colleges and universities.   This annual index measures the opportunities universities provide  economically disadvantaged and first-generation students to graduate  into well-paying jobs.   With approximately 80 percent of their students remaining in our  region after graduation, the university's success is a major benefit to  the San Diego region.   California State University San Marcos has opened its doors wide and  welcomed students of all backgrounds: 54 percent of students are the  first in their family to attend college; 40 percent have high financial  need; 12 percent are military-affiliated; and the campus has the  highest enrollment of former foster youth per capita in the Nation.   Through teaching hard skills and providing a world-class STEM  education, California State University San Marcos drives upward social  and economic mobility. We should encourage universities across the  Nation to look to this institution as an example of how to put student  success first.   I congratulate California State University San Marcos and President  Neufeldt. I am proud they are serving the citizens of my district, and  I look forward to seeing the ongoing success of their graduates in our  region and beyond.                            ____________________
