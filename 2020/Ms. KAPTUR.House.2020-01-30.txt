 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of both the repeal of  the Authorization for Use of Military Force against Iraq in 2002 and  the No War Against Iran Act, and I thank Congressman Ro Khanna and  Congresswoman Barbara Lee for their true leadership.   Sending our servicemembers into war is one of Congress' most solemn  constitutional responsibilities. History will show this  administration's reckless go-it-alone strategy against Iran with no  allied support has left America less safe.   Indeed, having dodged the draft himself, the President does not  appreciate the true costs of war. Just look at the President's initial  report that no U.S. troops were harmed following Iran's retaliatory  strike on U.S. bases in Iraq. It has since been reported that at least  50 U.S. servicemembers were wounded and suffered traumatic brain  injuries, a stark contrast from President Trump's tweet on January 8  stating all is well.   The cavalier approach this President has taken in escalatory action  against Iran is haphazard. Our servicemembers' safety and America's  security have been hard won.   This Congress fully understands the cost of liberty. It is why,  today, we reassert our Article I power and clearly demand a clear  request if the administration wishes to engage in war with Iran.    Madam Speaker, this Congress will ensure the wise,  strategic, and prudent use of force to win the future by defending the  American people and not carelessly tripping into war with Iran.
