 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, yesterday, the Senate Judiciary  Committee heard from the nominees for the No. 2 and No. 3 jobs at the  Department of Justice.   As you know, earlier today, we confirmed the next Attorney General of  the United States, Judge Merrick Garland. I supported Judge Garland's  nomination because I think he is a qualified, mainstream nominee with  the right experience and the right temperament to lead the Department  of Justice. I believe being Attorney General is probably the hardest  job in the Cabinet because you have two masters. One is the rule of  law, as the chief law enforcement officer for the country; the other  is, you are a member of the President's Cabinet and serve at his or her  pleasure, obviously, a political appointment.   Judge Garland told me, and I take him at his word, that he would work  hard to keep politics out of the work of the Justice Department--a goal  that folks on both sides of the aisle should support, especially after  the struggles of previous administrations.   As I said, I was proud to support Judge Garland's nomination, and now  we begin the process of considering other senior positions at the  Department of Justice.   One of the nominees who came before the Judiciary Committee yesterday  was Lisa Monaco, who has been nominated to serve as the Deputy Attorney  General.   Ms. Monaco is a lifelong public servant who previously spent 15 years  at the Department of Justice. She is a highly respected Federal  prosecutor and national security expert. She advised President Obama  and a number of other top government officials on matters like homeland  security, cyber security, and counterterrorism, and her expertise  extends beyond the ins and outs of matters of policy. Her knowledge of  the Department of Justice as an organization will be invaluable to the  Department, whose more than 100,000 employees are responsible for  carrying out a diverse set of missions. It is a huge organization with  a lot of moving parts.   Like Judge Garland, Ms. Monaco affirmed to me that she does not  intend to inject politics or to even give it a hearing within the  Department of Justice and her duties as the Deputy Attorney General.   I asked her, for example, if she would allow Mr. Durham, who has been  appointed as special counsel, to investigate the Crossfire Hurricane  issue from the last administration and the tail end of the Obama  administration. She said she saw no reason not to give Mr. Durham a  chance to complete his work. That is the same position we took on  Robert Mueller, who was appointed as special counsel to investigate  President Trump. Again, I take her at her word that she will not do  anything to fire Mr. Durham or deprive him of the ability to complete  his important work.   Ms. Monaco discussed her experience at the Department over the course  of the Clinton, Bush, and Obama administrations. She really does have a  lot of important, relevant experience. She talked about the unique role  of the Justice Department, which, as I suggested a moment ago,  functions both as an executive agency that is charged  [[Page S1453]]  with implementing the President's policies as well as being an  independent investigator and, in some cases, a prosecutor. She  described the importance of acting free from political or partisan  influence as her ``North Star.''   While Ms. Monaco and I will surely have policy disagreements at some  point, I trust her ability to fairly and impartially administer justice  while operating free of personal bias or political agenda. I believe  she is well qualified to serve as the Deputy Attorney General, and I  plan to support her nomination.   Unfortunately, I cannot say the same for the second nominee who  appeared before the Judiciary Committee yesterday. Vanita Gupta has  been nominated to serve as the Associate Attorney General, which is  sometimes considered to be the No. 3 position at the Department of  Justice. Throughout her career, Ms. Gupta has been a clear and  outspoken advocate for some pretty radical policies.   In 2012, for example, she wrote that States should decriminalize the  possession of all drugs--not just marijuana but all drugs--which, I  presume, would include things like fentanyl, heroin, methamphetamine,  and other highly addictive and destructive drugs. In yesterday's  hearing, when I asked Ms. Gupta about this statement, she took the  opposite position. She didn't tell me ``I used to advocate for that  position and have now changed my position.'' She said, unequivocally,  that she did not advocate for the decriminalization of all drugs. It  became apparent she wanted Senators to forget what she previously  wrote:         States should decriminalize simple possession of all drugs,       particularly marijuana, and for small amounts of other drugs.    That is a quote from an article she wrote in 2012. Unfortunately, the  list of inconsistencies does not end there.   In June of 2020, less than a year ago, Ms. Gupta argued that it ought  to be easier to sue police officers in court for money damages. Now,  this is sometimes called ``qualified immunity,'' which recognizes the  fact that law enforcement officers have to make split-second  decisions--life-or-death decisions, actually--and that it would be  unfair to them to, in retrospect, go back and flyspeck all of their  decisions. In other words, it gives them some room in which to operate,  recognizing the unique nature of their job. It applies to other  government employees, too. Yet, in June 2020, less than a year ago, she  argued that it was time to revisit this doctrine of qualified  immunity--in other words, to make it easier to sue police officers for  money.   This was one of the many steps that she outlined in an opinion piece  in a national publication following the death of George Floyd. Nine  months later, she says she does not support that position--one she  supported 9 months ago. Now she says she does not support the position  of making it easier to sue police officers.   And there is more.   Last summer, Ms. Gupta put her support behind the ``defund the  police'' movement. As our country engaged in an important and long  overdue debate about the police's use of force and responsible policing  strategies, the Senate Judiciary Committee held a hearing on that very  topic.   Ms. Gupta testified before the committee and said:         While front-end systems changes are important, it is also       critical for state and local leaders to heed calls from Black       Lives Matter and Movement for Black Lives activists to       decrease police budgets and the scope, role, and       responsibility of police in our lives.    Yesterday, Ms. Gupta did not mince words. She said she does not  support defunding the police, and she said decreasing police budgets  was not defunding the police. Well, at the time we were discussing this  movement for defunding police, she attempted to parse her words. It is  tough to reconcile the stark difference between what Ms. Gupta has said  in the past and what she now says as she attempts to win support in the  Senate. I am wary and, frankly, skeptical of confirmation conversions  wherein people take the opposite positions when they are nominated for  important, Senate-confirmed positions from the positions they have  taken in the past.   I understand her interest in distancing herself from her previous  positions. Decriminalizing drugs, eliminating qualified immunity-- making it easier to second-guess and sue police officers for money  damages--and defunding the police are radical policy positions that  should disqualify someone from becoming the third-highest ranking  official at the Justice Department. In order to be confirmed, Ms. Gupta  knows she needs to convince us that she actually holds mainstream views  on law enforcement strategies and issues. I find it hard to believe  that these views, which are not from decades-old law school writings  but are recent public statements--indeed, sworn testimony before the  U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee--are views she no longer holds, which  she said she held so recently.   I want to be clear on one point.   The opinions of Ms. Gupta's as a private citizen are not an issue.  She has every right to hold opinions that differ from mine or anybody  else's, but when you are the nominee for a high level--indeed, one of  the highest levels--of critical law enforcement positions, these are  highly problematic and, to my mind, disqualifying.   Perhaps more so than any other Federal Department or Agency, the  Department of Justice must operate free from bias and political  agendas. The men and women leading the Department must be able to  separate their personal beliefs from the jobs before them. No matter  how they feel about the wisdom of the policies enacted by Congress,  their jobs are to enforce the law not as they want it to be but as it  is. People across the country should have confidence that the senior  leaders at the Justice Department will follow the law as written-- without fail. We can't have leaders who turn a blind eye to whatever is  politically convenient when it conflicts with their personally held  positions.   Based on Ms. Gupta's clear history of radical policy positions, which  stands in stark contrast to the laws she would be charged with  enforcing, I do not believe she can separate her convictions from the  job at hand. Leaders within the Department must be able to view all  matters as matters of fact and as matters of duty, not just as matters  of opinion or as platforms to argue for changes in the law.   As the Senate has considered the President's nominees over the past  several weeks, I have been very clear that I will not oppose nominees  based simply on the President's political party. I think the President  is entitled to some deference as to the people he chooses. That was the  strategy of our Democratic colleagues previously, and it is incredibly  damaging to both our country and its institutions. Just because a  President you don't like has nominated somebody does not justify  opposing that President's nominee. I will continue to evaluate all  nominees of this President based on their merits and their abilities to  do the jobs for which they were nominated.   I firmly believe that the American people deserve to have qualified,  fairminded individuals leading these important Departments and  Agencies. For the Department of Justice, which is responsible for  enforcing the law of the land and imparting fair and equal justice,  that is doubly true. There is simply no room for political or partisan  or ideological agendas at the Department of Justice. I am concerned  that Ms. Gupta will continue to pursue those objectives from within the  Department and use all of the Department's tools and the authority  given to her to achieve these ideological outcomes. Therefore, I cannot  support her nomination   I yield the floor.
