 Mr. President, I want to honor the life of Officer Tyler  Avery Herndon of the Mount Holly Police Department. On December 11,  2020, Officer Herndon's life was tragically cut short at just 25 years  old while responding to a report of a break-in. I want to take a moment  to remember him and his commitment to his community.   Officer Herndon had served in the Mount Holly Police Department for  just shy of 2 years before his young life was taken. He had ambitions  of becoming an FBI agent and was approaching the time needed as a  police officer to become eligible to apply. He was described by his  fellow officers as ``the guy you just can't help but like'' and someone  who ``lived a life of service, and always wanted to do what he could to  help others.''   Officer Herndon served the people of Mount Holly, NC, and today, we  remember how he made the ultimate sacrifice. I want his family and the  Mount Holly Police Department to know that my thoughts and prayers are  with them as they grieve the loss of this exceptional young man. I know  that Officer Herndon will be forever missed, and his service and  sacrifice will not be forgotten.                            ____________________
