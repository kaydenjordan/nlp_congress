 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman of the full Committee on  Energy and Commerce for yielding me this time.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 826. Over the last 3 years,  the Trump administration has deliberately and repeatedly sabotaged the  Affordable Care Act. This has led to higher healthcare costs for low-  and middle-income Americans. This has also led to an increase in the  number of uninsured Americans, including those in my home State of  Illinois.   As such, Mr. Speaker, it is not surprising to me that the  administration is, once again, attacking vulnerable Americans'  healthcare.   We have not forgotten that our colleagues across the aisle tried and  failed to force through the Medicaid block grant in the year 2017. It  failed, Mr. Speaker, because the American people saw the plan for what  it was: a way to weaken the Medicaid program.   Under this latest proposal, just like TrumpCare, much of the  financial burden would shift to States. States, Mr. Speaker, would be  forced to reduce benefits, kick vulnerable Americans off Medicaid, and  siphon funds from other priorities, including schools, roads, and first  responders.   Mr. Speaker, healthcare is a human right, and we cannot and we will  not stand idly by if this right is taken away from the most vulnerable  among us.   As such, Mr. Speaker, I am proud to vote in favor of this resolution  to express my disapproval of the Trump administration's Medicaid block  grant plan.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of National Gun Violence  Survivors Week.   At a field hearing in my district last November, we heard from Pastor  Brenda Mitchell, who lost both her brother and a son to gun violence.  After her son's death, Pastor Mitchell experienced hypertension, and  the trauma forced her to leave a successful career behind.   According to the Gun Violence Archive, which tracks gun violence  statistics, there have been 862 deaths in my district since 2013, 862  families who have experienced the trauma of losing a loved one to gun  violence.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues in the Senate to stand up to  the empty minds, the empty hearts, and the empty suits of the gun lobby  and send H.R. 8 to the President's desk.                            ____________________
