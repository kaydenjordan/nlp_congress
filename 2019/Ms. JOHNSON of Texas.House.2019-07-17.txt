 Mr. Speaker, as chairwoman of the Committee on  Science, Space, and Technology, it is an honor to stand before you  today to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Apollo 11.   On the morning of July 16, 1969, Neil Armstrong, Michael Collins, and  Buzz Aldrin lifted off from NASA's Cape Kennedy. That day, millions  watched in awe as NASA launched Apollo 11's Saturn V rocket and began  the long journey to accomplish the goals set by President Kennedy less  than 10 years earlier to land a man on the Moon before the end of the  decade.   As President Kennedy said in his speech at Rice University in  September 1962: ``We choose to go to the Moon in this decade and do the  other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard.''   There is no better explanation that captures the American spirit. We  choose to take giant leaps. We choose to know the unknown. We choose to  lead into the future.   On July 20, 1960, just 4 days after the launch, the world listened  and watched as the first steps were taken on the Moon. Again, hundreds  of millions of people across the world watched as history was made.   Five times more, NASA astronauts landed on the Moon and returned home  safely. President Kennedy's promise that our great democracy could  achieve these hard things became a reality.   As we watched those things in July 50 years ago, dreams began to  form. Every person watching the success of the Apollo program, young  and old, no matter their background, was filled with inspiration.   Some youngsters could say to themselves, ``I will be an astronaut,''  or, ``I will be a scientist.'' As they looked up to the Moon, they  pictured themselves up there amongst those American heroes an  unimaginable distance away.   This impact has its greatest effect on our young people. We must  always remember that inspiration when we set out to accomplish our  greatest goals, the youth inspiration. The world's rising generations  are watching, always setting their eyes on the sky and the stars. Young  girls and young boys from all backgrounds thrive off the visions that  we have now and imagine themselves becoming a part of it when they can.   We must meet this great responsibility to the following generations  by providing opportunities for them to do great things with the  challenge we face today. As my predecessor, chairman of the then- Committee of Science and Astronautics, Congressman George P. Miller  said after the Apollo 11 crew splashed down safely in the Pacific  Ocean:         Those of us who are privileged to live today will pass this       on to our children and our grandchildren, and they will, in       turn, brag about the fact that we were there. The flight of       Apollo 11 is perhaps the greatest secular achievement that       the world has ever seen.    This achievement was made possible by the unified efforts of nearly a  half million men and women, scientists and engineers, technicians and  craftsmen, and the support of the American people and their government.  The United States discovery and exploration enterprise is unmatched.   Just as we once set our sights to be the first to land on the Moon,  let us bring that same sense of commitment to meeting other challenges  facing our Nation.                            ____________________
