 Madam Speaker, thanks to years of hard work, we have  made Arizona a global leader in semiconductor manufacturing. It is one  of our State's fastest-growing industries.   We have supported innovative, local companies that produce base  materials, we have trained a talented STEM workforce through our  colleges and universities, and we have attracted billions of dollars in  investment to build semiconductor fabs in the Valley of the Sun.   These days microchips are in everything from consumer electronics and  cars to technologies that support our national defense. Increasingly,  those chips are made in Arizona. In the future, I want more of those  chips to be manufactured in Arizona. That was why I was an early and  vocal supporter of the CHIPS Act.   It comes down to one word: jobs.   This bill will help drive down costs for consumers and lower our  reliance on foreign countries all while creating and supporting tens of  thousands of high-paying jobs in my home State of Arizona.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this bill to  recharge America's economy.                            ____________________
