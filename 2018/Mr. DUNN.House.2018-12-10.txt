 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the airmen of Tyndall  Air Force Base on a special date. Today marks exactly 2 months since  Tyndall took a direct hit from Hurricane Michael, a devastating  category 4.9 storm that damaged more than 90 percent of the structures  on the air base.   I salute the tremendous efforts of the Tyndall Air Force community  and the surrounding civilian community for their recovery efforts. It  is the remarkable work of the base leadership and all of the airmen of  Tyndall that enabled this base and its elementary school to reopen  ahead of schedule today.   The men and women of Tyndall have shown great courage and  determination in a time of extreme adversity. It is my great honor and  pleasure to represent Tyndall Air Force Base, and I commend the work  that they are doing day in and day out to rebuild this base stronger  and better than ever.                            ____________________
