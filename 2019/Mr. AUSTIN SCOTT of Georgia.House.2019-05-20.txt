 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. Veasey), and encourage those of you who are sportsmen  who have not had the opportunity to join the Congressional Sportsmen's  Caucus to join. It is a wonderful organization. It is the largest  bipartisan caucus in the House. We even allow Senators to participate  in the skeet shoot.   Madam Speaker, I would like to recognize Richard Hudson, who was our  team captain this year. I sent the B team captain, and I look forward  to being there next year.   I want to congratulate John Rutherford, Sheriff Rutherford, who was  top gun over all, with a score of 63; Jody Hice, who was the top  Republican from Georgia; and Mark Meadows, from North Carolina was top  trap. ``GT'', Glenn Thompson, from Pennsylvania, was top sporting  clays.   It is a wonderful event every year. I hope that if Members weren't  able to join us this year, that they will be able to join us next.    Madam Speaker, I just wanted Mr. Veasey  to get a good look at the trophy. We will certainly be recruiting women  next year, but we intend to keep the trophy in good safekeeping for a  long time.
