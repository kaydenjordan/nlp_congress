 Mr. President, first I want to thank my colleague for  coming to the floor today to speak about Montenegro and the importance  of its accession into NATO, as well as for his focus on the Balkans and  for his comment that right now the people of the Balkans and, for that  matter, the people in Ukraine and other countries in eastern Southern  Europe are feeling a lot of pressure. I applaud him for working on a  bipartisan basis over the last couple of years to help us push back  against some of the disinformation and propaganda that is primarily  being promoted by Russia.   In each of these countries--and I know my colleague Senator Murphy  has visited these countries--the first issue I hear about when I go on  a trip to Latvia, where I went recently, and certainly Ukraine and even  Poland is concern about this sort of unrelenting campaign of  disinformation, as we call it; maybe the other term would be  ``propaganda.'' We do need to stand up and be counted. The new  department of global engagement at the State Department is beginning to  do that. I know Senator Murphy has had some meetings recently--and I  have, too--where they are starting to get their feet on the ground and  being able to allow people to be able to see the objective truth; in  other words, to sort of separate narratives from reality, to be able to  ensure that we don't have an undermining of these great democracies-- these fledgling democracies, many of them.   So we are talking today, as my colleague from Nebraska did earlier,  about the meddling in our own election here and the effect it is having  on the level of trust in this country, and this is true not just here  but in other democracies. I appreciate Senator Murphy standing up and  being counted on that issue and then today specifically being able to  help Montenegro to have the opportunity to develop its own  institutions. As I said, it is not perfect, but they have made  progress, they have made reforms, and they have followed the directions  many of us have given them to enable them to be responsible members of  NATO. So I thank Senator Murphy for being here today and talking about  that.                               Read Aloud Month    Mr. President, I am actually speaking out today about another issue,  which is one that is a little closer to home, and that is about the  importance of reading to our kids. It turns out that this month of  March has been designated as Read Aloud Month, and this group called  Read Aloud is doing fantastic work around the country. They actually  started in my hometown of Cincinnati, OH, so I am a little biased about  them, but what they are doing is incredibly important. It is about  education, it is about the economy, and more importantly, it is about  the lives of young people around the country and the ability to achieve  their dreams. It is about child literacy.   Here is the information. Elementary schools and libraries are talking  about this more and more back home. If you read to your kids when they  are young, they will have a much better chance of succeeding in life.  According to a study that dates back to 1995--kind of a famous study-- by the time a child born into poverty reaches age 3, he or she has  heard 30 million fewer words than his or her peers. Let me repeat that.  A kid who is born into poverty is going to hear 30 million fewer words  by the time he or she is 3 years old. Why does that matter? Why does  this word gap, as they call it, matter? Well, it matters because it  turns out these verbal skills, like other skills, develop as they are  used, and if they are not used, they don't develop. So a lot of kids  who already have the challenge of growing up in poverty are also  burdened with the disadvantage of not developing these verbal skills.  That makes it harder for them to get good grades, harder for them to  develop social skills, and harder for them to get a good job and  ultimately to be able to live out their dreams.   I know Washington, DC, may be the only place on Earth where 30  million sounds like a small number, but it is a big number. It makes a  huge difference. This word gap leads to an achievement gap later in  life based on all the studies. Experts tell us that a child's  vocabulary is reflective of his or her parents' vocabulary. It makes  sense. Kids learn what they see and what they hear.   There is a 2003 study by Elizabeth Martin and Tom Risley studying  word gaps which found that by age 3, before even reaching school age,  children's ``trends in the amount of talk, vocabulary growth, and style  of interaction were well established and clearly suggest widening gaps  to come.'' So having poor reading skills makes it harder to make a  living, it affects self-esteem, and it makes life more difficult in so  many small ways. Think about this: unable to read a manual when you buy  something, unable to read a list of ingredients, unable to read a  newspaper to understand what is going on, to be online.   Millions of our friends and neighbors are struggling with these  consequences every day. According to the Department of Education, about  32 million adults in this country can't read. Think about that. That is  a group nearly 3 times the size of the State of Ohio and maybe 25 to 30  times the size of the Presiding Officer's State--32 million. Too many  of these adults, of course, started off life with the disadvantage of  this word gap, and they never caught up.   That is why this Read Aloud Month is so critical. Parents and other  caretakers need to know they can steer their child in a better  direction--develop vocabulary skills and end the word gap just by  reading aloud to them.   Developing these skills, according to experts, affects the biology of  the brain. Dr. Tzipi Horowitz-Kraus of Cincinnati Children's Hospital-- a great institution in my hometown and one of the top three children's  hospitals in the country, based on U.S. News and World Report. Anyway,  he is an expert on this topic, and this is what he said: ``The more you  read to your child, the more you help the neurons in the brain to grow  and connect.'' So it is physiological.   Dr. Kim Noble, a brain scientist at Columbia University, has found  that this word gap actually translates into a brain-sized gap in the  areas dealing with language.   Dr. Dana Suskind of the University of Chicago has found that more  than 80 percent of a child's brain development occurs by age 3--80  percent--and the effects of the word gap are detected in brain  development in babies as young as 9 months old. These aren't children;  these are babies. Doctor Suskind says that by reading aloud, every  parent has the ability to grow their child's brain.   So certainly before a child can read, before a child can even speak,  it is important to be speaking to that child. Think about that. Think  about the impact you can have. So get out a book and do some reading to  a child, a grandchild, someone who is in the neighborhood, one of your  kids. Do it tonight.   Sometimes when I talk about this, people say: Well, Rob, parenting is  pretty tough. Everybody is busy. Some people are working two shifts.  Both parents are working. Where do you make time for this? Here is my  answer to that: Fifteen minutes a day. That is the goal here. Fifteen  minutes a day makes a huge difference to be able to close that gap.   Others say: We can't afford it. How do you afford to buy these books  if you are going to read all the time? To me, that is pretty simple.  Buy a library card. They are free, usually. If not, they are cheap. You  don't need a lot of new books, but you do need a library card, and that  is very helpful. They helped Jane and me to be able to have books to  read to our kids.   Again, I am very proud Ohio has led on this issue. In 2008, this  group Read Aloud was started in Cincinnati, OH. It has now become a  national movement. It has more than 10,000 grassroots partners-- including daycare facilities, schools and libraries, and rotary clubs-- in all 50 States.   So what can you do to help? I would say that this issue is not going  to be found here in this body. It is not about Washington, DC, doing  anything except encouraging people to do what makes sense, which is to  spend time with your kid, to ensure that if you have a kid in school,  that you know that kid gets the right start in life, to ensure that  everybody has the ability to have a successful life.  [[Page S2036]]    Senator Harris and I introduced a resolution about this recently in  the U.S. Senate. It is called the Read Aloud Month resolution. It  encourages parents and caregivers to read to their kids for 15 minutes  a day. We are asking our colleagues on both sides of the aisle,  Republican and Democratic, to sign off on that resolution. That would  help raise the visibility of this issue.   Again, I hope everybody listening today takes the opportunity to  follow up, to read to a kid, to help ensure they can close that words  gap in their lives and therefore have a better chance of getting better  grades, getting a better job, and achieving whatever their dream is in  life.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
