 Mr. President, now, it came to our attention last night  that members of the National Guard, after standing on duty to protect  the Capitol for Inauguration Day, keeping us safe, were sleeping in  parking garages and cramped quarters without proper space or  ventilation. It was utterly unacceptable.   I have told those who run the security of the Capitol that it can  never happen again, and I pledge to every National Guard member that it  will not happen again.   The minute I heard about this outrage last night, we made sure it was  fixed immediately. Every member of the Guard was found proper  accommodations inside, and, as of this morning, everyone was accounted  for and taken care of.   This morning I went over to the CVC and I spoke to a number of  Guardsmen personally to make sure they were OK.   I want to thank Senators Hassan, Duckworth, Kelly, and Heinrich for  their work on this matter last night, as well as Senator Lujan, who  went around late at night to make sure things were OK, as well. And I  want to thank all the Members who were concerned and lent a hand.   I also want to particularly thank Acting Sergeant at Arms Jennifer  Hemingway, who, when we told her about this situation, patrolled the  floors of the Capitol Complex until past 3 a.m. to ensure that no one  was left behind or not where they belonged. And she was back at her  desk first thing today to follow up.   We owe an enormous debt of gratitude to the men and women who worked  to keep us safe on January 6 and the days since. A situation like last  night will never happen again                            ____________________     Now, I have spoken about the Senate's agenda for the  next several weeks. We have three essential items on our plate: one,  the confirmation of President Biden's Cabinet and other key officials;  two, legislation to provide desperately needed COVID relief; three, a  second impeachment trial of Donald Trump. The Senate must and will do  all three--COVID relief, confirmation of nominees, and an impeachment  trial.   Now, the first order of business is to fulfill our constitutional  duty to advise and consent on the President's appointments to his  Cabinet. This morning the Senate will vote to confirm President Biden's  nominee for Secretary of Defense, Lloyd Austin. Mr. Austin will be the  first African American to ever helm the Defense Department in its  history--a powerful symbol of the diversity and history of America's  Armed Forces.   Mr. Austin has a storied career in the Army, but those days are  behind him. As Secretary of Defense, he has promised to empower and  lift up his civilian staff, and I believe he will be an outstanding  Secretary of Defense for everyone at the Pentagon--servicemembers and  civilian employees alike.   The Secretary of Defense, of course, has a hugely important task  ahead of him. He must once again demonstrate  [[Page S96]]  to the world that the U.S. military will always support our friends,  deter our adversaries, and, if necessary, defeat them.   Lloyd Austin is the right person for the job. He has the experience,  the vision, and the competence to run the largest agency in our  government. I look forward to confirming his nomination shortly.   Afterward, the Senate must continue to install President Biden's team  by confirming Secretaries of State, Homeland Security, and Treasury. We  need Republican cooperation to confirm these nominees, but we expect  that cooperation to continue. The continuity of our national security,  military, and intelligence policy, as well as our ability to  effectively respond to the current health and economic crises, depend  on having these Cabinet officials confirmed.   Now, as I mentioned, the Senate will also conduct a second  impeachment trial for Donald Trump. I have been speaking to the  Republican leader about the timing and duration of the trial, but--make  no mistake--a trial will be held in the U.S. Senate, and there will be  a vote on whether to convict the President.   I have spoken to Speaker Pelosi, who informed me that the article  will be delivered to the Senate on Monday.   Now, I have heard some of my Republican colleagues argue that this  trial would be unconstitutional because Donald Trump is no longer in  office--an argument that has been roundly repudiated, debunked by  hundreds of constitutional scholars--left, right, and center--and  defies basic common sense. It makes no sense whatsoever that a  President or any official could commit a heinous crime against our  country and then be permitted to resign so as to avoid accountability  and a vote to disbar them from future office. It makes no sense.   Regardless, the purveyors of this unusual argument are trying to  delay the inevitable. The fact is, the House will deliver the Article  of Impeachment to the Senate. The Senate will conduct a trial of the  impeachment of Donald Trump. It will be a full trial. It will be a fair  trial. But make no mistake, there will be a trial, and when that trial  ends, Senators will have to decide if they believe Donald John Trump  incited the insurrection against the United States.   Now, over the course of elections in November and January, the  American people chose to retire four Republican Senators and elect a  Democratic majority to this Senate. The Senate must now take the basic  step of passing an organizing resolution and setting up the rules for a  Senate where there are 50 Members of either party.   Luckily, we have a clear precedent for what to do in this situation.  In 2001, then-Majority Leader Lott and Minority Leader Daschle came  together and agreed on a set of rules to govern a 50-50 Senate. We  should follow that precedent.   We have offered to abide by the same agreement the last time there  was a 50-50 Senate. What is fair is fair. That is precedent. We could  organize the Senate today if both sides agreed to abide by the same  rules as last time.   The Republican leader, however, has made an extraneous demand that  would place additional constraints on the majority--constraints that  have never been in place before. In fact, his proposal would remove a  tool that the Republican leader himself used twice in just the last  Congress to accelerate the confirmation of Republican nominees.   Leader McConnell's proposal is unacceptable, and it won't be  accepted. And the Republican leader knew that when he first proposed  it.   Only 2 days ago, we celebrated the inauguration of a new President  and the turning over of a new leaf. The American people want us to work  together and move past the meaningless political fights and gridlock  that have plagued us for too long.   It is time to get to work. A first step is for the Republican caucus  to agree to follow the same precedent that governed the Senate the last  time around.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, we have made good progress in our efforts  to determine the timing and structure of the impeachment trial of  Donald J. Trump.   For the information of all Senators, the House managers will come to  read the Article of Impeachment at 7 p.m. on Monday, January 25.  Members will then be sworn in the next day, Tuesday, January 26.   After that, both the House managers and the defense will have a  period of time to draft their legal briefs, just as they did in  previous trials. During that period, the Senate will continue to do  other business for the American people,  [[Page S103]]  such as Cabinet nominations and the COVID relief bill, which would  provide relief for millions of Americans who are suffering during this  pandemic.   Then, once the briefs are drafted, presentation by the parties will  commence the week of February 8.   The January 6 insurrection at the Capitol, incited by Donald J.  Trump, is a day none of us will ever forget. We all want to put this  awful chapter in our Nation's history behind us, but healing and unity  will only come if there is truth and accountability, and that is what  this trial will provide                            ____________________     Mr. President, I have a request for one committee to  meet during today's session of the Senate. It has the approval of the  Majority and Minority leaders.  [[Page S108]]    Pursuant to rule XXVI, paragraph 5(a), of the Standing Rules of the  Senate, the following committee is authorized to meet during today's  session of the Senate:              Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation    The Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation is authorized  to meet during the session of the Senate on Thursday, January 21, 2021,  at 10 a.m., to conduct a closed hearing.                                 ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that upon the  conclusion of morning business on January 25, the Senate proceed to  executive session to consider the following nomination: Executive  Calendar No. 2, the nomination of Janet Yellen to be the Secretary of  the Treasury; further, that the time until 5:30 be equally divided  between the two leaders or their designees, and that at 5:30 the Senate  vote without intervening action or debate on the nomination; that if  confirmed, the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon  the table and the President be immediately notified of the Senate's  action.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 3 p.m., Monday,  January 25;  [[Page S112]]  further, that following the prayer and pledge, the morning hour be  deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, and the  time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day and  morning business be closed; finally, that following leader remarks, the  Senate proceed to executive session to consider the Yellen nomination,  as provided under the previous order.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 6:11 p.m., adjourned until  Monday, January 25, 2021, at 3 p.m.                            ____________________
