 Madam Speaker, last week the Wall Street Journal reported  that a whistleblower employee at Abbott Nutrition filed a complaint  with the FDA in February of last year, months before the originally  reported date of October. If true, President Biden and his FDA must  answer for why they ignored these alarming claims.   Parents in middle Tennessee are struggling to find baby formula as  the out-of-stock rate has skyrocketed to 92 percent.   Ultimately, this is just another crisis that has been made much worse  by the Biden administration, about which one White House official on  the Domestic Policy Council gave the excuse that the administration's  plate was full with ``a million crises going on.''   Unfortunately, President Biden's failed far-left agenda caused the  million crises. Those many crises very well may have distracted his  administration from initially taking the baby formula shortage  seriously, as well as contributed to the administration's inexcusably  slow reaction to the crisis, allowing it to get much worse than it  should have.   We must get to the bottom of this failure and hold those accountable  responsible, but in any case, the President must do better.                            ____________________
