 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 431, I call  up the resolution (H. Res. 430) authorizing the Committee on the  Judiciary to initiate or intervene in judicial proceedings to enforce  certain subpoenas and for other purposes, and ask for its immediate  consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous material on H. Res. 430.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this is a dark time. This Congress is being tested--in  this case, not by a foreign adversary but by our own President, a  President who is undertaking a relentless campaign of obstruction and  stonewalling.   We have never seen anything like this. Never before, Mr. Speaker, has  a President from either party so flagrantly ignored Congress'  constitutional oversight authority and our Nation's separation of  powers.   You don't have to take my word for it. President Trump has declared,  ``We are fighting all the subpoenas,'' and, ``I don't want people  testifying.'' These words make Richard Nixon look like an Eagle Scout.   His Attorney General, William Barr, is apparently more than willing  to follow the President's command. He has refused to release the full,  unredacted Mueller report and any underlying evidence until a  compromise was finally reached yesterday. That is after the Judiciary  Committee had already voted to hold him in contempt of Congress.  Apparently, the Attorney General went from being America's lawyer to  being the defense counsel for the President of the United States.   I hope the Justice Department acts in good faith on this new  agreement. These are documents that Congress needs to see in response  to Special Counsel Mueller's findings. But if they do not, and if the  Attorney General holds back key information, then all options need to  be on the table, including enforcing these subpoenas. That is in  addition to the fact that some documents and testimony we deserve to  obtain could very well fall outside the bounds of this agreement.   The Mueller report is just the tip of the iceberg. The President is  using every trick in the book, including false claims of executive  privilege, absolute immunity, and lack of legitimate legislative  purpose, all to obstruct legitimate inquiries into matters that impact  Americans' daily lives. This includes the President's attack on  affordable healthcare coverage for millions of Americans, including  those with preexisting conditions; his family separation policy that  has torn apart vulnerable immigrant families; his misappropriation of  military funds for his offensive border wall; and his decision to roll  back landmark civil rights protections.   This is exactly the sort of concentrated power in the hands of the  few that the Founders intentionally prevented through the creation of  the three separate but coequal branches of government, each branch with  unique powers and responsibilities and each branch expected to act as a  check on the power of the others.   But the President is trying to take this balance of power and  centralize it  [[Page H4412]]  in one place, 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. He is acting as though the law  applies to every American but himself.   The President's strategy here is clear. Tweet by tweet, quote by  quote, he has laid it bare for all of us to see.   The question is whether this Congress will have the courage to take a  stand against it and whether we will confront it for what it is, an  attack on the very notion of Congress as a coequal branch of  government. I can't speak for my friends on the other side of the  aisle, but this Democratic majority will not allow this President to  turn a blind eye to the rule of law.   That is why I introduced this measure, H. Res. 430. It is a civil  enforcement resolution that will strengthen our hand in court as  Congress tries to get the documents this administration is currently  trying to hide, so we can uncover the truth and follow the facts,  wherever they may lead.   The first part of this resolution follows past precedent used by  Democratic and Republican majorities, this time to allow the Judiciary  Committee to go to court to enforce subpoenas issued to the Attorney  General and former White House General Counsel Don McGahn.   The second part reaffirms key language in House rules, making clear  that every committee chair retains the ability to go to Federal court  to seek civil enforcement of their subpoenas when authorized by the  Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group. That includes those already issued, as  well as any future subpoenas.   I know some of my colleagues on the other side will be quick to claim  this resolution is unprecedented. To them, I would ask this: What is  the precedent for an administration refusing to comply with any  congressional oversight--no documents, no information, nothing? There  isn't one.   We have never seen anything like this before, so we need an  appropriate response like this because of this administration's  constant obstruction.   I am proud that my fellow committee chairs quickly joined in  cosponsoring this resolution, including Oversight and Reform Committee  Chairman Cummings, Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Engel, Judiciary  Committee Chairman Nadler, Ways and Means Committee Chairman Neal,  Intelligence Committee Chairman Schiff, and Financial Services  Committee Chairwoman Waters.   I urge all of my colleagues to join us. This deserves support from  both sides of the aisle.   I know the silence from some of my Republican friends to what this  President is doing has been deafening, but this moment demands you  finally speak up and say enough is enough. This resolution is not  about politics or partisanship. It is about defending the rule of law  and the very notion of separation of powers.    The challenge here is so great that if we don't stand up to President  Trump today, then we risk losing the power to stand up to any President  in the future.   I strongly urge my colleagues: Let's make clear that the law still  matters, even in Donald Trump's America. We can do that by voting  ``yes'' on this resolution and making clear that no one is above the  law, not even the President of the United States.   Let's do right by the American people. Let's restore the dignity of  this institution. Let's pass this resolution.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Waters), the distinguished chairwoman of the Financial  Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, let me just assure the gentleman from  Georgia that there is nothing novel about this legislation. It is not  novel because everything in this bill goes to the Bipartisan Legal  Advisory Group, and that has been the case in the past.   What is novel, however, is a President of the United States who says  ``ignore subpoenas'' and ``we will not cooperate'' and tells people not  to testify. That is not only novel, it is shocking.   Mr. Speaker, I would just say to my friends on the other side: You  are going to have a choice today to either vote for this resolution and  stand up for this institution and support the rule of law, or you are  going to vote in a way that is going to be complicit with this  President's obstruction and disrespect for this institution and  disrespect for the rule of law. I urge you to vote with us.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Cummings), the distinguished chairman of the Committee on  Oversight and Reform.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Maryland.    Mr. Speaker, I am proud to yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Pelosi), the distinguished Speaker of  the House.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Tennessee (Mr. Cohen).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), who is the majority leader.    Mr. Speaker, let me correct the Record in response to  the gentleman of Ohio. The Russians didn't attempt to interfere in our  election; they did interfere in our election.   And, if my friends read the Mueller report, they would realize they  interfered in the election to help Donald Trump get elected.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr.  Nadler), the distinguished chair of the Committee on the Judiciary.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   The distinguished minority leader began by saying that the Mueller  report makes it clear that there was no collusion and no obstruction.  Maybe that is what you would conclude if you just read Barr's summary  which tried to cover up what the Mueller report said, but I would urge  the distinguished minority leader to read the report. I am happy to  lend him my bifocals if he has trouble reading it.   But the report doesn't say that. It doesn't say no collusion. And on  the issue of obstruction of justice, it says: If we were convinced that  he, the President, did not commit a crime, we would have said so.   That is what the report says. And I would remind my colleagues that  obstruction of justice is a crime.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr.  Ted Lieu).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman from Texas an  additional 1 minute.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers. I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the remainder of my time.   Mr. Speaker, my friends on the other side have responded to this  legislation with the same old same old.   They are circling the wagons around this President and his team. They  are deliberately turning a blind eye to the corruption, to the  deception, to the illegality that has surrounded this White House.   But let me remind them all of why we are here today. We are here  because the American people elected each of us to write laws and to  ensure those who execute them are accountable.   We all took an oath when we were sworn in to uphold and defend the  Constitution. That is our job.   None of us were sent here to play defense for the President of the  United States.   There are some things that are more important than politics, and I  hope that even in this day and age, there are still some things that  are more sacred than partisanship, like the rule of law and the  separation of powers.   I mean, each of us took the same oath. We now have a choice whether  or not to uphold it.   The choice should be a simple one: to stand up to President Trump and  to defend the Constitution.   Mr. Speaker, I remember when many of my Republican friends ran for  office claiming to be constitutional conservatives. Well, this is their  chance to back up their campaign slogan with their vote.    We have a President that publicly states: ``We're fighting all the  subpoenas.''         And I don't want people to testify.    Those are his words. Those are the words of the President, not some  mob boss.   As we heard from the chairman of the Oversight and Reform Committee,  Chairman Cummings, the White House hasn't turned over a single  document, a single piece of paper that his committee has requested to  do their oversight work, not one piece of paper.   At the core of this resolution is Congress getting the appropriate  documents, so we can do the appropriate oversight. That is part of the  job.   How can anybody be against that? To be against that is to be part of  the coverup, is to be complicit with the obstruction that this White  House demonstrates each and every day.   Mr. Speaker, I remind my colleagues that history will judge how we  react to this moment. So I urge all of my colleagues, do not let this  moment pass us by. Vote ``yes'' on this resolution, and let's hold the  President accountable.   Nobody is above the law in the United States of America, not even the  President of the United States.    Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote, and I yield back  the balance of my time.
