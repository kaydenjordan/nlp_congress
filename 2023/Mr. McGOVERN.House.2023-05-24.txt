 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my deep  frustration with the Biden administration, especially the State  Department, and its indifference to the suffering of the Cuban people.   I was in Cuba in December. I have traveled there often over the past  four decades. I have deep ties to many ordinary Cubans, small  entrepreneurs, and people of faith. I have never seen the Cuban people  suffer such hardship as they are at this moment.   The main drivers of Cuban migration right now are hunger and a  despair for a better future. There are many reasons for this  desperation: The economic collapse of the tourist economy during the  COVID-19 epidemic, rigid economic controls by the Cuban Government that  change too slowly, a harsh crackdown on protests, and the denial of  basic rights and freedoms.   However, a significant factor contributing to the suffering are the  policies of the United States.   Despite promises made as a candidate, President Biden has failed to  undo the economic and financial restrictions imposed by his  predecessor. He has failed to remove Cuba from the State Sponsors of  Terrorism list against all reason, information, and analysis that  should have led to its immediate removal upon his taking office.   These restrictions have strangled ordinary people's daily activities,  financial transactions, the Cuban private sector, activities by other  Western governments, and even the delivery of humanitarian aid.                                time  1045    In December, young entrepreneurs were begging me to remove Cuba from  the State Sponsors of Terrorism list. The Governments of Colombia and  Mexico, and many others, have asked the Biden administration to remove  Cuba from this list. They have received the same response as many  Members of Congress: an indifferent silence.   No doubt, the Biden administration will tinker around the edges,  announcing limited reforms that might allow a few small entrepreneurs  to survive another year or two, but they won't thrive. Such measures  will hardly alleviate the suffering of the Cuban people as a whole.   Until this administration takes a hard look in the mirror and gets  serious, until it removes Cuba from the state sponsor of terrorism list  and ends the economic and financial restrictions imposed during the  Trump administration, the United States will continue to contribute to  the suffering of the Cuban people every single day, every single hour.   The Biden administration has had nearly 2\1/2\ years to undo the  Trump restrictions. It has purposely decided to keep them in place,  even to embrace them, no matter the cost to the Cuban people. These  policies are no longer President Trump's policies. They are Biden's.   Cuban migration is just a symptom of the suffering. It won't stop  until U.S. policy changes and starts working on behalf of the Cuban  people rather than sitting back and continuing the harsh policies that  have driven thousands to abandon their homes.   Yes, Mr. Speaker, I am angry. I am frustrated. I am past making  excuses for this administration on this issue. We need to change U.S.  policy toward Cuba. Today couldn't be soon enough.                            ____________________
