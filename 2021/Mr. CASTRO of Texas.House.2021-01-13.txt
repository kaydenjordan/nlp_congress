 Madam Speaker, Donald Trump is the most  dangerous man to ever occupy the Oval Office.   Madam Speaker, I want to take you back 1 week ago today when people  were barging through these doors and breaking the windows with weapons,  armed, pipe bombs, coming here to harm all of you, to harm the Speaker,  and to harm the Senate.   Madam Speaker, let me ask you a question: What do you think they  would have done if they had gotten in?   What do you think they would have done to you, and who do you think  sent them here? The most dangerous man to ever occupy the Oval Office.   If inciting a deadly insurrection is not enough to get a President  impeached, then what is?   All of us must answer that question today.   The Constitution requires us to impeach and remove Donald John Trump.
