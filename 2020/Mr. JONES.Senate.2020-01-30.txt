 Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I send a question to the  desk.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you.   Senator Jones' question is for the House managers:         Aside from the House's Constitutional impeachment       authority, please identify specifically which provision or       provisions, if any, in the House rules or a House Resolution       authorized the subpoenas issued by the House Committees prior       to the passage of House Resolution 660.        In addition, please list the subpoenas that were issued       after House Resolution 660.    Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Senator, we will compile the list. We don't have  it accessible at the moment. Oh, we do have it.   Specifically, the subpoenas that went out after the passage of the  House resolution were the subpoena to John Eisenberg and the subpoenas  to Brian McCormack, Robert Blair, Michael Ellis, Preston Wells  Griffith, and Mick Mulvaney.   Let me underscore something that my colleague Manager Lofgren had to  say, and let me break this down, if I can, in very practical terms.   What is the practical import of what counsel for the President would  argue? It is this: Let's say that a Democrat is elected in November,  and let's say that any one of you who chairs a committee in the Senate  determines that you think that the next President is engaged in  something questionable, maybe even in some wrongdoing, and you begin an  investigation. I would imagine that in your Senate rules, like in our  House rules--and it is House rule X, Senator, that has the specific  language authorizing the issuance of subpoenas as a part of our normal  oversight responsibility. That power didn't exist at the time of  Watergate, so they had to have a separate resolution. But that House  rule, passed each session, empowers us to issue subpoenas, as committee  chairs, as part of our oversight jurisdiction.    So there you are with a Democratic President. You are a chair, and  you start to do oversight. You issue subpoenas. You start to learn  more, and what you learn becomes more and more concerning, and you  issue more subpoenas.   The administration's effort to cover up its misconduct says: We are  not going to comply with any of your subpoenas. We are going to fight  all subpoenas.   And they come up with one bad-faith excuse after another as to why  they don't have to comply.   As you investigate further and you are able to overcome the wall of  obstruction, then you begin an impeachment inquiry, and that leads to  the passage of yet another resolution.   They would argue to you that all of the work you did before you  determined that it merited potential impeachment must be thrown out,  that they were perfectly empowered to obstruct you in your oversight  responsibility, that you must begin with your conclusion and you must  begin with the conclusion that you were prepared to impeach the  President before you issued a single subpoena; otherwise, they can say  whatever you did before you got to that place should be thrown out.   Now, we did not have the Justice Department do the initial  investigation here. Why? Because Bill Barr turned it down. The same  Attorney General that mentioned that July 25 call said there was  nothing to see here. So there was no DOJ investigation. There was no  special counsel investigation. It was not as if someone like Ken Starr  handed us a package and said: Here is the evidence. Now you can take up  an impeachment resolution because we have done the investigative work.  No. We had to do that work ourselves.   They would have you believe that any subpoena you issue as a part of  your oversight responsibility that, down the road, reveals evidence  that leads you to embark on an impeachment inquiry must be disregarded.  That cannot and is not the law. It would render the oversight function  meaningless.   Court after court has looked at the Congress's power to issue  subpoenas, and they have all reached the same conclusions. That is, if  you have the power to legislate, you have the power to oversee. Here,  we have a violation of the Impoundment Control Act. That is, Congress  passes military spending. The President doesn't spend it, and he gives  no reason. He keeps it a secret. We are investigating that. That can't  be more squarely within the oversight power of Congress--to find out  why aid we appropriated was not going out the door.   They would say: You can't look into that unless you are prepared to  impeach the President and announce it firsthand. That is the import of  that argument. It would cripple your oversight capacity, and without  your oversight capacity, your legislative capacity is crippled. That is  the real-world import of this legal window dressing. They would strip  you of your ability to do meaningful oversight.   Particularly here, where we are talking about the misconduct of an  impeachable kind and character, it would mean that a President could  obstruct his own investigation.   If you need any evidence of his bad faith, which is abundant--of the  shifting and springing rationalizations and explanations--when we had  Corey Lewandowski in the Intelligence Committee, they said, under  instructions of the White House, he wouldn't answer questions because  they might claim executive privilege. Now, this was someone who had  never worked for the executive, but they made the claim he might use  executive privilege.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Time is expired.   Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Thank you.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senator from Texas.    Mr. Chief Justice.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senator from Alabama.    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I send a question to the  desk on behalf of myself, Senator Manchin, and Senator Sinema.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. The question from Senators Jones,  Manchin, and Sinema is directed to the House managers:         So much of the questions and answers, as well as the       presentations, have focused on the completeness of the House       record. Should the House have initiated the formal       accommodations process with the Administration to negotiate       for documents and witnesses after the passage of H. Res. 660?       And regardless of whether the House record is sufficient or       insufficient to find the President guilty or not guilty, what       duty, if any, does the Senate owe to the American public to       ensure that all relevant facts are made known in this trial       and not at some point in the future?    Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Senators, thank you for the question.   It was apparent from the very beginning, when the President announced  that they would fight all subpoenas, when the White House Counsel  issued its October 8 diatribe saying they would not participate in the  inquiry, that they were not interested in any accommodation.   We tried to get Don McGahn to testify. We tried that route. We have  been trying that route for 9 months now. We tried for quite some time  before we took that matter to court, with absolutely no success.   And I think what we have seen is, there was no desire on the part of  the President to reach any accommodation. Quite the contrary, the  President was adamant that they were going to fight in every single  way.   Now, if they had an interest in accomodation, we wouldn't be before  you without a single document. There would have been hundreds and  hundreds of documents provided. We would have entered an accommodation  process over claims of--narrow claims of privilege as to this sentence  or that sentence. They would have had to make a particularized claim  that we could have negotiated over. But, of course, they did none of  that.   They said: Your subpoenas are invalid. You have to depart from the  bipartisan rules of how you conduct your depositions. Essentially, our  idea of accommodation is you have to do it our way or the highway. And  the President's instructions, the President's marching orders were: Go  pound sand.   Now, what is the Senate's responsibility in the context of a House  impeachment for which there was such blanket obstruction? And bear in  mind, if you compare this to the Nixon impeachment, Richard Nixon told  his people to cooperate, provided documents to the Congress. Yes, there  were some that were withheld, and that led to litigation, and the  President lost that litigation. But the circumstances here are very  different.   Frankly, the President could have made this difficult case but didn't  because of the wholesale nature of the obstruction.   Now, in terms of the Senate's responsibility, the Constitution says:         The Senate shall have the sole Power to try all       Impeachments. When sitting for that Purpose, they shall be on       Oath or Affirmation.    And so you have the sole power.   That expression is used, I believe, only twice in the Constitution:  One, when it tells the House that we have the sole power to conduct an  impeachment proceeding; and, again, the process we used--and they can  repeat this  [[Page S733]]  as often as they would like--it is the same process used in the Clinton  and Nixon impeachments. And I am sure Clinton and Nixon thought that  was unfair, but, nonetheless, we used the same process.   But, here, you have the sole power to try the case. And if you decide  that 1 week is not too long, in the interest of a fair trial, to have  depositions of key witnesses, that is for you to decide. You get to  decide how to try the case.   And so if you decide that you have confidence in the Chief Justice of  the Supreme Court to make decisions about materiality and relevance and  privilege and make those line-by-line redactions, if they are  warranted, if you decide you trust the Chief Justice to decide whether  privilege is being applied properly or improperly to conceal crime or  fraud or for legitimate national security purpose, you have the sole  power to make that happen. That is within--every bit within your right,  and we would urge you to do so.   Now, counsel for the President says the Constitution doesn't require  that. The Constitution doesn't prohibit that. It gives you the sole  power to try this case. And under your sole power, you can say: We have  made a decision. We are going to give the parties 1 week. We are going  to let the Chief Justice make a fair determination of who is pertinent  and who is not. We are not going to let the House decide who the  President's witnesses are; we are not going to let the President decide  who the House witnesses are. We are going to let them both submit their  top priorities, and we are going to let the Chief Justice decide who is  material and who is not. That is fully within your power.   And so, in sum and substance, there is no evidence of an intention or  willingness in any way, shape, or form to accommodate in the House. If  there was, we wouldn't be here. Instead, there was: We will fight all  subpoenas, and under article II, I can do whatever I want. And now we  are here.   And they make the astounding claim: If their case is so good, let  them try it without witnesses. That wouldn't fly before any judge in  America, and it shouldn't fly here either.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, Mr. Manager.
