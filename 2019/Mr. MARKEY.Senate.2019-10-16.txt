The House impeachment inquiry is a solemn and serious  matter. It concerns the official conduct of the President of the United  States, and it implicates matters of grave importance: our national  security, the rule of law, and the very foundations of our  Constitution.   We all--Democrats and Republicans alike--have a duty to defend our  democracy, so when we are confronted with evidence that President  Donald Trump abused his power and violated his oath of office by  seeking foreign interference in our elections and then sought to cover  it up, we have a constitutional obligation to investigate.   The evidence we have already seen validates Speaker Pelosi's decision  to open an impeachment inquiry and reinforces the need for this inquiry  to continue unimpeded. Indeed, Donald Trump himself has already  confirmed key evidence.   Just look at what we know so far. We know that Donald Trump asked a  foreign power, Ukraine, to investigate his political opponent. The  President both admitted it on live television and then released a  transcript showing that it had happened just as a whistleblower alleged  that it did. That is not in dispute.   We also know that Donald Trump then doubled down, subsequently  admitting on camera that he wants foreign governments like Ukraine and  China to investigate his political opponents. That is not in dispute.   So instead of focusing on the Latin phrase ``quid pro quo,'' the  President should be saying, ``mea culpa''--my fault, but he is not. And  with each passing day, additional evidence of serious wrongdoing at the  highest levels of our government has surfaced, evidence that Donald  Trump has subjugated the Nation's interest to his personal and  political interest and evidence that plainly warrants further  investigation.   For example, we learned that prior to his phone call with Ukrainian  President Zelensky, Donald Trump blocked almost $400 million in  military and security aid to Ukraine. Moreover, as the White House's  own partial transcript of the conversation reflects, Donald Trump  conditioned this aid on the Ukrainian President's willingness to  conduct a political investigation, telling him: ``I would like you to  do this as a favor though.''   Donald Trump's quid pro quo linking U.S. military and security aid to  a politically motivated investigation makes his admitted solicitation  of foreign interference in our elections that much worse. It is an  abuse of power and betrayal of Trump's oath to the Constitution and  promise to the American people.   We have also learned that White House officials moved the transcript  of the phone call between President Trump and President Zelensky from  its typical electronic storage system to a separate system intended to  handle classified information of an especially sensitive nature. In  other words, there appears to have been an effort to cover up Donald  Trump's wrongdoing.   We are also witnessing extraordinary attacks by Donald Trump on the  whistleblower who brought the matter to light.   Donald Trump's attacks on this individual are so serious and so  harmful that they may rise to the level of witness tampering and  obstruction of justice. They send a chilling message to others who may  have information and are contemplating coming forward.   It should go without saying that whistleblowers play an important  role  [[Page S5854]]  in our democracy, especially when it comes to whistleblowers in the  intelligence community. They should be praised and not demonized or  threatened.   Most recently, we have learned that the President allowed his  personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, to conduct a shadow foreign policy  outside of proper State Department channels--a foreign policy that  serves personal interests and the President's personal political  interests, but not the interests of the United States or the American  people.   We have learned that two individuals connected to Giuliani have been  indicted on charges of violating Federal campaign finance laws stemming  from hidden foreign campaign donations. We have learned that a career  diplomat with an unblemished record was recalled from Ukraine because  she honored her oath to the Constitution, but Trump viewed her as an  impediment to his foreign policy agenda.   These are just some of the things we have learned in the past few  days.   So what must we do? The answer is simple. We must investigate and get  all the facts, Donald Trump's unprecedented and unjustified refusal to  cooperate notwithstanding. The torrent of revelations of serious  misconduct relating to foreign interference in our elections only  underscores the need for the House investigation to continue unimpeded.   The Founding Fathers were very concerned about foreign interference  in America's democracy. They knew that foreign involvement in our  politics and elections posed a threat to our sovereignty as a new  nation.   In 1787, John Adams wrote: ``As often as elections happen, the danger  of foreign influence recurs.'' In 1788, Alexander Hamilton warned us  that foreign powers trying to gain influence in our politics would be  ``the most deadly adversaries of Republican government.''   The threat of foreign interference in our elections is as serious  today as it was more than 200 years ago. We must do all that we can to  defend against it, and that includes an impeachment inquiry into the  conduct of the President when he admits to soliciting that very  interference.   The House of Representatives is going to begin a process. If the  House of Representatives ultimately approves articles of impeachment  against Donald Trump, the Senate will hold a trial and our Members will  serve as jurors.   As a member of the Senate and a potential juror, I will take my job  as seriously as any I have ever had in this institution, and I hope my  Republican colleagues will do so as well. The American people deserve  nothing less.   Leader McConnell and my Republican colleagues must uphold their oaths  to the Constitution, put country over party, and conduct a fair trial.  Anything short of that would be a dereliction of duty.   No one should prejudge the case. Indeed, that is precisely the advice  that Leader McConnell gave during the 1998 impeachment proceedings when  he stated: ``As a potential juror, if it's serious enough to warrant a  potential impeachment proceeding, I don't think I ought to prejudge the  case.''   We have a constitutional duty to investigate President Trump's  attempts to orchestrate foreign interference in our elections, the  usage of his office to support his personal political goals, and how he  sought to cover up that effort. Nothing less than our national  security, the rule of law, and our constitutional order are at stake.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
