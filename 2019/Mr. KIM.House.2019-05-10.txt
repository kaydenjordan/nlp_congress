 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the incredible  contributions that small business owners across Burlington and Ocean  Counties are making to our communities.   This week is National Small Business Week, and I have talked with New  Jersey small business owners about the opportunities they see and the  challenges that they face. One owner is Kristofor Sabey, who runs Surf  Liquors and Market with his wife, Patty, in Seaside Heights.   In 2012, Kristofor and Patty faced the unthinkable when Superstorm  Sandy destroyed their store. But as Kristofor told me, small business  owners are nothing if not determined, and they have rebuilt, even  though they still face challenges.   It is that determination that drives more than 860,000 small  businesses in New Jersey, and it is that determination that makes them  the backbone of our economy and our communities.   I hope my colleagues take a moment this week to reach out, listen,  and thank our small business owners. When we do better for our small  business owners, they do better for our communities. We should strive  for that this week and every week forward.                            ____________________
