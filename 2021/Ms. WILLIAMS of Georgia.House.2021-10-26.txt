 Madam Speaker, everyone, inside Congress and  out, has a duty to stop domestic violence.   Those of us in the House of Representatives can fulfill that duty  today by voting to reauthorize and strengthen the Family Violence and  Prevention Services program.   Sadly, Atlanta experienced what researchers at Emory University  called the ``co-occurring pandemics'' of COVID-19 and domestic  violence. The victims of both were disproportionately in marginalized  communities.   A strengthened Family Violence and Prevention Services program may  have prevented those acts of violence in the first place. This bill's  expanded resources will support organizations like the Partnership  Against Domestic Violence, and everyone else working in the Fifth  District to end domestic violence.   If you are a victim of domestic violence, I want you to know you are  not alone. Please call the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 1 800- 799-SAFE or text ``START'' to 88788.   Thank you to my fellow Georgian Lucy McBath and to Chairman Bobby  Scott for their leadership in advancing this crucial legislation.   I urge all my colleagues to vote yes on the Family Violence  Prevention and Services Improvement Act because there are not two sides  to this issue. You are either opposed to domestic violence or you  aren't.
