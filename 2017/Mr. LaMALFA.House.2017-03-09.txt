 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to share with you one of the  countless stories my office has received that highlight the hardships  faced under the Affordable Care Act, primarily by middle-income  families. This one came in on January 17. Joe writes:   ``Mr. LaMalfa, I was penalized $850 on my 2015 tax return for the  transgression of not having been enrolled in the Affordable Care Act.   ``I simply cannot afford the now $895-per-month premium, double, to  insure my family of three. I have been forced into what's called self- pay for our doctor visits.   ``Cancer biopsies, Z-Packs, dental, and eyeglasses all come out of my  paycheck . . . it sure would have been nice to have that extra $850  penalty to pay for all this.''   He ended his message stating, simply: ``ObamaCare needs to be  repealed and replaced with free market policies that can be purchased  across State lines.''   His testimony highlights one of the primary issues with the ACA:  fewer choices, increasingly expensive premiums, deductibles that are  out of sight that are forcing citizens into paying out of pocket for  services they need.   Another one of my constituents told me they were ultimately forced to  choose between paying their mortgage and paying their monthly premium.  That is not a choice at all, and one that should not have to be made.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from California (Mr.  Yoho), a good friend here, and my other colleagues here, to allow me  the moment to speak.   Mr. Speaker, I am really excited about the opportunity with this new  administration for relief for regular Americans from the Affordable  Care Act. I think the intentions may have been good when it was passed,  but we see the devastating effects from the many emails, letters,  calls, and the communications my office received from middle-income  families. They are the ones that are the most negatively affected by  this act. We have seen their premiums and their deductibles go out of  sight. They may not even need to have the insurance anymore because the  deductibles are so out of reach for them on cost, so insurance means  nothing to them.   Indeed, with most Americans having health insurance before the ACA  that they were at least reasonably happy with, they have had that  choice taken away from them. They have had choices taken away. My wife  and I were sitting there in December 2013, being forced, just like  everybody else, to enroll in a plan with a broken website trying to get  it to go through. We knew at the time we were going to have big  problems with that.   We even agreed with the Republican conference when we were on the eve  of this taking effect. The President decided that maybe we need to have  a 1-year pause for this for employers of 100 people or more. We agreed  with that. We offered legislation because you are not supposed to just  do that with the stroke of a pen. Indeed, it was duly passed  legislation with all Democrat votes, no Republican votes, just a few  short years before. We agreed, let's lay this for a year, if nothing  else, for those larger employers.   But we also said: Mr. President, we should also delay it for  everybody else because we know it isn't going to work. We know this is  going to do nothing to curb costs. That really is the bottom line. It  is the middle-income families that I am really worried about in this  thing because, again, we received so many communications from them  saying: Please help us. We can't afford it. We are putting off being  able to buy a home because we are seeing these costs go up. We are  putting off college savings for our kids because our costs are  spiraling out of control.   So if we do nothing else in the process, again, are we going to come  up with the perfect bill?   There is no perfect bill when you have this many years of the type of  government takeover of health care that we have seen here. But we are  going to do the best we can because it is those folks out there-- middle-income Americans--that we are trying to help to bring relief  from the ACA so they can go back to doing the priorities they see:  having affordable insurance, doctors they can choose, a plan they can  choose, and being able to go off and do the things like saving for  their kids' college and maybe buying that home that is part of the  American Dream instead of the American nightmare they see it has been.   So I appreciate my colleague, again, having this time this night and  for allowing me to speak for a few minutes.
