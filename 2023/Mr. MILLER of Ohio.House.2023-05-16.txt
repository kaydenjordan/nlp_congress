 Mr. Speaker, veteran suicide is a tragedy that  claims far too many of America's heroes.   We lost 6,146 veterans that we know of from suicide in 2020 alone.  That is about three times as many soldiers as we lost in Afghanistan  from hostile action.   This is tragic, but any veterans listening should know that America  is in their corner.   On May 6, I had the opportunity to join the patriots of Save22 for a  veteran suicide awareness hike in  [[Page H2360]]  Massillon, Ohio. Similar events will happen across the country. Go to  one to let our heroes know that they matter.   Veterans in crisis may call 988 and then press 1 if they need  immediate support.   To our heroes listening: Please know that we are here for you and  that we will never forget your service and sacrifice to our Nation.   May God bless our veterans.                            ____________________
