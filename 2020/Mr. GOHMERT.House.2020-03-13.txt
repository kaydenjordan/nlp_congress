 Mr. Speaker, it is quite sad that something this  important had this kind of procedure.   Now, I got a bill at around 9 o'clock or so. I was told it was the  most recent draft. I read through that, and I got through it in time to  have a number of questions highlighted, tagged.   I wasn't able--my staff was trying--to get a copy of the bill we were  going to vote on. I got it right before the buzzer goes off that we are  going to have a vote in 15 minutes.   This is no way to handle something so important. Part of my problem,  my concerns and questions I couldn't get answered: Is this going to put  some people out of business? I get over here, and people hadn't read  it, so they can't answer my questions.   This is no way to handle billions and billions of dollars when we are  trying to help people, and we don't even know whether we will help them  or hurt them.                            ____________________
