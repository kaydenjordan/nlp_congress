 Mr. President, Senator McCaskill and I rise to have an  opportunity to pass a bill and for the Senate to do some work on a bill  that has been around for several years and just hasn't been able to go  over the finish line. We would like to see that finish today.   It is a bipartisan bill with a very straightforward concept. Right  now, if any agency head or any sub-Cabinet individual or any individual  within the government wants to see what another agency is doing, they  have to go to the Office of Management and Budget. They would do a  study--and get it back to them--to find out if the program they are  doing exists somewhere else.   If any Member of this body or of the House wants to find out about an  agency and such straightforward things as how many employees they have,  what programs they are doing, if they measure those programs, how are  those programs measured--if we want to find out those very basic  things, we have to go to the GAO office to make a request, and 18  months later, we will get an answer back on that specific thing.   This is something that every agency either already has or should have  but that the American people can't see, the Congress can't see, and,  quite frankly, the individuals within the agencies also cannot see.   This is a straightforward concept. We call it the Taxpayers Right-to- Know Act, and it is something Senator McCaskill and I have worked very  hard on. It is something that passed out of the Homeland Security  Committee unanimously. This is a bipartisan bill. In fact, to show you  how bipartisan it is, this passed in the House of Representatives last  session 413 to 0. Not a single House Member voted against this  proposal, but it wasn't able to pass in the Senate. So Senator  McCaskill and I brought it up again this year. It came unanimously out  of committee; it also has been through the House of Representatives. In  January of 2017, it passed unanimously in the House of Representatives  again. This is not a controversial piece of legislation.   What is interesting is that Senator McCaskill and I did a lot of work  with President Obama's Office of Management and Budget to make sure  there were no concerns. They had some concerns, so we made some  changes, and President Obama's Office of Management and Budget signed  off on this and said it would be a helpful document.   We have now worked with President Trump's Office of Management and  Budget, which also signed off on this proposal and said that this would  work.   We went to the Government Accountability Office, the entity we asked  to help us find duplication, waste, and inefficiency in government, and  in a hearing we asked Gene Dodaro, the head of GAO, a simple question:  Would it be a help to have the Taxpayers Right-to-Know Act? You have  the ability to see all agencies. Would this be a help to you? His exact  response:         I would urge the Congress to complete passage of that       bill--  meaning the Taxpayers Right-to-Know Act--       and send it to the president for signature. I think that it       would make a huge difference in identifying overlap,       duplication, fragmentation in the federal government and       provide a better accountability tool to the Congress and the       agencies. It's severely lacking.    That is from the head of the Government Accountability Office, the  one we have asked to help us find these things. He is saying that he  needs this tool. We need this tool. The agencies need this tool.   President Obama's team signed off on this. President Trump's team has  signed off on this. It has passed unanimously out of the House of  Representatives.   We bring it to the floor today to ask unanimous consent to move this  across the floor of the Senate today, to be able to get in place what  President Obama asked for, what President Trump has asked for, what the  Government Accountability Office has asked for, what all Members of the  House of Representatives have asked for, and what Senator McCaskill and  I are asking for.   With that, I yield to Senator McCaskill.    Mr. President, I could not more wholeheartedly agree  with my colleague from Missouri.   What is surprising to me is that Senator Schumer's objection to the  taxpayers right-to-know bill was that the taxpayers would actually find  out information that he doesn't want them to find out. That is the  surprising part.   I am grateful to be able to get his answer because over the last 6  months, our staff--Senator McCaskill's and my staff--has worked with  his staff every month. We have made 27 changes and 6 revisions over the  last 6 months. In the last month, we have gotten radio silence--nothing  from Senator Schumer's staff. So we finally brought it to  [[Page S2414]]  the floor and said ``What is the problem?'' because we can't seem to  figure out what the problem is. We learn today that the problem is that  he doesn't want the program inventory to be public because if the  American people and the Congress and the Office of Management and  Budget see the programs, they might actually do things with efficiency.  That seems surprising to me, but if you read the transcript, that is  what he just said. The fear is that they will actually find out what  the Federal Government does in the programs.   Surely that is not his objection. Surely no one in this body would  say: I hope the American people and the Office of Management and Budget  never find out what the Federal Government does.   Here is what this bill does. The reason we could not have a good  listing--Senator Schumer mentioned that there is no way to do a list  right now--is because there is no definition for a program. The Federal  Government has struggled with that simple definition, so this bill  fixes that. The reason that inventory doesn't exist gets solved with  this. So literally Senator Schumer's objection as to why we shouldn't  do this is nonsensical.   The second issue with this is the fear of OMB and Mick Mulvaney  actually trying to slash programs. OMB and Mick Mulvaney have no  authority to take down a program. Congress does that, and Senator  Schumer knows that better than anyone in this body. While OMB can make  recommendations, Congress has to actually vote to act on those  recommendations. He can't just slash programs. He can recommend it. He  can say: Here is an issue of inefficiency. It is the exact same as the  Obama administration could have done, the exact same as any future  administration could do, but Congress must act on that.   It seems exceptionally shortsighted to say: I don't want the American  people to know what the government is doing, because of the current  administration and someone I don't like.   In a few years, there will be a different administration. That may be  in 7 years, or that may be in 4 years, but in a few years, there will  be a different administration, but this problem will still remain.  Agencies can't see what other agencies are doing, this Congress can't  see what the agencies are doing, and the American people cannot see  what the agencies are doing.   I would say that for the benefit of the taxpayers--not the benefit of  Washington bureaucracies but for the benefit of the taxpayers--we  should allow this information to go public. I hope we can continue to  work with Senator Schumer's office, after making 27 changes that his  staff recommended, to finish this document.   Yesterday, Senator Schumer was caught in the hallway and was asked  what the problem is in the Senate, and his response to a reporter was  that the Senate needs more comity. I would agree.   The House approved this unanimously. Our committee approved this  unanimously. It has come to the floor and has but one person who  believes that the American people should not have access to the  information on the programs they pay for.   I would love to see more comity in this body and for us to work this  out.   I yield the floor.
