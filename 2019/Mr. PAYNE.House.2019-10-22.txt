 Madam Speaker, I would like to celebrate an organization  right here in Washington, D.C., that fights every day to increase the  academic achievements of local African American students, the Black  Student Fund.   The fund has provided educational assistance and resources to  promising Black students since 1964.   Officials work with students from pre-K to 12th grade to keep their  grades up, graduate high school, and go on to college. Many of these  students are the first in their families to go to college, and 70  percent of them are from single-parent households.   The benefits of a quality education to students and their communities  are too numerous to mention in 1 minute. That is why we need more  organizations like the Black Student Fund to keep more of our youth out  of trouble and in the classrooms where they belong.                            ____________________
