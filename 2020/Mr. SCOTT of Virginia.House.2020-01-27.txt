 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 943, the Never Again  Education Act.   With each passing year, there are fewer and fewer people who can  provide firsthand accounts of the horrors of the Holocaust. We have a  responsibility to ensure that the lessons of the Holocaust are not  forgotten.   As Elie Wiesel once said: ``Wherever men and women are persecuted  because of their race, religion, or political views, that place must,  at that moment, become the center of the universe.''   This legislation creates a grant program to fund Holocaust education  programs across the country.   As we confront a disturbing rise of anti-Jewish bigotry and acts of  hate, let us invest in the minds of young people to understand the  destructive powers of intolerance and how to use that knowledge to  embrace understanding and insight.   Madam Speaker, I thank Chairwoman Maloney, Mr. Bacon, Mr. Norcross,  and Ms. Stefanik for their leadership, and I encourage my colleagues to  support the bill.
