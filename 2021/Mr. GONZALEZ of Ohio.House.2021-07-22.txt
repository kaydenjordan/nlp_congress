 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the  Cuban people and against the illegitimate, violent dictatorship that  continues to assault the basic freedoms and rights of the Cuban people.   This photo here behind me is of two of my heroes, my abuelo and  abuela. In 1960, they and their children were forced from their  homeland by the communist regime for having the audacity to say no to  Castro and his thugs.   Sixty years later, that same regime and that same poisonous ideology  wreak terror on the Cuban people as the people march courageously in  the streets, knowing full well what brutality awaits them as they ask  for the most basic of human rights.   Yet, there are some in this body who foolishly wish to blame America  for the plight of the island and the suffering of the Cubans. Let me  say emphatically that the Cuban people are suffering and crying out for  freedom because the communists have spent 60 years cynically destroying  their country and trying to break the spirit of their own people. They  will not succeed.   I stand firmly against the Castro regime and any of their apologists,  and I stand with the Cuban people who are crying out for freedom.                            ____________________
