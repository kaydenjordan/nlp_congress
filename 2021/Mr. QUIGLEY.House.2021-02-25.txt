 Madam Speaker, I get it now. This is all about  protecting women. This intolerance is the Republicans' effort to show  us how much they want to protect the rights of women. They want us to  believe that protecting LGBTQ Americans somehow hurts women and girls.  But they know better, and history will accurately reflect what it  really is.   It is an ugly, twisted use of feminism. It is what it is. It is  homophobia. It is transphobia. It is intolerance, and it is hatred.   There is no constitutional right to hate. There is no constitutional  right to exclude, and there is no right of conscience to hate.   Trans rights are human rights. LGBTQ rights are human rights. We must  pass the Equality Act now.
