 Mr. Speaker, the ongoing malicious and  provocative construction by Hezbollah of attack tunnels along the  Israeli northern border have intensified. This puts innocent lives in  critical danger, requiring Israel to destroy the tunnels located on  Israeli territory. The world should condemn Hezbollah, a murderous  terrorist organization, for infiltration designed to kidnap Israeli  citizens.   The message of National Security Advisor John Bolton is clear to  ``call on Hezbollah to stop its tunneling into Israel.''   This major aggression by the Iranian-backed terrorists has also moved  the Trump administration to impose greater sanctions on the terrorist  group and to encourage all nations to stand up against the Iranian  malign behavior.   The Hezbollah attack tunnels are a blatant violation of Israeli  sovereignty and a violation of U.N. Security Council Resolutions 1559  and 1701, which call for the disarmament of all nonstate militias and a  verified demilitarized zone in southern Lebanon.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and may we never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.                            ____________________
