 Mr. President, today I have the distinct honor of  recognizing Tony Colter of Powell County as Montanan of the Month for  his many years of leadership in resolving forestry and timber issues  and his dedication to making Montana a better place to live for all  Montanans.   Tony is a founding member of the Beaverhead-Deerlodge Working Group,  which was formed in 2011. The group brings Montanans with diverse  interests together to collaborate with Forest Service staff and  community members to promote collaboration and transparency when  solving forest-level issues in the Beaverhead-Deerlodge National  Forest.   Tony's leadership and passion for the Working Group has impacted the  lives of many of his fellow Montanans. He has been instrumental in  helping develop science-based restoration strategies, forging diverse  partnerships, and improving Forest Service projects through  collaborative approaches and recommendations.   Fellow members of the Working Group say that Tony cares deeply about  the group's vision for the Forest, and his passion and charisma made  him a valuable leader and representative for the Working Group. They  say that learning from and working alongside Tony was an honor.   Tony also worked for many years at Sun Mountain Lumber in Deer Lodge.  His former coworkers, friends, and colleagues all agree that his  efforts have made a lasting impact. Bryan Lorengo with the Montana  Logging Association said, ``The one thing that sticks out about Tony is  his calm demeanor and willingness to listen first while respecting  people's opinions and views even though they might be opposite of his  own.''   It is my honor to recognize Tony for his leadership and commitment to  bettering the Forest and serving his community. Through his passion for  advancing the Working Group's mission for and dedication to solving  forest-related issues, I have no doubt that Tony's hard work has made  the great State of Montana a better place to live.   Congratulations on your retirement, Tony. You make Montana  proud.                            ____________________
