 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to bring attention to the  devastating impacts of droughts and floods that have been exacerbated  in part by climate change in California but also around the country and  around the world.   California is being battered with major storms bringing flooding and  high winds across our State. Normally, we need the water but not quite  at this level and at this measure.   We need to be taking advantage of the heavy precipitation to shore up  our water supplies, to fill our State's critical reservoirs, and  recharge our aquifers that have been depleted not only over decades but  the last 3 years as a result of extreme drought.   The fact is, California gets most of its moisture, unlike parts of  the country, from November to March. If we don't get it then, we don't  get it at all.   The acceleration of the cycle of droughts and floods caused by  climate change and more demands in California's water system, more  people, more needs, have made it more difficult for farmers to put food  on America's dinner table. I know. I am a third-generation farmer.   Now, the ongoing storms and floods threaten to damage our crops.  California's San Joaquin Valley, which I represent a part of, grows  nearly a quarter of the United States' food and has been bearing the  brunt of it all.   Since 2019, farmland in California has shrunk by 10 percent,  resulting in over 750,000 acres of fallowed land. Nearly 12,000  agriculture jobs were lost statewide, representing a 2.8 percent  decline. A total of 1.3 million acres were left unplanted compared to  2019, most of it within the San Joaquin Valley. Sadly, we see that  example here. And the surface water deliveries in the valley were cut  by nearly 43 percent; a complex State and Federal water system. Zero  percent were to agricultural allocations. You can't grow food without  water.   Our farmers feed the world, and they can't do that without a reliable  water supply. Forty-four percent of California's agriculture is  exported.   Last year, Congress enacted the bipartisan infrastructure law, the  largest infrastructure investment since the Eisenhower administration.  These projects must be accelerated to develop additional water storage  and to expand access to water for farmers in the valley and throughout  the State.    In these efforts, we secured $1.15 billion for western agriculture  water storage, an important first step; $25 million for the San Luis  and Delta-Mendota Authority, which increases 130,000 acre-feet of  additional water storage; $30 million for Sites Reservoir to pursue  off-stream storage that will provide 1.5 million acre-feet of water;  $82 million for the Los Vaqueros Reservoir that will expand another  115,000 acre-feet of additional storage; and $15 million to construct  the Del Puerto Canyon Reservoir, another 82,000 acre-feet of off-stream  storage.   If all of those would be in place today, that would be an additional  2 million acre-feet of additional water supply for California during  these flood times. Unfortunately, these projects are not built. We must  get about that business.   These investments, along with the ongoing Friant-Kern Canal  construction already underway, show that we can and will improve our  water system to sustain our future with climate change and other  factors.   For decades, sadly, we did not make these investments, and we need to  do so to protect our communities and farmland against extreme weather  events for our country and for the world.   Water will rival energy in the next 10 years as to whether or not  nation-states can live together amicably. It is critical.   Finally, we took a large step by investing in this bipartisan  infrastructure. But the flooding that we see here obviously is our  current, ongoing problem. Our Federal agencies must work  [[Page H157]]  quickly, and we must use all of the water tools in our water toolbox to  prevent future disasters like this from destroying our State and for  other water basins, like the Colorado River and the Mississippi River.  All of these are known to experience periodic flooding and periodic  droughts. We must act now.                            ____________________
