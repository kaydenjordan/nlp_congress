 Mr. President, today I wish to honor University  of Arkansas- Fort Smith Chancellor Dr. Paul Beran who will be leaving  the university at the end of August after more than a decade of  service.   Since becoming chancellor in 2006, Dr. Beran has shown himself to be  a tremendous advocate for the university. During his tenure, he has  overseen the expansion of undergraduate degree programs, as well as a  master's degree program, resulting in the graduation of thousands of  students over the past 12 years. Under Dr. Beran's leadership, UAFS has  tripled its student housing capacity, expanded the school's Boreham  Library, constructed the Windgate Art and Design facility, and expanded  its athletics program, transitioning from the junior collegiate level  to an NCAA Division II athletic program.   Dr. Beran is a champion of all students, notably student veterans. He  facilitated the construction of the veteran resource center, which  offers veterans a special space on campus. In addition to serving as a  communal study space, the center streamlines interactions with off- campus organization and businesses.   He has made a career out of helping students pave the way for a  successful future. He has been recognized for his work to advance the  academic opportunities of the African-American community, earning the  Golden Hands Award from the Martin Luther King Holiday Committee. He  was credited as a distinguished graduate of Stephen F. Austin  University and was recognized by Texas A&M University's College of  Education as an outstanding alumnus. All of these honors are well  deserved.   I congratulate Dr. Beran for his outstanding achievements in  education and thank him for his service to the University of Arkansas- Fort Smith. I appreciate his friendship and enjoyed working with him to  improve education opportunities in Fort Smith. UAFS is an excellent  school and a great asset to the region, thanks to his leadership and  years of dedication. We will miss his guidance, but wish him continued  success as executive director and chief executive officer of the South  Dakota Higher Education Board of Regents.                            ____________________
