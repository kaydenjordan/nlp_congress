 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Representative Gianforte and  Representative Connolly for their work on this bipartisan bill to  extend the authority for agencies to conduct telework pilot programs  for travel expenses. The current authority for this program expired on  December 9 of this year, so passage of this bill is urgently needed.  The bill extends the program until December 13 of 2020.   In February of 2012, the United States Patent and Trademark Office  used this authority to initiate the Telework Enhancement Act Pilot  Program. This program allows USPTO employees to work throughout the  country and waives the requirement that the agency pay their travel  costs for mandatory trips back to its headquarters.   According to the USPTO, the program significantly expanded the  agency's teleworking workforce and allowed it to hire and retain a  highly skilled workforce. The USPTO also estimates that this program  has saved the agency more than $77 million in fiscal year 2016,  including $17 million in avoided real estate costs and nearly $32  million in reduced recruitment expenses.   The agency also cites increased productivity, work hours, employee  morale, and decreased environmental impacts as benefits of the pilot.  Given its benefits, it makes sense to authorize an extension of this  pilot program.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter that the Oversight  Committee received from The National Treasury Employees Union yesterday  supporting the bill.                                               The National Treasury                                                 Employees Union,                                                  December 11, 2017.        Dear Representative: As National President of the National       Treasury Employees Union, representing over 150,000 federal       employees in 31 different agencies, I am writing to express       NTEU's views on HR 4171, a bill to amend title 5, United       States Code, to extend the authority to conduct telework       travel expenses test programs, which is scheduled to be       considered by the House tomorrow.        NTEU represents the trademark attorneys at the U.S. Patent       and Trademark Office (PTO). The enhanced telework program has       allowed employees to work and live in various communities       across the nation, saving PTO office property costs and       reducing employee turnover. We support the bipartisan       legislation for a short-term extension of the pilot, which we       believe has been a success for both the PTO and employees. We       believe, with the expiration of this new extension, that the       agency will have the experience to be able to allow national       telework while covering employee travel costs.            Sincerely,                                                Anthony M. Reardon,                                                National President.     Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to  the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, let me thank the gentlewoman from  Florida and the author of the legislation and manager for their  leadership on this issue as members of the Oversight Committee and  indicate that I rise to support H.R. 4171.   I am a member of the Judiciary Committee and have worked very hard on  patent and trade issues, and particularly the patent office, and I see  this as  [[Page H9815]]  raising the caliber of opportunity of different types of employees,  which are very important. The patent office is a skilled entity, and  clearly, this gives a greater opportunity for those individuals to work  in places beyond Washington, D.C.   I also think it is important to note that telework is advancing, and  it should not be considered less work than anyone who is at an office.  I would hope that, as we look at legislation dealing with telework,  that telework would not diminish the benefits that an employee gets and  they would not be distinguished because they are working at home, if it  was allowed, versus in an office.   So I think this is an important responsibility of the Oversight  Committee, and clearly, I rise to support that. Keeping in mind that  the House Judiciary Committee and the House Oversight Committee have  worked together on a number of issues, I might just comment on, I  think, an element that needs the cooperation of the Judiciary Committee  as well.   I think, today, many of us heard of a statement being offered by the  Oval Office. I would like to read part of it into the Record. It deals  with the standards of accountability and protocol and decorum. It was  sent by the Oval Office.   ``Lightweight Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, a total flunky for Chuck  Schumer and someone who would come to my office `begging' for campaign  contributions not so long ago (and would do anything for them), is now  in the ring fighting against . . .''--I will just say the Oval Office.   This requires oversight of the appropriate committees because it is a  question of protocol, dignity of the office.   I would offer to say, as a woman, I am outraged that these comments  were made. I don't know what it means to say ``would do anything.'' We  all know that we do not have public finance, and members of various  parties and levels of government raise fundraising dollars to  communicate to their constituents. I would imagine that they go to any  number of individuals who live in their State.                                time  1430    I think that Senator Gillibrand obviously went to an individual who  lived in her State, but to silence a sitting Senator on her expression  of outrage over treatment of women and to utilize a theme that has been  used for decades regarding how women rise--this is the larger question,  how women rise.   Are they Ph.D.'s? Are they law enforcement? Are they secretaries or  doctors? Are they teachers? Are they in businesses in Hollywood? Are  they in aviation? How do they rise?   This squarely talks about, overall, all women and, frankly, I think  it is important, in an oversight capacity, that the women who have  asked to be heard as it relates to issues of the Oval Office should be  heard, as all, in a process of combining committees, such as Oversight  and Judiciary. That is our appropriate protocol.   All that I have said, I have always said that these issues should be  allowed the appropriate investigation and due process, and that, I  think, would be what the American people would want us to do.   So I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. I could not be on the floor,  and I would be remiss, if I did not bring to the attention of my  colleagues the dastardly comment that does not fit the office and,  really, characterizes women, American women, since this is an issue and  a statement made here in the United States, characterizes women in a  highly inappropriate manner; and a professional colleague in an equal  branch of government to be castigated by the Oval Office, I think an  apology is warranted.   But I think an investigation is warranted for those women who have  made allegations who have yet, to date, been heard, and I might add,  they have yet, to date, been sued, so they have not had their day in  court to be able to answer any such allegations.   I hope that our respective chairpersons and committees will  investigate this in the most appropriate way forward.   And any woman that is of a generation of this time, millennials or  other women, have had the allegations made against them that the only  way they have risen is because they have acted in a certain manner, I  don't think that that is appropriate and appropriate decorum.   With that, I support this legislation. I look forward to the answer  to our request for full hearings on these women who have to have their  say and to be heard regarding the protocols of the Oval Office.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman and Members of the body are  reminded to refrain from engaging in personalities against Members of  the Senate.    Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers. I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers. I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join my colleagues in consideration of  H.R. 1208, a bill to designate the facility of the United States Post  Office located at 9155 Schaefer Road in Converse, Texas, as the  Converse Veterans Post Office Building.   Every day, brave men and women in our military make great sacrifices  to defend this Nation and protect our freedom. While we can never repay  them for their service, naming the Converse Post Office in their honor  is the least we can do.   Mr. Speaker, we should pass this bill and name this post office so  that we might recognize the selfless service of  [[Page H9816]]  our veterans and honor the sacrifices they have made for this Nation.   Mr. Speaker, I, too, urge the passage of H.R. 1208, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Cuellar).    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am honored to join my colleagues in consideration of  H.R. 2815, a bill to designate the facility of the United States Post  Office located at 30 East Somerset Street in Raritan, New Jersey, as  the Sergeant Basilone Post Office.   We have already heard he was born in 1916 and enlisted in the United  States Army at the young age of 18. While serving in the Philippines,  Sergeant Basilone developed a reputation as a championship boxer.   He returned to the United States in 1937 to begin work as a truck  driver, but we have heard that that was not enough. He reenlisted in  the Marines in 1940.   Sergeant Basilone earned the reputation as the marine who proved that  the opposition was not invincible. Sergeant Basilone was a hero. As  stated, upon his death, he was awarded a Navy Cross, the Navy's highest  decoration.   Mr. Speaker, we must pass this bill to name the post office in  Raritan, New Jersey, after their hometown hero so that future  generations might continue to be inspired by his selfless and heroic  service.   Mr. Speaker, I urge the passage of H.R. 2815, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pascrell), my colleague.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join my colleagues in consideration of  H.R. 3638, a bill to designate the facility of the United States Post  Office located at 1100 Kings Road in Jacksonville, Florida, as the  Rutledge Pearson Post Office Building.   Born in 1929, Rutledge Pearson graduated from New Stanton High School  in 1947, before attending Tillatson College on a baseball scholarship.  Following his graduation, he began playing for the Negro League's  Birmingham Black Barons, but because of his race, the Jacksonville  Beach Seabirds refused to allow Mr. Pearson to play on their team,  deciding they would rather close the park.   His rejection, however, inspired him, and he went on to become an  influential member of Jacksonville's education system and civil rights  movements. He served at every level in the NAACP, and he continued to  energize and inspire young people around his community, as he did in  the classroom every day.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to be a cosponsor of this legislation to  honor Mr. Rutledge Pearson. I urge the passage of H.R. 3638, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Lawson).                                time  1500     Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join my colleagues, particularly my  colleague from central Florida, in consideration of H.R. 4042, a bill  to designate the facility of the United States Post Office located in  Kissimmee, Florida, as the Borinqueneers Post Office Building.   Originating in 1899, as part of the Puerto Rican Regiment of the  Volunteer Army, the 65th Regiment became a part of the U.S. Army in  1908. The unit distinguished itself throughout Europe in World War II.   The 65th Regiment rapidly gained a reputation as one of the bravest  and most reliable regiments and, by November 1950, had become the  leading regiment by the 3rd Infantry Division.   In June of 2014, the Borinqueneers became just the second Hispanic  Americans to be awarded the Congressional Gold Medal, as they were  honored for the bravery and distinguished service for which they broke  down racial barriers in defense of our Nation.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to cosponsor this bill, and I look forward to  passing this legislation in honor of the 65th Regiment for their  service, their sacrifice, and lasting contributions to our country.   Mr. Speaker, I urge the passage of H.R. 4042, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Soto).    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Soto).    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join my colleagues in consideration of  H.R. 3655, a bill to designate the facility of the United States Postal  Service located at 1300 Main Street in Belmar, New Jersey, as the Dr.  Walter S. McAfee Post Office Building.   Dr. McAfee was born in Texas in 1914 and earned degrees in  mathematics and physics before receiving a Ph.D. in nuclear physics  from Cornell University in 1949.   You have already heard that Dr. McAfee launched this country into the  space age. Dr. McAfee also made important contributions, as you have  heard, to this country as an adviser to the U.S. Army during the  Vietnam war.   Mr. Speaker, we should pass this bill to commemorate the illustrious  career of Dr. McAfee and the legacy he leaves behind through his  impressive scientific accomplishments.   Mr. Speaker, I urge the passage of H.R. 3655.   I have no further speakers, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join my colleagues in consideration of  H.R. 4285, a bill to designate the facility of the United States Postal  Service located in Mullica Hill, New Jersey, as the James C. ``Billy''  Johnson Post Office Building.   You have heard he was a native of Richwood, New Jersey. He attended  elementary school at Mullica Hill and graduated from Glassboro High  School before attending Benedict College. In 1941, he began his  military service in the United States Army.   You have heard he was assigned to the Canon Company, the 370th  Infantry Regiment, 92nd Division. Regretfully, he made the ultimate  sacrifice in 1944, when he was tragically killed. But his legacy lives  on. He serves as an inspiration to those who have benefited from his  sacrifice.   Mr. Speaker, we should pass this bill to commemorate the sacrifice  that Second Lieutenant Johnson made to his country. I urge the passage  of H.R. 4285.   Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I yield back the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, first of all, I echo the comments I have  heard from other colleagues to thank my colleague from Illinois,  Representative Kelly, for her unwavering commitment to this issue.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak for those who have died in the United  States as a result of senseless gun violence. I want to reflect this  evening on where we have been, where we are now, and where we must go  from here.   When I took office 1 year ago, I was so excited to give my first  speech on the House floor. But I never dreamed my first speech would be  a tribute to a former friend and colleague.   My first floor speech was to honor Sergeant Debra Clayton, a law  enforcement officer who was shot and killed while trying to apprehend a  murder suspect, a person who should have never had a gun in his  possession in the first place.   Since then, two more law enforcement officers from central Florida,  Officer Matthew Scott Baxter and Sergeant Richard Samuel Howard, have  been shot and killed, both officers of the Kissimmee Police Department.   I was sworn into Congress just 6 months after the mass shooting in  Orlando at the Pulse nightclub where 49 people who were involved in  what my bishop likes to call a late-night fellowship--not doing  anything wrong, not in the wrong place--were killed by a lone gunman.   At that time, it was the worst mass shooting in modern American  history. But in the short time since then, the number 49 has been  surpassed as 59 people were killed in Las Vegas just a few months ago.                                time  1915    What this says is things are not getting better, and Congress has  failed to take responsible action. Since the Newtown shooting, Congress  has held at least 50 moments of silence for the victims of gun  violence. But, Mr. Speaker, please tell me: How does a moment of  silence protect the next victim?   I join my colleagues in honoring the victims who have died tragically  of gun violence in our Nation. The victims deserve to be remembered.  Their families deserve recognition, and the victims and their families  deserve action.   John 13:17 says: ``Now that you know these things, you will be  blessed if you do them.'' Well, we now know these things. In other  words, when you know better, Mr. Speaker, you are supposed to do  better.   We also know that the vast majority of the American people across the  Nation want action.   As a former law enforcement officer, I had a duty to enforce the laws  to protect the innocent; and, Mr. Speaker, as Members of Congress, we  have a duty to enact laws that protect the innocent. We need to stand  up to the gun lobby and take on their indiscriminate sales of bump  stocks and other modifications that make weapons deadlier or more  suited for criminal violence. We need to strengthen programs that work,  such as the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, and  drastically improve mental health screening and treatment.   And I continue to oppose concealed carry reciprocity, as I did last  week on the floor, because it would allow persons from outside your  State to bring their firearms anywhere in your State, making the job of  law enforcement officers on the street who have the responsibility of  sorting it all out more difficult and, potentially, more dangerous.   Mr. Speaker, the men, women, mothers, fathers, sons, daughters,  brothers, and sisters gunned down in our country deserve remembrance.  They also deserve courage from their leaders. They deserve action from  their leaders. I once again call on this body to provide some.   Debra Clayton, Matthew Baxter, and Sam Howard.   Again, I thank my colleague from Illinois for her unwavering  commitment and leadership on this issue.
