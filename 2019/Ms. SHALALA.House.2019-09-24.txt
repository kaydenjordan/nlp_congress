 Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor my good friend Maurice  Ferre, who was considered the father of modern-day Miami. He passed  away on Thursday at the age of 84.   Born in Ponce, Puerto Rico, Maurice championed the power of  architectural beauty and cultural diversity to reshape a city.   He served Miami as mayor from 1973 to 1985 and succeeded in  transforming the city into the commercial and cultural center we know  today.   Mayor Ferre's vision of Miami as integrated and urban, international  and ultramodern is woven into every inch of our community, from the  high-rises in Brickell to the bayside park that bears his name.   He was a talented politician and innovative entrepreneur and a man of  unparalleled class and elegance. He continued to advocate for our city  and for the people of Puerto Rico until his last days.   His passion, wisdom, and loyalty to Miami will be missed but never  forgotten. He was a true titan of public service. I am proud to have  called him my friend.   Mr. Speaker, my thoughts are with his wife, children, and  grandchildren, and with all those in Miami who will miss this  incredible man.                            ____________________
