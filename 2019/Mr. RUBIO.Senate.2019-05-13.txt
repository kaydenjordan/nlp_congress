[[Page S2785]]    As a student at Seminole Elementary School in the 1990's, Jade  participated in a weekly culture class on the Brighton Reservation to  learn about Seminole history. This was her favorite class and served as  an inspiration for her continued learning of Native American affairs.   Like her students, Jade is a second language learner of Creek. She  believes teaching the language to her students is very important, as  there are only 33 speakers of the language left in the region. She is  dedicated to doing everything she can to keep the language alive for  future generations.   Jade teaches Creek 1 and 2 at Pemayetv Emahakv Charter School to  seventh and eighth grade students. She graduated from Edison College in  2004 and was offered a job teaching Seminole history.
