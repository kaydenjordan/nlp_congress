 Mr. Chair, I thank the gentlewoman from Kansas for  this outstanding complementary amendment to a very important issue.   I am, I believe, very much supportive, and I am supportive of the  idea of the GAO producing a report examining the FCC's efforts to  assess competition. That is an important record that we in the Congress  need, and it complements the Save the Internet Act which represents  true net neutrality protections that are designed for today and  tomorrow without loopholes.   The Save the Internet Act includes enhanced transparency protections  and enacts specific rules against blocking, throttling, and paid  prioritization.   Additionally, the Save the Internet Act empowers the FCC to stop  internet service providers from undermining the net neutrality  principles through new and harmful mechanisms, but we want to work with  those providers.    My colleague just mentioned 5G. Nothing that we do here is going to  inhibit, I believe, the opportunity for us to work together.   Ms. Davids' amendment is a vital and important contribution to the  idea of competition, and the idea of serving your area, and making sure  that we understand how the competition is increased in wireline and  wireless broadband internet access to many markets.   I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. I support her amendment, and I  support the underlying bill, which is the Save the Internet Act, and I  thank Mr. Doyle for his leadership over the years in this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I am reminded of the creation of the  Homeland Security Committee and the Department of Homeland Security. It  was in the aftermath of the heinous acts of 9/11, of which I was a  Member of the United States Congress, and the description and actions  are seared in my memory.   We organized the Homeland Security Department to be the front lines  of security, to recognize, and to determine what would be the best way  to function.   I will be introducing legislation about the security of the Homeland  Security Department. The precipitous firings and resignations are  putting this Nation in jeopardy and putting the men and women on the  front lines for the work that they are doing, it is undermining that  very important work.   So today I rise as a cofounder and co-chair of the Afghanistan  Caucus, to ask my colleagues to salute those who just lost their lives  in battle in Afghanistan, soldiers from across the Nation. Their  families are mourning, and we owe them a recognition that they wear the  uniform and they are able or willing to sacrifice for us.   I would ask my colleagues to take a moment of silence for those who  died in the recent IED incident in Afghanistan. I ask now for a moment  of silence for those soldiers who have fallen in battle.                            ____________________
