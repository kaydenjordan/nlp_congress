 Madam Speaker, I agree with the comments of many of my  colleagues on both sides of the aisle expressing grave concern over the  President's decision to establish a date certain for the withdrawal of  all U.S. military forces from Afghanistan. I believe this decision is  deeply misguided, and it is damaging to the long-term national security  interests of the United States and our allies.   The strawman argument of ending forever wars might be a convenient  campaign slogan, but it is strategically naive and deeply offensive to  those who have volunteered to fight to ensure that the very  organization which attacked us on September 11, 2001, is incapable of  ever doing it again.   This is their job. It is a job that I did on four deployments. It is  our sworn duty. It is their sworn duty. They are proud to do it, and we  honor them for it.   The truth is our force levels in Afghanistan are a fraction of what  they once were, and have been steadily decreasing for years.  Maintaining a small residual force is not an unaffordable or  unsustainable burden. More than any other deployment in the world, the  U.S. and NATO presence in Afghanistan delivers tangible strategic  benefits to the U.S. at a relatively small and ever-decreasing cost,  not to mention the immense humanitarian benefit to the people of  Afghanistan itself, especially the women and the girls.    The recent violence committed by the armed forces in Afghanistan only  proves that the Taliban, al-Qaida, and ISIS-K clearly see this  announcement as a full-fledged capitulation, and it reveals their true  nature as untrustworthy and savage.   A military withdrawal must always be based on conditions, not a  calendar. By establishing a specific date, we are simply surrendering  the hard-fought leverage we have gained over two decades, and we are  inviting the Taliban to embark on a vicious reign of terror against the  Afghanistan people.   Furthermore, as a military man, I am utterly dismayed that we did not  take the necessary steps to secure and prepare standoff basing in the  region to project power when needed to conduct counterterrorism  operations and to support the Afghan National Defense and Security  Forces before announcing the withdrawal.   We put the cart before the horse. We now have a moral obligation to  ensure that the Afghan security forces can continue functioning with  the proper military and financial support to keep the Taliban from once  again plunging Afghanistan into darkness.   Finally, and most urgently, we must honor our promises and keep faith  with our partners and allies. Our values must remain the foundation of  our foreign policy. If our partners and allies  [[Page H2550]]  lose faith in our ability to back them up, we willingly cede the field  to an enemy who seeks our destruction.   It is now, unfortunately, a moral imperative to find a way to  expedite the safe passage of the very people who stood by us for nearly  two decades. They have been loyal to our shared vision and have  sacrificed so much to the pursuit of democracy. Their safety must be an  absolute priority for this administration.   So far, we have not observed sufficient urgency in developing an  interagency plan to do this and in requesting the necessary resources  and authorities from Congress. If we don't do this, the Afghans who  helped our military will be hunted down and murdered by the Taliban.   We must ask ourselves: Did we learn anything from our clumsy  withdrawal from Iraq in 2011?   The only thing more expensive than maintaining a moderate level of  stability in a country like Afghanistan is the bloodshed and cost we  will bear if we are forced to return.   This is not an academic, hypothetical consideration, nor is it a  partisan issue. Like many others on this side of the aisle, I  repeatedly and publicly expressed my deep concerns over President  Trump's impulse for a hasty withdrawal.   The Taliban is still allied with al-Qaida. If the Taliban prevails  after our withdrawal, it is very likely that al-Qaida will once again  have a safe haven to conduct terrorism, and this is the very reason we  invaded Afghanistan in the first place.   Fortunately, pushback from Congress and the previous administration  slowed the withdrawal process while retaining negotiating leverage and  key counterterrorism capabilities. Unfortunately, from my vantage  point, this latest decision has abandoned any semblance of strategy. It  is a retreat.   This hasty withdrawal is a tragic mistake, and we are going to regret  it. I urge the President to change course before it is too late.                            ____________________
