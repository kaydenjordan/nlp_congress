 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, we are inching ever closer to the  government's spending deadline of January 19, when we will have to  address a host of unresolved issues. We must lift the spending caps  equally for defense and other domestic priorities, such as opioids,  veterans, pensions. We must pass an aid package to give relief to  disaster stricken areas of our country. We must pass the healthcare  package that extends CHIP--children's health insurance--and community  health centers.    Just this week, the CBO projected that CHIP will actually save the  government money if it is extended for 10 years. We could ensure that  kids continue to get quality health insurance for longer and save the  government money if we extend it for 10 years. That is a no-brainer.   Of course, we must settle the fate of the Dreamers. A deal to pass  DACA protection alongside a package of border security measures is  finally within reach. As the immigration meeting at the White House  showed, almost everyone in this body is interested in passing DACA  protections into law.   Democrats are interested in effective, practical border security  measures. We want what secures the border the most, not what sounds the  best, not what was a political slogan in a campaign but what actually  protects our border as drugs flow in and other things come across. We  are working as hard as we can to find an agreement both sides can live  with. The only folks who didn't get the memo were some House  Republicans who continue to push hard-line immigration bills that are  outside the scope of the negotiations. I am referring to Representative  Goodlatte's proposal, which is entirely counterproductive and  completely unacceptable.   If Speaker Ryan is going to listen to the hard right in the House and  coalesce behind Representative Goodlatte's proposal on DACA, we will  have no deal. Let the American people hear that. If Speaker Ryan is  unable to resist Representative Goodlatte's proposal--he has never been  for Dream to begin with--we will have no deal.   If Speaker Ryan bends to the hard-right faction of his caucus--which  is far away from what most Americans think; the hard right doesn't like  Dreamers, and 70 percent of Americans do--and if they ask for  immigration measures outside the scope of our negotiations, then so  will we. Deal with chain migration outside of the scope of Dreamers?  Let's deal with the 11 million who need a path to citizenship--a tough  but fair path. We can play that game too. We can go beyond the confines  of this deal, which has been Dreamers and border security, and then the  whole thing won't happen.   There are people on my side who aren't going to want to make any  compromises. I know that. There are people on both sides who won't want  to make any compromises. As responsible leaders, we have to come to an  agreement, and we can't make everybody happy. That is why we have a  House and Senate. That is why we have legislators.   The whole reason we narrowed the scope of our negotiations is so that  we could accomplish something for the Dreamers, rather than  relitigating comprehensive immigration reform in such a compressed  timeframe.   This body passed a very fine bill, in my opinion. It was really tough  on the border. It was tough on benefits. It was tough on a path to  citizenship. For the first time, for instance, green card holders had  to learn English. That was in our bill that passed this body--led by  Senator McCain and myself and the Gang of 8--68 to 32. The House didn't  dare take it up for the same reason they seem to have trouble today:  The hard right said no immigration reform. And we are stuck. That hurts  everybody.   I am sure my good friend is hearing from farmers in his State, as I  hear from farmers in mine, and businesspeople. We have to tighten up  our borders. We have to make sure we have a rational system of  immigration. We can't assure that every person who wants to come here  comes here. We all agree with that. But that is comprehensive  immigration reform, because we also believe that the 11 million here  should be given a difficult but fair path to citizenship. We can't  start litigating all of that.   Some of my friends on the other side of the aisle say: I have to have  this provision outside DACA and border security. They are hurting the  cause of getting something done.   If we can reach an agreement by the end of this week or over the  weekend, we can pass it into law as part of a global deal on the budget  by next Friday. I believe that is still the best way to resolve the  issue. I am hopeful we can get this done. Any later than that, we won't  have time to do it by the 19th.   Let me assure my colleagues, accept the majority leader in good faith  and the Speaker in good faith--their intention is to put a bill on the  floor in February or March. We have heard that before, and it never  happens. So we feel passionately that we should get this done--both  tighten up the border and help the Dreamers. We have to do it as part  of the must-pass bill, and that must-pass bill is this global spending  deal.                            ____________________     Mr. President, now a word on the Russia investigation.  Over the past weeks, several events have shaken my confidence that our  Republican colleagues are committed to an independent investigation in  Congress and at the FBI.   A rightwing smear campaign is being waged to discredit the  investigation and the investigator. Absurd attacks have been launched  on Special Counsel Mueller, one of the finest men that I think we have  ever come across in this body. I remember when he was FBI Director;  everyone loved him. He is a man of utmost integrity. A Republican  Congressman went so far as to suggest his investigation was a ``coup''  when that Member spoke on the floor of the House.   Here in the Senate, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee--I have  great respect for him; we are the only two Charles E's in the Senate-- referred Christopher Steele to the FBI and recommended criminal  charges, even though Mr. Steele was a whistleblower--something that our  chairman of Judiciary has always protected. He came to the FBI with  concerns that Donald Trump was subject to blackmail. Any American would  worry about that. The chairman took that action  [[Page S145]]  unilaterally--that is, asking for criminal charges--without consulting  with or providing notice to the minority. Yet he still expressed  outrage when the ranking member of his committee released a transcript  of his committee's interview with the chairman of Fusion GPS even  though that was what was in contention. There is a fundamental double  standard here. You can't complain, Mr. Chairman of Judiciary, about our  side doing things unilaterally if you do them unilaterally. We want to  work in a bipartisan way.   I applaud my friend, the senior Senator from California, for  releasing that transcript. It contained information that was crucial  for the American people to read and understand in order to judge for  themselves the allegations my friends across the aisle have made. You  make a serious allegation against someone but say no one can see the  information? That is not fair. That is not how we work here in America.   Now, in the Foreign Relations Committee, my friend Senator Cardin was  compelled to release a minority report about Russia's interference in  foreign elections because the majority would not join him. Think about  that. Senator Cardin's report showed something we already know to be  true--no one disputes that; well, maybe a few--that Russia maliciously  and persistently interferes in elections around the globe and will not  cease without unified and strong countermeasures.   Senator Cardin's report is another compelling reason that the Senate  act on election security legislation. Before we left for the holidays,  Senators Lankford, Klobuchar, Harris, and Collins introduced the Secure  Elections Act. It is a good piece of legislation that would help shore  up election security. Midterm elections are just around the corner,  and, as Senator Cardin's report tells us, Russia will no doubt endeavor  to sow confusion and chaos into our democracy once again. That is what  they do. That is what Putin likes to do. We have to stop it. And making  information public about it is very important. This should be a  unifying, nonpartisan issue.   Why would the Republican majority on the Foreign Relations Committee  refuse to join that report? It is because--in my judgment, at least-- for partisan reasons, Republicans in Congress and some in some parts of  the media--the conservative parts of the media--have sought to  undermine the Russia investigation in countless ways. They have hidden  behind secrecy and innuendo to cast aspersions on the investigation and  erect roadblocks in its path. Their goal, it seems, is to discredit the  investigation so that ultimately they can discredit any findings that  are detrimental to their party or their President.   President Trump makes the strategy manifest, clear as day, almost  every day on his Twitter feed. Yesterday, he tweeted that the Russia  investigation was ``the single greatest witch hunt in American  history.'' That is a little self-centered. How about Salem? Those  people were burned at the stake. And he wrote that ``Republicans should  finally take control.'' That last line should send shivers down our  spines, that ``Republicans should finally take control.''   From the very beginning, this investigation has been about an issue  most sensitive to our national interests--interference in our  elections, the wellspring and pride of our wonderful and great and  grand democracy. If ever there were an issue that transcends party,  this is it. Yet here is the President of the United States imploring  his party to ``take control'' of the investigation. You never thought  you would hear a President say something like this. Frankly, you never  thought you would hear such silence from the other side of the aisle  when he does, but that is where we are. Republican lawmakers ought to  shout down that kind of appeal. We all must commit to the essential  truth of the matter, which is that the investigation into Russian  interference in our election must remain as bipartisan and as  nonpartisan as possible. The interests of the Nation are at stake. All  of us--all of us--must choose country over party.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
