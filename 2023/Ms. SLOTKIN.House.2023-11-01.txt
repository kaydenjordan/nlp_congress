 Mr. Speaker, today I rise with others from the Michigan  delegation and onward to recognize Samantha Woll, a former member of my  staff, a member of the House of Representatives' staff, and a  passionate advocate who was taken from us on October 21, 2023.   It is important to me, as I know it is to my colleagues who knew her  directly, that we honor the way Sam lived.   From working in my very first congressional office to serving as the  president of her synagogue in Detroit, Sam had profound faith, not just  as a Jewish woman but an abiding faith in humanity and a passion for  interfaith relations, something that right now is more than ever  important to our country.   In closing, I ask my colleagues for a moment of silence for Sam, for  her family, for her community, for our State, and send my deepest  condolences to her loved ones in Michigan.                            ____________________
