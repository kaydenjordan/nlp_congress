 Mr. Chair, I just raise concerns with two of the  amendments that are in this en bloc amendment.   Amendment No. 5 is one that extends free coverage for pregnancy  prevention, and with the amendment, extends to all FDA-approved drugs  and methods. Why I find it interesting is that, of course, a couple of  years ago, we actually increased the copays on TRICARE for former  members.   If a former member has diabetes, they have a $28 copay for insulin.  So this is kind of strange because what we are doing is selecting one  type of drug and saying there are no copays for this, yet we have  thousands, if not tens of thousands, of members who take an important  drug like insulin and have to pay a copay. It just doesn't make sense.   With regard to amendment No. 13, amendment No. 13 extends in vitro  fertilization coverage which, up until now, has been for members whose  problems have been related to their military service. It extends it to  all members as well. It is going to greatly increase the number of  embryos created.   Although I have no disagreement with extending the coverage, the  problem is, the amendment and the statute don't deal with what members  are going to do with these embryos. It presents serious life concerns,  due to the sheer number of embryos created that will often be  discarded, now with government payment involved. Many will subsequently  be killed or frozen indefinitely, leaving these early lives in limbo.   There are no limits within the amendment as to how many cycles of IVF  may be covered, how many embryos may be created or frozen. Of course,  there are no requirements to protect the embryos that have been formed.   It is for that deficiency, it is for creating a permanent statutory  entitlement without dealing with what some people object to, which is  treating those embryos created in a comprehensive, long-range fashion,  for those reasons, I express concerns about amendments No. 5 and No.  13.
