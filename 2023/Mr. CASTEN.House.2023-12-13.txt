 Madam Speaker, I am incredibly proud today to introduce  the Clean Electricity and Transmission Acceleration Act with my friend,  Congressman   Mike Levin, to remove the financial and regulatory  barriers that are delaying the clean and cheap energy transition.   For too long, U.S. energy policy has been focused on putting the  interests of  [[Page H6926]]  energy producers and exporters first, which is good for a small  minority of Americans, but is actually opposed to the interests of a  majority of us who are energy consumers.   Here is the thing: every new wind turbine, every solar panel, every  geothermal plant, and every hydro plant is a threat to oil, gas, and  coal producers who cannot compete against free. Every EV charger, every  heat pump, and every LED light is a threat to people who make money off  inefficiency. However, for consumers to realize those benefits and  entrepreneurs to access those markets, we need wires to connect new  generations to new loads.   So over the last year, Congressman Levin and I have worked with our  colleagues across the Democratic Caucus to develop a consumer-focused  energy policy that makes that possible, to accelerate the deployment of  clean energy, to accelerate Americans' access to cheap energy, and to  refocus U.S. energy policy on the interests of energy consumers where  it belongs.                            ____________________
