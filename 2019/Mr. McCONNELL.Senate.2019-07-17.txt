 Mr. President, first, this morning, the Senate  recognizes the death of a distinguished American. We received word last  night that the remarkable life of former Associate Justice John Paul  Stevens had come to a close at the age of 99.   Justice Stevens served for 34 years on the Nation's highest Court.  You didn't have to agree with his constitutional philosophy to admire  his obvious intelligence or the universal reports about his kindness  and collegiality or the passionate patriotism he was proud to wear on  his sleeve. No question, this was a quintessential public servant of  the ``greatest generation.''   A son of Chicago who enlisted in the Navy the day before Pearl Harbor  and went on to earn a Bronze Star for his work in cracking the coded  messages of Imperial Japan, there was just something about Justice  Stevens that told you this man lived life to the fullest. At age 12, he  was there to see Babe Ruth's ``called shot'' at Wrigley Field. At age  99, just this year, he published a memoir that was subtitled  ``Reflections on My First 94 Years.'' In between, alongside his time on  the Court, he found time to weigh in on Shakespeare scholarship on the  side.   So the Senate joins the Nation in appreciating this American life  fully lived, and our condolences are with the Stevens family on this  sad day.                            ____________________     Mr. President, yesterday, our colleagues on the Armed  Services Committee heard testimony from Dr. Mark Esper, the Senate- confirmed Secretary of the Army and President Trump's nominee for  Secretary of Defense. They examined his extensive record of military  and public service and discussed the variety of challenges the next  Secretary will face. By the end, I believe anybody impartial would have  to have come away impressed by Dr. Esper's mastery, intelligence, and  thoroughness.   Of course, it is not exactly surprising that a decorated combat  veteran and distinguished scholar would convey expertise and calm under  pressure. For those of us who knew him during his service as national  security adviser to the former majority leader, Bill Frist, those  qualities are familiar.   You could hardly invent better qualifications for the top job at the  Pentagon than Mark Esper's: a graduate of West Point, advanced degrees  from the Harvard Kennedy School and George Washington University,  courageous service with the 101st Airborne in the Gulf war, service at  the Defense Department, a successful career in the private sector.   Every step of the way, he earned respect and admiration. That  includes high praise from DOD leaders of the last administration, the  Obama administration. They say that Dr. Esper ``works hard, he's smart,  he's dedicated.'' He has ``all the qualifications.''   Our colleagues at the hearing saw an exceptionally well-qualified  nominee. In fact, as my friend the junior Senator from Virginia has put  it, they saw a  [[Page S4872]]  man of ``sound character and moral courage.'' He is a man of honor and  integrity, dedicated to our Nation and committed to the men and women  who serve in uniform, and I think it is clear he deserves prompt  confirmation. Even more, the Pentagon and our Nation's security deserve  a Senate-confirmed Secretary of Defense to be in place and on the job.   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting his confirmation as  soon as it can reach the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, the Senate is in the midst of  considering bilateral tax treaties with Spain, Switzerland, Japan, and  Luxembourg. If yesterday's overwhelming votes on the first protocol are  any indication, all four will be ratified with huge bipartisan margins  by the end of the day, and American businesses and workers in all 50  States will be thrilled to finally be back on fair footing.   The details of these nuanced agreements are complicated, but the core  principles are quite simple. Foreign trade and international investment  are key cornerstones of the U.S. economy. Major parts of proud American  businesses and hundreds of thousands of hard-working Americans' jobs  are oriented around trade with these four nations. So their governments  and our government sit down and negotiate which country will tax which  kind of activities. The result is more clarity, more certainty, and a  lot less unfair double taxation that has cost American businesses  millions and millions of dollars.   Let me say clearly that the years of delays in getting these  noncontroversial treaties ratified have cost American businesses that  employ American workers millions and millions of dollars. Inaction on  this subject has needlessly--needlessly--put our firms that employ all  of our constituents at a complete disadvantage and delayed capital  investments that could have helped American workers.   Let me bring this home with some numbers. I have mentioned one  Kentucky manufacturer that produces more than one-third of all  stainless steel that America makes. They employ 1,500 people. I happen  to know this firm is contemplating a capital investment of more than  $30 million that would benefit Kentucky workers and provide a shot in  the arm for the local economy. But there has been a wrinkle because  this one employer had to pay a $15 million tax bill back in April  because we hadn't ratified the agreement with Spain. And--listen to  this--if the delay had continued, an additional $35 million tax  liability would have been next--had we delayed. If the Senate had not  finally acted on this, this single American manufacturer would have  owed $50 million in unnecessary or redundant taxes, had we not acted.   For nearly 6 years, this manufacturer has been laboring on an unfair  playing field that discouraged them from making investments that could  have expanded operations and created more jobs in Kentucky and  elsewhere in America.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the news story containing  their CEO's statement on yesterday's ratification of the Spain treaty  be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                    [From Business Wire, July 16, 2019]   Statement of North American Stainless CEO Cris Fuentes Regarding the    Passage of the Protocol Amending the Tax Convention with Spain 94-2         Ghent, KY.--Today, the United States Senate passed a tax       protocol with Spain that had been languishing for over five       years, causing unfair double taxation for American companies       with foreign investors. This has cost companies like North       American Stainless tens of millions of dollars over the       years; alleviation of the double taxation could now allow for       greater investment in plants and workers.        NAS Chief Executive Officer Cristobal Fuentes released the       following statement heralding news of the Spanish protocol's       passage:        ``This is a great day for North American Stainless and so       many U.S. companies with foreign investors that had been       subject to unfair double taxation for many years. We are       located in Kentucky, and if it had not been for Senate       Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and his tireless efforts I       firmly believe this day would never have come. Senator       McConnell stood up for his constituents and helped many       working people at our Ghent, Kentucky plant by moving this       protocol through the Senate. He listened to us and put       Kentucky first. Workers in all 50 states stand to benefit       from Senator McConnell's efforts, and companies nationally       have him to thank for improving the American business       climate.        ``In addition to Senator McConnell, we are grateful to       Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Jim Risch and the       bipartisan group of Senators on his committee that moved this       protocol forward. We are also thankful that President Donald       Trump and U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and their       staff members understood the vital importance of this       protocol and strongly engaged to work with the Senate to       achieve this victory. It is now vital that President Trump's       Administration move quickly to finalize and implement this       protocol with the Spanish Government so that affected       companies can have fiscal certainty before year's end as it       relates to tax payments. We are confident that President       Trump will move quickly because this protocol falls squarely       within his America First agenda.        ``At a time when Chinese stainless steel producers are       engaged in unfair trade practices and market uncertainty       exists, this treaty victory gives a leg up to the American       workers who produce quality stainless slabs in Ghent,       Kentucky. Senator McConnell, President Trump, Secretary       Mnuchin and everyone who supported the protocol stood up for       workers all over America today, including the ones right here       in Kentucky. This treaty will preserve and unlock large       investments in our facility, and we look forward to talking       more about that in the near future.''     Multiply this kind of story by all of the other  numerous, significant Kentucky companies whom these agreements affect;  then multiply by 50 States because U.S. businesses from coast to coast  interact with these four nations; then consider how many hundreds of  thousands of workers all of these companies employ. That is the scale  of what we are talking about--the highest consequences.   I know job creators across the country are thrilled that the Senate  is finally moving forward this week, and I am certainly proud to have  helped resolve this matter. But, curiously, it seems that not all of  our colleagues are thrilled. Don't get me wrong; the vote totals on the  floor have spoken volumes. The cloture vote on the Spain agreement was  94 to 1--just one Senator in opposition--and the treaty was ratified  yesterday 94 to 2.   Yet I was curious to hear one colleague of ours come to the floor  yesterday and passionately argue against what I have done as majority  leader to support these agreements. As the Member himself stated, he  has made obstructing these tax treaties a yearlong personal project.  The United States and Spain agreed on this protocol back in 2013. Spain  ratified it in 2014. That is when it also arrived here in the Senate.   For nearly 6 years, he has worked to stall ratification. I know,  because on multiple occasions I sought unanimous consent to secure  Senate ratification of this protocol. During that time, he has tried  and failed to persuade Treasury Departments of two different  administrations to insist on certain changes that would have required  reopening the international negotiations. He tried and failed to  persuade his colleagues on the Foreign Relations Committee that his  ideas were so necessary that we should risk scuttling the treaties-- scuttling all of the treaties--over them. He tried and failed to  persuade the whole Senate.   At every step, executive branch officials and Senate colleagues have  tried to engage his concerns in good faith. But for 6 years in the case  of the Spain treaty, 8 years with respect to Switzerland, and 9 years  with respect to Luxembourg, he was unable to persuade anybody--over 9  years. In all of that time, no one was persuaded, partly because the  changes he demanded don't solve a real problem, partly because they  would have forced reopening the treaties for even more negotiations,  and partly because everybody else was actually listening to the job  creators who have been pleading with us for years to get this millstone  off their necks. There were 9 years--9 years of rejecting reasonable  counteroffers and accommodations, 9 years of working to hold up these  treaties and trying to sell the Obama administration, the Trump  administration, and his Senate colleagues on an off-the-wall story that  failed to persuade anyone.   Look, I am a patient man, but my patience is not inexhaustible. After  unanimous consent was denied on multiple occasions, I determined, after  consulting with the Treasury Secretary and the Chairman of the Foreign  Relations Committee, that I would prepare  [[Page S4873]]  to file cloture on these tax protocols. Yet even after this whole  journey, our colleague still was not blocked or shut out of the  process. He had his opportunity.   A few weeks ago, he had the opportunity to offer amendments to the  protocols in committee. They failed on a vote of 17 to 5. Last night,  we put two more of his amendments up for votes on the floor; they went  nowhere.   Nine years is long enough. In fact, it is far too long--too long for  our U.S. businesses to have been either paying needless double taxes or  deferring huge amounts of money in dividend payments that could  otherwise have been invested right here at home.   Year after year, money that could have been immediately used to hire  Americans or make new investments had to either be frozen up or handed  over in duplicate taxes--all in large part because one of our  colleagues could not accept that one single Senator who hasn't  persuaded his fellow Members is not entitled to singlehandedly rewrite  international treaties. No wonder all kinds of American employers came  out of the woodwork yesterday and urged the Senate to reject his  misguided amendments and waste no more time in ratifying these  treaties. I don't know why the Senator believes he was close to a  breakthrough after his years of effort. Hope springs eternal, I  suppose.   Even if he had convinced the administration or his colleagues, the  U.S. Government would have had to reopen the treaties for negotiation  all over again with the other party, which would almost certainly have  brought about changes that they wanted. No wonder President Trump's  Treasury Department expressed opposition to these amendments. Treasury  told Senators yesterday that going back and inserting these changes  could force a years-long renegotiation of the treaties themselves,  jeopardize their ratification, and have a significant adverse impact on  America's standing among the international community.   I am not quite sure what all these years of heel-dragging will have  accomplished--except impose unnecessary taxes on Kentucky employers and  deferring investments in the United States. I can't see anything to  show for this crusade except hurting American businesses for the better  part of a decade, all to no effect. But I am glad we can turn the page  this week and get these treaties on the books.   I haven't been able to identify a constituency for which he has  advocated, but I know my actual constituents in Carroll County--real  people in Kentucky--are sure glad the Senate has taken this important  action.   It is the right thing to do for the country. It is the right thing to  do for Kentucky workers and all the employers nationwide who have been  waiting and waiting for this unfair competitive disadvantage to be  removed. I am glad that is exactly what we are doing this week.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I understand there is a bill at the  desk due a second reading.    In order to place the bill on the calendar under the  provision of rule XIV, I would object to further proceedings.    Mr. President, the Democratic leader and I just want  to take a few minutes here to point out to everyone that our colleague,  the senior Senator from Vermont, just cast a truly historic vote. Of  course, these tax treaties are significant, but I am talking about the  fact that Senator Leahy just cast his 16,000th vote of his Senate  career. We know of no single statistic that could begin to capture such  a tenure, but this figure comes close--16,000 votes cast for his  constituents. With numbers like that, Senator Leahy has already left  towering figures like our late colleagues Ted Stevens and Ted Kennedy  in the dust. Now he is gaining on legends like Danny Inouye.   I think it is safe to say that all of Senator Leahy's colleagues on  both sides of the aisle are reminded every day why the good people of  Vermont made him the youngest U.S. Senator ever from Vermont back in  1974 and why they have rehired him over and over. He must be a hard act  to follow, too, because, believe this or not, he is still technically-- technically--the only Democrat Vermont has ever sent to the Senate.   I know we all admire the Senator's passion and perseverance. I  remember him fondly from our time together as chair and ranking member  on the Appropriations Subcommittee on State and Foreign Operations.  Foreign Ops was one of my favorite committee assignments, and I am  proud of the investments Senator Leahy and I helped make in support of  democracy, good governance, and human rights around the world.   I think I speak for all of us when I offer congratulations to our  good friend from Vermont on his historic milestone.   (Applause.)    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 11:30  a.m. on Thursday, July 18, the Senate vote on the Corker and Blanchard  nominations and that if confirmed, the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table and the President be  immediately notified of the Senate's action; further, that following  disposition of the Blanchard nomination, the Senate resume  consideration of the Tapia nomination; finally, that at 1:45 p.m., the  Senate vote on the Tapia nomination and that if confirmed, the motion  to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table and the  President be immediately notified of the Senate's action.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session and be in a period of morning business,  with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 95, S. 1321.    I ask unanimous consent that the bill be considered  read a third time and passed and the motion to reconsider be considered  made and laid upon the table.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 120, S. 1833.    I ask unanimous consent that the bill be read a third  time and passed and the motion to reconsider be considered made and  laid upon the table.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m.,  Thursday, July 18; further, that following the prayer and pledge, the  morning hour be deemed expired, the journal of proceedings be approved  to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later  in the day, morning business be closed, and the Senate proceed to  executive session and resume consideration of the Corker nomination.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the  [[Page S4916]]  previous order following the remarks of our Democratic colleagues and  Senator Sullivan.
