 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from  Colorado.   Madam Speaker, for women to thrive in the economic and social  opportunities of our Nation, we must have the ability to control our  own reproductive lives with full access to real healthcare choices.   Republican unrelenting efforts to force unwanted pregnancies and  eradicate affordable, safe abortion will not save lives. Repealing the  Affordable Care Act, defunding Planned Parenthood, and now driving  insurance coverage for abortion into extinction will  [[Page H639]]  return women to the days of coat hanger medicine. Allowing women to be  killed and maimed in back alleys is not pro-life. It will not make  America great again.   Women of America are on the march, and, Madam Speaker, we will not  retreat.
