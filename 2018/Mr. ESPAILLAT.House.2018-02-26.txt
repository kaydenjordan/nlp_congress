 Mr. Speaker, earlier today, the Supreme Court rejected  the Trump administration's appeal to leapfrog the judicial system in an  attempt to end DACA. Today's decision is a victory for Dreamers and the  entire Nation. But our work in Congress must continue until we pass the  Dream Act to protect Dreamers once and for all.   This decision tells us what we have already known all along, that  ending DACA would be detrimental to our community and for our economy.  With the loss of revenue, if we end DACA, it means that critical public  programs like Social Security and Medicaid will take a big hit. We know  that the Dreamers will bring in $460 billion in economic output over a  decade.   Dreamers are our sisters, our brothers, our cousins. They are owners  of grocery stores, taxi drivers, members of our Armed Forces. We cannot  afford to sit idly by. Mr. Speaker, I urge you to bring a clean Dream  Act to the floor.
