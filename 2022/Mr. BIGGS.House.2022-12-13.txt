 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California for  yielding.   I oppose the EAGLE Act and encourage all Members to do the same.   The Biden administration has created the absolute worst border crisis  in our history, and congressional Democrats have done nothing to  address it. They won't even acknowledge that there is a crisis, with  the exception of the gentleman in the Chair.   The crisis is real. It is having a negative impact on communities  across the country, but President Biden has more important things to do  than visit the border.   I visit the border on a regular basis, and every time I do, I hear a  similar message.   First, the brave men and women of the Border Patrol are being  overrun. They are tired of the administration not supporting their  efforts to secure the border.   Second, illegal aliens enter every day because they believe that the  Biden administration is going to let everyone stay.   Thirdly, our communities are running out of resources to deal with  the real-world impacts of the Biden border crisis. Cities like New York  City and Washington, D.C., complained when a few hundred illegal aliens  were sent to their communities, but cities in Arizona are dealing with  large groups of illegal aliens every day. We are now told, with title  42 expiring, that they will do direct releases into Arizona's  communities because there is just simply no place to even hold them to  process them.    Since President Biden took office, U.S. Customs and Border Protection  has encountered more than 4 million illegal aliens at the southwest  land border. During the same time, the Biden administration has simply  released  [[Page H9714]]  more than 1.4 million of those illegal aliens into the country.   Under this administration, those aliens will never be removed from  the country, and the 4 million number does not include the hundreds of  thousands, probably more than a million, got-aways who enter the  country illegally without being apprehended by the Border Patrol.   For example, in November alone, there were more than 73,000 known  got-aways, with estimates of at least one unknown got-away for every  known got-away. That is a total of 150,000 people. We don't know where  they came from. We don't know where they are going. We don't know what  their intentions are.   The numbers continue to get worse. Over the weekend, Border Patrol  reported more than 16,000 encounters in 2 days, and that does not  include known and unknown got-aways.   But according to DHS Secretary Mayorkas, the border is secure. In  fact, he testified under oath that DHS has operational control of the  border. A week later, he backtracked on that statement because DHS does  not have operational control of the border, despite the fact that he is  required to achieve and maintain operational control of the border.   Congress even defined what operational control means so that there  would be no ambiguity. It is this: ``The term `operational control'  means the prevention of all unlawful entries into the United States,  including entries by terrorists, other unlawful aliens, instruments of  terrorism, narcotics, and other contraband.''                                time  1245    I look forward to Secretary Mayorkas testifying before the Committee  on the Judiciary next year and explaining whether he stands by his  previous testimony that he is maintaining operational control of our  border.   We know what he will say, because last month he told the Committee on  Homeland Security that he believes the border is secure.   The Democrat-led Committee on the Judiciary hasn't held a single  hearing on the crisis, and many Democrats on the committee deny that  there is a crisis. At a hearing earlier this year, one Democrat  committee member referred to this crisis as the ``supposed crisis at  the southern border.''   I wonder if she still thinks it is just a supposed border crisis.  Some of us in this room today know the reality of that border crisis.   The committee hasn't held a single hearing on the flow of fentanyl  into this country.   The committee hasn't held a single hearing on the increase in the  number of Border Patrol encounters with illegal aliens on the terrorist  watch list.   You would think that the committee would be concerned with the fact  that in fiscal year 2022, Border Patrol reported encountering 98  illegal aliens on the terrorist watch list.   To put that in perspective, for the years 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020  combined, Border Patrol only reported encountering 11 illegal aliens on  the terrorist watch list.   Secretary Mayorkas couldn't even tell the committee if any of the  illegal aliens on the terrorist watch list who were encountered by CBP  were still in the country.    Mr. Speaker, he has no idea where those individuals are.   Republicans on the Committee on the Judiciary have repeatedly asked  for hearings. Those requests have been ignored.   Instead of conducting oversight, Democrats have advanced bills to  provide amnesty and further weaken our security, which are incentives  to those who wish to illegally enter the United States of America.   The EB-4 issue, as explained by my colleague from California, Ms.  Lofgren, it does not change the impact, as it provides an incentive for  the cartels in their human trafficking expeditions.   The EAGLE Act will do nothing to secure our border or address the  crisis that this administration has created, but it will dramatically  alter our illegal immigration system in ways that most Members do not  understand or fully appreciate.   Even the American Immigration Lawyers Association has opposed the  bill. They acknowledge that the bill will benefit immigrants from a few  countries, namely China and India, while adversely impacting those  wishing to legally immigrate to the United States from almost all other  countries.   Instead of rushing to pass this bill today, the House should be  debating and passing legislation to require Secretary Mayorkas to  enforce the law, to finish construction of the border wall, and to  provide CBP and ICE with the resources they need to enforce the law.
