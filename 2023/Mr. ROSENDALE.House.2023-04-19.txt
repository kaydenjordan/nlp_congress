 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to acknowledge an  extraordinary Montanan whose service to his country is a powerful  reminder of the legacy we inherit from the Greatest Generation.   Jack Kindelman grew up in Roundup, Montana, during the dark days of  the Great Depression in World War II. At the age of 17, Jack joined the  United States Navy during the final months of the war and served with  distinction despite his youth.   Unwilling to sit on the sidelines at the war's conclusion, Jack would  answer the call to service in Korea, where he rescued dozens of  refugees fleeing the conflict in a small fishing boat.   Since then, Jack has been a pillar of the community in Billings where  he volunteers at St. Vincent Healthcare, having served over 10,000  hours to date.   Mr. Speaker, Jack Kindelman's dedicated service has touched countless  lives in Montana and across the United States. It is an honor to  represent him and thousands of veterans just like him in Congress, and  it is my privilege to recognize Jack on the floor of the United States  House of Representatives.                            ____________________
