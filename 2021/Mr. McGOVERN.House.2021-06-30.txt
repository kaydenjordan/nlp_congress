 Madam Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 504, I call  up the resolution (H. Res. 503) establishing the Select Committee to  Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol, and  ask for its immediate consideration.  [[Page H3323]]    The Clerk read the title of the resolution.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, 175 days ago, as we gathered here in this spot, the  House floor became a crime scene. The U.S. Capitol, this temple of  democracy, was ransacked. Property was damaged, and more importantly,  lives were lost.   Insurrectionists tried to stop our democracy in its tracks. A mob  wanted to prevent the certification of a free and fair election in  America, and they resorted to violence to do it.   I will never forget that day. I was one of the last Members off this  House floor, as we were being taken to a secure location away from the  mayhem.   As I was walking out, I looked over and saw these people--homegrown  terrorists, I call them--literally smashing the doors with their bare  fists and breaking the glass to try to get at us.   They weren't here to peacefully protest. They were fueled by rage and  here to cause harm. I looked in their eyes, and I saw hate.   Many of my colleagues feared for their lives. Some called loved ones  to say good-bye. The staff that worked here barricaded their office  doors. They ran down these marble halls, trying one door after the  next, just searching for safety. Others hid in closets, terrified.   When those of us who are elected to Congress put our names on the  ballot, we are prepared to take all kinds of incoming. But the staff  here--the cafeteria workers, the cleaning crew, the people who make our  democracy function day in and day out--they do not. But, still, they  found themselves in danger, afraid for their lives.   We must speak the truth of what happened that day, Madam Speaker.  Shockingly, there is an effort by some in this Congress to whitewash  and minimize what went on. One of my colleagues even suggested it was  somehow just a normal tourist visit, as if facts don't matter, as if we  all didn't see with our own eyes what happened.   History will judge how we respond to the events of that day, and the  glare of history should be cast most harshly on the minority leader,  who worked overtime to prevent a bipartisan, bicameral commission from  being formed to examine what happened on January 6.   A bipartisan commission emerged out of the Homeland Security  Committee with a bipartisan vote. Everything the minority leader asked  for in this commission, he got it. He got it all. But then, I guess,  Donald Trump called him, and he began walking back his support and  whipping against his own ranking member's bipartisan deal.   It has been 25 weeks since an insurrection in our country. A  commission should be already at work right now, getting the facts about  this attack on our democracy so it will never, ever, ever happen again.   Sadly, a majority of Republicans objected to that happening. Now,  they may have delayed uncovering the truth, Madam Speaker. But, Madam  Speaker, the truth will not stay buried forever. That is why we are  here today, because the facts matter.  [[Page H3325]]    A select committee will finally get to the truth about the events of  January 6. It is modeled after a select committee formed when my  Republican colleagues were in charge.   I hope I am wrong, but if past is prologue, many of my Republican  friends will stand up today and say no. They will oppose this select  committee and say they want a different approach.   Well, let me again remind them: We already gave them exactly what  they asked for with the commission, and even that wasn't good enough. I  think, for some on the other side, nothing that gets to the truth will  ever be good enough because they do not want the truth.   Michael Fanone, a Metropolitan Police Department officer for nearly  two decades, responded to the insurrection on January 6. In a letter  that he wrote to all of us, he said: ``I struggle daily with the  emotional anxiety of having survived such a traumatic event, but I also  struggle with the anxiety of hearing those who continue to downplay the  events of that day and those who would ignore them altogether with  their lack of acknowledgment. The indifference shown to my colleagues  and I is disgraceful.''   Madam Speaker, I include the full text of his letter in the Record.                                                        May 5, 2021.        To All Elected Members of the United States Government, My       name is Michael Fanone and I have been a sworn officer with       the Metropolitan Police Department for almost two decades. On       January 06, 2021, I participated in the defense of the United       States Capitol and as a result of my efforts was severely       injured. I was pulled out into the crowd, away from my fellow       officers, beaten with fists, metal objects, stripped of my       issued badge, radio and ammunition magazine and electrocuted       numerous times with a Taser. I am writing to you so that you       may better understand my experience that day.        I am assigned to the First District's Crime Suppression       Team and while my daily responsibilities involve combating       violent crime and narcotics related offenses. I, like many       other officers, took it upon myself to respond to the       numerous calls for help coming from my colleagues at the       Capitol Complex. Upon my arrival my partner, Jimmy Albright,       and I searched for an area where we could be of most       assistance and eventually found our way to the West Terrace       Lower Tunnel entrance to the Capitol. The fighting here was       nothing short of brutal. I observed approximately thirty       police officers standing shoulder-to-shoulder maybe four or       five abreast using the weight of their own bodies to hold       back the onslaught of violent attackers. Many of these       officers were injured, bleeding and fatigued but they       continued to fight.        In the midst of this fighting, I observed Commander Ramey       Kyle, cool, calm, and collected giving commands to his       officers. ``Hold the line.'' It was the most inspirational       moment of my entire life. Even as I write this it brings me       to tears. I tried to render assistance to some of the injured       officers asking them if they needed a break. There were no       volunteers, only those that identified injured colleagues who       may be in need of assistance. I have never experienced such       bravery, courage and selflessness.        Since then I have struggled with many aspects of that day.       As the physical injuries gradually subsided in crept the       psychological trauma. In many ways I still live my life as if       it is January 07, 2021. I struggle daily with the emotional       anxiety of having survived such a traumatic event but I also       struggle with the anxiety of hearing those who continue to       downplay the events of that day and those who would ignore       them altogether with their lack of acknowledgement. The       indifference shown to my colleagues and I is disgraceful.        It has been 119 days since 850 Metropolitan Police (MPDC)       Officers responded to the Capitol and stopped a violent       insurrection from taking over the Capitol Complex saving       countless Members of Congress and their staff from almost       certain injury and even death. The time to fully recognize       these Officers actions is NOW!            Sincerely,                                                    Michael Fanone.     Madam Speaker, I am tired of the delays. Quite frankly,  I am sick and tired of the fact that there are too many people in this  Chamber who continue to put party over country and propagate the lies,  distortions, and falsehoods that led to January 6. It is disgusting.   For Congress to do nothing in response to a literal insurrection  would allow our democracy to be chipped away at from the inside. Not on  my watch.   Our system of government is fragile. It is not a given; it is a  choice. Looking down on us from the gallery right now are  representatives of the D.C. Metropolitan Police and the U.S. Capitol  Police, and I want to thank them and their colleagues for their service  and for protecting us and our democracy on January 6.   To my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who are about to vote  ``no'' on this, please, no lectures on respect for the police because a  ``no'' vote is a vote to cover for those who brutally attacked the  police on January 6.   I say to my colleagues in this House, they will be watching as we  cast our votes. History will be watching. I pray that we have the moral  courage to do what is right, that we choose truth and that we choose to  defend our democracy.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Oh, my God, I can't believe what I just heard. I mean, my Republican  colleagues are talking about the need for bipartisanship. We gave them  bipartisanship. The ranking Republican member on the Homeland Security  Committee endorsed a bipartisan commission, and my friends on the other  side, including the gentlewoman who just spoke, voted ``no'' on it.   Now, they are objecting to a select committee that we are forming  that is exactly like the select committee that they formed when they  were in charge. Give me a break.   This is clear--people should know this--they don't want to get to the  truth. But we will insist that we get to the truth.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Mississippi  (Mr. Thompson), the chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, who  did such an incredible job in negotiating a bipartisan commission.                                time  1400     Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues on the other side  to stop the lame excuses. Now they are blaming the Senate?   Let's go over the chronology: Leader McCarthy had a bunch of demands  in order that we move forward with a bipartisan commission. We gave him  every one.   And then what happened is, I guess, he didn't expect us to actually  work with him on this in a bipartisan way. There is a quote that  appeared in Politico from a Republican aide who said: ``I think Kevin  was hoping that the Democrats would never agree to our requests. That  way the commission would be partisan and we can all vote no and say  it's a sham operation.   ``Because he knows Trump is going to `lose his mind over this  commission'.''   And then all the sudden, he comes out against it, and 175 of my  Republican colleagues voted against a bipartisan commission. They sent  a signal to the Senate to kill it.   So the idea that somehow they are washing their hands of any  responsibility, they were complicit in killing the bipartisan  commission.   And now they are here to try to kill a select committee modeled after  a committee that they established when they were in charge.   So enough of the lame excuses. We get it. You don't want to get to  the truth.   I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Jeffries), the  distinguished chairman of the Democratic Caucus.  [[Page H3327]]         Madam Speaker, I am sorry that the previous speaker  doesn't see the importance of trying to get to the bottom of an attack  on our democracy.   And by the way, for the Record, the gentlewoman voted against the  bipartisan commission.   I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Carolyn B.  Maloney), the distinguished chairwoman of the Committee on Oversight  and Reform.    Madam Speaker, the language on consultation is the  exact same language that was in the Select Committee on Benghazi.   Let's just be honest. My friends on the other side are not interested  in getting to the truth.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr.  Swalwell).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Pennsylvania (Ms. Dean).    Madam Speaker, let me again say it is the exact same  language that was in their Benghazi Select Committee. And I am more  than happy to send over a paper copy so they can see it.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr.  Malinowski).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pascrell).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  the U.S. Virgin Islands (Ms. Plaskett).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Takano), the distinguished chairman of the Committee on  Veterans' Affairs.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds.   Madam Speaker, I was one of the last people off this House floor.  When I walked into the Speaker's lobby, I saw this mob smashing the  window, trying to get at us. And we were protected because of the  Capitol Police and the D.C. police who were here. They protected my  life. They protected your life.   And to them: I apologize that you have to hear this kind of debate, a  partisan attempt to try to undermine a committee that is aimed at  getting at the truth of what happened. You deserve better.   The people who work up here deserve better. Our democracy deserves  better.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs.  Demings).    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  be given 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks on H.  Res. 503.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Speier).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I have great respect for the gentlewoman. We serve on  the Rules Committee together, and she has a tough job here today. But,  I mean, come on. Give me a break.   I mean, we had a bipartisan commission, equally divided, equal  subpoena power, and they voted against it. The minority leader of this  House whipped against it and fought against it and convinced the Senate  to try to kill it.   I have noticed that there is a lack of Republicans who have the  backbone to come down here and explain to the American people why they  won't support the bipartisan commission or this select commission,  because they don't want to be on record as defending a position aimed  at not getting to the truth.   This is a moment that, quite frankly, people are going to remember. I  best point that out because it is stunning to me.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the majority leader.    May I inquire of the gentlewoman how many speakers  remain on her side.    Madam Speaker, I have one additional speaker.   Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I want to just correct the Record on what the previous  speaker has just said. The bill that he referred to was not written by  Democrats. The bill that he referred to, the bipartisan commission, was  written by Democrats and Republicans. It was written in consultation by  the minority leader's designee, Mr. Katko. It was presented to the  Rules Committee in a bipartisan way. This was a bipartisan product.   I share the gentleman's outrage over the attack against the shooting  of Republican Members, including the distinguished minority whip,  during that baseball practice. But I would just say to the gentleman,  respectfully, my friends on the other side of the aisle were in charge  of this institution then. They could have called for an independent  committee to look into that, and I think all of us would have supported  that.   Let me just say, Madam Speaker, that I assume many of my colleagues  on the other side of the aisle are getting their talking points from  the minority leader.   I have to tell you, Madam Speaker, I get why the mother of Officer  Sicknick who lost his life defending us on January 6 said yesterday  that she was disappointed with her meeting with Minority Leader  McCarthy.   I was hoping that maybe the minority leader would come to the floor  and explain to us why he objected to the bipartisan commission, why he  objects to the select committee, and why he objects to getting to the  truth. But apparently he is not coming. Because, Madam Speaker, there  was no rational explanation for putting up roadblocks to get to the  truth unless you are trying to keep it hidden.   I am reminded of that old line: If you have got nothing to hide, you  have got nothing to fear.   So what are my Republican friends so afraid of, Madam Speaker?   Does a defeated and disgraced President hold so much sway that they  are forever unwilling to investigate what happened here?   There was an insurrection in the United States of America, and each  of us not only has the ability to figure out what happened, but we have  an obligation to do so. An obligation that is more important than party  and should come before the whims of any one man, and that includes the  former occupant of the White House. So I urge my colleagues to uphold  that solemn duty today.    Our system of government isn't guaranteed. It is a choice. Keeping it  takes work, and it is time we finally did the work of defending our  democracy after a literal insurrection and allow the process of getting  to the bottom of what happened on January 6 commence.   I was here. I was presiding over the House when this attack happened.  I assumed the chair after the Speaker left. I went out into the  hallway, and I saw these people who were crazed trying to get at us. My  colleagues were here. Our staff was here. The people who support this  campus were here.   The Capitol Police protected us. I mean, I get it. My friends have  turned this into some sort of partisan issue. It isn't.   Please, I hope everybody before they vote will think of not just  Donald Trump or not just what the minority leader instructs them to do,  but think of our police who defended us, think of their staff who put  their lives at risk, and think of everybody who works on this campus.  They deserve a hell of a lot better than what they are getting here  today.   So, Madam Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the  select committee, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Pelosi).    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
