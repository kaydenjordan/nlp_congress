 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, first, let me thank Chairman Hunter for his work on this  bill and on the other work we have been able to do with the Coast Guard  and the legislation. It has been a great pleasure to work with him.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 756, the Save Our Seas Act of  2018, as amended, to include other important bills addressing maritime  safety and ocean technologies.    As explained by the majority's manager of the bill, marine debris,  especially plastics, is a persistent and growing threat to the global  marine environment. Many countries, including the United States,  contribute to the plastic pollution, and it does add up.   For example, in 2010 alone, according to a University of Georgia  study, a total of 8 million metric tons of plastic entered the world's  oceans. Worse yet, the study predicts that number will grow 10 times-- tenfold--as large by 2025.   Not only are floating plastic bags, straws, Styrofoam cups, and  plastic bottles harmful to the health and welfare of marine life, but  marine debris also threatens the food supply of millions of people  around the world who rely on seafood as their primary source of  protein.   The impacts affect people everywhere, and the problem is not going to  go away and won't be solved by itself. The legislation we put forth  today is an important step in the right direction.   Title I would authorize existing funding levels in the Marine Debris  Act to enable the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and  the United States Coast Guard to identify and remove sources of marine  debris and to coordinate response activities on the national and  regional levels to assess and reduce the volume of the debris entering  our oceans.   The title also contains important amendments, including new authority  to allow the Federal Government to provide assistance to mitigate  severe marine debris events, such as the recurrence of the flood of  debris that drifted from Japan across the Pacific Ocean in the  aftermath of the 2011 Fukushima earthquake and tsunami.   I also want to express my strong support for two other bills recently  passed and reported by the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee  that were added as separate titles to S. 756: First, H.R. 6175, the  Maritime Safety Act of 2018, as title II; and my legislation, H.R.  6206, the Coast Guard Blue Technology Center of Expertise Act, as title  III.   The 2015 sinking of the U.S.-flagged commercial vessel, El Faro, and  the tragic loss of all 33 crew members was the worst U.S. maritime  disaster in 35 years. The subsequent Marine Board of Investigation,  convened by the Coast Guard and joined by the National Transportation  Safety Board, found numerous faults in the ship's safety management  system, bridge management, and safety apparatus, as well as other  critical oversights or failures.   Title II enacts several important recommendations contained in the  action memo released by then-Commandant of the Coast Guard, Admiral  Paul Zukunft.   I want to particularly note the chairman's work in bringing together  a couple of hearings on this, both formal and informal, that led to  these investigations and recommendations.   Together, these provisions that are in this bill will improve ship  communication and safety management. They will also improve our ability  to identify and recover voyage data recorders and locate and retrieve  seafarers who may be adrift at sea.   Additionally, the investigation revealed gaps or insufficient  oversight in the inspection regime, and the bill deals with those.   Title II also includes several new requirements to shore up the  oversight and investigation of third-party inspectors, who should be  reviewing the safety of these ships.   I also strongly support title III, which contains my legislation--I  know you are surprised with that support, but nonetheless--H.R. 6026,  to authorize the Coast Guard to establish a Blue Technology center of  expertise.   Unlike the Navy, ocean industry sectors, and ocean science community,  the Coast Guard has not embraced the  [[Page H7644]]  adoption and use of a wide assortment of advanced ocean technologies,  systems, sensors, and platforms. This is unfortunate because I suspect  that several such technologies have the potential to dramatically  improve the Coast Guard's operational capability.   Therefore, title III simply draws upon the existing authority to  direct the Coast Guard to establish a Blue Technology center of  expertise. The overarching goal is to improve from within the Coast  Guard's awareness of blue technologies that apply or align with Coast  Guard mission needs.   In addition, this new Blue Technology center will facilitate a  dialogue and sharing of information between the Coast Guard and the  growing number of Blue Tech stakeholders in the private sector,  academia, and ocean research community.   A 2015 study by NOAA identified over 400 Blue Technology firms across  the United States who generate some $7 billion in annual revenue. These  firms, along with our academic and research institutions, stand ready  to put their innovations to work in the service of the American people,  using the Coast Guard as a mechanism to accomplish that.   I am confident that this Blue Technology center will open doors of  opportunity for the Coast Guard to better protect and patrol the vast  oceans and complex waterways.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides to join with me in  support of this noncontroversial maritime legislation, and I reserve  the balance of my time.                                time  1445     Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time I have  remaining?    That should be enough for Mr. DeFazio, the ranking  member of the committee, to share his views on this legislation.   I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DeFazio).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the honorable  gentlewoman from the State of Oregon (Ms. Bonamici).    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close. I will take my  few seconds that remain then and simply say this is a good piece of  legislation. I want to thank the chair of the Coast Guard and Maritime  Transportation Subcommittee for his work on this, and for working  across the aisle to solve problems, some very real, serious problems in  this legislation.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I might  consume, but I will try to be brief.   Mr. Speaker, we are in total support of this piece of legislation. We  think this is a very, very good thing to do, to adequately fund all of  our military, whether it is SOCOM or any other part of it. It is  essential for our national security.   However, I would like to note that, having served on the Armed  Services Committee for the last several years and endured unending  discussions about the horrible sequestration issues, which were totally  under the control of the majority party to change should they decide to  do so, that it is a little incongruous to put forth a resolution that  would call for adequate funding for SOCOM, and we should do so.   At the same time, when we have created a trillion-dollar deficit with  a piece of legislation that passed last December with no Democratic  votes--because we like to think of ourselves as deficit hawks, and we  think it is difficult to put this Congress into a situation where we  have to choose between the health of seniors who are on Medicare or  young children who depend upon the Medicaid program or maybe the  education systems.   So this resolution, it is a good thing. It is something we ought to  do. Certainly, we ought to support SOCOM. Certainly, we ought to pass  appropriations bills on time. Let me commend the House for having done  so, and we can always blame the enemy on the other side of the  building, the Senate, but the reality is that the Treasury was gutted  by a tax bill of which more than 80 percent of the benefit went to the  top income earners of America and corporations. And a deficit has been  created that will be a trillion dollars next year. That is the period  of time in which this resolution calls for full funding for our Special  Operations Forces.   So my discussion today is really about the very difficult choices  that are going to have to be made because this Congress, without  Democratic support, decided that the first choice was the superwealthy  and the corporations of America, not the children, not the sick, not  those in need of education, not the infrastructure, but rather those  who have much already.   Now, I notice that I don't have many colleagues here on our side,  although I would assure all the Congress that we are 100 percent in  support of our Special Operations Forces, and we look forward to a  continuing debate on the choices that must be made.   Mr. Speaker, I urge an ``aye'' vote, and I yield back the balance of  my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume, as long as it does not exceed 20 minutes.   Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from Texas spoke boldly and correctly. If  I could get a copy of his speech, as I will, I think I will use it  myself.   He covered all the issues that I would want to cover in talking about  the United States Air Force as a representative of two very important  Air Force bases, Travis Air Force Base in Fairfield-Vacaville,  California, and Beale Air Force Base just outside of Marysville,  California.   I found myself not only in sympathy and empathy, but also marching  right alongside the gentleman from Texas as he eloquently spoke about  the role of the Air Force and the necessity of Congress to provide the  adequate funding for not only repairing and maintaining the existing  aircraft and bases, but also to expand and improve.   Certainly, I am looking forward to the arrival of the KC-46s to  Travis Air Force Base. If Boeing will get that done, we will get on  with it.   However, I want to remind my colleagues on the other side of the  aisle that funding for the military is ultimately dependent upon the  revenues of the Federal Government, which are dependent upon the health  of the economy. Those things go together.   My esteemed colleague from Wyoming, in her remarks on the previous  bill, addressed the issue of how we tax and who we tax or whether we  tax. An interesting point was raised about this and whether it is  possible to tax too low.   A situation has arisen in the State of Oklahoma, where they thought  they could cut taxes continually and everything would grow, and there  would be great opportunities. Well, the opportunity turned out for the  highway patrolmen to buy their own gas, and for schools to go to 4- and  even 3-day sessions, because there was no money.   So my point is this, that we have to balance things here. I raise  this issue in the context of the appropriate desire of my colleagues to  adequately fund the military, because I read in the newspaper yesterday  and again today that my colleagues intend to go to tax cut 2.0. Very  interesting.    In the face of a trillion-dollar deficit in the 2018-2019 fiscal  year, we would do another massive tax cut in hopes that the situation  would be such for the revenues of the Federal Government that we could  fund everything that the military wants and whatever other needs we  decide must be funded.   Well, let's see. We just borrowed, or are about to borrow, $12  billion from China to pay American farmers for their losses resulting  from a trade war with China in which China was supposed to somehow grow  our economy by not shipping as much to America.   That is convoluted, but it is what we are going to have to do if we  cut taxes again. We are going to have to grow the Chinese economy, so  we can borrow money from China, and then import from them.   I guess this makes sense to some, but I think we best be very careful  here.   Mr. Speaker, I guess some people would say that I am off subject  matter here, because we are really talking about fully funding the  needs, in this piece of legislation, of the United States Air Force,  and we should do so. However, at the same time, we must consider the  revenue sources for the Federal Government, and we did.   In December 2017, the 435 of us who are selected by the 350 million  Americans to represent them, a decision was made amongst us to slash  the revenue of the Federal Government by more than $1.5 trillion over  the next decade.   Now, my colleagues on the Democratic side didn't vote for that, but,  apparently, the deficit hawks migrate out of Washington, D.C., in the  winter. I suspect they are coming back--not ``suspect,'' they are  actually back. The Speaker of the House tells us that we must cut  Medicaid, Medicare, and Social Security in order to deal with the  deficit that was created by the tax bill. Well, we shall see.   How are we going to adequately fund the military in the face of last  December's tax cut, which I will remind folks, if they care to be  reminded, that the beneficiaries were principally the great American  corporations that were doing quite well, profitably, prior to the tax  cut, and that somehow promised that they would bring jobs home, which  they have not. Well, we shall see.   It takes $1.5 trillion out of the Treasury, and my esteemed colleague  from Wyoming said: Look how successful Oklahoma was.   Well, I don't think she said that. But as she was talking about tax  cuts, it came to mind that we ought to think about Oklahoma and what  happens when the government doesn't have the revenue it needs to do the  things that it must do.   Now, maybe you want to argue that the government must not provide  funding for Social Security. Maybe you would want to argue that the  government must not provide money for Medicaid, of which some 60 to 70  percent of the recipients are elderly people in nursing homes. Maybe we  ought not do that. Or maybe you would want to argue that the Medicare  program for seniors should be slashed and cut.   Those are all suggestions that the Speaker of the House of  Representatives has made. I disagree.   How do we fund the programs that Americans need? Surely, they want a  strong Air Force, as I do. And I suspect they would also want to see  that those seniors in nursing homes are cared for, and those who are on  Medicare are able to get their drugs and their care, and that the  Social Security checks not be slashed and reduced. We shall see.   In any case, I support the resolution, and I think we ought to fully  fund the Air Force.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time I have  remaining.    Mr. Speaker, if you are a person who wants to cut  taxes and borrow money from China, then you can keep the economy going.  In fact, the job growth has been basically steady for the last 8 years.  It has been in the last year, also, and most of this year, and we are  thankful for that.   Nonetheless, we have a very serious deficit. The CBO estimate that  was quoted a moment ago actually took place prior to the tax cut. More  recent estimates indicate that the deficit is larger than anticipated  and that the growth rate has not expanded to the point that was  anticipated and that the deficits that are going to be there are very  real. All of that is true.   While there have been increases in wages, some 2 percent over the  last year, almost 18 months now--and we are grateful for that--those  wages are less than the inflation rate; and, therefore, for those  working men and women across the Nation who have received an average of  2 percent or so of wage growth, it has been eaten up by inflation.   The point here is one of this resolution reminding us that we have a  very important obligation to adequately fund, in this case, the Air  Force; in the previous piece of legislation, special operations.  Indeed, we do have that obligation. But at the same time, we need to  have a fiscally sound government.   Unfortunately, what happened last December was to pull the foundation  of fiscal soundness out from beneath the government's revenue stream.   Now, there is a necessity for some adjustment in the taxes, and you  will get no debate on our side of the aisle about the necessity to do  that. It would have been our choice, had we the majority, to reduce  taxes far more than the tax bill did for the working men and women and  for the smaller businesses in America, and not for the wealthy  corporations that were doing quite well, and certainly not to create an  international Tax Code that continues to encourage the offshoring of  American jobs.   That simply happened because the reduction in the corporate tax rate  for America went to 20 percent, while those American corporations  operating offshore could get a 10 percent tax, providing a very  significant benefit to corporations to offshore jobs. I don't think we  would have done that. Maybe that is why many of us voted against the  legislation.   There is much more to be said about it, but the fundamental point at  this moment is this resolution that says fully fund the Air Force. We  are 100 percent for that.   The question we ask is: How are we to do that in the face of the  massive deficit and, to hear from our Republican leadership, tax cut  2.0? What does that mean, on tax cut 1.0? We don't know. But I would  draw the attention of all of us to what happens when you do not have  the revenues necessary to fund the government--Oklahoma.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I want to thank the gentleman from Oklahoma for making me aware of  the current financial situation, and I will remind him that California  is running a very significant budget surplus at the present time. Both  of our economies are presently growing, and we are thankful for that.   I also want to thank the gentleman for being a voice of knowledge on  the Armed Services Committee, for his many years of service in the  United States Army, and for bringing us this resolution today calling  for the full and timely funding of the United States Army.                                time  1545    My father, who served in the Army and ended that service as a major,  would have been very pleased to hear that there was adequate and timely  funding.   I know I have said quite enough on the issue of how we are going to  fund the government, and I am sure my colleagues across the aisle  probably think I have said too much. If they feel that way, so be it.  But I do think that we need to understand the need to be balanced as we  move forward.  [[Page H7651]]    I announce my support for this resolution, along with the two  previous resolutions, and look forward to its immediate passage.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
