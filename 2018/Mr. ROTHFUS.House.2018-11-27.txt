 Mr. Speaker, in the coming days, this House will debate  the importance of securing our border with Mexico. This should not be a  controversial debate. Every nation has the right to secure its borders.  There are, indeed, differences among nations from the type of  government to the freedoms and liberties a country's people enjoy, and  borders define where these begin and end.   Borders also allow countries to determine who and, as important, what  is allowed to enter into respective nations. It is this latter point,  Mr. Speaker, given the historical context in which the United States  and Mexico find themselves, that impels not only the United States but  also Mexico to ensure that we have a secure border. There are certain  products, namely dangerous narcotics, being made in and shipped through  Mexico that we do not want in the United States, and there are items  such as illicit cash from drug sales that Mexico does not want imported  from the United States.   Yes, we are concerned about knowing the identity of individuals  coming into our country, and we need to be vetting each individual  seeking admission to the United States. But it is the illicit drug  trade, which is responsible for taking tens of thousands of lives on  both sides of the border, that makes beyond urgent the securing of the  U.S.-Mexico border.   Ninety percent of the heroin used in our country comes from Mexico.  Fentanyl, methamphetamines, cocaine, and marijuana also flow across the  border in staggering amounts.   These poisons destroy lives and result in billions of dollars of  illicit cash flowing to transnational criminal organizations on the  Mexican side of the border. These organizations are described best in  one word: evil.   Over the last decade, Mexican drug cartels have been responsible for  deaths of thousands of Mexicans, and their exports have killed  thousands of Americans. Mexico prosecutes relatively few of the murders  that occur on its soil.   The cartels kill with impunity. They kill Catholic priests. They kill  journalists. They kill students. They kill politicians. They have  killed U.S. agents. And they kill each other. The rule of law has been  replaced in many Mexican states with the law of violence, revenge, and  brutal force.   Headlines over the past 2 years tell the story: National Catholic  Register, May 22, 2018: ``Why Is Mexico the Deadliest Place to Be a  Priest?''   The New York Times, December 21, 2017: ``Most Lethal to Journalists:  1. War Zones 2. Mexico.''   CNN, July 2, 2018: ``Mexico goes to the polls . . . 132 politicians  have been killed since campaigning began.''   The Wall Street Journal, November 14, 2018: ```It's a Crisis of  Civilization in Mexico.' 250,000 Dead. 37,400 Missing.''   Progress against the cartels has been too slow, but there have been  some encouraging developments. The trial of the alleged head of the  Sinaloa cartel, Joaquin ``El Chapo'' Guzman, is underway in New York.  Within the last month, the Department of Justice indicted individuals  affiliated with the Jalisco Nueva Generacion cartel, but those  individuals remain at large.   The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration also recently announced it  was joining with State and local officials in Chicago specifically to  go after Mexican cartels, which have played a role in the violence that  plagues that community, a community that is 1,500 miles from the  border.   In announcing the action, the DEA said: ``There is no single entity  or solution that can stop the flow of dangerous illicit drugs like  heroin and fentanyl into Chicago or to keep them from harming the  citizens of this great city. . . . To be clear, these drugs are being  produced, manufactured, and trafficked by various Mexican cartels to  numerous parts of the United States and elsewhere in the world.''   Yes, Mr. Speaker, the border issue does not just affect California,  Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas. It affects the entire Nation, including  my district in western Pennsylvania.   Our two countries have not done enough to combat the epidemic of  drugs and violence. It is an epidemic that has left mothers, fathers,  brothers, and sisters on both sides of the border steeped in grief.   There is no single solution to this evil. But one tool is available,  and that is the force of our will. It is an act of the will to stop the  transfer of drugs northbound into the United States and the transfer of  illicit cash southbound into Mexico.   A secure border is a necessary prerequisite to this end. That secure  border requires not only, where appropriate, physical barriers. It also  requires significantly increased capacity for inspecting vehicles  traveling between the United States and Mexico at our ports of entry.   More inspection lanes, more equipment, and more personnel were  prescribed in the Securing America's Future Act. If we are serious  about securing the border, that bill should accompany any  appropriations language we pass this month.   As the 115th Congress draws to a close, let us take one more vital  step to ending the drug crisis and bring peace to Mexico and  communities across the United States.   Mr. Speaker, let's secure our border.                            ____________________
