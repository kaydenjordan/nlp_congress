 Mr. Speaker, I rise today urging the Senate to take up  the forest reforms that this Chamber passed more than 7 months ago.   Last year, wildfires burned more than 1.2 million acres in Montana,  an area the size of the State of Delaware. I met with the firefighters  on the ground and saw the devastation. I heard from families anxious  about the dangerous air quality impacting their kids. I listened to the  hardworking Montanans worried that their livelihoods would go up in  flames.   Montana survived last year's devastating fire season. Our communities  pulled together, helping neighbor to neighbor, just as Montanans do.   The bad news is that forecasters project another severe fire season  this year. We need to start managing our forests again. While there has  been some progress, more work remains to improve the health of our  forests and reduce the severity of wildfires.   I call on the Senate to end the obstruction and pass forest  management reforms. Montanans need them to act.                            ____________________
