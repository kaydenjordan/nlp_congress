 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 1017 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Woodall),  my friend, pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, none of us know what the future holds, but my friend  from Georgia has indicated that he is not going to return after this  session. He and I serve actively on the Rules Committee and have gotten  to know each other and share moments of frivolity, as well as serious  debate. I am going to miss him. I don't know whether he and I will be  in debate on another rule because we have a rotational system up there,  but just in case, I wish him well in his endeavors in the future.   Mr. Speaker, during consideration of this resolution, all time  yielded is for purposes of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  be given 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, on Wednesday, the Rules Committee met for  7\1/2\ hours and reported a rule, House Resolution 1017, providing for  consideration of six measures, each under a closed rule.   For H.R. 51, the rule provides 1 hour of debate equally divided and  controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on  Oversight and Reform and self-executes a manager's amendment.   For H.R. 1425, the rule provides 3 hours of debate equally divided  among and controlled by the chairs and ranking minority members of the  Committee on Education and Labor, Committee on Energy and Commerce, and  Committee on Ways and Means, and self-executes a manager's amendment.   Mr. Speaker, for H.R. 5332, the rule provides 1 hour of debate  equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member  of the Committee on Financial Services, and self-executes a manager's  amendment.   For H.R. 7120, the rule provides 4 hours of debate equally divided  and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the  Committee on the Judiciary and self-executes a manager's amendment.   For H.R. 7301, the rule provides 1 hour of debate equally divided and  controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on  Financial Services.   For H.J. Res. 90, the rule provides 1 hour of debate equally divided  and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the  Committee on Financial Services. The rule provides one motion to  recommit for each measure.   Lastly, the rule provides that the provisions of section 125(c) of  the Uruguay Round Agreements Act shall not apply for the remainder of  the Congress, and extends recess instructions, suspension authority,  and same-day authority all through the legislative day of July 31,  2020.   Mr. Speaker, we come together today still struggling in the long  shadow of a pandemic that has taken the lives of over 121,000  Americans. With no end in sight, and--even in my judgment--less  leadership from the White House than the last time we were together, we  again see cases of COVID-19 spiking across the country and in my  beloved State of Florida. If ever there was a time when an occupant of  the White House has so abjectly failed to meet the moment to lead us to  a safer, healthier, and better future, this is it.   We must never forget one simple truth: It never had to be this way.  Countless Americans never had to lose a father, a mother, brothers,  sisters, grandparents, or dear friends--or even young ones.   In the long shadow cast by the ongoing devastation wrought by a  pandemic that has so overwhelmingly affected communities of color, we  are witnessing again and again, day in and day out, the images of Black  people being brutalized by officers who have taken an oath to serve and  protect. Let me make it very clear: I have friends that are police  officers. All police officers are not brutal. All police officers do  not conduct themselves the way that we have seen some conduct  themselves.   My friends, the question is a fair one:   How much of this do you expect us to take?   How much of this would you take?   How much would you allow your children and grandchildren to take?   Reflect on that, please.   Now, I imagine many of my friends on the other side of the aisle--I  heard some of it yesterday--are going to say that the George Floyd  Justice in Policing bill ``doesn't do this'' and ``it could do that.''  Simply because this bill may not be the reflection of the perfect  vision of all Members of this body, does not mean it is therefore  unworthy of the support of Members of this body. Currently, in this  place, the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act is worthy of every  Member's support.   Mr. Speaker, there is another issue at the heart of achieving racial  justice in this country. At the heart of ensuring that all American  citizens know the liberty the Founders wrote of, and that is the cause  of D.C. statehood.  [[Page H2432]]    The District is overwhelmingly one of people of color, and the  residents have, for years, vociferously, with over 80 percent voting in  the affirmative, called for D.C. statehood.   Over 700,000 Americans live in Washington, D.C. They pay Federal  taxes, but do not have a say in this Chamber or the upper Chamber on  how those dollars are spent. Residents of the District register for,  and are subject to, the draft but have no voice in this Chamber as to  whether we should declare war.   Indeed, the District has sent 200,000 brave men and women to fight  for the ideals and benefits of a democracy they are denied here at  home--2,000 of those gave the ultimate sacrifice, and we will never  forget them.                                time  1030    It really is a tribute to Eleanor Holmes Norton that she has  continued this fight on behalf of her constituents.   The Supreme Court and the Federal bench in general render judgment  after judgment that limit or expand the rights of D.C. residents, yet  they are denied the right to elect the Senators who will confirm all  these judges. Others will make the argument more fully today. They will  note the constitutional, legal, and moral evidence that clearly and  convincingly makes the case for statehood.   But I would be remiss to let go unsaid the following, having gone to  school in the District of Columbia at Howard University, from being the  birthplace of Duke Ellington, the hotspot of jazz innovation for  decades, Chuck Brown and go-go music, to the District's role in the  civil rights movement, going way back with some to Cecilia's and Faces,  to Ben's Chili Bowl and the Florida Avenue Grill, let us mute D.C. no  more. Let us be about the business of expanding liberty today and pass  H.R. 51.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Matsui), a distinguished member of the Rules Committee  and my friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Pocan).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern), the distinguished chair of the Committee  on Rules and my friend.    Madam Speaker, I take notice that the Speaker pro  tempore has changed, and I am very pleased that one of the leaders of  the legislation that we are taking up today is now serving as Speaker  pro tempore.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from the District  of Columbia (Ms. Norton), whom I have known all of my career and  consider a friend and mentor.    Madam Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman from the  District of Columbia an additional 30 seconds.    Madam Speaker, would you be good enough to tell both  sides how much time we have remaining.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the  gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Torres), my good friend and  distinguished member of the Rules Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro).    Madam Speaker, yesterday, before we began our  proceedings in the Rules Committee, I asked one of my good friends if  he would speak on this rule. It is for the reason that I consider him  one of the preeminent constitutional scholars in this institution that  I made that request.   I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Raskin), a  distinguished member of the Rules Committee and my good friend.    Madam Speaker, when I asked the gentleman to speak, I  didn't mean for him to take my time. I yield an additional 15 seconds  to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Raskin) for closing purposes.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman  from Pennsylvania (Ms. Scanlon), my friend and a distinguished member  of the Rules Committee.    Madam Speaker, I would advise the gentleman that I have  no further speakers, and I too am prepared to close.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time,  and I thank my good friend from Georgia for yielding me time. I believe  I will be able to wrap up in a shorter period of time if I stick to the  script.   Madam Speaker, my friends across the aisle, some of them like to act  as though they have no hesitancy in saying ``Black Lives Matter.''   The problem is there is always a ``but'' after ``Matter,'' and the  sentence typically ends with ``All Lives Matter.''   I want to be clear about something: The only way ``All Lives Matter''  is if ``Black Lives Matter.''   The last thing I will say about this is that we better doggone well  agree that ``Matter'' is a bare minimum.   Madam Speaker, it strikes me that this is the first time we can  gather here and note the recent celebration of Juneteenth, a  celebration and a time for reflection in these trying days, to be sure.   Indeed, we ought to take stock of and celebrate all that we have  accomplished since that June day in Galveston, Texas, when General  Gordon Granger read General Order No. 3 informing all who listened to  carry forth that all slaves were now emancipated.   The abomination of slavery ended, my ancestors moved forward with the  hope of a better future and, I am sure, the knowledge that new and dire  challenges would be waiting for them and their progeny, and that has  indeed been the case.   Whether it has been the harsh consequences of a reconstruction  abandoned too easily and too quickly, Jim Crow, the violent resistance  of the civil rights movement, the war on drugs, or the relentless  police brutality conducted by some police officers directed  [[Page H2438]]  at Black people, we have stood strong, we have stood together, and  through prayer and perseverance, we have endeavored to ensure that  access to the American Dream, that is rightly ours to attain, is ever  growing for our children and grandchildren.   As I have always done, I welcome all colors, creeds, and religions to  this righteous march.   Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Woodall), all  of the persons who have spoken, the distinguished staff on both sides  for putting together this matter, and you, Madam Speaker, along with  our colleagues in the various caucuses and, particularly, the  Congressional Black Caucus, and the Speaker of the House of  Representatives for moving this matter forward.   Like my friend from Georgia, I don't see this today as the end, but  it is a privilege for me to be on the floor with him and you, Madam  Speaker. And I am sure down the road, it will reflect in this  historical record that we were here to make a difference.   Madam Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the rule and the previous  question.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Woodall is as follows:                     Amendment to House Resolution 1017         At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 9 Immediately upon adoption of this resolution, the       House shall proceed to the consideration in the House of the       resolution (H. Res. 1023) calling for justice for George       Floyd and others, and condemning violence and rioting. The       resolution shall be considered as read. The previous question       shall be considered as ordered on the resolution and preamble       to adoption without intervening motion or demand for division       of the question except one hour of debate equally divided and       controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the       Committee on the Judiciary. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not       apply to the consideration of House Resolution 1023.    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and  I move the previous question on the resolution.
