 Mr. President.    Reserving the right to object, I voted for this  legislation in July as part of the annual Defense bill, and I don't  personally oppose its passage. Senator Lee and Senator Paul have  reservations about the bill, though they couldn't be present at this  time. As a courtesy, therefore, I object on behalf of Senator Lee and  Senator Paul.
