 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Leslie and Carlton C. Smith  for their high achievement in exportation. Leslie and Carlton's  Jacksonville-based heavy equipment exporting business, Heavy Equipment  Resources of Florida, or ``HERO FL,'' is a top exporter of components  and spare parts to mining industries all around the globe.   Earlier this month, HERO FL was awarded with its second Presidential  E Star Award for Exportation. This award is the highest honor given to  our Nation's exporters and highlights HERO FL's significant  contribution to U.S. exports and their development of market entry  strategies for challenging international markets, specifically in  Africa.   The E Star Award, which is now designated by the U.S. Secretary of  Commerce, sets HERO FL apart from their peers for their noteworthy  export promotion efforts.   Just since 2013, HERO FL has grown from 10 export markets to over 32.  This is an incredible achievement and is a testament to Leslie and  Carlton's hard work in northeast Florida and across the globe.   I am honored to recognize their efforts, and I am grateful for the  economic growth that they continue to bring to Florida's Fifth  Congressional District.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman, again, for yielding.
