 Mr. Speaker, I just want to point out the pride of  Chico, California, and the First District. The Pleasant Valley High  School Vikings became State champions of football just a few weeks ago.   It was a very exciting game. They traveled south to Long Beach for  it, to beat St. Anthony. The resiliency of the Vikings was amazing. I  didn't get to go to the game myself, but I was texting back and forth  with a good friend down there. After a 17-13 halftime score, it ended  up 50-49.   The Vikings were back and forth, up and down. With just 1\1/2\  minutes left in the game, after a late interception by the other team,  they were down by 8 points. But with about 1\1/2\ minutes to go, they  drove the field, scored a touchdown, got the 2-pointer and tied. They  went into overtime. After giving up a touchdown to the other team in  overtime, they came back, drove the field once again, scored a  touchdown, and went for two and became division champions for the State  of California by a score of 50-49.   Congratulations, Pleasant Valley Vikings. Well done. You showed a lot  of heart.                            ____________________     I was listening to the gentleman's remarks on a couple  of these topics here that are very important.   He led off with the situation that occurred with the sit-in that  occurred here on this House floor last year, some months ago, and I  found that to be very appalling for the decorum, for  [[Page H90]]  the honor, for the history, for all the things that are important about  conducting ourselves in a society where order is needed in order to  conduct business.   This House floor was not treated with that respect that is necessary  to have order, to have an honest debate, and a debate that is  constructive when you have a sit-in like that where basically the folks  on the other side of the aisle--some of them--decided to take over the  entire building outside of session, outside of the rules. As Mr.  Gohmert mentioned, many rules were violated.   I had the appalling experience of walking on the floor just a few  minutes after they concluded their sit-in and, honestly, the garbage  that was laying on the floor. I saw food crumbs, old newspapers,  magazines, a couple of blankets. They didn't even pick up after  themselves. They expected the staff of the building to pick it up and  haul it off for them because their Occupy Wall Street moment was over  with. This is not the sixties. This is not the hippy era. This is the  United States House of Representatives.   This week, rules were proposed that say, when you violate rules in  such a fashion where videotaping or Periscoping, as they call it, is  occurring--sending these speeches during a nonofficial, non-session  time, basically bootlegging them to the American public via C-SPAN; and  I am a little annoyed with C-SPAN actually playing along with the  violation of House rules of piping this out the way they did.   If you want to have a protest out on the front lawn, fine. That is  within the rights of free speech, the First Amendment, and all that.  You don't do it in violation of the rules of a fairly, some might say,  sacred place--this House floor--the way that happened then. For them to  be piping it out live that way, I found it to be completely wrong.   There are those folks that might say: Well, this is all First  Amendment rights, not in violation of the decorum of the House rules.  So I am glad Mr. Gohmert brought that up. Rules are put in place this  week to address people that are going to violate the very House rules  that help us keep order and do business of the American public. We lost  part of, I think, three session days that we could have been grinding  out the important business that the people expect of this country.   We lost that session time and, indeed, had to come in here and the  Speaker or whoever was introducing legislation that day had to yell  over the process here to do things in order for the House. I find that  appalling. It isn't very mature. I think with some of the penalties  that are put in place by the rules this week, there will be a little  more accountability for that.     It wouldn't be inappropriate since OCE is a hot topic  this week.   The accountability goes both directions. So we have heard our  colleagues talk about unjust charges that can be brought from anywhere,  out of the blue, against a Member of the House without justification,  without even a due process for that Member to have a chance to address  directly what that charge is, and then have their name run through the  newspaper, giant headlines, and maybe a year's worth of investigation.   When you see it, Congressman being investigated, well, that is an  ugly headline. It can be used to manipulate it for political purpose  when it might be a trumped-up charge, something that has no merit, and  many times talking to my colleagues that have faced this, hundreds of  thousands of dollars of cost to them for attorney's fees, their  reputation besmirched by this, when, really, there is an investigative  process that is open, with oversight.   Now we didn't have the perfect piece of legislation in the rule this  week. No. We probably need a little more time for it to be aired out  and a little more widely. It was withdrawn after at least getting the  idea out on the table.   So I am proud of my colleagues who are going to take this up and work  in a bipartisan fashion and get the input to make some needed reforms  to the OCE so that we have an ethics process that is fair to the  Members, but obviously enforces ethics for this House that are needed  and clearly demanded by the public and us.   We are talking here tonight about a decorum, a code, a process that  our House is to be conducted by. So that sit-in is one extreme. The  other one is charges that are, in many cases, absolved months later  without giant headlines but are not even sometimes an oops or I am  sorry for trumped-up charges being brought up against somebody that  would affect them negatively in their ability to serve their districts  or to fend off the huge costs of legal matters that they have to go  through.   So many of my colleagues here strongly care and want to have a strong  ethical process in this place, but there needs to be accountability and  balance to it. That is what we are all looking forward to, is  accountability with OCE and our Ethics Committee who, in a bipartisan  fashion, can weed through all these processes.   I think we will get to that. For those that are concerned around this  country that some here want to get rid of that ethics process, that  absolutely couldn't be further from the truth. We all demand that with  the code of conduct of this House, on the floor and off, of our  Members.
