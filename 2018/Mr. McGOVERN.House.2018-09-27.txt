 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   (Mr. McGOVERN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Texas,  my good friend, Mr. Sessions, for yielding me the customary 30 minutes.   Mr. Speaker, 9 months ago, as the already unpopular Republican tax  scam was making its way through Congress, Speaker Ryan stood in this  Capitol and made a bet. He wagered that ``results are going to be what  makes this popular.''   Today the results are clear, and they are not what the majority and  President Trump promised. Big corporations have gotten a windfall.  Workers have gotten laid off. Jobs are being shipped overseas, and the  richest 1 percent is getting 83 percent of the law's benefits.   Despite those realities, my colleagues seemed to be surprised  recently when a survey commissioned by the Republican National  Committee was released in the media. It found that the public believes  their tax scam benefits the wealthy and large corporations over average  Americans by a two-to-one margin--61 percent to 30 percent.   Let me repeat that before the President tries to tweet that it is  fake news. It was a poll conducted for Republicans by a Republican  polling firm. That is why we are here today with tax 2.1, Mr. Speaker,  because the majority's bet is turning out to be a losing one.                                time  1230    Nine months ago, the Republicans were assuring themselves their tax  scam was good politics. Back then, Senate Majority Leader Mitch  McConnell said, ``If we can't sell this to the American people, we  ought to go into another line of work.'' With polling like this, some  Washington Republicans may have to. But first, they are here today with  a package of bills that represents their last-ditch attempt at trying  to turn the tide before November. And the sequel is as bad as the  original in three key ways.   First, the original Republican tax scam added $2.3 trillion to the  national debt to give the wealthy more tax cuts. 2.0 would add another  $3 trillion to the debt. You won't see its cost on the budget  scorecard. Republicans think they can waive a magic wand and hide the  costs. But I have news for them: this is Congress, this isn't Hogwartz.  The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center says that this is going to cost $3.2  trillion.   It is important that people pay attention to this. I have got to give  the Republicans credit for their sneaky ways to try to avoid the  realities. They have an amendment that says this massive giveaway to  the wealthy magically doesn't count.   And here is the other thing. We won't even get to vote on it. It is  in the rule. It will be self-executed once the rule passes. So no one  has to take any responsibility for adding all this to our debt.   This is at a time when the U.S. Treasury is borrowing money at a rate  of $5.4 billion a day. The Congressional Budget Office recently found  that the majority and the Trump administration have blown a $900  billion hole in the Federal budget. The deficit will increase by nearly  32 percent this year alone, with one of the main causes being the first  GOP tax law.   Mr. Speaker, what happened to the Republican Party that claimed to  care about fiscal discipline?   This majority is drowning in red ink. And the list goes on.   Second, the original Republican tax scam reduced the Medicare trust  fund by 3 years. 2.0 could trigger an automatic 4 percent cut in  Medicare. That means hundreds of billions of dollars for this program  would be lost.   My colleagues on the other side may stand here today and claim that  they want to protect Medicare and Social Security. But don't believe  them. Don't be fooled. Right after their tax law exploded the deficit,  what did the President's chief economic adviser do? He called for new  cuts to Medicare and Social Security.   It is no wonder that in the Republican poll I referenced earlier,  many Americans worry that the tax law would lead to cuts to these vital  programs. Make no mistake: under the majority, these earned benefits  are on the chopping block so Republicans can give tax breaks to the  wealthy.   Third, the original Republican tax scam temporarily limited the State  and local tax deduction, undermining funding for priorities like  schools, firefighters, and police officers. Under 2.0, that deduction  would be made permanent. More than 45 million Americans claim the SALT  deduction, including those in Massachusetts, by the way. They will have  a harder time doing things like buying a home if this package becomes  law, all while State and local governments have a harder time investing  in their communities.   Even while making these harmful changes to the Tax Code, the majority  apparently couldn't be bothered to make changes that could actually  help Americans who have become victims to natural disasters. In the  wake of Hurricane Florence and the largest wildfires in California  history, Democrats asked the majority to include an amendment that  would provide to all eligible Americans the same type of relief that  the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee provided his constituents  last year after Hurricane Harvey. That request was denied. It is  outrageous that, under the majority, the tax relief Americans get after  a tragedy apparently depends on their ZIP Code.   Mr. Speaker, there is a word for doing the same thing other and over  and over again and expecting a different result. I think the majority  would be hard-pressed to find anyone watching today who thinks doubling  down on such an unpaid for and damaging policy is anything other than  insanity.   The policies in these proposals are very similar, but there is one  key difference worth noting, and that is the process.   The first time around, the majority used special fast-track  procedures to provide tax cuts for the wealthy and large corporations.  They pulled out all the stops to assure that it became law as quickly  as possible. They couldn't even find time to hold a hearing before  voting on it. But now, on a proposal they are claiming is for the  middle class, there are no fast-track procedures. There is not even a  guarantee that this proposal will even be considered in the Senate.   Every middle-class American watching should realize this: with this  majority, the wealthy and the well-connected get a windfall under a  special, quick process. Their tax cuts were virtually guaranteed under  a rigged system. Your tax cuts aren't getting that same urgency. There  is no special process for you. This plan will be left in limbo on the  other side of the Capitol. And we all know that.   The fact is, their procedures give away the whole game. This isn't  about policy. This is about politics. The first tax scam isn't paying  the kind of dividends that the majority anticipated. It is unpopular.  So they are trying to pass this to have another talking point on the  campaign trail. The public didn't fall for the majority's spin with  their last tax scam, and I think they will see through this one again.   They will see what this is all about. They will see this for what it  is: a proposal that continues the same, old Republican policies at a  time when the public is demanding a new direction.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, it is nonsense to suggest that somehow Democrats don't  want the economy to work well. The difference here is we want the  economy to work well for everyone, not just those at the top. Eighty- three percent of the benefits in their tax scam go to the top 1 percent  of this country. The people who are struggling are those in the middle  and those struggling to get in the middle.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter to the Speaker and to  the minority leader from Feeding America, which basically says very  clearly that the Republican tax bill `` . . . did not prioritize  assisting those taxpayers who are most at risk of being food insecure,  and as a result the new law provides little direct, tangible benefit to  the individuals and families served by Feeding America.''  [[Page H9105]]                                                Feeding America,                                                 September 25, 2018.      Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker of the House,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      House Democratic Leader,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Ryan and Leader Pelosi: We write to share       Feeding America's views about ``Tax Reform 2.0'' and the       legislation recently approved by the House Ways and Means       Committee. We previously expressed our concerns about the Tax       Cuts and Jobs Act (H.R. 1) and its impact on the millions of       Americans facing hunger in every community across our       country, and do not believe making its provisions permanent       would ease the burden on those individuals and families        As the nation's largest private response to domestic       hunger, and the country's third largest charitable       organization, Feeding America works to advance public       policies that support food insecure individuals and families       and that expand the resources necessary for them to access       nutritious food. Given that the aggregate annual food budget       shortfall for the more than 41 million food insecure       individuals in the United States now stands at more than $21       billion, our highest priority is protecting the federal       nutrition programs that help these families access the       resources and nutrition needed to succeed.        At the same time, a large percentage of individuals,       including children, who struggle with hunger fall outside the       public safety net, underscoring the profound need for private       food assistance. In 2016, more than a quarter of food       insecure individuals nationwide lived in households that       earned too much to qualify for most federal nutrition       assistance programs. For these working families, the       generosity of individuals and corporations makes possible       vital food assistance that might not otherwise be available.        Regrettably, H.R. 1 did not prioritize assisting those       taxpayers who are most at risk of being food insecure, and as       a result the new law proves little direct, tangible benefit       to the individuals and families served by Feeding America.       According to the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) beginning       in 2021 taxpayers earning between $10,000 and $30,000 per       year will see an increase in their average tax rate, a       circumstance that will apply to all taxpayers earning less       than $75,000 by 2027.        Additionally, changes to the standard deduction and the       availability of itemized deductions have effectively       eliminated the charitable deduction for 28.5 million       taxpayers, according to JCT. The result will be a decline in       charitable giving of more than $17 billion per year,       according to a recent American Enterprise Institute study,       with human service charities likely to be especially hard       hit. Of the 28.5 million taxpayers expected to no longer file       itemized returns, 24.6 million earn less than $200,000 per       year. Donors with incomes below $200,000 are responsible for       62% of annual charitable giving to all human needs charities.        Simply put, the loss of this century-old giving incentive       will have a devastating effect on a wide range of charitable       programs and services delivered in communities across the       country, including those that provide much-needed food       assistance to hungry individuals and families who are not       otherwise benefitting from the new tax law.        H R. 1 represented a missed opportunity to provide relief       for the millions of Americans who struggle to put food on the       table, and we do not support making its provisions permanent.       We do, however, encourage you to undertake Tax Reform 2.0       with the aim of enacting legislation that eases the burdens       on lower-income working families, continues to encourage       Americans to give generously to charity, and ensures the       government has the resources necessary to meet our collective       obligations to provide for the health and well-being of our       neighbors and our communities.        We hope to serve as a resource to you as this process       unfolds, and we look forward to the opportunity to share with       you proposed tax code changes that we believe will have a       positive impact on the people we serve.

Nothing in this bill today or the bill that the Republicans  passed previously does anything to help those people.   So yes, we want the economy to work well, but for everybody. Not just  the rich, but we want it to work well for those in the middle and those  struggling to get in the middle. We don't want to embrace a tax scam  package where 83 percent of the benefits go to the top 1 percent. They  may be good contributors, but that doesn't represent the majority of  America.   Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an  amendment to the rule to bring up Ranking Member Nadler's bill, the  Special Counsel Independence Act. This vital legislation will allow the  people's House to demonstrate that we as a body are capable of putting  America's interests over partisan politics.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Nadler), the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee,  to discuss his proposal.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from New York an  additional 30 seconds.    Mr. Speaker, the reason why we are offering this  procedural motion is because the Republicans run this House like Putin.  We are shut out of everything. So this is our only opportunity to try  to get some important business done.   The Republicans can spend every day trying to pass more tax cuts for  their wealthy friends and big corporations, but maybe--just maybe--we  can do something useful like protecting our democracy.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from California  (Mr. Schiff), the distinguished ranking member of the Committee on  Intelligence.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from California an  additional 30 seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Swalwell).    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 30  seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, with all due respect to my colleague from Texas, tax  cuts for the rich and big corporations aren't going to protect this  country from another attack by the Russians on our elections and on  democracy.   But here is the deal: You can do both. You can debate your tax scam  2.0 for the rich, and if you vote to defeat the previous question, we  can also vote to protect the Mueller investigation.   So we can do both, and I hope my colleagues will vote to defeat the  previous question.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Mrs. Torres), a distinguished member of the House Rules  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from California.    Mr. Speaker, if I can inquire of the gentleman from  Texas how many more speakers he has on his side?    Mr. Speaker, I kind of figured, if this was so popular,  that there would be tons of Republicans down here.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Wisconsin (Ms.  Moore).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Kentucky (Mr. Yarmuth), the distinguished ranking member of the  Committee on the Budget.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Tennessee (Mr. Cohen).    Mr. Speaker, if I could just inquire of the gentleman  from Texas one more time, just to make sure there is nobody else who  wants to speak.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the Republicans have so diminished this House of  Representatives. We are being told that tomorrow may be our last day in  session before the election, that the Republicans will adjourn 2 weeks  early so they can go home to try to convince voters that they deserve  to be reelected.   What we are doing today, this tax scam 2.0, is a joke, because they  know it is going nowhere in the Senate. They are frightened by the fact  that their original tax bill is so terribly unpopular, and rightfully  so, because the American people object to a tax bill where 83 percent  of the benefits go to the top 1 percent. That is just not fair. People  understand things like fairness.   Mr. Speaker, we are asking people to defeat the previous question to  protect  [[Page H9110]]  the Mueller investigation. Since we are adjourning most likely  tomorrow, this may be our only time to do it. You can vote to defeat  the previous question. You can still vote for this tax scam bill, but  you also can vote on whether or not to protect the Mueller  investigation. We ought to do that.    But there is another thing I want Members of both sides to  appreciate, as this may be the last rule we bring to the floor.   What we are considering today is record-shattering. The majority  broke the record for the number of closed rules in Congress earlier  this year. The record they broke, by the way, was their own.   This restrictive process has often shut out debates here on the House  floor that the American people desperately want this Congress to have,  on issues like gun safety, protecting the Dreamers, and lowering the  cost of prescription drugs.   Now, today, the majority is taking is the most closed Congress in  American history to a whole new level because, tucked inside this  measure, is the majority's 99th, 100th, and 101st first closed rules of  this Congress. There has never ever been a moment like this in American  history, more than 100 closed rules in a single Congress.   This isn't some arcane legislative matter. Consider what the majority  has brought under closed rules, things like their first tax scam and  their disastrous healthcare repeal bill.   There are still months to go before the 116th Congress begins. Who  knows what other disasters the majority of President Trump will dream  up next.   Now, Mr. Speaker, I am not suggesting that everything that the House  considers should be under an open rule. There are times when a closed  rule might be necessary. But more than 100 closed rules? There is no  justification for that.   Now, I don't know who will run this place in January, but if  Democrats are trusted with the majority, we will have a more  accommodating process. This place will be run like professionals. Ideas  will be allowed to come forward, and the House of Representatives will  actually debate again.   But we don't have to wait until next year to force a more open  process. We can start right here today. My Republican colleagues have  voiced frustration with their majority's closed process. Well, we have  the chance here to do more than just talk. We can vote.   So when a closed rule goes down, Speaker Ryan will actually have to  start upholding his promise of a more open, more inclusive, more  deliberative, and more participatory process.   It would be better late than never. While calling for a more open  process, virtually every Republican voted for every closed rule we have  considered. The rank and file Republicans are part of the problem.   Mr. Speaker, if they are not going to take a stand on the 101st  closed rule, will they ever be able to back up their talk with their  vote?   So I ask the majority, as we stand on the doorstep of this dubious  distinction, join us in voting against this record-shattering closed  rule.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
