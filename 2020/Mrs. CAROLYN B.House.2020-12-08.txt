 MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak on  an important aspect of this bill.   My Corporate Transparency Act is the most important anticorruption,  anti-money laundering bill in 20 years. When a terrorist cell or a  criminal organization wants to move or hide money, they usually do it  right here in the United States with a shell company. So the same  terrorist groups that want to attack the United States are using our  own financial system to finance those attacks. It is appalling, and it  has to stop.   My bill will end the abuse of anonymous shell companies in the United  States by requiring companies to disclose their true beneficial owners  to the Treasury Department at the time the company is formed.   I want to thank my negotiating partners, Chairman Crapo, Ranking  Member Brown, Chairwoman Waters, and Ranking Member McHenry, and I  congratulate Chairman Smith and Ranking Member Thornberry for all of  their hard work on this bill.                                time  1345
