 Mr. Chair, I am proud to support this  amendment which would align the TANF program and the federal work study  program.   TANF, or the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, was  created to help struggling families become self sufficient.   We know that the best way to achieve this goal is to give people the  resources they need to find quality jobs.   This amendment would allow states to align employment efforts by  coordinating with schools to help more students access work-study  opportunities.   And we know that these students are not the 18 year olds of decades  past--they are older students with children, dependent parents, and  more financial responsibilities.   Helping these students elevates entire families; helping these  families elevates entire communities.   I hope we can come together to support this amendment and support  more working Americans.
