 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of  Rare Disease Week.   Around 350 million people, worldwide, suffer from a rare disease.  That is more than the number of people who live in the United States,  alone, and it is particularly alarming when we consider how few  resources are available to those battling a rare disease.   In fact, of the 7,000 rare diseases in existence, half of them don't  have a designated foundation or research support group, and nearly 90  percent lack an FDA-approved treatment.   As a member of the Rare Disease Congressional Caucus, I urge my  colleagues to support measures that would increase funding for research  and put our resources into the development and accessibility of  lifesaving treatments. Treatments should not be as rare as the diseases  they heal.                            ____________________
