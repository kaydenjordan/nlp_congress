 Madam Speaker, we know we are in an election year. We  know passions are running high. We know we have an environment where  our country is incredibly hurting right now.   If you saw the unemployment numbers this morning, the GDP numbers,  how vibrant the economy was last quarter, you can almost have your  heart ache. We have millions and millions and millions and millions of  our brothers and sisters outside these walls who are hurting. And I  guess for many of us in the minority, there is that frustration of ``we  care, but we want something that actually works.''   And so one of my reasons for taking some time tonight is I wanted to  do one or two things.   Originally, I was going to bring in all this data of what we have  learned about who gets sick and who doesn't get sick, and those things.  And I realized, maybe that is not what we should do. So I was going to  do just a couple data points and then actually talk about pieces of  legislation that should be easy for us, that actually would help our  brothers and sisters out there in dealing with the coronavirus, in  dealing with the economic devastation it has brought to us, and  providing some of the basic mechanisms. None of them are panaceas, but  it is good policy.   Let me start with one thing, just so we have this: If we look at our  fellow Americans that we have lost since the pandemic--family members,  mothers and fathers, grandmas and grandpas who passed away--45 percent  of them were actually in a nursing home or hospice-type care and their  death certificates make it clear that there was COVID as part of it.   So if you actually had that as a data point, I am hoping we can sort  of think through who are the most vulnerable in our society, and do we  continue to sell, tell, share the message that if you are in some of  these vulnerable groups, if you are in the nursing home, it is risky.  There is a concentration where resources should go and what we can do.   And that is an interesting baseline for those who actually have great  interest in the numbers. For myself in Maricopa County, Arizona, our  nursing home fatality rate is at 39 percent of the fatalities. There  are other places where it is over 50 percent. Using that actually is a  benchmark. If the national number is 45 percent of the fatalities from  COVID come from nursing homes and those types of facilities, if you are  above that, you really need to think about how you are treating that  population, how you are working with that care delivery network. If you  are below it, maybe you have a sense you are going in the right  direction.   But these are the types of things we need to be sharing with people  around the country, to understand that if you are 25 years old, the  chance of you losing your life--and we don't want anyone getting sick-- but you are well under 1 percent.   And this is something called--I do a lot of presentations here on the  floor, and I didn't bring all the charts because I just didn't want to  overwhelm the conversation--allocation of resources.   If your community, when you pull up your ZIP Code map--and in  Arizona, we are doing a really good job of using this heat map, where  you can see where we are having outbreaks--how do we actually share?  Because we have provided resources--maybe we need to provide more  technology or other things--but if you see on the heat map that this  neighborhood, this part of your community is having an outbreak, why  don't we have outreach into that community? Why don't we have people  knocking on the doors saying, Do you have a mask? Do you understand all  the little rules? Do you understand the Sunday barbecue in the backyard  with everyone in the neighborhood probably isn't a brilliant idea?   I really want us to communicate the idea where the devastation is but  also, how do we be proactive? How do we get out there? Instead of doing  some of the craziness of everything shuts down, whether you are in  communities where we can't find efficacy of transmissions to where we  see some pretty tough numbers. So that is actually one of the things we  have been trying to communicate to the professionals in Arizona, is  sort of, how do we reach out to where we see the problems?   In Arizona recently, we had the Federal Government provide testing in  some of the hardest hit areas, and we hoped actually some of those  numbers helped. There are other economic numbers that are really tough  because some of it is getting on the cusp of being partisan. And I am  going to beg for my brothers and sisters on the left, and those of us  on the right, to back away from it and actually sort of think it  through.   We actually have built a number of charts, and we are trying to build  more data of what is actually going to happen if schools aren't able to  find a safe way to open up.   Do you actually know what happens to long-term incomes of females in  the country? These are things people don't necessarily think about, but  we can show you--we are working on it because we are trying to make  sure we are getting our math right--that by not having the daycare  facilities and our schools open, it turns out the moms and dads--but,  particularly the moms that work--that may now have lost several months  of being in the workplace, it actually has an effect on  [[Page H4186]]  their entire future working careers, income potential, if not their  Social Security and other things.   We need to understand the totality of the decisions we are making.  And this was just a chart I grabbed because I thought the information  was interesting, but the compound effects of when we are not able to  come up with a safe method to open up our schools, you actually start  to see that for, particularly moms, it looks like by the numbers they  lose about half their working time. But we can even find another set of  numbers that 19 percent of those who are actually healthcare workers  can't be there providing those services.   We don't seem to stop and take a step backwards. And on one hand, we  are talking about how desperately we need healthcare workers and  facilities in places that are having a tough time. Oh, by the way, we  are not going to come up with a safe way for education, for daycare to  open up. You do realize that actually just reduced your healthcare  workers by 19 percent?   We haven't been taking a step backwards and thinking about this  holistically. And that is why I am going to walk through a couple of  the pieces of legislation we have introduced in the last couple of  weeks. We are trying to come up with ways to try to help. In the  future, we are going to talk more about this on the effects on the  children.   I have a little girl that is about to turn 5. She passed her test to  get early enrollment into kindergarten. When I go home, you can just  see almost how desperate she is to be with other little kids. I mean,  she loves mommy and daddy, but, apparently, we don't play the same way  as other 4-and-a-half-year-olds, five-year-olds. What would be the  long-term effect in her ability to socialize?   What is the effect? We came across--and we haven't been able to vet  it yet, so I am going to say it, but understand, we haven't vetted the  numbers--of high-school age kids that will pass away from the  coronavirus compared to the increase of high-school aged suicides. And  not being able to have services, not being able to have counseling, not  be able to have social relationships. And I know these are sometimes  really uncomfortable numbers to, one, get accurate, but even talk  about.   We have got to find a way to understand decisions we are making over  here. Are we ultimately doing more damage to the people in our country?  And this is more than the economy. It is people's mental health, their  economic future, their future earnings power, and just societal  cohesion.   Let's actually talk about some things I think that are both  optimistic and opportunities. One of the things that happened when we  started to do some of the emergency legislation on the pandemic, for  some of the staff that have been here, you know, there are a handful of  us who have been pounding the doors around here for years about  expanding telemedicine.   Oddly enough--I know this sounds crazy right now--but telemedicine in  the past has been a controversial subject here because it disrupts some  of the medical delivery business model. We have lots of lobbyists in  Washington, D.C., that really don't like telemedicine because it is  another avenue of competition. But we did it. We took a piece of  legislation that Mr. Thompson and I had passed, grabbed some of the  language, and that is actually the law right now--except for one catch:  When the pandemic is declared over, that expanded authorization of  telemedicine goes away. But we are getting a living test right now.   What is fascinating is, if you and I go back to 2019, only about 11  percent of healthcare consumers--you and I--11 percent in 2019--use  telemedicine. In the last few months, we are actually seeing it around  46 percent of folks that need some type of medical advice or doctor  visit are actually using telemedicine. We have just proven it works.   And there is actually some amazing data coming in about the ability  to make it very cost-effective, and the ability to find out the  satisfaction levels. Turns out that people are more satisfied with many  of their telemedicine visits than when they go visit the doctor's  office. And it turns out, also, that the actual face-time with that  medical professional actually is longer in telemedicine than when you  have actually gone to the doctor's office.   So we need to understand these things, because when we get beyond  this pandemic, will we understand that telemedicine isn't scary. We  need to find a way to extend it, make it permanent, and actually expand  what the definition is. Look, we have some great data that is coming in  that this is working. This is one of the things we did, bipartisan, on  something that we couldn't get done for years. It is happening right  now.   So we have introduced a piece of legislation that will just make it  so when the pandemic is declared over, telemedicine isn't ended in its  new reimbursements, in its efficacy, in its availability.   Now, I want to go further. I actually believe the future of  telemedicine is more than just picking up your phone and talking to a  medical professional or face-time. I also think it is the body sensors  you can put on that produce data from your body, that the algorithm can  be calculating, that finds if there is something wrong, the medical  professional can call you.   So we are going to try to see if we can expand that definition to  even the technology out there, because this is one of our arguments  that we have been making here, that as Republicans and Democrats, we  have been having the wrong debate about healthcare. We keep debating on  who should pay, who should get subsidized, and we are not having enough  of the debate on technology. What are the things we can do that would  actually change the price? Changing the price is what makes healthcare  much more available, not a constant debate on who should end up paying  and who should be subsidizing.   This piece of legislation has been dropped, and I am very grateful.  Thank you for those who are helping us cosponsor it. We want to see  more.   Another thing we are having that discussion of:   How do you start to open up society?   How do you open up your community?   How do you open up the little businesses in your neighborhood?   Many of them need to be able to put up that plastic shield. They are  going to need to be able to buy protective equipment or ways to  sterilize those things.   We have come up with a tax credit idea for those businesses. It is 50  percent of their cost, particularly for testing. If you want to test  your employees, a tax credit--but it is not the tax credit that at the  end of the year, next year you might get some money. We do it as a tax  credit off your payroll.    And the benefit of that is certain businesses, every couple weeks,  every month, they are turning in their FICA, you know, their payroll  tax, they can get the credit right there. So the cash flow is available  to go pay for testing, pay for things that make their businesses safe.  So as they start to invite their teams, their employees back, it is a  way to make sure they are staying safe.   The other one--and this is a big deal, and this one I think actually  both Republicans and Democrats will embrace--and we are going to geek  out just a tiny bit.   When the ACA passed--most folks know it as ObamaCare--one of the  mechanisms in there was the ability to deduct your medical expenses was  going to go up over time to 10 percent of your adjusted gross income.  And for a lot of seniors, that was going to be pretty tough. When we  did tax reform, we actually extended the 7\1/2\ percent of your  adjusted gross income when you hit that level the next dollar you could  start to deduct off your taxes for a couple of years.   But the fact of the matter is, it is scheduled to go up to 10 percent  of your adjusted gross income, your medical expenses, before you can  start to deduct them.   In a time like this, in a time when we all talk about healthcare and  the financial stresses and impacts that puts on our family, let's do  this: For the next 2 years, let's make it 5 percent. So if you had  medical expenses that you are paying for, you hit the 5 percent, you  can actually take it. And after that, we will keep it at the 7\1/2\  percent.    Madam Speaker, we will come back next week and do  [[Page H4187]]  the Invest Act, and I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
