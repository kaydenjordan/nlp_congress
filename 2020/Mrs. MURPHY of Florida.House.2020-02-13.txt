 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  25th anniversary of the Blue Dog Coalition, a caucus of pragmatic  Democrats I have the honor to help lead this Congress.   Since February 1995, the Blue Dog Coalition has been working to  bridge partisan divide and deliver bipartisan results. While the makeup  and size of our coalition has changed over the years, our focus on  fiscal responsibility and a strong national security has never wavered.   Blue Dogs recognize that our constituents expect us to be good  stewards of their hard-earned taxpayer dollars and that a skyrocketing  national debt is a threat to our national security.   Over the last 25 years, Blue Dogs have helped deliver balanced  budgets, end government shutdowns, grow the middle class, and pass  commonsense laws, such as pay-as-you-go.   This Congress we are leading the fight on election security,  infrastructure, and job creation, and we are pushing Congress to be  better by ending partisan gerrymandering and proposing No Budget, No  Pay.   Most importantly, Blue Dogs remain focused on our founding principles  of fiscal responsibility and a strong national security.   Madam Speaker, please join me in recognizing the Blue Dog Coalition's  25th anniversary this month.                            ____________________
