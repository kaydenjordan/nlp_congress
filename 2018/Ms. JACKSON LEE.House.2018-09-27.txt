 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H. Res.  1084, the rule governing debate for H.R. 6756, the American Innovation  Act of 2018,'' H.R. 6757 ``Family Savings Act of 2018,'' and H.R. 6760  ``Protecting Family and Small Business Tax Cuts Act of 2018''.   I must oppose this rule and urge the defeat the previous question,  not because we do not support innovation for our small businesses and  entrepreneurs, but because defeating the previous question will enable  this House to consider and pass H.R. 5476, the ``Special Counsel  Independence and Integrity Act''.   This is an opportunity we do not want to misuse.   For the last sixteen months, our nation has watched as the Special  Counsel investigating the attack on our democracy during the 2016  election has returned dozens of indictments against foreign actors  suspected of interfering in our democracy.   Tellingly, the investigation has also returned a series of guilty  pleas, including:   allocutions from the President's former personal lawyer;   his campaign chairman;   his deputy campaign chairman;   his first national security advisor;   a top foreign policy advisor, and many more.   Americans have come to the conclusion that the 2016 election was a  crime scene.   The 2018 election could be one too.   While the Special Counsel--appointed by officials from the Trump  Administration--has been diligently returning pleas and indictments,  and unearthing the extraordinary efforts that a hostile foreign power  had on our election, the President has been busy berating the effort,  and those whom he believes are assisting in attempts to get at the  truth of what transpired in the 2016 election.   Yet, beyond guilty pleas and indictments, the Special Counsel has  also been performing an essential service for the American people: he  has been telling the American people a story of how our democracy is  susceptible to outside influence.   He has done this by sharing certain, critical facts such as:   the President's son, son-in-law and campaign manager attended a  meeting with  [[Page H9111]]  agents of the Russian government promising to have ``dirt'' on the  President's 2016 opponent, Secretary Hillary Clinton;   we also learned how Russians funneled money through stalwart  Republican-leaning organizations to influence our campaign; and   we learned that Russians selectively leaked and indeed weaponized  stolen emails in order to influence our electorate.   Alongside this parade of developments, the American people have  watched as this president has tried to wrestle control--either  functionally or formally--of the investigation into the Russian  interference in the 2016 campaign, and whether and to what extent the  effort was aided and abetted associates of the Trump Campaign.   For good reason, Americans are suspicious of this president's ability  to abide by longstanding norms to which all prior American presidents  have adhered: the need to abstain from interfering in law enforcement  investigations.   Most infamously, the President breached this norm when he fired the  former director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, James Comey in  May 2017.   Between that date and now, the President has:   ridiculed the Attorney General, who recused himself from overseeing  the Russia investigation and, in the process, drew the ire of the  president;   terminated or forced the retirements of several senior law  enforcement officials; and   has threatened or attempted to take extraordinary steps--like the  selective dissemination of classified information--for the purposes of  tainting the investigation into his possible criminal activity.   Along the way, House Republicans have refused to exercise even the  slightest amount of oversight on this president or this president.   One significant way the Congress can do this is by protecting the  Special Counsel and his investigation.   This has long been a concern of mine.   This is why, alongside the Jerry Nadler, the Ranking Member of the  House Judiciary Committee, I introduced H.R. 5476, the Special Counsel  Independence and Integrity Act.   If enacted into law, H.R. 5476 permits a terminated Special Counsel  to challenge his termination in court and would stay the investigation  pending the challenge.   The Special Counsel would be given a notice stating the reasons for  the removal.   The matter would be heard by a three judge panel who would determine  whether the removal was for misconduct, dereliction of duty,  incapacity, conflict of interest, or other good cause.   If it is, the removal is affirmed.   If it is not, the Special Counsel is reinstated.   In the face of this president's bellicosity towards the law  enforcement institutions investigating him, the Special Counsel  Independence and Integrity Act is a measure of oversight we can place  on this president, who increasingly feels emboldened to flout  longstanding norms in the name of covering up his past conduct.   This is an Article I moment--it is time for all in this chamber and  across the Capitol in the Senate to seize it.   Through their elected representatives, the American people must  harness the constitutional apparatus created by the Framers and provide  oversight on a president sorely in need of it.   The material previously referred to by Mr. McGovern is as follows:            An amendment to H. Res. 1084 Offered by Mr. McGovern         At the end of the resolution, add the following new       sections:        Sec. 9. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the       Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare       the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on       the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R.       5476) to ensure independent investigations and judicial       review of the removal of a special counsel, and for other       purposes. The first reading of the bill shall be dispensed       with. All points of order against consideration of the bill       are waived. General debate shall be confined to the bill and       shall not exceed one hour equally divided and controlled by       the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on the       Judiciary. After general debate the bill shall be considered       for amendment under the five-minute rule. All points of order       against provisions in the bill are waived. At the conclusion       of consideration of the bill for amendment the Committee       shall rise and report the bill to the House with such       amendments as may have been adopted. The previous question       shall be considered as ordered on the bill and amendments       thereto to final passage without intervening motion except       one motion to recommit with or without instructions. If the       Committee of the Whole rises and reports that it has come to       no resolution on the bill, then on the next legislative day       the House shall, immediately after the third daily order of       business under clause 1 of rule XIV, resolve into the       Committee of the Whole for further consideration of the bill.        Sec. 10. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 5476.                                   ____           The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a       vote about what the House should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to       a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to       yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first       recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution .  .  . [and] has       no substantive legislative or policy implications       whatsoever.'' But that is not what they have always said.       Listen to the Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative       Process in the United States House of Representatives, (6th       edition, page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the       previous question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is       generally not possible to amend the rule because the majority       Member controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule .  .  . When       the motion for the previous question is defeated, control of       the time passes to the Member who led the opposition to       ordering the previous question. That Member, because he then       controls the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or       yield for the purpose of amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on       Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further       debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:       ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a       resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control       shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous       question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who       controls the time for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools for those who oppose the Republican       majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the       opportunity to offer an alternative plan.
