 DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong  opposition to this draconian, Dracula-inspired health bill. It is not  really a health bill at all. As a matter of fact, it is a tax cut for  the wealthiest individuals in our country. This bill will decimate all  of the public health gains that professional health personnel and  activists have fought for the last 50 years.   This bill will take out the opportunity for those low- and moderate- income individuals who fall between the gap created by Medicaid and  nothing. They are the least of those in our society. And when you take  away health care for that group of individuals, history will not regard  you well.   I believe that the best way to measure the effectiveness of a society  is by how well it treats its young, how well it treats its old, and how  well it treats those who have difficulty caring for themselves.   I will vote ``no.'' I urge us all to do so.
