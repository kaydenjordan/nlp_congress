 Mr. Speaker, this has been a really interesting  debate, because our friends on the other side, Mr. Speaker, it is like  they have amnesia and nothing happened before the election a couple of  years ago.   All of these promises about a border wall were followed by the cheers  and the chants of: And who is going to pay for that wall?   And you remember all your fans would stand up: Mexico is going to pay  for that wall.   Who?   Mexico.   And here we are today getting ready to shut down the Government over  you asking the American taxpayer to pay for this border wall. And then  some of you even are saying that we have hollow words, that our words  don't mean anything, when this President is going back on the promise  that he made.   He said Mexico was going to pay for it. He said it at the rallies. He  was in Ohio. He was in the swing States.   And now he is going back on his word on that. And he just went back  on his word where he promised the entire Senate he was going to support  the continuing resolution, and you are calling us and saying our words  are hollow. Are you kidding me?   Now, look, I am for border security. I am for border security. But I  am not for a wall. You know what, I like cars, too. I am for cars. I am  not for the Model T.   I like planes. I don't want a glider that was designed and built by  Wilbur Wright.   I like my phone, but I don't want to go back and get the rotary dial  out.   You guys are living in the past. And this Government is in chaos. It  is in a free-fall. The market is in a free-fall. The staffing at the  White House is in a free-fall. The Secretary of Defense is gone. We are  pulling out of Syria.   What is going on? You are in charge of the House, the Senate, and the  White House. Get a grip, and learn how to govern the country.
