 Mr. President, today, Senator Johnson and I will  present our third speech on the Biden investigation series.   Today, we will focus on James Biden, the President's brother. Hunter  Biden wasn't the only Biden family member who had connections to the  Chinese communist regime. James Biden did as well.   Before we begin our discussion, I think we will need to mention the  main company once again, the Chinese company that goes by the initials  CEFC.   In the first two speeches, Senator Johnson and I established the  connection between CEFC and the communist Chinese Government. We  established the connection between CEFC and Hudson West III. We then  established the connection with Hunter Biden's Owasco, Hudson West III,  and CEFC.   We showed that Hunter Biden and James Biden actively assisted CEFC as  it worked to expand its footprint and its holdings in the global and  U.S. energy sector. Today, we will add James Biden's Lion Hall Group to  the list of Biden family companies connected to the communist regime.   In my and Senator Johnson's September 2020 report, we showed that  Hunter Biden and James Biden and their aligned firms received  approximately $4.8 million from Hudson West III from August 2017 to  September 2018. During that same timeframe, Hunter Biden's Owasco sent  20 or so wires to James Biden's Lion Hall Group. Those 20 wires totaled  just about $1.4 million.   The liberal media and our Democratic colleagues originally tried to  claim that Senator Johnson and my findings were Russian disinformation.   Last week, the Washington Post reported the following:         Over the course of 14 months, the Chinese energy       conglomerate--    Here, parenthetically, they are referring to CEFC--       and its executives paid $4.8 million to entities controlled       by Hunter Biden and his uncle, according to government       records, court documents and newly disclosed bank statements,       as well as emails contained on a copy of a laptop hard drive       that purportedly once belonged to Hunter Biden.    The Post also reported this:         During that time period, about $1.4 million was transferred       from Hunter's account to the Lion Hall Group, the consulting       firm that James Biden ran, according to other government       records reviewed by The Post.    Senator Johnson and I were right 2 years ago. We knew it then, but it  has been a long road to defend our work product.   The liberal media and our Democratic colleagues aggressively tried to  make the case that we were peddling Russian disinformation. What will  the liberal media and my Democratic colleagues say now in light of last  week's Washington Post article that substantiated the work Senator  Johnson and I have been doing? We still haven't received any apology  from our Democratic colleagues for their false claims against us these  past several years. They haven't apologized to the American people. And  I am not going to hold my breath.   When will the big-time media in Washington awaken to respect my  reputation for the thorough investigative and oversight work that I do  as a Senator? And it is also my constitutional responsibility to do  exactly that.   Now, we have more records to discuss today. Today, Senator Johnson  and I will show you financial transfers direct from Hudson West III to  the Lion Hall Group. In other words, in these transfers, Hunter Biden's  Owasco isn't the middleman.   Let's look at the first poster here. This is a January 2018 bank  statement from Hudson West III. Now, there is a lot going on here, so I  will just mention several items.   First, we have two examples of more wire transfers from Hudson West  III for $165,000. The underlying wire data, which Senator Johnson and I  will make public this very day, shows that money went to Hunter Biden's  Owasco. That money was for the August 2017 LLC agreement, which by its  terms saw James Biden become a manager of Hudson West III. That  agreement sent $100,000 to Hunter Biden and $65,000 to James Biden  every month. Those transactions occurred after the $5 million wire from  Northern International Capital to Hudson West III on August 2017.  Northern International was connected to Ye Jianming, who was connected  to the communist regime.   We explained all that in our second speech just last Tuesday.   Second, this statement shows several examples of wires from Hudson  West III to CEFC. As Senator Johnson and I have established, that  company is an arm of the communist Chinese regime. This new record  shows how closely connected Hudson West III was with CEFC while Hunter  Biden and James Biden received money from Hudson West III.   Third, we have a January 17, 2018, wire to Lion Hall Group. That  happens to be James Biden's company. James Biden received $18,000 from  Hudson West III the same month that company sent money to CEFC. This is  just one example of many.   Accordingly, the official bank record makes clear the financial  connections between and among James Biden and the communist Chinese  elements.    To the liberal media and my Democratic colleagues, this official bank  record--is that Russian disinformation, as you accused us of spreading?   Now let's go to the second poster. This is a Hudson West III bank  record from April 2018. Here, you see wire transfers from Coldharbour  Capital. That company was connected to Mervyn Yan, who was an associate  of Ye Jianming and Gongwen Dong.   As Senator Johnson and I have already established, all of them are  connected to the communist regime. These are the players in the game  that I mentioned in the first speech last Monday, and now we have  established that they appear repeatedly in bank records with high- dollar transfers.   These transfers aren't by accident--no way. There is clearly a scheme  here.  [[Page S1970]]  There is a plan among and between all these individuals and their  respective companies, which then begs the question, has the Justice  Department acquired these records? If so, what has the Justice  Department done about these records?   Moving to the next transaction, there is another $165,000 wire.  Again, that relates back to the LLC agreement that connected Hunter and  James Biden to the Chinese firm CEFC and its projects in the energy  sector. Then you have a $34,000 wire to James Biden's Lion Hall Group  from Hudson West III.   So what was this all about? Let's take a look, then, at the third  poster. Look at the sixth line from the bottom. I want to quote. It  says ``office expense and reimbursement.'' That is the same reason  given for the first poster that I showed you.   We will make all these records public this very day.   For those of you who may still doubt my and Senator Johnson's  oversight work, I am going to present one last transaction to bring all  of this home.   Look at the fourth poster. In my and Senator Johnson's September 2020  report, we found that James Biden and Hunter Biden went on a $99,000  global spending spree courtesy of whom? Another Chinese person I have  mentioned so many times in these three speeches--Gongwen Dong. The  spending spree included airline tickets, purchases at Apple stores,  hotels, and restaurants. This bank record next to me shows a $99,000  transaction in September 2017, but that is not all that we have.   Let's turn to the final poster. This is No. 5. This is a credit card  authorization form for $99,000. Look at the bottom. There is a  signature block with Hunter Biden and Gongwen Dong.   To the liberal press and my Democratic colleagues, are these official  records Russian disinformation?   So what is the point of all these records? Not only have Senator  Johnson and I illustrated through new records that Hunter Biden was  financially connected to the communist regime, these records show James  Biden was as well. These new records show direct financial links  between companies connected to the communist regime and James Biden  through Lion Hall Group. These new records support the findings in our  report to the last Congress.   Remember, those records were put out in September and November of  2020, and everybody was saying it was Russian disinformation. Forget  the facts. Forget the evidence. Forget the investigative journalism.  The liberal media wanted to provide cover for then-Candidate Joe Biden.  They did whatever they could to smear our investigations.   With these new records, there can be no doubt that James Biden was  financially connected to corporations and individuals with extensive  links to communist China and that he and Hunter Biden were in it  together, working to help a Chinese Government-linked energy company  pursue deals and expand its reach in the energy sector.   Now, it is Senator Johnson's turn.    Mr. President, I thank Senator Johnson. I will just  quickly say that the journalists in this town have an obligation to  investigate. They ave an obligation to uncover the facts and the  evidence. They have failed time and again.   What has been reported recently is simply the tip of the iceberg. The  question now is: Instead of accusing us of peddling Russian  disinformation, will the media actually engage in true investigative  journalism? Will the media act with intellectual honesty, or will the  media continue to cover all this up for the Biden administration?   Now, Congress has a constitutional responsibility to engage in  oversight of the executive branch. The Biden administration has been  totally unresponsive to our oversight requests; specifically, requests  that relate to the Biden criminal case.   Is Nicholas McQuaid recused from the Hunter Biden case? No answer  from the Department. Does the Department possess FISA information on  Patrick Ho, Hunter Biden's associate? The Department told a Federal  court they do. They told me and Senator Johnson that they aren't sure.  Can you imagine that?   When Hunter Biden communicated with Patrick Ho, were his  communications captured by our intelligence community? Is the Biden  administration intentionally withholding this material from Congress  out of fear of what we will find?   In light of the Biden administration's total failure to respond to  our questions, these are legitimate questions to ask. The Biden Justice  Department's actions have cast a cloud over the case. The American  people are rightly skeptical of the impact it may have on it.   Transparency brings accountability. This week, Senator Johnson and I  have done what we can to bring transparency to our oversight work for  the American people. We will continue to do so.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that this  letter to the Senate Archivist be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                Charles E. Grassley,                                  President Pro Tempore Emeritus,                                      Washington, DC, April 1, 2022.      Karen D. Paul,      Senate Archivist, Senate Historical Office,      Washington, DC.        Dear Ms. Paul: I understand that you have been charged with       implementing a provision in the Consolidated Appropriations       Act, 2022 that offered a very limited number of senators up       to $2.5 million each for the preservation of their records.       This is a shocking amount of money, well beyond what could       possibly be necessary for processing and preserving records,       even for long serving senators with a lot of records. On       September 22, 2021, my staff alerted the Senate Legislative       Branch Appropriations Subcommittee of my decision not to       accept any of the funding being proposed. It was my       understanding at that time that the Appropriations Committee       would reduce the funding appropriated accordingly.        With a budget deficit for the current fiscal year expected       to be well over $1 Trillion, and ballooning debt that is on       pace to reach an all-time record as a share of our economy       within 10 years, spending millions of taxpayer dollars on a       handful of senators' records cannot be justified. The       tradition in the Senate is for academic institutions to agree       to store and manage former senators' records as part of their       academic mission. Some senators seek to go beyond simple       preservations of records and establish centers to perpetuate       their legacy. However, funds for new facilities or other       functions beyond simply storing records are traditionally       raised privately. The taxpayers should NOT be on the hook for       senators' legacy projects. As a working senator, lam not       focused on my legacy. I often say that my legacy will be       decided by historians decades into the future with the       benefit of hindsight. As such, my legacy is not something I       can or should worry about.        Again, I did not seek these funds and I oppose their       expenditure. I ask that you not transmit paperwork to the       future repository of my records. I also ask that any funding       that is eligible to be spent on the preservation of my       records remain in the Treasury to reduce the deficit.            Sincerely,                                                    Chuck Grassley,                                             United States Senator.        PS: Read and signed by this Senator.                            ____________________
