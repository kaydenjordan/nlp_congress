 Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague,  Representative Espaillat, for organizing this important hour to share  the stories of those living in fear as a result of the actions of this  administration.   As a proud immigrant and representative of a Chicago district that is  over one-third foreign born, I know and understand the need for a  permanent solution to the status of immigrants in this country. We are  long overdue for legislation that provides a path to citizenship for  those with uncertain status.   Madam Speaker, there are more than 11 million individuals, including  children, living in the U.S. who are currently undocumented. Of those,  there are over 3.6 million Dreamers, children who entered the U.S.  before their 18th birthday, and over 1.8 million children eligible for  deferred action because they were brought to the U.S. before their 16th  birthday.   Too many live in constant fear as a result of the cruel policies of  this administration.                                time  1945    In Illinois alone, there are almost 40,000 individuals enrolled in  the deferred action program, but this issue affects entire families,  including those in mixed-status families.   There are about 800,000 people in Illinois alone in families with at  least one undocumented family member. I want to share a story of a  Dreamer, like Beatriz, who is a constituent in my district, who came to  this country at the age of 6.   Like many, her parents brought her seeking refuge from hunger,  poverty, and the violent drug wars ravaging Mexico and Central America.  Despite the toughest odds, Beatriz graduated from the Illinois  Institute of Technology with no financial aid and working a full-time  job.   Dreamers like Beatriz, if given the opportunity, are incredible  assets to our country, not a drain. We should welcome hardworking  immigrants like Beatriz and not make it harder for them to succeed and,  in turn, grow our economy and enrich the cultural riches that makes  America great.   In Beatriz's own words: ``While I am always in fear of deportation, I  am not afraid to work or to study.''   As an immigrant myself, I empathize with Beatriz and her story.   Let me be clear: Putting Dreamers and TPS beneficiaries on a pathway  to citizenship is just one of the many steps that we must take to undo  the damage the Trump Administration has done.   The current legal immigration system is broken, creating decades-long  delays for family reunifications and exacerbating workforce gaps that  harm our economy.   We cannot continue to turn a blind eye to over 11 million  undocumented people in our country who live and work in fear and in the  shadows.   Immigrants--many of them are undocumented--are our teachers,  engineers, your law enforcement officers. We are your firefighters,  your plumbers, and your doctors. In some lucky instances, we are even  your Representatives in Washington.   These are people who contribute every day to our country, and it is  time we act now to reasonable pathways to citizenship for these  hardworking people.   Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New York for yielding in  order to share Beatriz's story.
