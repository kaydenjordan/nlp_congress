 Madam Speaker, I rise today to share the disastrous  consequences of the House majority's failure to address the California  drought.   As you can see in this photo, California's water levels are  dramatically low. This water is supposed to be up all the way at the  tree line. The reservoirs are low at this point because of disastrous  policies that force us to waste water during the wetter years.   Countless communities are relying on this water. If this is what we  are seeing in the beginning of the system in the north, how are we  supposed to supply the entire State of California with enough clean  water to survive?   Across the State, communities rely on water supplied by the federally  managed Central Valley Project. Last month the Bureau of Reclamation  announced that Central Valley farmers would receive zero percent of  their contracts, effectively signing a death sentence for their fields.   Acres of half-grown crops meant to feed families across the Nation  are being abandoned to dry up and die. Meanwhile, the majority refuses  to even consider my legislation, the RENEW WIIN Act, which would help  prevent this from happening again in the future.   I ask my colleagues in the House of Representatives to acknowledge  the suffering of California families and get to work to help them.                            ____________________
