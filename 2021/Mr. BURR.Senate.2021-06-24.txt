 Mr. President, I would like to talk about the HHS Assistant  Secretary for Preparedness and Response. The HHS Assistant Secretary  for Preparedness and Response, or ASPR, is in charge during a public  health emergency and serves as the principal adviser to the Secretary  on these matters. This is not a political or a personal choice for any  administration; it is the law. I know because I helped write it. It is  a national security position, responsible for keeping Americans safe  from public health threats, like COVID-19. It is a role that we  envisioned with two types of responsibilities. The ASPR serves an  operational role. During an emergency, the ASPR coordinates the public  health and medical response--whether that threat is a hurricane, a  novel virus, or a chemical attack. The ASPR has the responsibility of  overseeing the development, purchase, and deployment of lifesaving  countermeasures, like the COVID-19 vaccine. The ASPR is also a policy  job, assessing the threat landscape and adjusting our strategies to  best position the United States for the threats we face today and in  the future.   I am glad that today the Senate was able to confirm, by unanimous  consent, Dawn O'Connell to be the ASPR. During Ms. O'Connell's  nomination process for the job, she repeatedly agreed that she is ready  to serve both roles and that the ASPR is in charge during public health  emergencies. I believe her current role as a Senior Counselor to the  HHS Secretary for COVID Response and her previous roles at HHS and in  Congress have provided her with the skills necessary to fulfill the  role of the ASPR. I was disappointed that it took the administration so  long to nominate someone for this critical role, but I am pleased that  they picked someone of Ms. O'Connell's qualifications. The ASPR is  critical to the Nation's response and recovery to the COVID pandemic  and preparing us against whatever comes next.  [[Page S4767]]    I helped orchestrate Ms. O'Connell's confirmation today when I am  also releasing a white paper from my role as lead Republican on the  Senate HELP Committee about the role of the ASPR. We have learned from  two responses under two different administrations--Ebola under Obama  and COVID under Trump--that despite Congress's bipartisan intent that  the ASPR be in charge in an emergency, that hasn't worked quite the way  we envisioned. So I have a series of recommendations to bolster the  role of the ASPR and bring greater clarity to our government's response  for future emergencies. The ASPR needs to have strong, effective  leadership and play a key role in coordinating the Federal Government  response. The ASPR needs to have the authority and resources to  strengthen public-private partnerships in our medical countermeasures,  medical supply chain, and healthcare system. And the ASPR needs to  leverage innovation to expand our preparedness infrastructure. Senator  Murray, the chair of our HELP Committee, and I are working together on  bipartisan legislation to address the response to the pandemic, and  these recommendations will see their way into that legislation this  fall.                            ____________________
