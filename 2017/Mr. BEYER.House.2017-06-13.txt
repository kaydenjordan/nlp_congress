 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Pastor Dave Kirkland,  who led us in the opening prayer. Pastor Kirkland is appointed as the  pastor of Dulin United Methodist Church in Falls Church, Virginia,  where he has been the pastor for the last 17 years.   Previously, he was appointed to Del Ray United Methodist Church in  Alexandria, Virginia, for 6 years and associate pastor at Asbury United  Methodist Church in Harrisonburg, Virginia, for 4 years.   Dave's passion in ministry is related to the great Commandment: to  love God with all your heart, soul, and mind, and to love your neighbor  as yourself.   This is articulated in preaching, raising money, and good deeds  performed by the congregation through reaching out to the lost and the  least.   A highlight of this ministry of hope at Dulin: over 60 homeless  persons each Sunday morning are served a breakfast, attend a worship  service, and are given toiletries and assistance cards to purchase  items at Giant Food.   Dulin is engaged in several local ministries, such as Homeless  Shelter, Homestretch, Rebuilding Together, and Meals on Wheels; and he  also supports a child rescue center in Sierra Leone.   Mr. Speaker, I am honored to welcome Pastor Dave today to the House  of Representatives, and I personally thank him for offering the opening  prayer.                            ____________________
