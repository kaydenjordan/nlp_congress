 Mr. President, I rise to join my colleagues, Senator  Rounds and Senator King, in clarifying the intent of a provision from  the Immigration Security and Opportunity Act, which has been offered as  an amendment. What this provision seeks to do is send a strong message  to people who come to the country after the bill is enacted that they  are going to be a priority for deportation just like a person  [[Page S1148]]  who has committed a felony is prioritized for deportation. I commit to  changing this date from June 30, 2018, back to the beginning of the  calendar year, January 1, 2018, in conference should the amendment be  adopted by the Senate.    Mr. President, I thank my colleagues, and I yield the  floor.
