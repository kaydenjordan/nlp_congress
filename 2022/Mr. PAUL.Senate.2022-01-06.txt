 Mr. President, as ranking member of the Senate  Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week, I  recognize an outstanding Kentucky small business that exemplifies the  American entrepreneurial spirit. This week, I am honored to recognize  the Lenoxburg General Store of Foster, KY, as the Senate Small Business  of the Week.   When Scott and Angela Horn took over the Lenoxburg General Store  nearly 2 years ago, they inherited more than four walls stacked with  merchandise. The illustrious history and culture of the store bring  with it a tradition that the Horn's were determined to uphold and  enhance. Founded by Sam Lenoxburg in 1938 during the height of the  Great Depression, the General Store brought local farmers and tradesmen  together for excellent meals and butchering services. It represented a  gathering place for a rapidly expanding community and was the  cornerstone of Bracken and Pendleton County. While large cities and  towns had cinemas and famous diners to bring about this connection, it  was Sam Lenoxburg's store that generated the communal culture in the  tight-knit Kentucky town for generations.   Today, the Lenoxburg General Store continues to supply both general  service and deli processing to its local clientele. The location  remains a congregation hub, drawing folks from all over and the  bordering counties to dine and shop with a traditional flair. Since the  Horns took ownership, the store has branched into catering and offers  delivery for local events across the community it serves. The location  also hosts events of its own, including fish-fry contests and holiday  celebrations. But most importantly, during this time, Angela and Scott  have continued in their tradition of hiring within their community,  serving as a boon to their local economy. This family-owned business  has supported a community-first atmosphere in the store which attracts  visitors and customers from surrounding counties.   Philanthropy and hospitality are crucial tenants to Kentucky's  character, and the Horns exemplify these traits through their  charitable work. Scott, the local game warden, has partnered with  Kentucky Hunters for the Hungry to deliver more than 1,450 pounds of  venison to more than 350 families in need. The Horns are also involved  with national charities and use their business to contribute to the  Bracken and Pendleton tourism committees, along with the counties' 4-H  programs. Lenoxburg General Store was heavily involved in the  preparation and execution of the Heritage Days in Augusta, the longest  running event in the area. Scott and Angela are committed to serving  their friends and neighbors and get involved whenever they can to  improve the lives of those around them.   The Horns' dedicated approach to supporting the store's family-like  atmosphere goes beyond their praised home-cooked specials. As business  owners and operators, Scott and Angela go above and beyond for their  community and demonstrate how small businesses serve as the backbone of  towns across Kentucky.   Congratulations to Scott, Angela, and the entire Lenoxburg General  Store team. I wish them the best of luck, and I look forward to  watching their continued growth and success in Kentucky.                            ____________________
