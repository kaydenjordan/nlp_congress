 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of truth and  justice. The chairman and the ranking member are two honorable men. We  all can see this, Madam Speaker, and I am happy about that.   That attack was born of lies. This year marks the 20th anniversary of  the worst external terrorist attack in our modern history. The gravest  attack ever on American democracy came 133 days ago. That attack was  born of lies. It was born about the voting, about elections, and about  our democracy. These lies divided our country. They spread across our  land like a plague.   On December 11, I warned on this floor of elected officials across  this Nation amplifying big lies. On January 6, the world saw the  result. Like the 9/11 Commission it is modeled after, this commission  must hold allegiance only to the truth. A full investigation of this  attack must reflect on how the spark of insurrection was ignited and  who fanned the flames. It is our sacred duty, Madam Speaker.
