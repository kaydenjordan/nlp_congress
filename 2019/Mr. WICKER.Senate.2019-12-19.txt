 Mr. President, the time is fleeting.   The distinguished Republican whip is correct. We had hoped that the  robocall bill could be included with unanimous consent with two other  very important pieces of legislation--one being the Broadband DATA Act,  S. 1822, which is designed to tell the FCC: Go back. Get the maps  right. Show us where we have coverage and where we do not have  coverage. We are making great progress with that. I do believe we will  get that bill passed in just a moment.   The other issue is the Huawei data security act. I understand we are  going to have some trouble with that. Let me talk briefly before I make  my unanimous consent request.   China is up to no good with their government-controlled companies,  Huawei and ZTE. They are required by Chinese law to do the bidding of  the Chinese Communist dictatorship, and that means using their  equipment to spy on Americans.   This is an undisputed fact, and it is recognized not only by  Americans but also by other countries, our allies, which are taking  steps to protect themselves. Japan, Australia, New Zealand have already  begun the process of removing this dangerous ZTE and Huawei equipment  from their networks.   We have legislation we thought was going to be included in this  three-bill package, H.R. 4998, to authorize this in the United States.   Earlier this year, the President signed an Executive order declaring  a national emergency--and I agree with the President--because of the  dangerous effects of keeping Chinese equipment in our Nation's critical  infrastructure. Given these threats, we have an opportunity today to  remove this Huawei and ZTE equipment from American telecommunication  networks so we can protect Americans.   We are going to have some trouble with that on the unanimous consent  request. I think with the broadband DATA Act we will not.   (Mrs. FISCHER assumed the Chair.)                            ____________________     Madam President, notwithstanding rule XXII, I ask  unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate  consideration of Calendar No. 328, S. 1822.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  committee-reported amendment be withdrawn; that the Wicker substitute  amendment at the desk be agreed to; that the bill, as amended, be  considered read a third time and passed; and that the motion to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.    Madam President, with regard to the so-called ``Rip and  Replace Act'' that would facilitate the United States joining our  allies and protecting us, notwithstanding rule XXII, I ask unanimous  consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of H.R.  4998, which was received from the House; that the bill be considered  read a third time and passed; and that the motion to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table.    Reserving the right to object.    Madam President, the Senator, my good friend from Utah,  has asked unanimous consent that we pass the version of the bill I  authored. Ordinarily, I would very much appreciate that. The problem  with his request is that in this Congress, it prevents us from acting  today to get to this ZTE and Huawei problem. We have a solution, and we  need to get started on it.   Let me also make the point that some things are worth paying for, and  protecting Americans, protecting our electronic system, our broadband  communications from the Chinese-owned Huawei and ZTE is worth paying  for.   What my unanimous consent request would have done, had the Senator  not objected, is we would have passed the bill and leave the issue of  how we fund it to another day. Perhaps the appropriators would have  decided to appropriate money for it. Had they done so, they would have  operated within the budget caps, as the Appropriations Committee has  done, and found room, found some offsets, and paid for it that way.   The proposal I made, that was objected to by my friend from Utah,  would also have left open the possibility of having a pay-for by the  sale of some spectrum.   I regret that the Senator is objecting based on how we will pay for  this very needed expenditure down the road. So I am compelled to object  to my good friend's unanimous consent request.
