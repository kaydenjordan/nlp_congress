 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, the gentleman from  Virginia, Ranking Member Scott, for recognizing me.   Mr. Speaker, as someone who has dedicated most of her career to  combating anti-Semitism and as the co-chair of the House Bipartisan  Task Force for Combating Antisemitism, I know well that anti-Semitism  has been on the rise in our country for years.   It was a growing problem before the October 7 Hamas terrorist attack,  and sadly, immediately after that savage attack, anti-Semitism has  skyrocketed, particularly on college campuses.   What we have seen happening on college campuses is outrageous, and  too many college and university leaders have totally failed in their  moral responsibility to condemn anti-Semitism. They have failed to keep  Jewish students and faculty members safe. That is shameful.   I was appalled by the failure of the three college presidents to  simply say yes. A call for the genocide of Jews is wrong, period, but I  have no interest in meaningless resolutions that do nothing to address  the underlying issue of anti-Semitism.   That is why my colleagues should join us in crafting serious  bipartisan legislation that will make a real difference. We don't need  throwaway resolutions. We need effective solutions.   If we are serious about fighting anti-Semitism, we need legislation  to implement and codify the United States' National Strategy to Counter  Anti-Semitism. We need to pass the President's request for $200 million  in emergency supplemental funding for the Nonprofit Security Grant  Program. We need to fully fund the Office of Civil Rights at the U.S.  Department of Education, not cut that funding. We need to strengthen  our Federal civil rights laws to punish all universities that fail to  protect Jewish students.                                time  1530    Until we do that, nonbinding politically motivated resolutions are  not worth the paper they are written on. When anti-Semitism rears its  ugly head, it harms us all and it eats at the foundations of our  democracy.   I have always called out anti-Semitism on the left and on the right,  and I will continue to do so, but I don't want just words. I want this  Congress to take action and pass implementing legislation.
