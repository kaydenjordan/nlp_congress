 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume as  I rise in support of this measure.   First of all, let me thank Congressman Doug Collins and Congresswoman  Brenda Lawrence for their work in bringing this bill forward.   This bill before us, the Intercountry Adoption Information Act of  2018, will create more transparency in the adoption process.   Mr. Speaker, the adoption process can be long, emotional, and  expensive  [[Page H6016]]  for Americans who seek to expand their families and give children a  forever home. The reason families put themselves through this is  because they love these children and want to give them a chance to be  part of a loving family. But foreign governments sometimes abruptly  change their policies on adoptions, leaving families in the dark as  they anxiously wait to be united with their adoptive children. This  measure would help make sure adoptive parents get the information they  need when this happens.   H.R. 5626 requires the Secretary of State to report whether countries  have enacted new laws or policies that would affect intercountry  adoptions for American families. This will help create a more  transparent adoption process that benefits everyone, the parents and  the child as well.   Mr. Speaker, we owe to these families and children to illuminate the  dark corners of the adoption process. With 140 million children  orphaned worldwide, we need to make it easier for families to come  together, regardless of the child's birth country. These children need  loving and supportive homes, and this bill gives them a better chance  at being adopted into one.   Mr. Speaker, I support this measure strongly, and I urge my  colleagues to do the same.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Michigan (Mrs. Lawrence), the coauthor of the measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time, and I  will close.   I want to say again that I am pleased to support the Intercountry  Adoption Information Act. Let me add that too often we hear these  heart-wrenching stories of American families whose adoption processes  were halted by a foreign government's change in policy. To make matters  worse, these families often have no idea why the process grinds to a  halt.   This bill presents a straightforward fix, requiring the State  Department to provide information that affects prospective adoptive  American families. So I support this bill and agree with what the  chairman has said as well and encourage all my colleagues to do the  same.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this measure.   I thank the ranking member of the Africa, Global Health, Global Human  Rights, and International Organizations Subcommittee, Ms. Karen Bass of  California, for her hard work on this legislation.   For several years, Libya has been a hub for African migration to  Europe, with an estimated 700,000 to 1 million refugees and migrants  currently in the country.   Last year, I was shocked and horrified to see multiple news reports  documenting the existence of slave auctions in Libya, where these  migrants and refugees were put up for sale. It is unbelievable that, in  the year 2018, we could still have slavery anywhere in the world, just  absolutely unbelievable.   Since then, the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights found that  many migrants who enter Libya are forced to work for no pay. This is  also unacceptable. We cannot accept a world where human beings are  auctioned off, treated like property. It is unbelievable. These are  some of the most vulnerable people in the world, and we cannot stand by  as they are mistreated.   This resolution strongly condemns slave auctions and the exploitation  of migrants and refugees as forced laborers in Libya. It also calls  upon all parties to the conflict in Libya to investigate and eradicate  slave auctions and forced labor involving migrants and refugees, to  hold those identified in the investigation accountable in courts of  law, and to examine the extent to which profits earned through the  exploitation of these migrants may be fueling conflict in Libya.   Importantly, the measure also calls upon the United Nations to  investigate this slave trade and forced labor in Libya and expand U.N.  Security Council sanctions against individuals and entities responsible  for this atrocity. The international community must hold accountable  those who are responsible for these heinous crimes.   It is also important that we have full information so that we can  address this issue and understand what we are dealing with. That is why  it is so important that this resolution also urges the Secretary of  State to ensure that Libya is fully and accurately covered in the  annual Trafficking in Persons Report. This measure sends a clear  message. By passing it today, we say, unequivocally, that we will not  stand for this inhumanity.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan measure,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, it is now my pleasure to yield 5 minutes to  the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Bass), the very distinguished  ranking member of the Africa, Global Health, Global Human Rights, and  International Organizations Subcommittee of the Foreign Affairs  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   In closing, the United States cannot stand by as human beings are  auctioned off, forced to work for no pay, and treated without dignity  or respect. Congress must speak out and condemn this horrific situation  in Libya.   Mr. Speaker, I support this measure. I urge my colleagues to do the  same, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this measure. I would like to begin  by thanking Representatives Ted Poe and Joe Kennedy for their hard work  on this legislation. This legislation seeks to enhance the health,  safety, and security of Peace Corps volunteers.   Of course we, many of us, served with many of the people who went on  to become Congressmen when they were first in the Peace Corps as well,  and Sam Farr was one of those people, and I listened to many stories  that Sam Farr told about the Peace Corps.   The bill is named in honor of two past Peace Corps volunteers, again,  Congressman Sam Farr, who served in Colombia. I have traveled with Sam  to Colombia, and his Spanish was impeccable. He was a tireless champion  of the Peace Corps during his service in the House.   The bill is also named for Nick Castle, a young volunteer who was  passionate about life and about helping other people. In 2013, while on  assignment in rural China, Nick fell ill and didn't receive the medical  care he needed and, tragically, died, a young man in his twenties.   This legislation before us today would strengthen existing health and  safety standards for our Peace Corps volunteers. It would also  reauthorize the Sexual Assault Advisory Council that reviews reports of  sexual assault involving volunteers, and provides the Peace Corps  additional flexibility in retaining certain employees.   Peace Corps volunteers represent the best of America. These selfless  men and women live for 2 years, often in remote parts of the world,  helping to advance critical priorities, like educating girls,  preventing HIV and malaria, environmental conservation, improving  agricultural methods, and community economic development.   Mr. Speaker, this is an important bill that will improve the lives of  our Peace Corps volunteers currently serving in 65 countries across the  globe. By passing this measure, we honor Sam Farr and Nick Castle and  the 230,000 Americans who have served as Peace Corps volunteers over  the past 57 years.   I remember when the Peace Corps first came together, when President  Kennedy called for a Peace Corps. It has obviously gone on for a long,  long time, and has been one of the most successful programs that the  United States has had.   So I urge my colleagues to support this measure, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Massachusetts (M Kennedy) who, as Mr. Poe mentioned before, is a former  Peace Corps volunteer who served in the Dominican Republic.    I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentleman from  Massachusetts.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   In closing, let me first again say that my colleague and friend, Mr.  Poe, is eloquent as usual. I want to single out Mr. Kennedy, whose  great uncle, President John F. Kennedy, first established the Peace  Corps; and the Kennedy family has also, through the years, been very  engaged in making the world a better place, so I appreciate my  colleague from Massachusetts for speaking.   Congressman Royce and myself have run this committee in a bipartisan  way and, again, I think this bill is typical of good bipartisanship. It  is a good bill for the United States.   The Peace Corps shows people around the world America at its best. It  shows our values. It shows our generosity. It shows our compassion.  Since its inception in 1961, volunteers have engaged in people-to- people diplomacy and community-based development in 141 countries on  six continents.   We, in Congress, must do what we can to keep our current volunteers  healthy and safe.   So, again, I want to thank Congressman Poe and Congressman Kennedy. I  want to also thank Senator Corker and Senator Feinstein for the  companion bill in the Senate.   I would also like to especially recognize three staff members, Luke  Murry, Oren Adaki, and Janice Kaguyutan--even though I am massacring  her last name--for their years of work on Peace Corps issues. We  couldn't do this without the good work that our staffs do.   One of the things that I am very proud of on the Foreign Affairs  Committee is the bipartisan way in which we work, and the staffs are  responsive to everyone on the committee, not just people on their side  of the aisle, and I think that shows in the committee, and it shows  America at its best and its finest.                                time  1730    The Peace Corps is really important. Peace Corps issues are really  important. The agency is undoubtedly a better agency because of the  efforts of the people that I just mentioned.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly support this measure, I urge my colleagues to  do the same, and I yield back the balance of my time.
