 Mr. Speaker, I rise today as May marks National Mental  Health Awareness month, a time when Americans recommit themselves to  building better futures for those struggling with a mental health  condition, erasing the stigma around those seeking help, and elevating  barriers to high quality and timely mental health care.   According to a 2020 report released by Congress' Joint Economic  Committee, over 40 percent of adults surveyed reported a negative  mental or behavioral health condition exacerbated by the coronavirus.  Ending the mental health and addiction crises is a mission that can  unite all of our communities because, just like mine in northern Ohio,  there isn't a single community that hasn't struggled with both.   I commend my colleagues with legislation on the floor today,  including Mrs. Watson Coleman's bill to reauthorize the Minority  Fellowship Program to support more students of color entering the  mental health workforce, who are dedicated to addressing mental health  disparities among underserved populations.   It is time, and over time, for Congress to take meaningful action,  targeting provider shortages, reimbursement parity, housing support,  treatment, and more Federal funding to push the bounds of Federal  research.   We have strong allies in the administration who care about these  issues. I look forward to rolling up my sleeves to work with them, and  across the aisle. We are only getting started.                            ____________________
