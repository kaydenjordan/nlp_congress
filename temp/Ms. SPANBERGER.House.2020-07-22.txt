 Madam Speaker, I rise tonight to remember Congressman  John Lewis.   And for me, the best way to honor the memory of this beautiful man,  this kind soul, our colleague, our friend, and for so many of us, our  teacher, is to share his best lessons.   And in his 2017 book, Congressman John Robert Lewis said the  following: ``Freedom is not a state; it is an act.   ``It is not some enchanted garden perched high on a distant plateau  where we can finally sit down and rest.   ``Freedom is a continuous action we must all take, and each  generation must do its part to create an even more fair, more just  society.''   These are words to drive our work and our lives. And he spoke them to  the world.   But to us, on June 4, on a call with so many of our colleagues, he  told us: ``Be brave. Don't get weary. Let's continue to work.''   And I wrote those words down, because like everything John Lewis  said, they struck me as powerful and important and worth remembering.  And in his memory and in his honor, we should all do just that,  continue to work.                                time  2045
