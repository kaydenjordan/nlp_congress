 Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition to this  resolution, which curtails the President's authority to protect  American interests in the Middle East.   Two weeks ago, Iranian proxies launched a missile attack on American  forces in Iraq. This was the 11th such rocket attack by the Iranians in  recent months. This time, as our leader said, it killed Nawres Hamid,  who was a husband, a father, a contractor, and an American citizen.   The man behind this attack and additional attacks that were being  planned and that were imminent was the terrorist mastermind Qasem  Soleimani, who was responsible for the deaths, as we have heard, of at  least 600, probably many more, Americans and for thousands of others in  that part of the world, and for causing destabilization throughout the  entire region.   For years now, Soleimani had been leading Iran's shadow war against  us and against our allies. In targeting Soleimani, President Trump took  bold, long-overdue action, and he ought to be supported for this  decision, not criticized.   This resolution, by condemning even limited military force and  limited action, would essentially tie the President's hands behind his  back as he tries to counter Iran's shadow campaign against us.   Madam Speaker, it makes no sense, this resolution, and I strongly  urge my colleagues to oppose it and vote against it.
