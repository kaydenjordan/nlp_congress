 Madam Speaker, I rise today in the wake of National Police  Week to memorialize our officers who lost their lives in the line of  duty.   Nearly 3 years ago, on October 8, 2016, Officers Lesley Zerebny and  Gil Vega from the Palm Springs Police Department were shot and killed  in the line of duty responding to what appeared to be a routine  domestic disturbance.   Through this tragedy, our community came together, not only to  remember Officers Zerebny and Vega, but to do more for their families  and the entire law enforcement community.   Together, we found that families of fallen first responders, those  who gave their all to protect us all, are being shortchanged. That is  why I introduced the Heroes Lesley Zerebny and Gil Vega First Responder  Survivor Support Act, to honor those who have passed by serving the  living.   My bill will increase the Public Safety Officer Benefit from $350,000  to $500,000 in order to pay off the calculated national average debt  most families have; it will increase the monthly education benefit from  $1,024 per month to $2,000 per month to ensure they can afford the  actual rising costs of an education; and it will fix a bureaucratic  loophole that, due to unnecessary red tape and delays in receiving  benefits, can cost families up to tens of thousands of dollars through  no fault of their own.   I urge all Members of Congress to do the right thing: to follow words  with action, to follow praise with pragmatic solutions that will  improve the lives of fallen first responders' families. I hope that all  Members will cosponsor and support my bipartisan Heroes Lesley Zerebny  and Gil Vega First Responder Survivors Support Act.   I urge the Speaker to bring it up for a vote immediately. Let's  support this bill and stand up for the families of fallen officers who  have sacrificed so much for us.                            ____________________
