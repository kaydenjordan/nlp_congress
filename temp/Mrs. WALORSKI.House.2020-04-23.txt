 Madam Speaker, I want to give a shout-out to the  healthcare workers in Indiana's Second District while I am standing  here supporting this legislation. What a phenomenal job and risk they  have taken.   I am supporting this legislation today, but this delay was long, too  long, completely avoidable. Two weeks ago, Democrats blocked attempts  to replenish PPP and ensure small businesses could continue making  payroll and rent. They said there was no data supporting more funding,  even though the program ran out of money only a week later.   PPP has helped so many small businesses across my district save jobs.  But others have been waiting for loans they urgently needed while  Democrats played games with workers' livelihoods.   As one frustrated small business owner wrote to me: I saw the Speaker  laughing it up on late night television, showing off her stash of high- end ice cream, while I and other small business owners don't know how  we will make the next payroll.   I tell you what, ladies and gentlemen: Times are tough. Small  business needs everything we can give them in a bipartisan way. I  strongly urge support of this bill.
