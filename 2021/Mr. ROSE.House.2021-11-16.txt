 Madam Speaker, today, I stand here, in the people's House,  entrusted with the responsibility of ensuring taxpayers' hard-earned  dollars are spent appropriately and with the proper oversight in place.   Yet, this week, House Democrats are pushing to ram through their  fatally flawed, partisan, multitrillion-dollar tax and spend package,  which uses taxpayer dollars and, no doubt, billions of dollars in  borrowed money to fund their ultraliberal domestic spending priorities.   The gigantic $3.5 trillion bill has apparently been cut down to $1.75  trillion, which is still a lot.   What is in the $1.75 trillion tax and spend spree? Amnesty for  illegal immigrants, billions for tree equity, tax hikes on job creators  and working Americans, and it doesn't end there.   The Democrats' package leaves out critical funding for the Department  of Defense and the Department of Homeland Security.   Democrats have gone so far as to break over 40 years of tradition by  stripping the Hyde amendment from their package, a longstanding  bipartisan provision that prevents taxpayer dollars from being used to  fund abortions.                            ____________________
