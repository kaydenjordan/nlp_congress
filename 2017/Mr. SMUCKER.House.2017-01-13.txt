 Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this resolution,  which will be the first step to repealing ObamaCare.   I, like so many of my colleagues, have heard from citizens all across  my district in regard to the impact of this system on them. I want to  share a conversation I had recently with a constituent.   Tim Hollinger called me. Tim and his wife, Phyllis, are residents of  Mount Joy, Pennsylvania, in my home county of Lancaster. Tim is on  Medicare, but Phyllis, who is self-employed, has a healthcare plan that  she obtained through the ObamaCare marketplace.   Tim and Phyllis' annual income is $53,000 per year. Phyllis'  healthcare premium is over $1,000 a month and carries a $2,700  deductible. Let me repeat that. Phyllis' healthcare premium is over  $1,000 per month. That is 23 percent of their combined annual income.   The CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.    Mr. Chair, now Phyllis receives a Federal subsidy that  covers 35 percent of that monthly cost. She takes pride in the fact  that she has never taken a government handout in her life.   Now that she is on ObamaCare, the American taxpayers have to  subsidize her health care. To Phyllis, that is not right. To Phyllis,  this is about her pride. She is not asking for a lot. She is simply  asking that she have access to affordable health care that doesn't  require the American taxpayers to help her pay for it.   I look forward to working with my colleagues to fix our Nation's  failed healthcare system.
