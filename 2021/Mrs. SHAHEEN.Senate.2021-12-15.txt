 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for  up to 5 minutes before the vote.    Madam President, I am really pleased to join my  colleague Senator Hassan to speak in support of Samantha Elliott's  nomination to the Federal District Court for the District of New  Hampshire.   As we heard from Senator Hassan, Samantha Elliott has had an amazing  public service career. Her professional experience and commitment to  ensuring equal access to justice make her eminently qualified to serve  on the Federal bench. She will make an excellent addition to the  Federal district court in New Hampshire.   Now, Samantha actually came to the practice of law in a less  traditional way. She started out first as a writer for magazines before  she and her husband flipped a coin to see who would go to law school.  After graduating from Columbia Law School--she obviously won the toss-- she joined Gallagher, Callahan and Gartrell, a law firm in Concord, our  capital city.   Since becoming an attorney, Samantha has litigated before Federal and  State courts, handling an impressive collection of matters that  involves complex areas of law. She has also served in a variety of  leadership positions at her firm, including serving as president for 5  years.   During the selection process, Samantha always came back to the  importance of equal access to justice, saying at one point: ``No one  closes or opens doors to access to justice like a judge does.''  Samantha knows firsthand, through her extensive work with the New  Hampshire legal aid community, just how correct that saying is.   For 9 years, she served on the joint board of the New Hampshire Legal  Assistance and the Legal Advice and Referral Center, and she has held  various roles on its executive committee. Samantha has also spent more  than 2\1/2\ years on a special committee that has met every other  Monday to revisit the structure of legal aid in New Hampshire. Just  think about that--every other Monday for 2\1/2\ years to better  restructure legal aid in New Hampshire. These tireless efforts  culminated in the creation of 603 Legal Aid, which is a new entity that  will increase access to justice for New Hampshire's low-income  residents.   Samantha has consistently demonstrated her commitment to ensuring  that everyone has access to justice no matter what their socioeconomic  status. As a result of her commitment, her tenacity, and her respect  for the law, Samantha's nomination has garnered widespread support  throughout the New Hampshire legal community, including from Chuck  Douglas, who is a former Republican Representative to Congress and New  Hampshire Supreme Court Justice. Now, he has only ever faced Samantha  as an adversary in litigation, but he said she is an ``excellent lawyer  who is creative and diligent and exhibits the highest standards of our  profession.''   In addition to former Justice Douglas, Samantha's nomination is  supported by a diverse collection of attorneys and others in the New  Hampshire legal community, including the New Hampshire Women's Bar  Association; Judge Gary Hicks, who is a current supreme court justice  in New Hampshire, a senior associate; and George Moore, the executive  director of the New Hampshire Bar Association, to name just a few of  those who have weighed in with letters of support.   Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have these letters of  support printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                           New Hampshire Women's Bar                                                     Association,                                                    October 4, 2021.      Re: Nomination of Samantha Elliott to the United States           District Court for the District of New Hampshire        Dear Chairman Durbin and Ranking Member Grassley: On behalf       of the unanimous Board of Directors of the New Hampshire       Women's Bar Association, and in my personal capacity as her       law partner, I write, collectively with the Board, in support       of Samantha Elliott's nomination for the United States       District Court for the District of New Hampshire. We urge the       Committee and full Senate to promptly review and confirm her       nomination.        Since admission to the bar, Attorney Elliott has spent her       entire legal career practicing in New Hampshire. She has       represented plaintiffs and defendants, individuals,       corporations, and governmental entities. She has handled       matters in nearly all areas of civil practice, such as       commercial disputes, employment and discrimination, product       liability, property rights, and municipal defense in civil       rights litigation. She has successfully represented clients       in litigation, trials, and appeals in every New Hampshire       state court, the United States District Court for the       District of New Hampshire, and the First Circuit Court of       Appeals.        In addition to her legal work, Attorney Elliott has       dedicated over a decade towards volunteer board work in       service to legal aid, first with New Hampshire Legal       Assistance and the Legal Advice and Referral Center, and then       603 Legal Aid. Attorney Elliott frequently speaks on lawyers'       continuing legal education panels, including multiple years       with the Federal Practice Institute. She is an active member       of the American Inns of Court, and has served on both the New       Hampshire Court Accreditation Commission and the Federal       Court Advisory Committee.        The New Hampshire Women's Bar Association Board of       Directors strongly supports Attorney Elliott's nomination to       the federal bench. Attorney Elliott is an outstanding member       of our legal community. She possesses the mental acumen and       temperament to decide matters fairly and impartially. She       would be an asset to the federal judiciary, and we strongly       recommend her appointment.            Sincerely,          Caroline K. Leonard, NHWBA President 2020-2022; Christina             A. Ferrari, Immediate Past President; Katherine E.             Hedges, Treasurer; Lyndsay N. Robinson, Networking             Chair; Meredith R. Farrell, Public Relations Chair;             Christine Hilliard, Public Service Chair; Emily Gray             Rice, Member at large; Marrielle B. Van Rossum, Member             at large; Lindsey B. Courtney, Vice President; Brooke             Lovett Shilo, Secretary; Alexandra S. Cote, Membership             Chair; Shauna Segelke, Programming Chair; Terri M.             Harrington, Member at large; Courtney G. Tanner, Member             at large.                                   ____                                  Douglas, Leonard & Garvey, P.C.,                                                    October 6, 2021.      Re: Nomination of Samantha Elliott to the District Court of           New Hampshire        Dear Chairman Durbin and Ranking Member Grassley: I am       writing to support the nomination of Samantha Elliott of New       Hampshire to be a United States District Judge for the       District of New Hampshire.        I served as a judge for over 10 years on the state Superior       Court and the state Supreme Court and have practiced in the       federal courts since I was admitted to the Bar in 1968. I       know what the job entails and that she will perform       admirably.        We currently have at least two cases in which Attorney       Elliott is on the other side. I have never been in litigation       with her other than as adversaries. She is an excellent       lawyer who is creative and diligent and exhibits the highest       standards of our profession. She is well respected in the New       Hampshire Bar and has served our legal aid and legal       assistance programs for years.        I have also dealt with her as a lobbyist for a pool of       municipal governments. While we were adversaries for years       over various immunities and governmental disputes with       plaintiffs, she always kept her word and I could trust her to       accurately convey our negotiated deals even if I were not       present to submit them to a committee. That is an extremely       rare quality, and one that is not general currency in our       capital or yours.        I have no hesitation supporting her nomination and know she       will serve the judiciary well on our bench.        By the way I enjoyed serving with then Congressman Durbin       when I was in the House in 1989 and 1990.            Sincerely,      Charles G. Douglas, III.                                   ____                                                     October 2, 2021.      Re: Nomination of Samantha D. Elliott to the United States           District Court for the District of New Hampshire        Dear Chairman Durbin and Ranking Member Grassley: We are       writing in enthusiastic support of Samantha Elliott's       nomination to the United States District Court for the       District of New Hampshire. Both of us have worked closely       with Ms. Elliott over the past ten years to achieve the goal       of equal access to justice for all in New Hampshire.        Deborah, a legal aid lawyer in Tennessee and New Hampshire       in her early career, served as a judicial officer in New       Hampshire's Superior Court and Family Division for 25 years.       In 2013, following her retirement from the bench, Deborah       joined the overlapping Boards of New Hampshire Legal       Assistance (NHLA)and the Legal Advice & Referral Center       (LARC) serving as Co-Chair of the Joint Board and then Chair       of the LARC Board. Beginning in 2018, Deborah spearheaded the       Statewide Planning Committee,  [[Page S9181]]       created to improve the delivery of quality legal services to       low income and disadvantaged residents of New Hampshire. This       three-year effort resulted in the merger of LARC and the NH       Bar Association's Pro Bono Program into 603 Legal Aid,       collaborating in partnership with NHLA. Ms. Elliott and       Deborah have worked closely over the past five years, as Co-      Chairs of the overlapping Boards, and during this intense       three-year Statewide Planning commitment. Deborah is now a       founding member of the 603 Legal Aid Board, of which Ms.       Elliott is the founding Co-Chair.        John is currently a legal aid consultant and NH school       funding advocate. He worked for 38 years at NHLA New       Hampshire Legal Assistance as a staff attorney and managing       attorney before serving for 18 years as the program's.       Executive Director until his retirement in 2014. During his       time at NHLA he played a leadership role in advocacy for       equal justice in New Hampshire, in the New England region,       and nationally. He was Executive Director of NHLA during the       beginning of Ms. Elliott's term on the overlapping Boards of       NHLA and the Legal Advice and Referral Center (LARC).        We have observed Ms. Elliott's superior intellect and       communication skills, and we have seen how others respond to       her measured and perceptive analysis of difficult problems.       We know how respected she is among her fellow Board members       and the staff of NHLA, LARC, and now 603 Legal Aid, who have       relied on her good and ethical judgment in the governance of       these organizations. And we have been impressed with her work       ethic, her focus, her humanity, and her integrity. She       possesses in great abundance the intelligence, ethical       grounding, and temperament that are vital to being a fair and       effective judge.        While we admire her intellect and her character, from our       perspective as legal aid leaders we want to emphasize Ms.       Elliott's extraordinary fidelity to the concept of equal       justice and her commitment to seeing that everyone has the       opportunity to access this basic American value, no matter       their position in society. The amount of time and energy that       Ms. Elliott has devoted to the cause of equal justice is       immeasurable. Despite the demands of a busy law practice, Ms.       Elliott has unsparingly committed herself to assuring that       New Hampshire's legal aid organizations are well-managed and       highly collaborative, so that they can deliver quality legal       services to the poor. She has used her stellar reputation in       the legal community to recruit prominent lawyers to support       access to justice efforts, whether in leadership positions,       as advocates, or as donors. She has volunteered her own legal       services by assisting the Boards in understanding their       fiduciary responsibilities and providing advice on other       legal matters. She has developed relationships with the       executive leadership of NHLA, LARC, and 603 Legal Aid,       nurturing mutual trust and mutual commitment to mission. And       she has advocated in multiple forums, including at the NH       Supreme Court and in the NH Legislature, in support of       everyone's right to justice and dignity in our legal system.        We hope that you will consider this nomination favorably.       We are confident that, as a judge, Ms. Elliott will be highly       competent and deeply compassionate. We know that she will       treat everyone who appears before her with the respect they       deserve from our judicial system, regardless of their social       status or identity. And, as a member of the federal bench,       she will have the opportunity to bring our court system       closer to the goal of equal access to justice for all.            Sincerely,      Deborah Kane Rein, Esq.,        Lake Worth, FL (formerly Concord, NH).      John E. Tobin, Jr., Esq.,        Concord, NH.                                   ____                                    New Hampshire Bar Association,                                                    October 1, 2021.      Re: The nomination of Samantha Elliott to the District Court           for the United States District of New Hampshire         Dear Chairman Durbin and Ranking Member Grassley: I write       in support of the nomination of Samantha Elliott to serve as       a judge on the United States District Court for the District       of New Hampshire. I urge the committee and full Senate to       promptly review and confirm her nomination. I have worked       with Attorney Elliott on a number of matters over the years       and found her to be an exceedingly excellent trial lawyer and       advocate for both plaintiffs and defendants. She is       extraordinarily bright, personable, and has a great       temperament to be on the bench. In the course of her career,       she also served as managing partner of her law firm.        In addition, I worked very closely with Attorney Elliott in       her capacity as a Board Member for New Hampshire Legal       Assistance and Legal Advice and Referral Center. Together, we       recently merged the Bar Association's Pro Bono program with       the Legal Advice and Referral Center to create a new       statewide entity to serve indigent citizens. The new       organization's name is 603 Legal Aid, and it was Attorney       Elliott's determination, forthrightness, and ability to bring       various stakeholders to the table that ensured that our       efforts would be successful. There is no doubt that she will       bring the same energy, judgment, and intellectual capacity to       the federal bench.        In closing, I respectfully submit my strong support for       Samantha Elliott and request the committee and full Senate to       promptly review and confirm her nomination to this important       position.            Very Truly Yours,                                           George R. Moore Esq.,                                                 Executive Director,      New Hampshire Bar Association.                                   ____                                        Backus, Meyer & Branch, LLP,                                                Attorneys at Law,                                    Manchester, NH, October 4, 2021.      Re: Samantha Elliott         Dear Senator Durbin: I welcome this opportunity to support       the nomination of Samantha Elliott. I have practiced law in       New Hampshire since 1977, first with the New Hampshire Civil       Liberties Union, and since 1981 in private practice. My       principal areas of work are plaintiff's employment law and       civil rights. Attorney Elliott has been defense counsel in       several of my cases. In my experience, she is very       knowledgeable of the law, has excellent legal skills, and       works hard to achieve a fair outcome. Notwithstanding her       defense counsel role, she has demonstrated a capacity to       empathize with the plaintiff.        She has a strong commitment to securing equal protection       and justice. Equally important, at least from my perspective,       is her welcoming demeanor which would make her courtroom a       great place to practice law.        Please let me know if I can provide any further       information.            Sincerely,      Jon Meyer.                                   ____                                        Backus, Meyer & Branch, LLP,                                                Attorneys at Law,                                    Manchester, NH, October 4, 2021.

Re: Nomination of Samantha Elliott to the United States           District Court for the District of New Hampshire         Dear Chairman Durbin and Ranking Member Grassley: It is       with much pleasure that I write to you in support of Attorney       Samantha Elliott. My knowledge of her qualifications derives       from ten years of personal observations including: multiple       arguments before our court; active participation in our       Daniel Webster Inns of Court; and her remarkable public       service.        Attorney Elliott has earned an exalted position among New       Hampshire lawyers. She has the wisdom, the patience, and the       sense of humor necessary to become one of the finest District       Court judges to sit in our lifetime.        Please do not hesitate to contact me if you would like any       further information.            Very truly yours,                                                     Gary E. Hicks,                                          Senior Associate Justice.     I am confident that Samantha's passion for the law and  dedication to the impartial administration of justice will make her an  excellent judge, and I urge my colleagues to support her nomination.   I yield the floor.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I am really pleased to be on the floor  this afternoon with my friend and colleague Senator Rob Portman to talk  about an issue that we have been working on, literally, for a decade,  and it has been a bipartisan effort to focus on energy efficiency as a  response to the energy needs in this country.   In 2011, Senator Portman and I introduced S. 1000, which was the  first version of the Energy Savings and Industrial Competitiveness Act.  Over the years, it has been known as Shaheen-Portman, when we were in  the majority on the Democratic side, or Portman-Shaheen, when the  Republicans were in the majority.   But it doesn't matter what you call it. Our bill has proposed  substantial investments in energy efficiency in this country, and what  we did in the bill was to focus on the most energy-intensive sectors in  our economy: buildings, residential and commercial, which is about a  third of our energy use; the industrial sector; and the Federal  Government. And, in the United States, the biggest user of energy is  the Federal Government.   In a Congress that is divided along partisan lines on so many issues,  energy efficiency is one priority that can bring us together on a  bipartisan, bicameral basis to get things done. I always like to say  that energy efficiency is one of those energy sources that you can  support whether you are from New England or Ohio or Wyoming. Whether  you support oil and gas or wind and solar, energy efficiency is the  fastest, cheapest way to meet our energy needs.   Our legislation has always focused on low-cost tools and adoption of  off-the-shelf technologies to save money for consumers and businesses,  to make America more energy independent, and to reduce emissions.   And over the years, over the last decade, we have had some big wins.  In 2015, President Obama signed a targeted version of Shaheen-Portman,  the Energy Efficiency Improvement Act, into law. That bill helped align  the interests of commercial building owners and their tenants to reduce  energy consumption, and it allowed certain water heaters to help with  demand response programs in rural areas.   Now, we have also made great strides through annual appropriations  and administrative actions on things like energy efficiency standards  for appliances.   Of course, we have also had some real defeats. But, though  frustrating, as those defeats were, our resolve on this bill has never  wavered, and when we reintroduced Portman-Shaheen last Congress, we  worked to again incorporate feedback from stakeholders. For 7 months,  our staffs held back-to-back meetings with constituents, stakeholders,  and committee staff to ensure the bill addressed the energy needs in  New Hampshire, Ohio, and the rest of the country.   Improving the efficiency of residential and commercial buildings  through energy-saving building codes remained central to our bill, as  did industrial energy efficiency provisions and improvements to Federal  energy efficiency programs.   We also, again, included energy efficiency bills from our colleagues.  So in that piece of legislation, we included Senators Murkowski and  Manchin's Federal Energy and Water Management Performance Act. We  included Senators Hoeven and Manchin's All-of-the-Above Federal  Building Energy Conservation Act. And we included Senator Collins and  Warner's legislation coordinating the energy retrofitting for schools.  Finally, as part of that, we included Senator Bennet and Senator  Isakson's Sensible Accounting to Value Energy Act, or the SAVE Act.   So there were a lot of reasons why a number of Members of this body  were interested in that legislation. But it was also a real savings  because, according to the American Council for an Energy Efficient  Economy, the policies from that bill would save consumers over $51  billion on their energy bills. It would reduce carbon emissions by 1.3  billion metric tons, which is the equivalent of taking 280 million cars  off the road for a year. And it would save 32 quadrillion Btus of  energy, which is nearly the total energy use of all U.S. industries for  1 year.   Now, a previous study from ACEEE also estimated that the legislation  would add more than 100,000 jobs to the economy. That bill passed the  Energy and Natural Resources Committee by a vote of 14 to 6, and it was  the fifth  [[Page S9198]]  time--fifth time--the bill passed in committee on a bipartisan basis.   Now, I am proud to say that the Energy Policy Act of 2020 that was  signed into law by President Trump at the end of last year had several  provisions from that Shaheen-Portman legislation that would streamline  efficiency for schools, increase energy efficiency for Federal data  centers, provide rebates for energy-efficient electric motors and  transformers, and support Federal energy efficiency programs. But, of  course, a piece of that bill was left on the cutting room floor, with  the voluntary building codes, where so much of the savings was really  incorporated.   But despite the success and the defeat in the last Congress, we came  into this year as determined as ever. And as part of the original Gang  of 10, Senator Portman and I teamed up to ensure that energy efficiency  was a big part of the bipartisan infrastructure framework.   We worked with Senator Manchin and our bipartisan colleagues to  incorporate much of Shaheen-Portman with funding in the Infrastructure  Investment and Jobs Act.   I am going to turn it over to Senator Portman for a few minutes so my  voice can recover, and then I will pick it up when he finishes.    Mr. President, I thank my colleague and partner in this  effort, Senator Portman. And as he pointed out, on November 15,  President Biden became the third President to sign energy efficiency  provisions from our bill into law.   Now, we still have a lot of work to do. But I just want to recognize  current and former Shaheen-Portman staff who have helped us shepherd  this bill through its many obstacles.   From my staff, I want to thank Trent Bauserman, Robert Diznoff, Ariel  Marshall, Drew Story, and Janelle DiLuccia.   From Senator Portman's staff, I want to thank Pam Thiessen, Steve  Kittredge, Pat Orth, Sarah Peery, and Lydia Denis.   I would like to ask unanimous consent to enter the names of these  current and former staff into the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:         Energy and Natural Resources Committee staff who have       played a pivotal role in the advancement of the Energy       Savings and Industrial Competitiveness Act over the years:        Brie Van Cleve, Adam Berry, Al Stayman, Sam Fowler, Renae       Black, Sarah Venuto, Angela Becker Dippman, Mary Louise       Wagoner, Joshua Sheinkman, Colin Hayes, and Brian Hughes.     Finally, I want to thank the chairs and ranking members  of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee who have played such a  pivotal role over the years: Senators Manchin, Murkowski, Cantwell and  Wyden and their staffs.   Senator Portman talked about all of the various groups who have been  involved in helping to move this legislation where we are today. So I  won't go back over those. But I will say, again, energy efficiency is a  win, win, win. It create jobs; it reduces cost to consumers; and it  lowers emissions.   And as our economy recovers and grows, the investments in energy  efficiency from our bipartisan infrastructure package are going to make  sure that we use energy smarter. And I am going continue to partner  with Senator Portman and others so we can unlock the full potential of  energy efficiency for our growing economy.   I yield the floor.
