 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I am feeling a sense of deja vu this  morning. In March, Democrats used reconciliation to pass a massive,  partisan bill that served as a cover for a collection of payoffs to  Democratic interest groups in Democratic States.   Now, just over a month later, we are facing the prospect of round 2.  Democrats are once again looking at reconciliation to pass a massive,  partisan piece of legislation that serves to cover a long wish list of  liberal priorities. The subject this time, of course, is  infrastructure--like COVID relief, a subject that Republicans are very  ready to tackle, but, just like with their COVID bill, Democrats aren't  showing a lot of interest in bipartisan cooperation. Once again, their  message seems to be ``Go along with everything we want or be completely  excluded from any part of this bill.''   As I said, Republicans would be happy to take up infrastructure  legislation. Our Nation is overdue for additional infrastructure  investment. But an infrastructure bill should be focused on actual  infrastructure: roads, bridges, airports, waterways, and digital  infrastructure like broadband.   Democrats have some of that in their bill, but they also have been  very busy expanding the definition of ``infrastructure'' to include a  whole host of Democratic priorities. One Democratic Senator tweeted:         Paid leave is infrastructure. Childcare is infrastructure.       Caregiving is infrastructure.    Well, actually, no, they are not. Neither is the Civilian Climate  Corps or community colleges or support for Big Labor. None of those  things are infrastructure.   Now, it may be that some--and I say ``some''--of Democrats'  noninfrastructure proposals are things that we should have a discussion  about here in Congress, a bipartisan discussion, but they are not  infrastructure, and they  [[Page S1954]]  don't belong in an infrastructure bill. Democrats should stop rewriting  the definition of ``infrastructure'' to suit their purposes. The word  ``infrastructure'' is not, in fact, anything that Democrats say it is.  ``Infrastructure'' has an actual meaning, and it is not childcare or  assistance for unions.   Even Democrats' actual infrastructure spending is frequently  problematic. Democrats' infrastructure proposals would cost $2.2  trillion. Less than 6 percent of that--less than 6 percent--would be  spent on roads and bridges. Under the Democrats' plan, spending on  electric vehicle promotion would exceed investments in roads, bridges,  ports, and waterways combined. That includes tax credits and rebates  for electric vehicles, measures that will primarily benefit wealthier  car buyers and leave rural States like South Dakota, where electric  vehicles remain impractical, behind.   The bill also includes a massive sum for transit and high-speed  rail--substantially more than the bill spends on highways, roads, and  bridges--despite Americans' limited interest in rail travel.   On the tax front, Speaker Pelosi has expressed her interest in  including a lifting of the current cap on State and local tax  deductions. Now, this one is really interesting. It is a very  interesting priority for Democrats, considering that repealing the SALT  deduction would mostly benefit wealthy taxpayers, including that evil 1  percent whom Democrats are always talking about. But I guess sometimes  principle has to take a back seat to keeping Democratic donors happy.   While we are talking about taxes, let's talk about how Democrats plan  to at least partially--and I say ``partially'' because a lot of this  could go on to debt--pay for this bill. Democrats would like to  partially pay for this legislation with the largest corporate tax  increase in a generation. They would sharply increase the corporate tax  rate, once again putting American companies at a disadvantage next to  their foreign competitors and threatening American jobs and wages. It  is pretty hard to think of any worse proposal right now, with our  economy still trying to recover from the effects of the pandemic.   What, in effect, you are doing when you are raising taxes  dramatically--when I say ``raising taxes dramatically,'' I am talking  the largest or highest tax rate in the developed world. We will be  leading the OECD when it comes to taxation of businesses if the  Democrats get their way and raise the tax rate on businesses from 21  percent to 28 percent. What you are doing when you do that is not  punishing some corporation; it is punishing workers who work for those  companies. This is about jobs. It is fundamentally about jobs. When you  raise taxes on businesses, it hurts jobs.   Now, there is a history of bipartisan collaboration on infrastructure  legislation. Our last major transportation infrastructure bill, the  FAST Act, was supported by both Democrats and Republicans, and it was a  remarkably successful bill. Last Congress, the Environment and Public  Works Committee here in the Senate developed bipartisan transportation  infrastructure legislation. There is absolutely no reason--no reason-- why we couldn't replicate past bipartisan success in this Congress.   The word is that next week the Democratic leader is going to bring up  a bipartisan water infrastructure bill that recently passed the Senate  Environment and Public Works Committee unanimously. I hope he will.  That should be a model for a larger infrastructure bill, not the  partisan process that Democrats embraced with their COVID legislation  and not the partisan, wasteful proposal full of noninfrastructure- related measures that Democrats have put forward.   I saw an op-ed the other day that pointed out that ``President Biden  promised to usher in a golden age of bipartisan cooperation, but  instead he is showing a reverse Midas touch--taking issues that once  united Republicans and Democrats and making them partisan and  divisive.'' Sad but true. But the President has a chance to turn that  around with infrastructure.   It is not too late for Democrats and the President to sit down at the  table with Republicans and develop a substantial, bipartisan proposal  that would address our country's infrastructure needs without spending  taxpayer dollars on wasteful or extraneous proposals.   I am encouraged that President Biden is meeting with Republicans on  infrastructure legislation, but I hope these meetings are not just for  show. The President, as we all recall, met with Republicans on COVID  legislation, too, before rejecting bipartisan cooperation. Let's hope  he will choose a different path this time.   It is not too late for the President to start fulfilling his  inauguration promise of unity and bipartisanship. He should start with  this infrastructure bill.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator  from Kansas (Mr. Marshall), the Senator from Kansas (Mr. Moran), the  Senator from Ohio (Mr. Portman), the Senator from South Dakota (Mr.  Rounds), and the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. Tillis).   Further, if present and voting, the Senator from Kansas (Mr.  Marshall) would have voted ``no.''
