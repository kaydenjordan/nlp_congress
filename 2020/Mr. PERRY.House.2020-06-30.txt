 Mr. Speaker, an efficient and effective infrastructure  system is vital to our Nation's economic well-being. It is vital to  every citizen. They realize it. That is why they are willing to pay for  it, as long as we do the responsible thing here.   But for years, Mr. Speaker, Federal policies have diverted funding  away from the core projects and created a system that incentivizes  waste, and, as a result--you can figure it out--our infrastructure is  crumbling.   The need for reform is acknowledged across the aisle, across the  spectrum. Both sides know there is an opportunity right here,  especially with this President.   Unfortunately, the majority has now squandered that opportunity for  bipartisan reform. Instead, they propose H.R. 2, which is a leftist  wish list that doubles down on the policies that brought our  infrastructure to its current deteriorated state.   In fact, the majority of the $1.5 trillion in spending under this  bill, 1,400 pages, is unrelated to the repair and build-out of our  Nation's infrastructure. Two-thirds of this spending, $1 trillion, was  created out of thin air in the 2 weeks since we had the discussion in  the Transportation Committee. It was just dropped on us. We didn't even  discuss it. After we left and marked up the bill, they added the money  and added the policy.   Moreover, the majority has failed to even propose a way to pay for  this liberal wish list, instead stating it will be paid for by deficit  spending.   We don't always get it right, but at least make an attempt.   Our Nation is $26.3 trillion in debt, $3.5 trillion of that occurring  just in the last couple of months. The majority's plan to bankroll  their liberal wish list by imperilling future generations is reckless  and threatens the very future of our Nation.   I sincerely hope this political theater will conclude shortly, Mr.  Speaker, and the majority will get serious about a serious  infrastructure package.
