 Madam President, I am saddened to have to begin my  remarks this morning by acknowledging yet another senseless act of  school violence in America.   Less than a month after the 20th anniversary of the tragic shooting  at Columbine High School, another Colorado community was shattered  yesterday afternoon. Just miles away, at the STEM School Highlands  Ranch, one student has been killed, eight others have been wounded, and  many more young lives have been changed forever at the hands of two of  their fellow students.   I know the entire Senate joins me in holding the victims of  yesterday's shooting, their families, and their entire community in our  prayers today.   Our gratitude is with the first responders of Douglas County, whose  swift action to engage the shooters saved untold lives.
