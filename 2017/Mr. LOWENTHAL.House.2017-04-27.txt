 Mr. Speaker, yesterday Representative Fitzpatrick and  I introduced a bipartisan resolution calling on the House to commit to  the removal of political gerrymandering from congressional  redistricting and to improve the public confidence in our electoral  process.   Every citizen in every State deserves to have the same ability as  citizens in States like California, Arizona, Hawaii, and Ohio, who now  have to draw their Congressional district boundaries without the  influence and gamesmanship of politics.   The political gerrymandering of our congressional districts, which  attacks at the very bedrock the right of every American to fair  representation, has seriously undermined the public's trust in our  democratic system.   Mr. Speaker, it is time to get the back room out of the ballot box  and let the people decide.                            ____________________
