 Madam President, I would like to respond to my colleague  from Texas with regard to at least one or two aspects of what he said.   He has characterized the opposition to Judge Kavanaugh as ``mob  rule.'' I don't think that is a fair characterization. The opposition  to Judge Kavanaugh is on many different levels. My colleagues on both  sides of the aisle have looked at this nomination seriously, and they  have come to opposite positions. I don't believe we are influenced,  frightened, or in any way moved by mob rule. I just don't get it.   Have I seen conduct that I think is untoward and really should not be  condoned by people who feel strongly about this issue? Of course. Do I  believe that people should have their freedom of speech limited or  stifled? No, I don't. Even if it is something I don't want to hear,  people have a right to speak. Of course, I will never condone violence  or any physical activities against anyone, including Members of  Congress. Some people have either come close to that line or have  stepped over it, but I don't condone that in any way, shape or form.   If we are truly committed to the Constitution that we have sworn to  uphold and defend, the First Amendment creates opportunities for  American citizens that others around the world long for and never see  once in their lives. Part of that is freedom of speech. Part of that is  the right to petition your government. So if some have stepped over the  line, I will not defend them when it comes to violent conduct, but in  expressing their points of view with a sign or a march or even a chant,  I have to say that it is part of our constitutional birthright, thank  goodness, in the United States of America.   Last week, I saw Dr. Christine Blasey Ford for the first time. I had  heard her name for a week or more. I had seen one photo of her in  sunglasses, but I had never seen her or heard her speak. She came  forward at great risk to herself and to her family after having been  dislocated, with her kids, from two different homes. She came here to  face the Senate Judiciary Committee and the Nation and to speak under  oath. She had absolutely nothing to gain by coming forward. She did it,  as she said, out of a sense of civic duty. She wanted to, in her own  words, be helpful so that the Senate and leaders of this Nation would  know what had happened to her before there would be any vote on the  confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. Her testimony was  credible and powerful. She answered every question and tried to be  helpful whenever she could.   I was struck by the statement from the Senator from Texas. He said  that in some way, we want to make sure that our wives and daughters are  treated fairly if they come forward with this kind of information. I  couldn't agree with him more, but we all know what happened after her  testimony. Even President Trump, before a Mississippi rally, ridiculed  and belittled Dr. Ford. After once calling her a credible witness, she  became the butt of his joke at a rally in Mississippi. That is  unfortunate.   When Dr. Ford came before us, she had nothing to hide. The  Republicans on the committee were so concerned about her testimony and  their relationship in the questioning of her that they were unwilling  to risk direct questioning as she sat in front of them. They pointedly  enlisted a woman prosecutor to do their job. The prosecutor's  examination was meandering and without any clear focus other than as an  attempt to try to discredit Dr. Ford. That Republican prosecutor failed  as Dr. Ford calmly replied to all of her questions.   It was clear, however, that despite this testimony, even despite this  hearing, many Republicans had made up their minds, as the majority  leader had characterized it, to plow right through regardless of Dr.  Ford's testimony. We hear so many tributes to Dr. Ford from the  Republican side out of one side of their mouth, and then they turn  around and say that it is a smear. A smear is a lie.    I don't believe she was lying. They can't praise her on one hand and  call her testimony a smear on the other. The majority leader did that  for 3 successive days on the floor of the U.S. Senate.   They even went so far as to schedule a committee vote before that  hearing with Dr. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh had started.   Then, last Friday, two of our colleagues, Republican Senator Jeff  Flake and Democratic Senator Chris Coons, came together and joined Dr.  Ford's call for a nonpartisan and thorough FBI investigation into the  pending allegations against Judge Kavanaugh. That should have happened  long before. Make no mistake. There would not have been a hearing with  Dr. Ford were it not for Senator Flake, a Republican Senator, demanding  it, and there would not have been an FBI investigation if he hadn't  demanded it as well. I thank him for his leadership in doing that.  Those were two reasonable requests, and I am glad that he was in a  position to make it happen when Democrats could not. It was the right  request.   Of course it would have been helpful for Senators exercising the  advice and consent role if neutral investigators at the FBI were  allowed to question all of the relevant witnesses, follow the facts  wherever they may have led, and get to the bottom of the allegations  brought by Dr. Ford, Deborah Ramirez, and Julie Swetnick.  Unfortunately, the White House and Senate Republicans were determined  not to let such an FBI investigation go forward.   A Whitehouse spokesman, Raj Shah, has now publicly acknowledged that  Senate Republicans were allowed to severely constrain the scope of the  FBI investigation. He said it. He said it publicly. He said it before  the cameras.   Senate Republicans allowed only a handful of witnesses to be  interviewed by the FBI. Deputy Press Secretary Raj Shah said: ``There  was an initial list of four''--four--``provided to us by the Senate.''  There were reportedly almost 40 corroborating or character witnesses  who have been trying to share information with the FBI. The FBI has  refused to contact them, even though their names had been provided.   Dr. Ford's and Deborah Ramirez's attorneys both sent letters  yesterday with lists of corroborating witnesses who were not  interviewed by the FBI. There is no good explanation as to why these  witnesses weren't interviewed by the FBI, nor can I explain why Dr.  Ford and Judge Kavanaugh themselves weren't interviewed. Those are  basic steps for a legitimate and credible investigation.  [[Page S6568]]    Some of my Republican colleagues have claimed that the FBI's  supplemental investigation provides no corroboration of Dr. Ford's or  Ms. Ramirez's complaints, but, of course, you will not find  corroboration if the investigation systematically excludes  corroborating witnesses.   Unfortunately, the effort by the White House and Senate Republicans  to tie the FBI's hands in the Kavanaugh investigation is part of a  pattern of concealment when it comes to the background of Brett  Kavanaugh.   The Senator from Texas says: I hope this isn't a new standard for  hearings on Supreme Court nominations. I hope it isn't either. There  are some things we have done in this particular nomination hearing that  were unheard of.   Millions of pages of Judge Kavanaugh's public service record have  been blocked from release to the public and even to the Senate. There  was a time when Senator Jeff Sessions--now Attorney General--demanded  documentation on Democratic nominees, and at that time the Democratic  chairman agreed with him. We provided all of the information requested,  as we should have. In this case, with Republicans controlling the  committee, we were limited.   We have been denied access to an entire 35-month period in Judge  Kavanaugh's White House career when he worked as one of the President's  closest advisers as the White House Staff Secretary. During that time,  he worked on controversial issues, such as same-sex marriage, abortion,  torture, and Executive power.   It is likely that there are documents in Kavanaugh's Staff Secretary  record that would impact how Senators would vote on his nomination, and  that is why they were hidden.   There was also an unprecedented partisan effort to screen and limit  the documents that the committee itself could see. I listened as the  Senator from Texas said: Dr. Ford had a partisan lawyer. Well, guess  who screened the documents that were going to go from the official  archives to our Judiciary Committee to review for the nomination of  Brett Kavanaugh. The man's name is Bill Burck. He is Kavanaugh's former  deputy. By every measure, Bill Burck is a partisan lawyer. I guess it  is no surprise. What I was surprised was to find that an individual  lawyer would have such power over a constitutional provision of advice  and consent.    Overall, when all is said and done, after the denials from the White  House of certain records, after the claims of Executive privilege,  after Bill Burck went through and screened what he considered to be  appropriate and inappropriate documents for the American people to see,  less than 10 percent of Judge Kavanaugh's White House record has been  disclosed.   Those documents are going to come out some day, and those who are  quickly voting for him now without reading them run the risk that they  are making a mistake, which they are going to have to explain at a  later time.   Just yesterday we learned from a FOIA lawsuit that the National  Archives has hundreds of documents concerning Brett Kavanaugh's work in  the White House on warrantless surveillance programs. We will not see  those documents before tomorrow's vote. The White House apparently  fears their contents and prefers to plow through.   Why has so much of Judge Kavanaugh's record been concealed? Most  likely because these documents contradict what he said. We have seen a  pattern with Judge Kavanaugh from his Senate testimony in 2004, 2006,  and again last month. When he is asked about controversial issues that  he has been involved with in the past, he tries to deny or downplay  them. He has done this repeatedly when testifying about matters he  worked on at the White House, including the rules governing detention  of combatants; warrantless surveillance; controversial judicial  nominations, such as Pryor, Pickering, and Haynes; communicating with  the press during the Starr investigation; and his work with Manny  Miranda, a Republican Senate staffer who stole documents from  Democratic Senators' computers, including my own, and shared them with  Brett Kavanaugh when he was working at the White House.   On each issue, we have seen documents and reports showing that Judge  Kavanaugh had far more involvement than his testimony let on. On issue  after issue, Judge Kavanaugh's sworn testimony was either misleading or  false.   This is a judge who claims that words matter. He says that he is a  strict textualist who holds other people accountable for their words,  but when it comes to his own words, he is happy to take liberties and  refuses to take responsibility. We have been forewarned of what we can  expect if he is given a lifetime appointment on the Court.   We saw this pattern again last week when he was asked about his high  school yearbook and excessive drinking. They were legitimate questions  that were relevant to the sexual assault allegations at hand. Many of  Kavanaugh's answers to these questions simply weren't credible. His  explanation of things he wrote in the yearbook didn't pass the laugh  test. Multiple people who knew him and socialized with him quickly and  publicly rebutted his denial that he ever drank, in their words, ``to  the point that it would be impossible for him to state with any degree  of certainty that he remembered everything that he did.''   I was particularly struck when Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota  explained that she understands alcohol abuse because her father was an  alcoholic and then asked Judge Kavanaugh if he had ever blacked out.  Instead of responding, Kavanaugh said: ``Have you?'' Conservative  columnist Jennifer Rubin has written: ``It was a moment of singular  cruelty and disrespect.''   It has been hard to take Judge Kavanaugh's testimony at his word on  matters both large and small. That matters a lot when we are talking  about a nominee's judgment, temperament, and integrity.   Judge Kavanaugh's judicial record and his academic writings raise  even more concerns. Not only did he check the box on President Trump's  litmus test of opposition to the Affordable Care Act and Roe v. Wade,  his judicial opinions consistently find ways to favor big business and  undermine protection for workers, consumers, women, and the  environment.   He claims to be a textualist, but he has a habit of creatively  defining words. In the Agriprocessors case, which I asked him about  directly in the hearing, his dissent abandoned the text of the  controlling statute. Instead, he borrowed a definition from another  statute in order to argue against the right of slaughterhouse workers  to vote to form a union. When I asked Judge Kavanaugh whether he ever  worked in a job himself that was dirty and dangerous, as dangerous as a  slaughterhouse, he told me he used to cut grass and worked one summer  in construction.   Look at his dissents in the White Stallion and Mingo Logan cases,  where the judge gave his own definitions to key terms in the Clean Air  and Clean Water Acts--so much for stare decisis.   Judge Kavanaugh claims he follows precedent, but as we have seen in  case after case, he goes his own way.   Look at his interpretation in the Supreme Court's 2008 Heller  decision. Judge Kavanaugh believes the Supreme Court created a history  and tradition test for considering challenges to gun safety laws. This  test would have courts ignore the public safety impact of gun laws.  Judge Kavanaugh admitted that he is ``a lonely voice in reading Heller  that way.''   His approach would put at risk many commonsense laws, such as keeping  guns out of the hands of domestic abusers. Judge Kavanaugh is not a  lonely voice on gun safety; he is an extreme and frightening voice on  gun safety.   After he wrote a dissent laying out his interpretation of the Heller  precedent, a majority panel of DC Circuit judges--all of them  Republican appointees--said this of his interpretation: ``Unlike our  dissenting colleague, we read Heller straightforwardly.''   Judge Kavanaugh's reading of Heller may be music to the ears of the  gun lobby, but it is manipulating precedent, nothing else.   Judge Kavanaugh's claim that he follows precedent is also  contradicted by his view of the Supreme Court decision Morrison v.  Olson. Rather than admit the majority's decision in the case still  holds, Judge Kavanaugh clings to Justice Scalia's dissent, which lays  out the so-called ``unitary executive theory'' of Presidential power.   Judge Kavanaugh has been explicit that he would overturn Morrison.  Let's  [[Page S6569]]  be clear. While Judge Kavanaugh may claim that he will scrupulously  follow precedent, he has shown he is willing to overturn it when it  suits him. I have cited just a few examples.   Also particularly troubling is this judge's view of Presidential  power. Judge Kavanaugh wrote a striking passage in the Seven-Sky  decision, dissenting from the majority's upholding of the Affordable  Care Act. He wrote: ``Under the Constitution, the President may decline  to enforce a statute that regulates private individuals when the  President deems the statute unconstitutional, even if a court has held  or would hold the statute constitutional.''   This is a truly breathtaking claim of Presidential power, a claim  particularly problematic at this moment in history.   Then there is Judge Kavanaugh's evolving view on investigations of  sitting Presidents. When he was working for Ken Starr and investigating  President Clinton, he was pretty ferocious. But in 2008, he gave a  speech and wrote a law review article arguing that sitting Presidents  should be immunized from criminal investigations and civil suit. This  was after Judge Kavanaugh spent a period of time working in the Bush  White House.   He claims that he has an open mind on the constitutionality of  criminal investigations of sitting Presidents, but consider what he  wrote in that law review article in the Minnesota Law Review:         If the President does something dastardly, the impeachment       process is available. No single prosecutor, judge, or jury       should be able to accomplish what the Constitution assigns to       Congress.    These are not the words of a judge with an open mind.   It was a telling moment when Judge Kavanaugh at his hearing would not  answer whether he believed a President should comply with a grand jury  subpoena.   Here is the reality: We have to consider why this President chose  this Supreme Court nominee at this moment in history when the Mueller  investigation is closing in.   Just a few weeks ago, Judge Kavanaugh himself said: ``The Supreme  Court must never be viewed as a partisan institution.'' But the  testimony and demeanor of Judge Kavanaugh last Thursday belies any  claim he makes of nonpartisanship.   I can understand emotion and indignation from Judge Kavanaugh when  one considers the gravity of the charges against him and the pain he  and his family must feel, but there was fire in his eyes when he read  the words he assured us he had personally written.   Benjamin Wittes has been a colleague of Brett Kavanaugh. He has  published his writings, and he even lent his name as a character  reference for the judge. He called Judge Kavanaugh's performance before  the Senate Judiciary Committee ``a howl of rage.'' Wittes went on to  describe Kavanaugh's partisanship as ``raw, undisguised, naked and  conspiratorial.''   Charlie Sykes, a conservative commentator, said of Kavanaugh's  statement before the committee last Thursday: ``Even if you support  Brett Kavanaugh . . . that was breathtaking as an abandonment of any  pretense of having a judicial temperament.''   Judge Kavanaugh abandoned any veneer of neutrality last week before  our committee.   Out of one side of his mouth, he claimed that he bore ``no ill will''  toward Dr. Ford. Then he called her allegations ``a calculated and  orchestrated political hit,'' citing ``apparent pent-up anger about  President Trump and the 2016 election and revenge on behalf of the  Clintons.'' He even threatened Democrats when he said: ``What goes  around comes around.''   In my 20 years on the Judiciary Committee, I have never heard  anything like that--or even close to that--from a judicial nominee. It  is hard to imagine how a nominee who has displayed such raw  partisanship could then claim to serve as a neutral umpire on the  Supreme Court. Judge Kavanaugh, through his testimony, has called his  own impartiality into serious doubt.   Retired Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens, a man who is  respected for his integrity and service to this Nation, said this week  that the performance by Judge Kavanaugh shows he should not serve on  the Supreme Court. I agree. At a time when our President plumbs the  depths of bad behavior on a daily basis, we should not allow the  highest Court in our land to now sink to that same standard in their  ranks.   From a broader perspective, let's be clear what is at stake in this  decision. We are at a moment in American history where our system of  checks and balances is being profoundly tested. We have a President who  has shown disrespect for the rule of law and the role of an independent  judiciary. It is likely the Supreme Court will soon consider  fundamental questions about Presidential authority and accountability.  With so much at stake, we should not confirm a nominee to the Court  unless we are sure of that nominee's credibility, integrity,  independence, and judgment.   Serious questions have been raised about Brett Kavanaugh. Dr. Ford's  testimony was serious and credible. When I asked her directly what  degree of certainty do you have that Brett Kavanaugh was your attacker,  Dr. Ford answered, without hesitation: ``100 percent.''   I believe her.   Judge Kavanaugh's testimony was simply not credible. From his  contrived explanations of his embarrassing yearbook entries, to his ``I  love beer'' declarations, he was a sharp contrast to Dr. Ford's  measured accounting of a horrible day in her life she cannot forget.   I had hoped the FBI would be able to provide us with information to  resolve unanswered questions, but they can't do their job if their  hands are tied. When the Republicans in the committee and the White  House decided to limit the number of witnesses, unfortunately, the  investigation could not be completed to meet professional standards.   I will say this to my colleagues. We have to think about what it  would mean if Judge Kavanaugh were to be confirmed to the Supreme Court  with credible sexual assault allegations against him. Specifically,  what it would mean to the millions of women across America who are  survivors of sexual assault--women who have been scared to come forward  with their stories for fear of being mocked, ridiculed, and shunned.  What would it mean for them to see Brett Kavanaugh sitting on that  bench in that Court across the street, day after day, for decades,  casting what may be the deciding vote on cases that profoundly affect  their rights. It would shake the confidence of millions of Americans in  the integrity of our Supreme Court. We should not take that risk.   There are other qualified lawyers besides Brett Kavanaugh who could  be nominated for this vacant seat--nominees whose legal views I may not  agree with but who do not have serious questions about their fitness  for office. If there are serious questions about a nominee's  temperament, credibility, or judgment--as there clearly are for Judge  Brett Kavanaugh--we owe a duty of caution. We should give the benefit  of the doubt to protect the integrity of the Supreme Court.   With so much at stake, we should not confirm a nominee to the Court  unless we are sure the nominee's qualifications are beyond question. I  do not have that confidence in Brett Kavanaugh. I will vote no on his  nomination.    Thank you, Mr. President.   Let me say at the outset that I would like to set the record straight  on the question of the FBI interview, which has been raised repeatedly  by Members on the other side of the aisle.   It was our request from the start, when we heard the complaints of  Dr. Ford and her allegations, that there be a thorough FBI  investigation. On the Democratic side, we asked for that repeatedly  from the Republican majority. It wasn't until Senator Flake and some of  his Republican colleagues made a point of saying they wouldn't move to  go forward without the FBI investigation that it finally was agreed to.   Let me also add that statements have been made publicly by the public  spokesman at the White House about how the witnesses were chosen for  this FBI investigation. According to Mr. Shah, who works in the White  House, he told us that a list of witnesses was sent by Senate  Republicans to the White House, and they were included in their  request. That is not the investigation we were looking for. We were  hoping the FBI would revert to its professional status and interview  all of the witnesses who are relevant. Certainly, among those relevant  witnesses would have been Dr. Ford herself who could have been  questioned under penalty of criminal prosecution if she misled or lied  to the FBI, who could have provided substantial corroborative  information. She was never called on. Neither was Judge Kavanaugh by  the FBI.   Dr. Ford provided eight different witnesses whom she thought should  be called to back up her side of the story, not a single one of them  was called by the FBI. Ms. Ramirez suggested 20 witnesses be called on  by the FBI on her behalf, and not one of them was called.   This was not the FBI investigation which we sought, nor does it clear  the charges against Kavanaugh that were raised by Dr. Ford. In fact, it  was a scant interview that involved some 10 witnesses in a matter of  just a few days with a limited roster of people who were going to be  questioned.   Let me speak to the matter at hand in a larger context. I have been  in public life for a few years, but I have never seen the public  reaction to this particular nomination and the hearings leading up to  it that I have seen in this case.   I went back to Illinois last week on Friday. Before I could get off  the airplane at Midway Airport, people were talking to me--just  passengers at random, about what had happened the day before with Dr.  Ford and Judge Kavanaugh testifying before our committee. The same  thing happened with cab drivers, the doorman at the hotel holding an  umbrella in the rain and talking to me about the testimony that was  given to the Judiciary Committee. For the next 3 days, everywhere I  turned, every person had a comment to make. America was tuned in and  watching carefully because they knew how important this hearing was. It  wasn't just the nomination for someone to serve on the Supreme Court.  It was critically important to Americans to know who would be that  person, what their views were when it came to the health of women, the  protection of our health insurance, our privacy, our right to vote. It  also was very clear that we held this hearing in the context of a  national debate on sexual harassment and sexual violence. Is it any  surprise that this explosive issue, which has touched corporate  boardrooms, our churches, sports, Congress, has now been raised in our  debate over a nomination to our highest Court?   I ask my colleagues: Is there a single one of us in the last 2 weeks  who has not had an experience with someone coming forward, either in  writing or in person, to tell you of their experience when it came to  sexual harassment and sexual violence?   Just a few minutes ago, I read the latest letters we received in our  office. Two women from my State of Illinois told me in their letters  they were saying for the first time what actually happened to them many  years ago and how much they identified with Dr. Ford and what she had  gone through. That is a fact of life.   The fact that this touched a nerve with so many Americans, and  particularly women who have gone through this experience, should put  this whole debate in context. It should not be cheapened or lessened by  political charges. We ought to understand the gravity of this debate in  light of the cultural change we are now facing in America.   This afternoon, we have reached that day of reckoning. Those of us  who count votes for a living know how this will end, but I want to make  it clear there is something we need to remember. One of the closest  votes in the history of the Supreme Court will occur this afternoon  with Judge Kavanaugh's nomination. One has to go back 137 years in  American history to find a closer vote for a Supreme Court Justice.  That portrays the seriousness with which this matter has been  considered and undertaken by Members of the Senate and how divided we  are on this nomination.   I want to ask my colleagues not just to reflect on this afternoon but  to reflect on tomorrow. What about the future of this Supreme Court and  this important critical institution in our Constitution?   Six years ago, in the days before the NFIB v. Sebelius decision  deciding the fate of the Affordable Care Act, a Pew Research poll  showed that the public approval of the Supreme Court had reached an  all-time low. Citizens United and Bush v. Gore had branded the Supreme  Court as a political tool in the eyes of most Americans. Chief Justice  Roberts stepped in and wrote a decision in that case which infuriated  conservatives but brought momentary credibility to the Court.   Filling this critical Kennedy vacancy with Judge Kavanaugh will again  raise the question about Supreme Court politics.   Chief Justice Roberts, are you watching?   What can we expect from this newest Member of the Court, Brett  Kavanaugh? After his contentious nomination process, Clarence Thomas  gave us 10 years of brooding silence on the Bench of the Supreme Court.  What can we expect from this new Justice? Will he be the soup kitchen  volunteer or the Federalist Society favorite?   Will he be the man who raged at the Clintons and promised revenge for  his ordeal or the judge who impressed Senator Collins as more moderate  than most of us on this side of the aisle ever found him?   Will he be a Justice forever grateful to President Trump who  nominated him, or a Justice who honors the rule of law more than any  political leader or political party?   And what about this Senate? What should the next Supreme Court  vacancy look like? Will we continue to follow the Merrick Garland plow- it-through playbook of judicial appointments at any cost, freezing out  a nominee to the Supreme Court for almost 1  [[Page S6694]]  year, abandoning the blue-slip process in the Senate Judiciary  Committee, ignoring American Bar Association ratings, overturning rules  protecting debate, concealing documents, tweeting confidential  background investigation reports? When we sweep aside all of the rules  and traditions of the Senate Judiciary Committee just to pile up more  and more Republican appointments to the Court, what is left?   Thomas More, in ``A Man for All Seasons,'' said famously:         And when the last law was down and the Devil turned round       on you, where would you hide . . . the laws all being flat?        And if you cut them down . . . do you really think you       could stand upright in the winds that would blow then?    So will we establish and reestablish rules and procedures that show  mutual respect for one another as Senators and respect for this body we  are honored to serve? I sincerely hope that conversation begins and  begins soon.   I want to say a word about the leaders on the Judiciary Committee.  Chuck Grassley is my friend. He has been my friend for a long time. We  do a lot of legislation together. We have a difference of political  views. He is a loyal Republican; I am a loyal Democrat. We have  adjoining States, and we find some things that we can work on in  common. I want to say personally to Senator Grassley: Thank you for  your leadership on this committee. I think there are moments when the  White House and even your staff got the best of you. But I trust Chuck  Grassley in terms of where this committee is going. You have it within  your power to restore the traditions of the Senate Judiciary Committee,  and I hope that you will. I will join you in that effort.   I want to say a word about Dianne Feinstein too. She has been the  subject of more attacks by my colleagues than I have ever heard any  Member face in the Senate. It is just not fair. Dianne Feinstein is a  woman of integrity. She is a person who is caring, and she has given a  major part of her life in public service at so many different levels.   Some of the charges and innuendo that I have heard on the floor of  the Senate are unbefitting this body, and she does not deserve them. I  thank Senator Collins yesterday for specifically saying that in her  remarks. I couldn't be more happy than to join her in those comments.   I want to say a word about protesting and mob rule. I will tell you  that if you believe in freedom of speech and our right as citizens to  petition our government, then you accept some tough consequences. There  are things that are said and done in the name of free speech that you  may not agree with. Violence is never acceptable; let me make that  clear. But the decision that is about to be made in the United States  is not being made by a mob. It is not mob rule. It is a decision made  by men and women of the Senate who are acting in accordance with the  U.S. Constitution.   One last point on the subject--this is one that I always remind my  colleagues and even my opponents of. I believe the hottest ring in hell  is reserved for those who attack our children and our families. If you  want to take me out on an issue, so be it. Leave my family, my kids  alone. That ought to be a rule on both sides of the aisle.   There is another issue we need to face squarely: Will victims of  sexual violence be more or less likely to step forward and tell their  stories after this high-profile political battle ends?   To Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, to your husband and your children: I  will never forget your brave testimony last Thursday. You gave new  meaning to the term civic duty. You spoke not just for yourself but for  millions of sexual violence victims who will never ever have that  opportunity. I am sorry--genuinely sorry--for the pain that you and  your family endured. And I am sorry you were mocked by President Trump  at his rally in Mississippi last Tuesday.   The Washington Post reported:         The President laid into Ford with the ruthlessness of an       attack dog and the pacing of a stand-up comedian. The crowd       roared with laughter and applause.    No one could have been surprised with the President's performance.  And when I hear repeated over and over again on the other side of the  aisle ``We wanted to treat her just as we would have our wife or our  daughter to be treated,'' that certainly didn't happen when it came to  the President's comments. We owe it to our wives, daughters,  granddaughters, and all the women and men in this country who have been  victimized to treat them with respect, not ridicule. We owe it to these  victims to listen, learn, and stand with them as they relive their  shattering experiences.   I believe the debate over this nomination has created a stronger  force in our Nation for justice for victims of sexual violence, and I  hope those who step forward know that they are not alone. Thank you for  your courage.   Tomorrow is another day. We are blessed to live in a democracy that  protects our freedoms and gives our citizens the last word at the  polling place.   Today, I will cast my vote in the Senate in opposition to the  nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Manpreet  Teji,  [[Page S6702]]  a judiciary staffer from my office, be granted floor privileges for the  remainder of the day.
