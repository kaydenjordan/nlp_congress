 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be recognized  for 2 minutes.    Mr. President, I am from Georgia. Last night in Georgia,  Alabama, and throughout the Southeast, one of the worst tornadoes went  through that has ever gone through in history.   Twenty-three Alabamians were killed last night; a number of homes in  Georgia were wiped out and ruined. I don't think we had a death, but  they had 23 in Alabama. The tragedies we are having in the Southeast  continue to rise.   In a few weeks, we are going to ask the Senate to pass a disaster  bill to reinstate some of the agricultural money for the last 2 years  for our pecan crop, our blueberry crop, and others.   On behalf of the people of Georgia, I just want to say that we are  having a tough time. Our agricultural community is in the most  difficult time it could possibly be. We are going to ask the Senate to  work with us to find appropriations that would make sense to bring back  those pecan and blueberry farmers in Georgia, Alabama, and  [[Page S1617]]  South Carolina and to deal with the agricultural emergency we have had.   We also say a prayer of thanksgiving for the great opportunity we  have to live in the Southeast but also recognize that we are now ground  zero for tornadoes and those types of death-defying acts that are  taking place. We want all of the people in Georgia and Alabama to know  that our prayers go out to them. We will do everything we can to make  them right.   Thank you.   I yield back my time.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of our time  and call the previous question.
