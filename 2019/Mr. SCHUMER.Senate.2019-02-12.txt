 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, last night, the country heard some good  news. The members of the conference committee announced a tentative  agreement to keep the government open past Friday as well as provide  additional border security. It was welcome news.   All on the conference committee worked very hard and should be  commended for their efforts. I talked to them regularly. Everyone  wanted to get something done, and everyone wanted to avoid a government  shutdown. While the details are still being hammered out, the tentative  agreement represents a path forward for our country--away from another  round of fraught negotiations up against a government funding cliff,  away from a dreaded government shutdown.   Over the past few months, we have been lurching from one manufactured  crisis to another. It would be a wonderful thing for this Congress to  pass bills that settle the budget issues for the rest of this year and  for the country to finally move past. Hopefully, that is what this  agreement will portend. Hopefully, this agreement means that there will  not be another government shutdown on Friday--sparing the country of  another nightmare of furloughed Federal employees, snarled airports,  and economic hardship. Hopefully, it means that we will pass not only  the DHS appropriations bill but all six other appropriations bills-- done in a bipartisan way--that have been caught in the tangle of these  negotiations since last year.   Each of these bills is a product of bipartisan consensus. Each  contains more support for programs to help the American people-- additional funding for infrastructure, housing, money to combat the  opioid crisis, and more. We should pass these appropriations bills  alongside this agreement on DHS.   These months of shutdown politics must come to an end. We now have a  bipartisan proposal to accomplish our goals, better secure the border,  and avoid another senseless government shutdown. I don't know the  details, but the parameters of this are good. So I thank the members of  the conference committee.   I would make one more point. I urge President Trump to sign this  agreement. We must not have a rerun of what happened a few months back,  whereby legislators--Democratic and Republican, House and Senate-- agreed, and President Trump pulled the rug out from under the agreement  and caused the shutdown. If he opposes this agreement, the same thing  could happen again. We don't need it. So I strongly urge the President  to sign this agreement. No one gets everything one wants in these  agreements. The President must sign it and not cause another shutdown.                            ____________________     Madam President, on another matter, late last week, I  had the privilege of addressing an audience at the Newseum about the  current challenges facing the free press in America.   I ask unanimous consent that my remarks be printed in the Record  after my remarks here.   One of the most significant challenges the press faces, of course, is  economic. Besieged by a fractured media landscape and rapidly changing  technology, newspapers have been forced to adapt or die. Some have  adapted, but many have died.   One area in which it is particularly troubling to me is in smaller  markets in midsized and smaller cities. In those areas, local  newspapers have been the glue that keeps communities informed and  stitched together. I have seen it. In cities in Upstate New York-- small- and middle-sized--big companies have left, and some of the  community banks have been bought up by major large banks. The things  that keep a community together are greatly deteriorating. Newspapers  are one of the few glues these communities have. They are vital--way  beyond the profit and loss that they might make. The external benefits  of these newspapers, as the economists would say, are large, but they  are in trouble because of all the economic issues I mentioned.   Now there is a new threat on the horizon. A few weeks ago, a hedge  fund, known as the ``destroyer of newspapers,'' announced a bid to take  over Gannett, which, in addition to USA Today, publishes a lot of  small- and medium-sized newspapers and four important papers in my  State, those being the Democrat and Chronicle in Rochester, the Press &  Sun in Binghamton, the Poughkeepsie Journal, the Journal News in  Westchester, and newspapers in Elmira and Ithaca.   This morning, on the front page of the Washington Post, there is an  article about the business practices of  [[Page S1177]]  Alden and its subsidiaries. Essentially, Alden's strategy is to buy up  newspapers, cut staff, and then sell the commercial real estate of  newsrooms and printing presses for profit. The article quotes several  experts who have said of Alden:         They are the ultimate cash flow mercenary. They want to       find cash flow and bleed it to death.    Their principle is ``no new investment and sell off what you can  while you can,'' according to analysts who have studied it.   An analysis of the newspapers owned by Alden revealed that it cut  newspaper staff at more than twice the rate of its competitors. In all  likelihood, when it sells the real estate, the vast majority of the  money does not go to revitalizing newspapers, as a newspaper itself  would do when it sells real estate; it goes elsewhere. For Alden Global  Capital, the hedge fund, the acquisition and streamlining of Gannett  papers might increase its profits a couple of percentage points, but  the loss of the Press & Sun and the Democrat and Chronicle would be  incalculable.   Let me ask the American people and every one of my colleagues here:  What is more important--having our newspapers go on, which is so  important to local communities, or having a hedge fund raise its market  profits by five points, if it is public, or by a certain amount? What  is more important? I would argue: the newspapers.   The Gannett consortium was already the result of a consolidated news  business, with one reporter working multiple beats and placing stories  in multiple newspapers. I have seen that in Upstate New York. What was  already an overburdened, undersourced operation now faces potential  annihilation by an indifferent media conglomerate that is backed by an  even more indifferent hedge fund.   What do we do about this?   I don't know how to solve the broader economic problem for  newspapers, big and small. I hope there is a solution. The only  antidote to these problems, as I have seen, is the rarer and rarer  presence of generous, civic-minded families and individuals who own  news outlets for the right reasons, not simply to maximize profits-- although profit is still important--but because they feel an obligation  to advance journalism for the greater benefit of us all. Everyone has  seen this work at flagship newspapers, but the family model has worked  in smaller markets as well, including at several papers in Upstate New  York.   So I would propose that charitably inclined institutions and  individuals should begin to think of journalism as a philanthropic  endeavor. If it becomes a worthy endeavor to buy a local newspaper and  preserve its size and independence--just as it is a worthy endeavor to  support the local hospital, school, charity--many more might consider  doing it.   As Americans, we must continue to support the First Amendment--the  freedom and viability of the press. Our democracy depends on it.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:         [CES Prepared Remarks--Feb. 7, 2019]                       Journalists Are Not the Enemy         Good afternoon everyone. Thank you, Gene Policinski, for       that kind introduction and for your help in hosting. Thank       you to Marjorie for your work at the Globe, your work on this       event, and allowing me to cut you in line to give remarks.        Thank you also to Linda Henry for the invitation to address       you today. It's a good time to be a Henry. Much to my       chagrin, the Red Sox were champions again this year, which--      no matter how many times it has happened--will always be a       bit bemusing to us Yankee fans with 27 championships. It       stings, but Sox fans: you have a long way to go.        I didn't want to miss the opportunity to be here with you       this afternoon, because, as you all know, I have such respect       and admiration for the press. At the Al Smith Dinner a few       years back, President Obama joked that I brought the press       along with me as my ``loved ones.'' And just as I do with my       loved ones, I worry about the future of the media; the future       of journalism.        We live in a time of immense challenge: economic, global,       political. The institutions of our democracy are being tested       in ways they haven't been tested since the early days of the       Republic. If ever there were a time for a vigorous Fourth       Estate--to ferret out the facts, inform a divided nation, and       hold power to account--it's right now.        But journalism, in its moment of maximum import, is also at       its moment of maximum peril. Besieged by large economic       forces and rapidly changing technology, journalism has been       forced to adapt or die. Some have adapted; many have died. On       top of these economic forces, the media faces a relentless       campaign of de-legitimization waged by the most powerful       office in the free world.        This afternoon, I'd like to discuss both of these       challenges with you; what they mean for our country and what       we might do about them.        I want to begin by talking about the concerted effort to       destroy the credibility of most news organizations.        To do that, I have to wind back the clock a bit to the       start of the Internet era, which allowed the media universe       to splinter into a near-infinite number of outlets, some of       which do important niche reporting, but many of which are       hyper-partisan, whose sole purpose is to market news to a       specific political demographic.        It used to be in America that we had a national town hall       every night at 6 o'clock with the ABC, CBS, and NBC evening       newscasts. You watched CBS if you liked Cronkite, or NBC if       you preferred Huntley-Brinkley. But regardless of what       channel we chose, we all got the same information; everyone       started with the same common fact base that helped us relate       to one another at the water cooler.        The same went for major newspapers. As Arthur Miller       quipped, ``a good newspaper, I suppose, is a nation talking       to itself.'' Our nation is no longer talking to itself--we're       not even speaking the same language.        1987 was a pivot point, when the Reagan FCC withdrew the       Fairness Doctrine. No longer were stations compelled to       report controversial issues in a manner that was honest,       equitable and balanced. The withdrawal of the Fairness       Doctrine took the leash off, allowing stations of any       political bent to report the news as they saw fit.        This was taken advantage of by folks from every dot on the       political spectrum, but figures like Rupert Murdoch, Roger       Ailes, Andrew Breitbart and Steve Bannon took perhaps the       greatest advantage. They realized they could cultivate a       network of partisan media outlets, walking right up to--and       sometimes crossing--the line of blurring fact and fiction.        Enter President Trump: stage right. Fueled by his derision       for all but the most flattering reporting, President Trump       has taken it one step further.        His goal, it seems, is to discredit the media altogether as       a check on his power, to say to the American people that       newspapers are irrelevant, ``the failing New York Times;''        that all journalists are evil, ``the enemy of the people;''        that virtually all news is false, ``fake news.''        Let's be honest here: the president tells more lies than       any president we have ever seen.        When the press tells the truth, when the press speaks truth       to power, when the press does its job: President Trump can't       handle it. He calls it fake.        When President Trump labels something ``fake news,'' it is       inevitably critical of him, and most often, true.        Perhaps the president's penchant for calling stories       ``fake'' could have been ignored or viewed with appropriate       skepticism 25 years ago. But because there is an entire       ecosystem of partisan news outlets and columnists that are in       total fealty to the president, who don't value the free press       as much as their own political ideology or profit--the ``fake       news'' contagion has spread, beyond even the president's most       ardent supporters, for a number of reasons.        We live in an age during which nearly all institutions are       mistrusted. Faith in the news media, historically one of the       most trusted institutions, has declined like so many others--      the government, the Church, corporate America, schools and       universities.        But if the public, broadly speaking, loses all faith in the       media--if the public comes to believe that all news is fake--      that's the beginning of the end of America as we know it.        So I want to speak directly to the members of the media in       the audience and those who may be watching . . .        Your job is more important than ever.        It's important to rebut alternative facts with facts.        It's important to correct the president's lies.        And it is equally important that you not let the president       wear you down or throw you off course . . . to think--maybe       we should tone it down a little, maybe we can let that one       go, when in fact it should be the opposite.        Dictators throughout the course of history have learned       that the best way to consolidate power is to capture or       totally discredit the news media.        Your mission goes beyond rebutting Trump's lies, important       as that may be. Your mission is intertwined with the future       of our democracy.        President Johnson said that ``an informed mind is the       guardian genius of democracy.'' That's what good journalism       does. It informs. It establishes truth. It is like a       guardrail for the country--keeping us from swerving off the       road and over a cliff        At a time when those fundamental principles are under       attack--including the very nature of truth--keeping the media       strong, keeping the media free, keeping the media alive . . .       has never been more important.        So I salute you. You are doing a noble thing. You just have       to just stay the course, charge ahead, undaunted and       undeterred.  [[Page S1178]]       Don't flag or lose faith. The Trump presidency has       reinvigorated a level of interest in journalism not seen       since Watergate. At the CUNY Journalism school, the number of       applications last year were 40% higher than they were the       year before. So long as journalists continue to do their jobs       without fear or favor, I truly believe that the president's       assault on the free press will not succeed.        Now, the second challenge facing journalism is also       menacing, also existential: the arrival of the internet--the       Huffington Post and Buzzfeed, followed closely by Twitter,       Facebook, and social media--brought an end to the traditional       business model for newspapers. Consumers expect their news       instantaneously, and they often expect it to be free.       Subscriptions and newsstand sales fell. Craigslist became the       preferred destination for classified ads, the most reliable       revenue stream for newspapers. Facebook, Twitter, and Google       gobbled up the remaining ad revenue as venues for the       journalism of others. I submit to you that it is not an       accident that Facebook's home page is called the ``news       feed.''        Like a boat taking on water faster than it can be bailed       out: newsrooms shrunk, the industry consolidated, and many       once-revered papers simply sunk.        None of this is ``news'' as would you say--but the collapse       of the newspaper's business model is still claiming victims.       One area where it's particularly troubling to me is in       smaller markets, in mid-sized and smaller cities. The most       striking example I've seen is in upstate New York. Just a few       years ago, the major newspaper in a town of 70,000 had       fifteen full-time reporters. Now it has two.        For generations, local newspapers and television stations       have been the glue that keeps small communities informed and       stitched together. In a big city, there are many interlocking       layers of civic life: social clubs, religious groups, sports       teams, municipal organizations. But in many smaller cities       and towns, the local paper is the most robust civic       organization left in that community.        When Kodak was in Rochester, it looked out for its civic       life, its charities, its communities. But there is no more       Kodak. When the community bank headquartered in Elmira was       purchased, a national bank came in and took much less       interest in the community life of Elmira. When Walmart came       in and supplanted every clothing and hardware store all       across upstate, it eroded both the finances and social fabric       of those communities. Local newspapers are one of the few       institutions left in smaller cities and towns. Just       anecdotally, cities with strong, successful papers--like       Buffalo with the Buffalo News--tend to do better economically       and those papers help foster a strong sense of community and       connectedness.        So I have a particular concern when smaller papers and       smaller television networks are forced to downsize,       reorganize, or close.        Unfortunately, in my home state of New York, an already       bleak picture just got bleaker. Last week, a hedge fund known       as the ``destroyer of newspapers'' announced a bid to take       over Gannet, which, in addition to USA Today, publishes four       important papers in my state, all in mid-size to smaller       cities: the Rochester Democrat and Chronicle, the Binghamton       Press & Sun, the Poughkeepsie Journal, and the Journal News       in the Lower Hudson Valley.        For Alden Global Capital, the hedge fund, the acquisition       and ``streamlining'' of Gannet newspapers might increase its       profits a couple of percentage points. But the loss of the       Binghamton Press & Sun and the Rochester Democrat & Chronicle       would be incalculable.        The Gannet consortium was already the result of a       consolidated news business, with one reporter working       multiple beats and placing stories in multiple newspapers.       What was already an overburdened, under-resourced operation       now faces potential annihilation by an indifferent media       conglomerate backed by an even more indifferent hedge fund.        And in my view, losing a newspaper in Rochester is even       worse than losing one in Dallas. I am left angry and       searching for answers. What do we do about this?        I don't know how to solve the broader economic problem for       newspapers big and small. Federal support is problematic       beyond NPR and PBS. The press must remain adversarial; acting       and appearing independent.        The only antidote to these problems I have seen is the       rarer and rarer presence of generous, civic-minded families       and individuals who own news outlets for the right reasons--      not simply to maximize profits, although profit is still       important, but because they feel an obligation to advance       journalism for the greater benefit of us all. Newspapers that       belong to families or trusts have been some of the few to       survive the last two decades, isolated in part from market       pressures.        Everyone has seen this work at places like the Globe, the       Times, and the Post, but the family model has worked in       smaller markets as well. The Watertown Times, for example, is       owned by the Johnson family and it does as much for the North       Country in upstate New York as any institution.        I would propose, to you and your broader audience, that       charitably-inclined institutions and individuals should begin       to think of journalism as a philanthropic endeavor. The       plight of the Fourth Estate should move the conscience of the       nation. If it became a worthy endeavor to buy a local paper       and preserve it's size and independence--just as it's a       worthy endeavor to support the local hospital, school, or       charity--many more might consider doing it.        The Guardian, for example, operates on a reader-donation       model--which funds its entire online presence. Journalism is       a public good. From philanthropists to average readers: we       should all start treating it as such.        This is just one idea. I'm sure there are better ones. God       knows I don't have the answers. But from where I stand, I see       the same problems that you all understand so well, and I am       pained for solutions.        Because, throughout history, the Fourth Estate has always       kept our government in check when it's gone astray, perhaps       more than anywhere else around the world. We rely on       newspapers to inform our citizens, shine a light on       injustice, establish the facts, and hold elected officials       like me accountable. A free and robust Fourth Estate is how       we discern democracy from autocracy and guard against the       slide from one to the other.        This is a time when many of us who have had complete faith       in the wellspring of democracy that has graced our country       genuinely worry if it will endure.        The fact that you, the free press, are there at the       bulwark--independent, strong, and fearless, in cities big and       small--gives me solace that despite our current peril, the       greatness of America will ultimately prevail.        As Americans, we must continue to support the First       Amendment; the freedom--and viability--of the press. It's       nothing short of a moral imperative.        Thank you.     I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
