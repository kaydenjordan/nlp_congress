 Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word.    Mr. Chairman, as we conclude discussion on our 12- bill package, I rise to urge support of H.R. 3354 and to thank the 12  chairs and ranking members who led the great work on these bills as  well as the many Members who offered amendments in this open and free  and, I may say, rather civil discussion.   This package prioritizes our domestic and national security to keep  our people safe, supports our troops, strengthens law enforcement,  secures our borders, and helps get our economy moving, and it deserves  bipartisan support.   Over the past week, the House has debated hundreds of amendments in  this appropriations legislation. Combined with the thousands of Member  requests included in the base text, these bills are truly  representative of our shared American values.   I want to thank all my colleagues for their time and consideration of  one another throughout this process.   Tomorrow the House will vote to finalize all 12 appropriations bills  before the fiscal year deadline of September 30.   We have not had what is referred to and what is called regular order  for a long time--in nearly a decade. And what's more, we have done all  12 bills under a very abbreviated time schedule. From June 12 to July  20--just over 1 month--the Appropriations Committee has held 12  subcommittee markups and 12 full committee markups, putting in hundreds  of hours debating hundreds of amendments. The legislation on the floor  this afternoon is a result of this hard work.   I would like to thank my committee, particularly its leaders,  including Chairmen Robert Aderholt from Alabama, John Culberson from  Texas, Kay Granger from Texas, Mike Simpson from Idaho, and Tom Graves  from Georgia who has done a masterful job this afternoon, Judge Carter  from Texas, Ken Calvert from California, Tom Cole from Oklahoma, Kevin  Yoder from Kansas, Charlie Dent from Pennsylvania, Hal Rogers from  Kentucky, and Mario Diaz-Balart from Florida.   On the Democratic side, I want to thank Ranking Members Sanford  Bishop from Georgia, Jose Serrano from New York, Pete Visclosky from  Indiana, Marcy Kaptur from Ohio, Mike Quigley from Illinois, Lucille  Roybal-Allard from California, Betty McCollum from Minnesota, Rosa  DeLauro from Connecticut, Tim Ryan from Ohio, Debbie Wasserman Schultz  from Florida, and David Price from North Carolina, and their  surrogates.   Of course, I particularly want to thank the ranking member of the  full committee, Mrs. Nita Lowey from New York for her dedication and  friendship to getting our work done on time.   I must also thank our incredibly hard-working staff, Mr. Chairman,  led by Nancy Fox, our staff director; and Maureen Holohan, our new  deputy staff director on the Republican side; and by Shalanda Young and  Chris Bigelow on the Democratic side. I thank them all. To all the  staffs, those assembled here in this room and those who have been here  for many hours over the last couple of days, I thank them all for all  the work they have done to get these bills to the floor and the  tremendous amount of time and dedication to them.   Mr. Chairman, this bill makes sure the United States has a strong  national defense and that our citizens here at home are protected. This  package sets us on the right path to fully fund the entire Federal  Government on time and on budget.   Mr. Chairman, I ask my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the bill, and I  yield back the balance of my time.                       Announcement by the Acting Chair
