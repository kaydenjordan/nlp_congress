 Madam Speaker, I rise today where we should have been a  [[Page H1936]]  week ago when the Treasury warned us that the small business program  needed refunding. It is a program we already authorized. It is a  program that Americans need desperately to keep their payrolls whole  during this crisis.   But, in predictable fashion, it was delayed. My colleagues will claim  victory for this delay, claiming ``wins'' for additional funding. But  they know that this vote today could have easily been agreed to last  week.   We are asking our grocers to stock our shelves, truckers to drive,  and nurses and doctors to risk their lives, but Congress can't even  bother to vote to help small businesses in time. In fact, many want to  vote from home or by proxy. If you think that is leadership, then I  would encourage you to rethink what it means to be a Representative.   Leadership is courage to lead from the front. It is steadfast  judgment free from cynical opportunism. Leadership means acting worthy  of the people we represent. If we are to survive this historic crisis,  we might collectively stiffen our spines and demonstrate to the  American people what that looks like.
