 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, who has  been a dear friend of mine as his father was for a very long period of  time. And we share in common a lot of things, but one of those things  that we share in common is a great respect for Richard Trumka, a great  appreciation for the leadership that Richard Trumka showed, not only in  the labor movement but in our country as a citizen representing our  best values.   And we share respect for the labor movement.   Richard Trumka, Madam Speaker, walked with the weight of America's  workers on his shoulders, but he wore that weight lightly in one sense  and with a great sense of responsibility in another sense.                                time  1730    He carried them with him always in his mind and in his soul. His life  was devoted to the labor movement and to each and every worker who was  part of the labor movement.   His loss, in my view, is a grievous one for our country, and he  leaves behind a legacy for which we can all be grateful: the men and  women in labor who have a better wage, a better place to work, and  greater security because of Richard Trumka.   Thanks to Mr. Trumka, workers across the United States today have  stronger representation and safer working conditions.   Madam Speaker, 12.5 million union members and countless others have  looked up to him for decades as a force for our positive change, an  unrivaled leader in the labor movement.   Few people epitomized the ideas of the workers' rights movement,  which are also core values of the Democratic Party, in the way Mr.  Trumka did. He was a fighter, but he was also a great tactician and  strategist. Those, of course, are the determination and attributes that  everyone who works hard ought to be able to get ahead and that working  families ought to be able to access opportunities and economic  security.   From the beginning of his career, first as a coal miner and then as  president of the United Mine Workers of America, he was committed to  forging closer ties between workers and their union representatives. He  ultimately became president of the AFL-CIO because not only was he  committed to do that, he did it. He accomplished it.   He made a difference for workers, for their families, and for  America. He knew that union action was the greatest tool available to  achieve labor reforms and to make economic security more attainable for  workers and their families.   As American workers continue to face new challenges as a result of  the pandemic, it is essential that policymakers continue to work  closely with organized labor and leaders like Richard Trumka.   Madam Speaker, the COVID-19 pandemic has placed so many of our  workers and their families in situations dangerous to their health and  also to their economic well-being. More than ever, workers need  champions for their rights, their fair wages, and their fair benefits,  and they are missing that champion they called President Richard  Trumka.   We need to ensure that workers continue to have a strong voice in  Congress, and we need to do everything we can to keep them and their  families safe and able to access opportunities.   Madam Speaker, in his last major speech, Mr. Trumka told Texas AFL- CIO members that inequality is the greatest threat to democracy. He  said this: ``Without the right to vote and without the right to  organize, there is no democracy.''   I share that view with Richard Trumka. Our Democratic House majority  will not waver in our work to secure both the right to organize and the  right to vote. They are really two of the same principle.   We look forward to working just as closely with Liz Shuler--I might  say a historic figure in her own right, like our Speaker, who spoke a  little while ago--the first woman to lead the AFL-CIO. She has worked  alongside Richard Trumka for years, helping him realize his goals for  the organization in its fight for workers' rights in this country.  Richard Trumka's vision for the future was one of dignity and justice  for all working Americans.   Madam Speaker, we remain committed to that vision and will continue  to honor his memory by fighting to realize his dream for all working  Americans.   God bless Richard Trumka, and may God keep his family in the hollow  of his hand.
