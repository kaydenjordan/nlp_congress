 Mr. President, I appreciate the time.   I think we have had a very interesting debate on Betsy DeVos and  frankly on public education. Listening to my friends on the left, I  have been encouraged, encouraged because I am excited that for the  first time in a very long time, we are actually having a conversation  about the important role of public education in America. This is a  necessary component to success in life.   I have been inspired, inspired by Senators who have spoken eloquently  and passionately about the importance of our public education system,  the challenges they fear might come with the appointment of Betsy DeVos  to be Secretary of Education.   I have also been disappointed and frustrated by some of the  statements made by my friends on the other side. What this is not, what  this should not be is a partisan issue. This is not an issue of  Republicans versus Democrats. That is not what this is about. This is  not even a political issue, nor is this an issue about teachers.   I, for one, am so very thankful for incredible teachers. I think of  Mrs. Lynch, Mrs. Greenberg, my fourth grade teacher, Mrs. Wynn--God  bless her soul. I was a handful. I think of Coach Roberts and Mr.  White. We called him Mighty White, Mr. White. What an amazing English  teacher I had in my senior year. Ms. Barry and Ms. Myers, wonderful  Spanish teachers.   This is not about teachers. It is not necessarily about Betsy DeVos,  not even Betsy DeVos. For me, the issue is simply an issue of quality  education. I will, without any question, have a very specific  conversation on Betsy DeVos. For me, however, this is simply about  quality education and how we get there.   My story is familiar to many people in this Chamber. I have spoken  about it a number of times. I will tell you that my entire time in the  Senate--the 4 years I have been here--I have been talking consistently  about the power of education and the necessity of quality education. I  call it the opportunity agenda.   The opportunity agenda, which has been my focus for the last 4 years,  focuses first on education, making sure that every single ZIP Code in  America has a quality choice for education. This is so important to me.   As a poor kid growing up in a single-parent household, I was not  doing very well. From 7 to 14, I drifted in the wrong direction. As a  freshman in high school, I basically flunked out. I failed world  geography. I may be the first Senator to fail civics. I even failed  Spanish and English. When you fail Spanish and English, no one  considers you bilingual, no one. They did call me, by the way, ``bi- ignant'' because I could not speak in any language, and that is where I  found my unhappy self.   I have two major blessings in my life: a wonderful mother who  believed in my future, who encouraged me, who inspired me, who did  everything necessary to try to keep me on the right track, and I had a  powerful mentor.   I am so thankful that during the hardest times of my life, I found  myself in the position to receive a quality education, and I learned  from my sophomore year forward to take advantage of that positive,  strong opportunity for a quality education, but that was not always the  case.   I remember by the time I was in the fourth grade, I had gone to four  different elementary schools because there is something transient about  poverty. So we moved around some. Picking the right school was  difficult, challenging. So, for me, when I think about this topic, when  I hear my friends on the left, when I think about the debate around the  Nation, this is simply a clear debate and discussion around education.  It changed my life for the better.   I will tell you, this is not a Republican or a Democratic issue. Both  Republicans and Democrats around this Nation--maybe not in this Chamber  but around this Nation--support Betsy DeVos to be the next Secretary of  Education, and that is good news.   Let me just talk for a few minutes about Betsy DeVos. I have listened  to the concerns as we have heard from the Senator from Pennsylvania.  Tens of thousands of folks have called the offices of all Senators, to  include mine. I have been on the phone, answering the phone in my  office so I could have a chance to chat with my constituents who called  in from inside the State. I certainly had a ton of calls from outside  the State.   Here are some of the concerns I heard from my constituents that I  know were serious concerns and important parts of the conversation. One  serious concern was the lack of experience she has.   I will tell you, she brings with her a fresh set of eyes; that, yes,  she has no official experience, but she has invested the last 28 years  of her life in improving public education. She has supported, without  any question, the creation of public charter schools.   I had the privilege of speaking at a charter school in Michigan  started by Betsy DeVos and her husband 3 or 4 years ago, an aviation  high school that focuses on making sure the students are prepared to be  competent and to qualify for good jobs in the aviation transportation  sector. It is a phenomenal school. I enjoyed my interaction with the  kids.   I will tell you that not only has she spent the last 28 years in  public education, not only has she spent millions of her own money  focusing on education, but she has a set of fresh eyes. I will explain  to you in a few minutes why that is so important if we are going to  improve the quality of education experienced in the rural areas, like  West Virginia or in South Carolina, as well as the inner cities, from  Chicago to Detroit and parts of South Carolina as well. So that will be  an important part of the conversation as we move forward.   The second thing I have heard from my constituents that I think is  really important is that she doesn't support accountability equally for  charter schools and other public schools.   I had a chance to talk to Betsy DeVos, and I would not support her if  she was not going to treat all the schools the same as it relates to  accountability. That is important, and that is a place where she has  been crystal clear, from my perspective.   The third issue I have heard is that supporting Betsy DeVos will  somehow ruin public education. I will tell you, I have had the chance  to sit down and chat with her about the role of public education. She  agrees with many on our side of the aisle, when she said very clearly,  she supports public education. She supports quality public education.  She supports charter schools. She supports school choice.   I do not believe there is a binary choice between public education  and school choice. I think that is not an accurate description that we  face. I think she will help to improve public education.   One of my friends on the left said that public education is a right,  but for too many of our children quality public education is not. It is  simply not happening.   I will tell you, as I think about the numbers around this concept, I  look at those schools around the Nation that  [[Page S768]]  meet or exceed our national standard in the area of English or language  arts.   In my home State, in the county where I was born, Charleston County,  if you break it down--and this is a debate that has become a debate so  often about where you live and what you look like so I wanted to break  it down by the demographics I have heard so often from my friends on  the left because these are important demographics. It is very important  for us to understand and appreciate the necessity of improving quality  education for all of our students.   I see in Charleston County meeting or exceeding the English standards  that we have set, that 78 percent of our White kids are doing just fine  in meeting and/or exceeding those national standards, but,  unfortunately, only 24.4 percent of our Black students meet or exceed  those standards. I heard that of the Hispanic students in Charleston  County, only 27.7 percent meet or exceed those standards.   I will tell you that if you think about where we are, as a nation, on  the issue of public education and if you drive into some of the inner  cities, like Chicago or Detroit or Philadelphia, you have to ask  yourself: What is the experience of that child in public education?  Because I think this is the central debate for our country. It is  around education because a poor education has a strong correlation with  our incarceration rates. A poor education has a strong correlation with  high unemployment rates. A poor education has a correlation with low  lifetime income.   So the importance of the issue of quality education--particularly in  those places in our country that seem to be under tremendous stress--we  should drill into the numbers so we can appreciate what the future  looks like for those kids. This is such an important issue.   In Chicago, 65 percent of our majority students meet or exceed the  standard in English or language arts, but only 22 percent of our  African-American kids meet or exceed the standards; 29 percent of our  Hispanic kids in Chicago meet or exceed the standards.   What are the numbers in Detroit? Well, in Detroit, only 13 percent of  our majority students meet or exceed those English standards; 9  percent--1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 percent--of the African-American  kids meet or exceed those standards; 12.5 percent of our Hispanic kids  meet or exceed those standards. Just correlate those numbers to the  incarceration rates, to the employment rates, to the lifetime income  rates, and to the rate of hopelessness in those communities.   I know we are having a debate about the Secretary of Education. It is  an important debate, but a more important debate centers around the  educational experience of our students all over this Nation and what  that means long term for this Nation and for the students and for our  communities all over the country.   Philadelphia is another place. For 53 percent--barely half of the  majority students--meet or exceed the standards; 24 percent of African- American students and 23 percent of Hispanic students meet or exceed  the standards.   What does that mean? That means that while we are having a debate  about education, while we are having a debate about Betsy DeVos, maybe  it is not about Betsy DeVos. Maybe it is not about the great teachers I  have had and others have had. We should all celebrate quality public  education. I do. I am a tremendous supporter of it, but there is a  place in this Nation--from Appalachia, the rural areas in West  Virginia, the rural areas of South Carolina, inner cities that I have  just named--where a quality education is not the norm. As a matter of  fact, the exact opposite is the norm, and that means we all will pay a  hefty price, not financially because that is secondary. We lose human  potential when it is not developed, and that is a travesty, one that we  can ill afford as a nation.   While I am seriously concerned about our debate on Betsy DeVos and I  am seriously concerned about public education, I am very concerned  about the quality outcomes not being experienced by our rural kids and  our inner-city kids, and far too often we forget to have a debate about  the children in the system. We have a debate about the system, we have  a debate about the Secretary of the system, but we haven't thoroughly  vetted the accomplishments or the lack of accomplishments within that  system. So we ought not cast a shadow over all public education. We  should, however, illuminate or cast a bright light into problem areas  and look for options to improve the outcome for those kids not only  trapped in a failing system but for the rest of their lives playing  catchup. That is where our focus should be.    We have heard a whole lot of hyperbole about what the next Secretary  of Education can do, as if that person could somehow with a magic wand  change education. That is patently false. It would take action by this  Congress to have that happen. The reality of it is that while it is an  important position, she cannot act unilaterally, and the one commitment  that I made sure I had from her--she viewed the world of education in  the same paradigm as I do, which is we don't want a top-down approach  to education; we actually want school districts and local communities  and counties and States to lead the charge, because about $550 billion  that supports public education doesn't come from the Federal  Government, it comes from the States and the local school districts.  That is where the decisions should be made.   I am a supporter of school choice; however, it would just be an  option under the best-case scenario where States would have more  options at the cafeteria. I don't want to mandate and she is not going  to be able to mandate school choice. That will be our decision, and I  have decided I don't want to make it happen. I want to give the States  and the local school districts the opportunity to make their own  decisions, which does lead me, of course, to my support and her support  of school choice.   I would submit that most of us in this Nation support school choice.  I know that is a controversial statement and one you have to back up  with facts. Here is a fact: The fact is that we as a nation  consistently support school choice. It is called a Pell grant. A Pell  grant is a Federal subsidy that oftentimes goes to private schools-- colleges. Unfortunately, many kids who do not meet or exceed the  standards in English, math, and science will never experience the Pell  grant because they don't go on to a 2-year or a 4-year education. They  don't go to a technical school or to a college. They don't find  themselves experiencing what we as a Federal Government provide--a  clear and specific option to take your Federal dollars to your private  colleges.   We all seem to support school choice; we just don't seem to support  it for those kids trapped in failing school districts and  underperforming schools. Those kids will not see the Pell grants so  often. Too often, too many of those kids will not see a Pell grant,  which is absolutely, positively, unequivocally school choice.   I will state that I am hopeful. I am hopeful because I believe that  men and women in this Chamber are sincere and serious about the debate  around public education. And I will tell you there are reasons to  believe that in spite of the dismal performance that I have read, there  are reasons to be hopeful that the future for those kids in public  education can get better--significantly better.   As I wrap up my comments, let me reflect upon what is possible for  kids who were underperforming to become high-achieving. So often we  label those kids as at-risk kids. I prefer to call them high-potential  kids. There are examples in this Nation where those kids who were  performing so poorly, according to the third grade statistics, around  meeting or exceeding expectations, according to ESSA, those kids, later  in life and in different programs and in New York City specifically,  are doing incredibly well. Let me give a couple of examples, and I will  close with this good news and more to be continued later this morning.   There is a group of schools called Success Academies which are public  charter schools that are performing at the highest levels in the State  of New York. Here is the good news: These kids are 87 percent African  American and Hispanic. And I went through the numbers earlier--dismal  numbers meeting or exceeding standards in English. The numbers are very  similar in math. They are very similar in science. But here is what is  possible: In all the New York State schools, the top-performing schools  in the State--  [[Page S769]]  looking at their performance, 94 percent success rate in math, 82  percent in English, 99 percent in science. To break those numbers down  as I did earlier with the African-American and Hispanic students, in  math, here is how you reverse the achievement gap: 93 percent of  African-American Success Academy scholars outperform the majority of  students in New York City. Eighty percent of them are African Americans  and 80 percent of them are Hispanic. They are at 80 percent.   You see, Mr. President, with the right focus, with the right  emphasis, with options like a cafeteria, when parents have a choice,  the students have a chance not just in education but a better chance in  life.   Thank you, Mr. President.    Mr. President, as we close this debate on Betsy DeVos,  this debate should really be about public  [[Page S824]]  education. I support public education. Education is the closest thing  to magic in America. Let me say again that again. Education is the  closest thing to magic in America. I experienced that magic.   As a kid growing up in a single-parent household, mired in poverty,  disillusioned about life, I nearly flunked out as a freshman. I thank  God for public education. But far too many kids--too many millions of  kids today--do not have a quality educational choice in their  communities. And what does that mean? There is a high correlation  between incarceration, high unemployment, and lower lifetime incomes  for those students who do not have quality public education.   This Nation--the greatest Nation on Earth--has afforded a kid who  almost dropped out of high school to become a U.S. Senator. Why?  Because I found a path that included public education, and quality  public education.   So what does it look like in some of our cities? Let me give my  colleagues an example from Detroit. Only 9 percent of African-American  kids meet standards for English. Thirteen percent of White kids meet  standards or exceed standards in English, and 12.5 percent of Hispanic  kids meet or exceed standards in English in Detroit. We need to make  sure that every child in every ZIP Code has a quality choice.   The Secretary of Education cannot--cannot--privatize education. That  would take an act of Congress.   So, yes, we should have a passionate debate about education, and yes,  we should make sure--make sure--that the focus of that debate is on the  kid.    Mr. President, before I get into my speech regarding  Senator Sessions, I wanted to talk a little bit about what occurred  last night.   First, there is no doubt in my mind that the letter written by  Coretta Scott King should be read by each and every Member of this  Chamber. Regardless of whether you disagree with her conclusions, her  standing in the history of our Nation means her voice should be heard.  What I took issue with last night and the true violation of rule XIX in  my eyes were the remarks shared last night originally stated by Senator  Kennedy--not Coretta Scott King--Senator Kennedy.   Whether you like it or not, this body has rules, and we all should  govern ourselves according to the rules.   There is no doubt that last night emotions were very high, and I am  not necessarily happy with where that has left us today. The Senate  needs to function. We need to have a comity in this body if we are to  work for the American people. This should not be about Republicans and  Democrats. It is not about us; it is about the American people.   If we remember that point as we move forward, our Nation will be able  to heal where we hurt. We will be able to disagree without being  disagreeable. This should be the norm, not a unique experience in  public discourse.   Before I decided to give this speech, I had the privilege last night  around midnight of having to sit in the Chair and presiding. My good  friend Cory Booker was making an eloquent presentation about where we  are on issues of race in this Nation. He was talking about the South,  and he was talking about the pain, the suffering, and the misery.   Today, as I want to share my thoughts on Jeff Sessions and how I have  come to my conclusion, I thought it was important for me to not try to  persuade people but to simply inform, because this issue is not simply  the issue about our next Attorney General. This is really an issue  about all of us--not all of us as Senators but all of us as members of  the American family. This is an issue that digs deep into the core of  our souls, deep into the core of our Nation, deep into who we can be,  who we should be, and how we will get there.   So my objective here, as I speak, will not be to somehow persuade the  other side that your decision is wrong. I don't think that is my  responsibility nor my intention. My goal isn't even to persuade those  who believe that Jeff Sessions will not be a good U.S. Attorney General  that they are wrong. I simply want to share information. I want to  share facts. I want to share, as Paul Harvey used to say, ``the rest of  the story,'' because if you read the news reports, you walk away with a  clear picture based on facts but not necessarily a clear picture based  on truth. There has been a distortion in many arenas, in many echo  chambers about who he is and why I support him.   My good friend Cory Booker last night spoke about a true American  hero, John Lewis. John Lewis is an American hero. I know that this may  or may not be popular with everyone in the Chamber or everyone in  America on the conservative side or the liberal side, but the reality  of it is this. He was beaten within an inch of his life so that I would  have the privilege--not to stand in the Chamber but--to vote, to simply  vote.   We should all thank God for the sacrifices of men and women so that  people like myself, Cory Booker, and Kamala Harris would be allowed one  day not to simply vote but to serve in the most unique, powerful, and  one of the most important legislative bodies in the world today. It is  the sacrifices of men and women of color who fought against injustices.  We stand as a nation on the shoulders of these giants. I know that I  don't have to remind my mother or my family, but just as a reminder to  those who are listening to the conversation, when I leave the Senate  one day, I am still going to be Black, an African American--Black every  day, Black every way, and there is no doubt.   This is an important part of the conversation because, as I read  through some of the comments of my friends on the left, you will wonder  if I ever had an experience as a Black person in America. I want to get  to that in just a few minutes.   God, in His infinite wisdom, made me Black, born in Charleston, SC,  for a purpose. I am blessed to be who I am, and I am equally blessed to  be a Charlestonian. Our country, the South, and, specifically, my State  have suffered through difficult and challenging times around the issue  of race. My grandfather, who passed away at 94 years old last January,  knew a very different South. I remember listening to him talking about  his experiences of having to step off of the sidewalk when White folks  were coming. He learned early in life: Never look a White person in the  eyes. He was in his forties in the 1960s. His whole life view, his  paradigm, was painted with a broad brush. Separation, segregation,  humiliation, and challenges.   It was in my home city of Charleston where the Civil War began. It  was in my home city of Charleston where nearly 40 percent of all the  slaves that came to America would come through in Charleston, SC. It  was a Charlestonian who came up with the concept written into our  Constitution of three-fifths of a man--a Charlestonian.   But it was also Charlestonians who, in 2010 had a choice between  Strom Thurmond's son and a young--I use that word liberally--African- American guy named Tim Scott.   The evolution that has occurred in the South could be seen very  clearly on this day in Charleston. The very first shots of the Civil  War were in Charleston. They gave me the privilege of representing them  in Congress, over the son of Strom Thurmond, over the son and the  namesake of one of the most popular Governors in South Carolina,  Carroll Campbell, Jr. I thank God that the South Carolina that I have  come to know, the South that I have had the experience to enjoy is a  different South. It is a different Charleston than my grandfather knew  in his 94 years. But my life has not been one of privilege, of promise.   As I said just a few nights ago, I was born into a single parent  household, living in poverty, nearly flunking out  [[Page S950]]  of high school. I have been called everything that you can think of  from a racial perspective--good, not too often bad, very consistently.  So I understand that there is room for progress. There is a need for us  to crystallize what we are fighting about, who we are fighting for, and  how we are going to get there.   This is an important day and an important issue, and the U.S.  Attorney General is perhaps one of the most important decisions I will  make about the Cabinet of President Trump. I will tell you that, for  me, this has been a challenging journey, one that I have not taken  lightly because, as I said earlier, I am going to be Black when I leave  this body, and so when I think about some of the comments and some of  the challenges for Jeff Sessions around the 1986 process, the trial of  the KKK and the trial of the Turner family, an African-American  couple--they were defendants he brought to court--I have heard it, and  I wanted to know more about what it is we are talking about, not by  reading it in the paper but by calling folks in Alabama, understanding  with new eyes who Jeff Sessions is--not the guy I serve with but the  guy who will have the most powerful position in law enforcement. I  wanted to know firsthand who he was before he was nominated and how he  would respond in a room filled with African-American leaders.   I and my best friend in Congress, Trey Gowdy, for a very long time  throughout South Carolina have held meetings of African-American  pastors and leaders coming together with law enforcement to try to  bridge the gap that is obviously broken, bridge the gap that obviously  exists between law enforcement and African-American leaders. So I  brought Jeff Sessions down to see from a distance how he interacts with  these African-American pastors, hear the tough questions on Walter  Scott and other issues so I can have an appreciation and affinity of  how the Justice Department under his leadership would act.   I take this responsibility seriously, and I wonder if my friends in  the Chamber have had a chance to see what others think--not the  political echo chamber, not the organization, but run-of-the-mill  people.   So I had that experience, and I will tell you that without any  question, the conclusion that I have drawn is a pretty clear  conclusion. I am glad that I dug into the issue. I am glad I took the  time to know Jeff Sessions the best I can from what I have read from  1986, what I saw in my own home city of Charleston, with a provocative  history on race.   We are at a defining moment in our country, not because of the  Attorney General, not because of the debate we are going through in  this body, but because our country is being pulled apart from extremes  on both ends. This is not healthy for our country. Too often, too many  particularly on the right are found guilty until proven innocent on  issues of race, issues of fairness. I say that because, as I think  about some of the comments that have come into my office over the last  several weeks, I am used to being attacked. If you sign up to be a  Black conservative, the chances are very high you will be attacked. It  comes with the territory, and I have had it for 20 years, two decades.  But my friends and my staff are not used to the level of animus that  comes in from the liberal left who suggest that I somehow am not  helpful to the cause of liberal America and therefore I am not helpful  to Black America because they see those as one and the same.   I brought some of the pages of chats that I have from folks, the  comments I get from Twitter about my support of Jeff Sessions:   Tracy V. Johnson sent in ``Sen. Uncle Tim Scott.''   ``Everyone from SC who happens to be a left winger knows that Tim  Scott is an Uncle Tom. [``S''] is documented.'' ``S'' is not for Scott;  it is for fertilizer.   SGaut says: ``A White man in a black body: Tim Scott backs Jeff  Sessions for attorney general.''   Until 3 weeks ago the only African-American chief of staff in the  U.S. Senate out of 100 was the chief of staff for a Republican. The  second African-American chief of staff in the U.S. Senate is the chief  of staff of a Republican. Yet they say of my chief of staff that she is  ``high yella,'' an implication that she is just not Black enough.   I go on to read from folks who wanted to share their opinions about  my endorsing Jeff Sessions:   ``You are a disgrace to the Black race!''   Anthony R Burnam @BurnamR says: ``You an Uncle Tom Scott aren't you?  Sessions. How does a black man turn on his own.''   Anthony B. from @PoliticalAnt says: ``Sen. Tim Scott is not an Uncle  Tom. He doesn't have a shred of honor. He's a House Negro, like the one  in Jango.''   He also writes--I guess Anthony Burnam has been active on my Twitter  feed--that I am ``a complete horror . . . a black man [who is] a  racist.''   ``Against black people''   ``Big Uncle Tom [piece of fertilizer]. You are a disgrace to your  race.''   I left out all the ones that use the ``N'' word. I just felt that  would not be appropriate.   You see, what I am surprised by, just a smidgeon, is that the liberal  left that speaks and desires for all of us to be tolerant does not want  to be tolerant of anyone who disagrees with where they are coming from.  So the definition of ``tolerance'' isn't that all Americans experience  a high level of tolerance; it is all Americans who agree with them  experience this so-called tolerance.    I am not saying this because it bothers me because, frankly, I have  experienced two decades of this. You don't necessarily get used to it,  but you don't find yourself as offended by it all. I just wish that my  friends who call themselves liberals would want tolerance for all  Americans, including conservative Americans. I just wish that my  liberal friends who are self-described liberal would want to be  innocent until proven guilty and not guilty until proven innocent.   So back to my findings on Jeff Sessions. I brought Jeff Sessions to  Charleston. And you can read about it in the Post and Courier, the  local newspaper. The pastor said that Jeff Sessions was warm and  friendly, engaging and competent.   Now, I will say that the response from the NAACP and the NAN, the  National Action Network, about the meeting that I had with the African- American pastors--that it was outrageous that I would invite African- American pastors to meet with this guy and they didn't have an  invitation. So I invited two of their leaders. I didn't tell anyone who  was coming because I wanted folks to come into the room and make their  own decisions and come to their own conclusions. They decided not to  come. Maybe it was because a conservative invited them. I don't know  why. But I wanted everyone to have a chance, and they did. It was  interesting.   Here are some other interesting facts that I have not seen often in  the press, which I think is a very important point.   All of us who engage in conversations around this Nation about race  and justice, to only have part of the story is just an unfortunate  reality that we should get used to that I haven't gotten used to. But  the reality is, 50 years ago, in 1966, Senator Sessions campaigned  against George Wallace's wife for Governor. As a Senator, Jeff Sessions  voted in favor of a 30-year extension of the Civil Rights Act. He was  one of only 17 Republicans to support the first Black Attorney General,  Eric Holder. He spearheaded the effort to award the Congressional Gold  Medal to Rosa Parks, an Alabama native and civil rights icon.   As Cory Booker, my good friend from New Jersey, said last night as I  presided, he and Jeff Sessions worked wonderfully well together in  awarding the Congressional Gold Medal to the foot soldiers of the civil  rights movement in Selma, AL.   Here is another part of the story that just hasn't seemed to break  through the threshold of our national media on Jeff Sessions' support  within the Black community. As I started making phone calls to leaders  in Alabama who were Black and Democrats, I was very surprised at what I  started hearing about Jeff Sessions. I will start with an Alabama  native, Condoleezza Rice, who is not a Democrat but who is an Alabama  native. She said: Sessions has worked hard to heal the wounds in  Alabama brought on by the ``prejudice and injustice against the  descendants of slaves.''   Willie Huntley, an African-American assistant U.S. attorney under  Jeff  [[Page S951]]  Sessions, now an attorney in Mobile, AL, has known Jeff Sessions for  more than 30 years and said in an interview that he has never  encountered racial insensitivity from Sessions in the three decades  they have known each other.   Alabama Senate Democratic leader Quinton Ross said of Jeff Sessions:  ``We have talked about things from civil rights to race relations, and  I think anyone--once you gain a position like that, actually  partnership has to go aside because you represent the United States and  all the people. . . . I feel confident [Jeff Sessions] will be an  attorney general that will look at it from all perspectives to just do  what's right for the citizens of the United States.''   That is from an African-American Democratic leader in the Alabama  State Senate, Quinton Ross.   From former Obama administration Surgeon General Regina Benjamin: ``I  think he'll be fine. I consider him a friend. . . . At least he will  listen as attorney general. My hope is that he'll do what is best for  the American people.''   Former Deputy Attorney General Larry Thompson says this. Larry is 71  years old, so we are not talking about folks who grew up in my New  South that I talked about earlier. Still we are working through it,  but, boy, we have changed. This is a 71-year-old who says of Jeff  Sessions: ``He doesn't have a racist bone in his body.'' He said: ``I  have been an African American man for 71 years. I think I know a racist  when I see one. Jeff is far from being a racist. He's a good person, a  decent person.''   Gerald Reynolds, former chairman of the U.S. Commission on Civil  Rights: ``During my discussions with Senator Sessions and his staff, it  was clear that the senator has a strong interest in ensuring our  nation's antidiscrimination laws are vigorously enforced. Senator  Sessions is a man of great character and integrity, with a commitment  to fairness and equal justice under the law.''   Just a few more.   Fred Gray. Fred Gray is an iconic figure in civil rights, for those  of us who may not be familiar with him. Fred Gray is an African- American civil rights attorney. He represented the Reverend Dr. Martin  Luther King, Jr. He represented Rosa Parks. He represented the Tuskegee  men who were exploited in the syphilis experiment by the government.  This is what he said in this letter from 2016:         What would be more noteworthy for the State of Alabama than       having an Alabamian follow in the footsteps of the late Mr.       Justice Hugo Black? Previously I have expressed appreciation       for your acts herein stated. I look forward to working       with you in any future capacity in which the Lord permits       you to serve.    That is a quote from a letter that he wrote to Jeff Sessions.   We are talking about a hero of the civil rights era. We are talking  about the lawyer for Martin Luther King, Jr., Rosa Parks, and the  Tuskegee men. We are not talking about someone who doesn't understand  and appreciate the weight and the importance of civil rights in this  Nation.   William Smith was hired as the first African-American Republican  chief counsel to the Senate Judiciary Committee by Jeff Sessions. He  said:         Jeff Sessions is a man who cared for me, who looked out for       me, and who had my best interests in mind. So, anybody who       says anything different simply doesn't know Jeff Sessions.    One last statement. This is an important one from my perspective.   I mentioned earlier that there was a case against a couple, the  Turner couple, where Jeff Sessions was the prosecutor, and the Turners  were being prosecuted for some voter rights issues. Interestingly  enough, what you don't hear in the news, by the way, is that the case  was brought by other African Americans in Alabama against an African- American couple, the Turners. This is from Albert Turner, Jr., the son  of the two defendants in that case. He says:         While I respect the deeply held positions of other civil       rights advocates who oppose Senator Sessions, I believe it is       important for me to speak out with regard to Senator Sessions       personally. First, let me be clear. Senator Sessions and I       respectfully disagree on some issues. That won't change when       he is the Attorney General of the United States. And I expect       that there will be times, as it is with all politicians, when       we will legitimately disagree and I will be required by my       conscience to speak out. I look forward to those constructive       debates, if necessary. However, despite our political       differences, the Senator and I share certain Alabama and       American values, including love of our State, its people, and       our country.        I have known Senator Sessions for many years, beginning       with the voter fraud case in Perry County in which my parents       were defendants. My differences in policy and ideology with       him do not translate to personal malice. He is not a racist.       As I have said before, at no time then or now has Jeff       Sessions said anything derogatory about my family. He was a       prosecutor at the Federal level with a job to do. He was       presented with evidence by a local district attorney that he       relied on, and his office presented the case. That is what       prosecutors do. I believe him when he says that he was simply       doing his job.    Jeff Sessions has also worked on civil rights cases, including the  KKK murderer Henry Hays in 1981.   Jeff Sessions worked with the Department of Justice attorneys, the  FBI, county investigators, and the county district attorney to solve  the murder of a 19-year-old African American, Michael Donald. Sessions  and the U.S. Attorney's Office prosecuted ``Tiger'' Knowles as an  accomplice, obtaining a guilty plea and a life sentence in Federal  court. After hard investigative work, Sessions shifted the case of the  KKK murderer Henry Hays to the State court where he received the death  penalty, which was not available at that time at the Federal level.   USA v. Bennie Jack Hays is another successful case against the KKK  that Jeff Sessions participated in.   In Conecuh County in 1983, Jeff Sessions joined in bringing the first  lawsuit in the history of the Department of Justice to stop the  suppression of African-American voting rights. In United States v.  Conecuh County, the DOJ Civil Rights Division, along with Jeff  Sessions, sued white Conecuh County election officials, including the  chair of the local Republican Party.   Finally, Dallas County. In 1978, the Department of Justice used  Dallas County, AL, to replace its at-large election system and go to a  single-member district so that African Americans would have a better  chance to be elected. Jeff Sessions supported it, the ACLU supported  it, as did the DOJ's Civil Rights Division. They were successful.   Finally, on the criminal justice issue that I support, according to  Senator Dick Durbin, who said during the confirmation hearing that Jeff  Sessions saved thousands upon thousands of years of Black men's lives  because of his push to reduce the disparity between crack and powder  cocaine from 100 to 1, to where it is today. Jeff Sessions even fought  against the Bush administration to bring that disparity down.   In conclusion, as I reflect on the brave men and women who have  shaped this country, who have fought for my freedom, for me to  participate fully in this Republic--the greatest experiment of self- governing the world has ever known--we have an obligation to judge a  man not by the color of his skin nor by the State of his birth, but by  the story his life tells and by the content of his character.   Jeff Sessions has earned my support, and I will hold him accountable  if and when we disagree moving forward.   Thank you, Mr. President.
