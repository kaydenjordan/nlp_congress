 But has any of the documents that you turned       over, to your knowledge, been turned over to the committee?        Ambassador TAYLOR. No.    Ms. Manager GARCIA of Texas. Senators, I will confirm. The committees  have not seen not one of these documents--none.   Finally, if it could be any worse--well, it is--a Trump  administration official, Ambassador Sondland, informed us that he was  not even permitted to review his own relevant records in preparation  for their testimony. Again, this would be his own records so that he  could prepare to testify.   Let's watch.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         Ambassador SONDLAND. I have not had access to all of my       phone records, State Department emails, and many, many other       State Department documents. And I was told I could not work       with my EU staff to pull together the relevant files and       information. Having access to the State Department materials       would have been very helpful to me in trying to reconstruct       with whom I spoke and met and when and what was said.        My lawyers and I have made multiple requests to the State       Department and the White House for these materials. Yet these       materials were not provided to me, and they have also refused       to share these materials with this committee. These documents       are not classified and, in fairness--and, in fairness--should       have been made available.    Ms. Manager GARCIA of Texas. Of course, we agree.   At President Trump's order, agencies and offices refused to produce  documents in response to the committee's requests, and they refused to  allow individual witnesses to do so either.   So let's recap. No documents--zero, goose egg, nada--in response to  over 70 requests--70 requests and 5 subpoenas. There was no attempt to  negotiate, no genuine attempt to accommodate. There was categorical,  indiscriminate, and unprecedented stonewalling.   Again, never in my time as a lawyer or as a judge have I seen this  kind of total disrespect in defiance of a lawfully issued subpoena--and  all on President Trump's orders. And it could continue because this  obstruction of Congress is real, and it is beyond--beyond--comparison.  This President should be removed.   Ms. Manager LOFGREN. Mr. Chief Justice and Senators, let's turn to  President Trump's efforts to stop witnesses from testifying.   No other President facing impeachment has taken the extreme step to  prohibit executive branch witnesses from testifying before Congress.  Even President Nixon, who famously attempted to defy a subpoena for  tape recordings of his conversations, let his most senior staff testify  before Congress.   I remember listening on TV as John Dean testified before the Senate  Watergate Committee. He was the President's lawyer. President Nixon  didn't block him. Not only did President Nixon allow his staff to  testify before Congress; he publicly directed them to testify and  without demanding a subpoena.   Actually, with the Senate Watergate investigation, President Nixon  said:         All members of the White House staff will appear       voluntarily when requested by the committee. They will       testify under oath, and they will answer fully all proper       questions.    Now compare that to President Trump. He publicly attacked the House's  impeachment inquiry, calling it ``constitutionally invalid,'' and he  ordered every single person working in the executive branch to defy the  House impeachment inquiry.   As just discussed, in the letter to the Speaker of the House, the  White House Counsel said that President Trump ``cannot permit his  administration to participate.''   No President ever used the official power of his office to prevent  witnesses from giving testimony to Congress in such a blanket and  indiscriminate manner. There is no telling how many government  officials would have come forward if the President hadn't issued this  order.   Let's look at some of the witnesses who followed the President's  orders.   The House issued subpoenas to compel the testimony of three officials  at the Office of Management and Budget: Acting Director Russell Vought,  Associate Director Michael Duffey, and Associate Director, Brian  McCormack.   According to testimony in the House, which was reinforced by emails  recently revealed through the Freedom of Information Act lawsuits, OMB  was just central to the President's hold on security assistance to  Ukraine. Its officials served as conduits for the White House to  implement the hold without directly engaging the agencies that actually  supported release of the aid. President Trump directed these three OMB  officials to violate their legal obligation by defying lawful  subpoenas, and they followed his orders.   This isn't just an argument. It is a fact. In response to House  subpoenas, OMB sent a letter to Chairman Schiff refusing to comply.  This is what the letter said: ``As directed by the White House  Counsel's October 8, 2019, letter, OMB will not participate in this  partisan and unfair impeachment inquiry.''   In that simple statement, OMB admitted several key points. First, Mr.  Cipollone's letter of October 8 was an official directive from the  White House.   Second, President Trump's blanket order applied to OMB and the three  officials subpoenaed by the House.   Third, President Trump's blanket order not only directed them to  refuse to participate voluntarily; it also directed them to defy House  subpoenas.   Fourth, President Trump's blanket order directly prevented the three  OMB officials from providing testimony to the House.   There is no question about the scope of President Trump's order. It  was total. There is no question about the intent of the order. It was  clearly understood by administration officials, as shown by OMB. And  there is no question the order had an impact. It directly prevented the  House from getting testimony from the three senior officials at OMB.   So here we are. The President of the United States issued an official  order forbidding every single person who works for the executive branch  of our government from giving testimony to the House as part of an  impeachment investigation. That order prevented the House from getting  testimony from witnesses who knew about the President's conduct.   The matter is simple. It is plain to see. The question we here in  Congress must ask is whether we are prepared to turn a blind eye to a  President's obstruction--obstruction not only of oversight but also the  power to determine whether Congress may gather evidence in an  impeachment proceeding.   If the Senate is prepared to accept that, it will mean that not only  President Trump but all Presidents after him will have veto power over  Congress's ability to conduct oversight and the power of impeachment.  The House was not prepared to accept that, and that is why the House  approved article II.   As you consider what you think about this, please know that President  Trump's blanket order was not the end of his campaign to obstruct the  impeachment inquiry. Actually, it was just the beginning.   In addition to his total ban of government witnesses, President Trump  also sent specific explicit orders. He directed key witnesses to defy  subpoenas and to refuse to testify as part of the House's impeachment  inquiry.   As you know, the House subpoenaed Acting White House Chief of Staff  Mick Mulvaney. We wanted his testimony.   At a White House press briefing in October--I know you have seen it  before--Mr. Mulvaney confirmed what we had suspected. Mr. Mulvaney  admitted that President Trump withheld the aid to pressure Ukraine into  announcing an investigation into the conspiracy theory that Ukraine  interfered in the 2016 elections. Here are his words.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)
