 Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  resolution (H. Res. 327) encouraging greater public-private sector  collaboration to promote financial literacy for students and young  adults, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows:                                H. Res. 327         Whereas personal financial literacy is essential to       ensuring that individuals are prepared to make informed       decisions about budgeting, financial planning, wealth       accumulation, higher education loans, 529 savings plans,       managing credit cards, and managing other debt;        Whereas often young people are ill-equipped to handle major       financial decisions in an increasingly complex financial       marketplace;        Whereas personal financial management skills begin to       develop during childhood;        Whereas, according to the report of the Girl Scout Research       Institute entitled ``Having it All: Girls and Financial       Literacy'', only 12 percent of girls feel very confident       about making financial decisions;        Whereas the move away from traditional pensions and toward       defined contribution plans requires more financial education,       so workers need to be equipped with the financial aptitude to       not only save and accumulate assets, but also to turn those       assets into lifetime income;        Whereas the Council for Economic Education found that only       22 States require high schools to offer some type of personal       finance course and only 17 States require that course for       high school graduation;        Whereas a longitudinal research study by the University of       Arizona found that high school and college students who have       been exposed to ongoing financial education show an increase       in financial knowledge;        Whereas the 2015 National Financial Capability Study,       developed in consultation with the Department of the Treasury       and President's Advisory Council on Financial Capability,       updates key measures from the 2009 National Financial       Capability Study of American adults and deepens the       exploration of topics that are highly relevant today,       including student loans and medical debt;        Whereas the Federal Reserve System offers publications in       English and Spanish that provide consumers tips on a broad       range of topics, from avoiding mortgage foreclosure scams to       managing a checking account;        Whereas a study conducted by Daniel Fernandes, John G.       Lynch, Jr., and Richard Netemeyer entitled ``Financial       Literacy, Financial Education and Downstream Financial       Behaviors'' found that it ``is best to provide assistance       just before a decision is made in what is known as `just-in-      time education' ''; and        Whereas on September 6, 2018, the U.S. House of       Representatives passed, by a vote of 406 to 4, H.R. 1635, the       Empowering Students Through Enhanced Financial Counseling       Act, which helps improve financial aid counseling for       students receiving a Pell Grant or a Federal loan: Now,       therefore, be it        Resolved, That the House of Representatives--        (1) emphasizes the importance of raising awareness of       individual financial capability by providing relevant       information, financial workshops, and other decision-making       tools to consumers of all ages;        (2) supports the efforts of Federal financial agencies to       partner with organizations that are focused on developing       opportunities for minorities and women to place talented       young minorities and women in industry internships, summer       employment, and full-time positions;        (3) supports the efforts of the Federal financial agencies       to provide consumers with relevant information and decision-      making tools regarding important financial decisions; and        (4) urges the Department of the Treasury to consult with       the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority and implement       future national financial capability studies.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  on this legislation and to insert extraneous material thereon.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 327, a bipartisan  resolution we introduced in April in honor of Financial Literacy Month.   I would like to start by thanking my friend Congressman French Hill  from Arkansas, who should truly be considered as an original cosponsor  of this resolution for working on this legislation with me.   The aim of this resolution is simple but important. It encourages  collaboration between the public and private sector to promote  financial literacy for students. It emphasizes the importance of  financial literacy for consumers of all ages, and it supports efforts  of Federal agencies to expand financial education resources.   This year alone, approximately 15.1 million students will be in  grades 9 through 12 and almost 20 million students will be enrolled in  colleges and universities.   That is a lot of young people who will soon be entering a complex  financial marketplace where they will have to quickly make important  financial decisions. These include decisions about paying for college,  credit cards, financing a car or a home purchase, preparing for  unexpected emergencies, and saving for retirement.   However, without an understanding of basic financial concepts, these  young people will not be well equipped to make these decisions.   At a time when student loan balances stand at $1.5 trillion and a  majority of private workers have access to defined contribution plans  and not traditional pension benefits, it is even more important for  young people and workers to be financially literate.   Part of the problem is that too few schools incorporate financial  education into their curriculum. According to the Council for Economic  Education, only a third of States require high school students to take  a course in personal finance. In those States, most schools teach the  subject as one portion of another course of study--such as math,  economics, or social studies--while only five States require a  semester-long, standalone personal finance course.   Studies show that financial illiteracy carries significant cost.  Consumers who fail to understand the concept of  [[Page H3313]]  compound interest spend more on transaction fees, run up bigger debts,  and incur higher interest rates on loans.   We also need to work on making financial literacy tools available for  everyone. Unfortunately, levels of financial literacy are lower among  the less educated minorities and women.   Just 19 percent of high school graduates possess basic financial  knowledge and skills. Perhaps even more troubling, according to a  survey by the Consumer Federation of America and the Financial Planning  Association, 21 percent of respondents, including 38 percent of those  with income below $25,000, reported that winning the lottery was ``the  most practical strategy for accumulating several hundred thousand  dollars for their own retirement.''   This is a tragedy in the making, and we can do better.   While Americans are not expected to manage their own legal cases or  medical conditions, they are expected to manage their own finances.   We teach our children to wear seat belts. We teach them to say no to  drugs. We should also be teaching them the financial literacy skills  that they will need to successfully navigate the financial marketplace.   We want to give young people and all consumers the tools they need to  survive. One of the ways in which we can do that is by having Federal  agencies partner with schools, local and State governments, workplaces,  community organizations, nonprofits, and financial service providers.   Whether it is giving students immersive opportunities to see how  money and banking work in the real world or helping train and equip  teachers with the curriculum and materials they need to succeed in the  classroom, Federal agencies should be bold and innovative in their  approaches and leverage the ways in which technology can be used to  further these laudable goals.   We cannot afford to have future generations of Americans grow up  without learning these fundamental skills. For that reason, I urge all  my colleagues to support this resolution.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr.   David Scott).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I would like to again thank my colleague, Congressman Hill, for his  assistance in support of this resolution, and I urge my colleagues to  join us in supporting this important resolution to show Congress'  commitment to ensuring our Nation's students have the essential  financial literacy skills they need to thrive and excel in today's  economy.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1876) to create an interdivisional taskforce at the  Securities and Exchange Commission for senior investors.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1876         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

[[Page H3315]]         (c) Senior Citizen Defined.--For purposes of this section,       the term ``senior citizen'' means an individual over the age       of 65.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  on this legislation and to insert extraneous material thereon.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I am proud to support H.R. 1876, the Senior Security  Act of 2019, a bipartisan bill introduced by Congressman Gottheimer and  Congressman Hollingsworth.   The financial exploitations of senior citizens is a major problem  today, and with the aging of the baby boomer generation, it will only  get worse in the coming years.   By 2030, one in five persons in the U.S. is projected to be 65 or  older. That would equal approximately 75 million people who are senior  citizens.   It is also estimated that nearly one in five Americans over the age  of 65 have been a victim of financial exploitation. This can take many  forms, including being steered towards inappropriate investment, paying  unreasonably high fees for financial services, or outright fraud.   Senior citizens are often targeted because they are more likely to  suffer from problems of memory and judgment, making them vulnerable to  fraud. Exacerbating the issue is that the overwhelming majority of  incidents of elder financial exploitation go unreported to authorities.   The Senior Security Act would help combat elder financial abuse by  creating a task force in the SEC to identify the challenges that senior  investors encounter and areas in which senior investors would benefit  from changes to SEC regulations.   The bill also requires that the GAO conduct a study on the financial  exploitation of senior citizens. The GAO study would give us an  important comprehensive look at this issue, including a breakdown of  the economic costs of financial exploitation of senior citizens,  answers to how often this happens, why such abuses often go unreported,  and factors that contribute to an increased risk of exploitation.   Americans work hard over their lifetime in order to save for  retirement and be financially safe and secure when they get older.  Unscrupulous people and companies would take advantage of these senior  citizens and rob them of their hard-earned money. Those people and  companies should not be able to get away with such egregious behavior.   This bill would allow us to more effectively combat this growing  problem. For that reason, I want to thank the gentleman from New Jersey  (Mr. Gottheimer) and the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Hollingsworth) for  bringing this bipartisan initiative forward. I urge all Members to vote  ``yes.''   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  New Jersey (Mr. Gottheimer), the coauthor of this legislation.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of the time.   Madam Speaker, I want to congratulate, again, Mr. Gottheimer and Mr.  Hollingsworth for having brought this bill to the floor. I urge my  colleagues to join us in supporting this important piece of legislation  to comprehensively examine and strengthen the protections against  financial exploitation of our senior citizens.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to  the resolution (H. Res. 328) supporting the protection of elders  through financial literacy.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows:                                H. Res. 328         Whereas in the context of the financial exploitation of the       elderly, Federal statute defines ``exploitation'' as ``the       fraudulent or otherwise illegal, unauthorized, or improper       act or process of an individual, including a caregiver or       fiduciary, that uses the resources of an elder for monetary       or personal benefit, profit, or gain, or that results in       depriving an elder of rightful access to, or use of,       benefits, resources, belongings, or assets'' (42 U.S.C.       1397j(8)) (``Elder Financial Exploitation'');        Whereas the National Adult Protective Services Association       has stated, ``Elder abuse is vastly under-reported; only one       in 44 cases of financial abuse is ever reported'';        Whereas Elder Financial Exploitation is expected to       increase in the upcoming years as 10,000 baby boomers are       turning 65 each day;        Whereas estimates by the Investor Protection Trust suggest       that as many as one of five citizens over the age of 65 are       victims of the theft of money, property, identity or       belongings;        Whereas according to the National Center on Aging, ``Up to       5 million older Americans are abused every year, and the       annual loss by victims of financial abuse is estimated to be       at least $36.5 billion.'';        Whereas older adults are targeted for Elder Financial       Exploitation through schemes such as fraud by trusted family,       caregivers, and fiduciaries, and through scams by strangers       often committed by international criminal networks;        Whereas common schemes by fraudsters and scammers include,       lottery and sweepstakes scams, telemarketing scams, home-      repair scams, computer-repair scams, investment scams,       internet phishing scams, abuse of fiduciary authority, and       identity theft;        Whereas Financial Literacy Month aims to highlight for all       Americans the importance of establishing and maintaining       healthy financial habits;        Whereas education about healthy financial habits includes       the protection of one's finances from financial exploitation,       especially for older adults who are vulnerable to targeted       frauds and scams;        Whereas to combat this serious financial concern and to       protect the elder community, this education must also extend       to financial institutions, law enforcement, and regulatory       agencies so they may work together to understand and detect       these frauds and scams;        Whereas these partnerships include not only Federal       agencies, but also State, local, and Tribal authorities such       as law enforcement and adult protective services agencies;        Whereas the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN)       is vital to the pursuit of these bad actors, collecting       suspicious activity report (SAR) information and sharing, as       necessary, its data, analysis, and guidance with appropriate       public- and private-sector partners focused on detecting and       ending Elder Financial Exploitation;        Whereas FinCEN, working with Federal consumer and law       enforcement partners engages with financial institutions and       State and local authorities to educate on the signs of Elder       Financial Exploitation;        Whereas FinCEN, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau,       and the Department of Justice issued in 2017 a joint       memorandum to provide information on the use of SARs in the       investigation of Elder Financial Exploitation, building on a       2011 Advisory that identified red flags for detection; and        Whereas despite the broad efforts by law enforcement,       regulatory agencies, financial institutions, and private       sector organizations to educate and share information, Elder       Financial Exploitation persists as a multi-billion dollar       industry, more can be done: Now, therefore, be it        Resolved, That the House of Representatives--  [[Page H3317]]         (1) supports the goals of Financial Literacy Month to raise       public awareness about--        (A) the importance of personal financial education in the       United States; and        (B) the serious consequences that may result from a lack of       understanding about personal finances;        (2) acknowledges that raising awareness of threats to       personal finances, especially for vulnerable, targeted       populations like older adults and their relatives and       caregivers, is only one party of financial literacy;        (3) understands that to combat Elder Financial       Exploitation, it is also necessary to encourage continued       education and collaboration among law enforcement, financial       institutions, regulatory agencies, and private sector       organizations allowing detection, prevention, reporting, and       investigation of these crimes;        (4) supports work being done by FinCEN and its partners to       educate the stakeholders which serve and protect America's       elder community;        (5) urges continued public-private partnership and       appropriate information sharing to prevent, detect, report,       and investigate Elder Financial Exploitation; and        (6) urges action to assist with remediation and reporting,       as well as prevention and detection to have best possible       data, feedback, and incident response.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  on this legislation and to insert extraneous material thereon.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I am proud to support H. Res. 328, a resolution  introduced by Congressman Casten of Illinois and Congressman Rose of  Tennessee.   This bipartisan resolution acknowledges an important component of  financial literacy, and it is raising awareness of threats to personal  finances, especially for vulnerable targeted populations such as older  adults. It also encourages continued public-private partnerships and  information sharing to effectively prevent, detect, report, and  investigate elder financial exploitation.   As we have heard, the baby boomer generation is getting older; 10,000  of them are turning 65 each day. According to the National Center on  Aging, up to 5 million older Americans are abused every year, and the  annual loss by victims of financial abuse is estimated to be at least  $36.5 billion. That is why we need to be proactive about combating this  serious problem on multiple fronts.   We should work to arm our senior citizens with the knowledge they  need to effectively detect and prevent financial exploitation by would- be criminals. Understanding the red flags and warning signs to look for  is important first step.   In addition, we should continue to support efforts by FinCEN and  other regulatory and law enforcement agencies to ensure that  information at the disposal of these agencies is used to better deter  and respond to incidents of elder financial exploitation.   Efforts like H. Res. 328, together with the Senior Security Act of  2019 and the Senior Safe Act of 2018, show Congress' commitment to  supporting our Nation's senior citizens on a bipartisan basis. It also  shows our commitment to encouraging collaboration, public-private  partnerships, and information sharing in order to effectively combat  financial exploitation of senior citizens.   Madam Speaker, for these reasons, I want to thank the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Casten) and the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. John W.  Rose) for bringing this bipartisan initiative forward, and I urge all  Members to vote ``yes.''   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Casten), the co-author of this legislation.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, I want to again congratulate Mr. Casten and Mr. Rose  for having brought this resolution to the floor. I urge my colleagues  to join us in supporting this important resolution to empower senior  citizens and promote public-private partnerships in order to strengthen  our enforcement against crimes of financial exploitation, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
