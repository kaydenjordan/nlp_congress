 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         At the end of division A (before the short title) insert       the following:        Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may       be used to finalize, implement, or enforce the rule submitted       by the Bureau of Land Management relating to ``Onshore Oil       and Gas Operations; Federal and Indian Oil and Gas Leases;       Site Security'', published at 81 Fed. Reg. 81356 (November       17, 2016).    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 504, the gentleman  from New Mexico (Mr. Pearce) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Mexico.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I might  consume.   Onshore Order 3, put in place by the last administration, creates a  number of unnecessary and duplicative burdens that cause energy  production to be much more difficult.   Now, many people visualize that oil wells are drilled into the ground  and then they just produce oil on their own; that it flows to the  surface magically, and it remains unabated through the life of the oil  well. It is not true at all.   What actually happens is that there is a pool of oil at the bottom of  the well, and as it is produced, the production gets smaller each day  until eventually the small production is classified as stripper well  production.   Now, the Saudi Arabians, about every 10 years, come in and kill the  stripper wells because that would be approximately 2 to 3 billion  barrels of oil a year they could produce that would be shut down here.   In my home county of Lee County, New Mexico, we hunker down when we  see these economic attacks coming, and we simply make it through; not  because it is economic, not because it is productive, but because it is  one of the few economic drivers of New Mexico. Oil and gas provides  about 40 percent of our teachers' pay, 40 percent of police pay. So it  is just our way of life.   But the stripper wells are not extremely economic. So when this  Onshore Order 3 came into place, it actually is assisting the Saudi  Arabians to try to drive stripper wells out of existence because it is  the small producers, it is the guys who will stay there and produce the  wells when nobody has economic interest in them. They like sweeping up  the crumbs off of the energy table.   So Onshore Order 3 puts in processes that require monitoring that is  already provided at the point of sale. So it is not as if somehow the  government's being cheated. It just is trying to squeeze more out of  these uneconomic wells.   The estimates are that we have shut down a great number of those  wells, affecting teachers' pay, affecting the economy of New Mexico,  killing jobs.   So my amendment is very simple. It would prevent funds from being  used to fund the BLM Onshore Order Rule No. 3.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.   Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Minnesota is recognized for 5  minutes.   Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, once again, there might be some very  legitimate points that can be worked on out of these stripper wells  that are at the end of their life, and we might find some common ground  on some of your issues, but this is the appropriations bills and this  isn't the place to do it. It should be done in the Policy Committee.   Mr. Chair, we should be going to the Policy Committee, and we should  be asking the Policy Committee to take up and have hearings on these  issues that are very important to some of the Members here in this  House.   So when I look at this amendment on an Appropriations Committee bill,  what it says to me is that it is continuing the administration's agenda  that favors oil and gas industry ahead of other uses of our public  lands. It says to me that the administration has rolled back and  abolished a lot of rules that have been made over many years that are  contained and outlined in the Administrative Procedure Act, which  includes a consideration of public and travel comments so you can go  and register your comment and your concern on it.   The whole point of the site security rule is to protect against the  theft of oil and to make sure that the oil and gas production is  properly accounted for.   So this rule that we are talking about today also streamlines the  process for companies to get new measurement technologies to make sure  that they are using the most innovative technology. I think, after 25  years, most businesses, most people who want to make sure that they are  paying for product, want to make sure that it is being measured and  accounted for right.   This rule was also recommended by the GAO and the Department of the  Interior's IG, the Royalty Policy Committee regarding the BLM's  production of verification efforts. And those are things that, quite  often, we do to safeguard and to protect to make sure that the  taxpayer, when involved on public lands, is receiving fair value for  the royalty.   So there is a rulemaking process that is comprehensive. There is a  rulemaking process that is transparent. And there is also a way to  change the rule that is comprehensive, transparent, and allows the  public to have their voice, and that is to address these issues in the  Policy Committee.   So the main reason--and I want to be really clear about this--for  opposing many of these amendments is they are properly done in the  Policy Committee, a committee which I served on when I first came here.  Mr. Chair, I think that is where these amendments need to start being  direct so that we can do the real work and make sure that when Members  come to the floor, that they know that we have had a full vetting and  full transparency.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  2245     Mr. Chairman, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Calvert), the chairman of the committee and  subcommittee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Arkansas (Mr. Westerman).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Arkansas (Mr. Westerman).    Mr. Chairman, I think it is clear that what is at stake  is 2.6 billion barrels of oil a day made from wells that make maybe one  or two barrels, three barrels a day. They are not extremely economic,  but those businesses are located in New Mexico. Those businesses keep  their headquarters there. They are just small mom-and-pop operators  that care enough about the energy business to stay out there, and so  when the government does things that says we are not going to let you  operate, that we are going to shut you down, it accomplishes what the  Saudi Arabians have never been able to accomplish, and that is defeat  the spirit that says we can survive any attacks.   Mr. Chair, again, I urge people to support this amendment and the  underlying bill, H.R. 3354, and I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from New Mexico (Mr. Pearce).   The amendment was agreed to.                    Amendment No. 63 Offered by Mr. Pearce    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 63  printed in House Report 115-297.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         At the end of division A (before the short title) insert       the following:        Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may       be used to finalize, implement, or enforce the rule submitted       by the Bureau of Land Management relating to ``Waste       Prevention, Production Subject to Royalties, and Resource       Conservation'', published at 81 Fed. Reg. 83008 (November 18,       2016).    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 504, the gentleman  from New Mexico (Mr. Pearce) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Mexico for 5 minutes.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, the venting and flaring rule was, again, put in place  by the last administration, intending for BLM to regulate methane.  Historically, that had been regulated by the EPA.   Now, keep in mind that methane production from oil wells is down 21  percent since 1990, while production is going up. Production is going  up, methane production is down. So we wonder why the administration  came at the last second to put this rule into place.   Basically, the argument is exactly the same for opposing that venting  and flaring rule that what is at stake are not the good wells. Those  wells are going to produce in their economic with whatever burdens are  placed on them. What is at stake are the stripper wells which, again,  make up 2.6 billion barrels of production in the U.S. every day, 145  million barrels of production in the State of New Mexico. So you can  imagine the economic catastrophe if that 145 million barrels weren't  available to the State to both tax and to provide jobs.   Again, 40 percent of New Mexico's pay, roughly the teachers' pay, the  police pay, roughly that much comes from oil and gas production. You  can do the math and see how much New Mexico would be affected if this  venting and flaring rule continues to place the burden on the well.   The estimates are for each well that a cost of $60,000 is going to be  required to come into compliance. Again, keep in mind that this rule  comes after the methane is more carefully controlled today under  greater production than it ever has been. The estimates are that we  will lose thousands of wells if this venting and flaring rule  continues.   Again, it is the stripper wells which are most at harm. If we lose  the 2.6 billion barrels of stripper well production every year because  of the high cost of implementation of the venting and flaring rule,  that is going to mean we are less energy independent, that we rely more  on outside sources. It is going to drive the price of gasoline up. The  people who can afford it least are the people at the bottom of the  economic ladder. They will be the ones penalized most by rising prices  of gasoline and decreasing supplies of oil.   Mr. Chair, again, I would urge people to support this amendment, the  underlying bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.   Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Minnesota is recognized for 2  minutes.   Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  New Mexico (Ms. Michelle Lujan Grisham).   Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico. Mr. Chair, I want to thank  my colleague for yielding me time.   Mr. Chair, yesterday the House passed a $7.9 billion downpayment to  address the destruction caused by Hurricane Harvey, which is projected  now to cost as much as $180 billion--by far, today, the costliest  hurricane to hit the United States.   Today, we are considering an amendment which would prohibit BLM from  implementing a rule to address the wasteful venting, flaring, and  leaking of methane, which is a climate change-causing emission 30 times  more powerful than carbon dioxide.   New Mexico is currently home to the largest methane hot spot in the  world. Not only is methane a powerful greenhouse gas, but every cubic  foot of gas that is wasted into the atmosphere cheats hardworking New  Mexican taxpayers out of precious royalty and tax payments which go  toward public education, infrastructure, and community development  programs.   Our State desperately needs these investments, and we cannot afford  to let money disappear into thin air. BLM, in fact, should work with  stakeholders, especially small independent producers who have low- producing wells to make this workable. But taking a sledgehammer to our  Nation's energy policy is a shortsighted and counterproductive effort.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment and to  collaborate to make this rule effective for producers and taxpayers  alike.   Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Calvert), the chairman of the subcommittee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Arizona (Mr. Gosar).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Arizona (Mr. Gosar).
