 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R.  1180, the Working Families Flexibility Act, and encourage all of my  colleagues to do the same. This commonsense piece of legislation,  sponsored by my friend and colleague from Alabama, Martha Roby, would  empower private sector workers with the flexibility to choose comp time  as compensation for working overtime hours instead of added wages.   Specifically, the provisions of this legislation would be completely  voluntary for workers, allow them to exchange their accrued time for  full overtime pay at any time or for any reason, and would maintain the  protections of the Fair Labor Standards Act, such as the standard 40- hour workweek.                                time  1600    Mr. Speaker, I have heard our friends on the other side of the aisle  express opposition to giving private sector employees this choice. I  would point out that the public sector employees have enjoyed the  ability to use comp time to maintain a work-life balance for 30 years.  We are simply doing the same thing for private sector employees that  public sector employees have the right to do today.   H.R. 1180 would benefit workers who want more flexibility to decide  where they spend the time, with their families or pursue  entrepreneurial or education ambitions outside the workplace, and these  individuals should be admired for their efforts.   At its most basic level, this legislation is about choice and the  belief that hardworking employees know their needs better than  Washington bureaucrats. House Republicans believe it is time to adapt  our labor laws to meet the needs of a rapidly changing 21st century  workplace instead of imposing a one-size-fits-all, Washington-knows- best model.   It is time to empower employees to make choices on what will allow  them to better balance work with their personal lives. This commonsense  legislation will ultimately improve not only their benefits but their  lives.   I want to again encourage my colleagues to support H.R. 1180.
