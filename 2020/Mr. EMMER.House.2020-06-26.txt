 Mr. Speaker, on June 26th, I was unable to be present in  the House Chamber to cast my vote on two pieces of legislation. If  present, I would have voted ``nay'' on passage of H.J. Res. 76 (RC  120), ``yea'' on the Motion to Recommit (RC 121), and ``nay'' on  passage of H.R. 51 (RC 122).                             Personal Explanation
