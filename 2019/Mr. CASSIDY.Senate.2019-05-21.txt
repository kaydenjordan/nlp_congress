 Madam President, this month is Mental Health Awareness  Month, and the goal of Mental Health Awareness Month is to recognize  the importance for personal well-being, the need for research and  education, dispelling the stigmas associated with mental illness, and  to improve mental healthcare to ensure that care is available to ensure  that the first episode of mental illness is the last.   A goal with Mental Health Awareness Month is the awareness that is  necessary for the programs to be implemented so that that young person  with their first episode is returned to wholeness, and, again, as I  said earlier, the first episode is the last. It recognizes that mental  health is a societal issue associated with homelessness, crime,  suicide, physical health, and public health issues.   Now, when you speak of mental health, it is a little bit almost like:  Oh, my gosh, this is going to be a futile issue. It is so difficult for  someone who has serious mental illness to return them to wholeness. It  is so difficult that sometimes the individual, their family, and  society throws up their hands and says: There is nothing to do, so why  try.   You see manifestations of that with the homeless people walking  around this city and every city in the United States, many of whom are  mentally ill; yet there can be hope.   I called a person back home from Baton Rouge, LA, and asked her for a  [[Page S2997]]  story, if you will, of how someone with mental illness issues can be  returned to wholeness, so let me tell you about Mary. When you walk  with Mary, you can't help but feel happy, happy, happy. That is because  Mary radiates the joy of how Capital Area Human Services helped change  her life.   Mary says:         I go out and help the community every day. I became       successful in my life because of my faith in God and because       of the wonderful people at Capital Area Human Services. Today       I give back to the community what Capital Area has given to       me.    It wasn't always this way. For nearly 20 years before being referred  to Capital Area Human Services, Mary lived in group homes and was  dependent upon others for basic needs.   I am now quoting Mary:         I weighed 340 pounds. I was sick all the time, was in and       out of hospitals. I was barely able to function. I was on so       many medicines I could not keep track.    When Mary came to Capital Area Human Services in 2006, she was first  helped at the Margaret Dumas Center at the Government Street location.  She eventually entered the total health program, and even more dramatic  changes began.   Now, let me point out as a physician--I am a doctor--I have learned  from folks such as the people I am quoting now that mental health is  often associated with physical health problems. So someone who is  seriously mentally ill is more likely to die in their 50s than they are  in their 80s with untreated hypertension, diabetes, or perhaps, because  they are homeless, subject to violence on the streets.   So let me now go back to Mary's story. When she entered the total  health program, she lost nearly 100 pounds, no longer needed to take  blood pressure medicine, changed her diet, participated in fitness  programs, and continued to attend mental health therapy sessions.   Today Mary is a different person. She lives independently in her own  apartment, attends Sacred Heart of Jesus Catholic Church, walks 2 hours  every day to volunteer for various duties at the St. Agnes Catholic  Church soup kitchen, where she also sings for the attendees. Mary  credits the nuns at St. Agnes for teaching her how to cook, prepare  meals, and serve.   Also, Mary is a regular volunteer at the Society of St. Vincent de  Paul and at the Baton Rouge General Hospital chapel, where she reads  Scriptures for some of the services.   Mary said she loves Capital Area Human Services, tells everyone she  knows about the people who helped her, particularly Kesha, John, the  staff at Margaret Dumas, the staff at the Government Street location,  and former total health employees Roy and Ricky.   She says:         I was motivated and didn't give up. It made me happy to do       this for myself. I proved that I could do it, and I'm doing       it. It's winter, but I'm out there anyway.    Now, I give that kind of personal story to give an example of someone  with serious mental illness returned to wholeness. Now, I love that  because I always tell folks when I speak that we in Washington, DC, can  propose legislation, but unless there is local leadership, nothing good  happens.   In 2016, I collaborated with Chris Murphy, as well as Eddie Bernice  Johnson and Tim Murphy in the House, to pass the Mental Health Reform  Act. It increased access to mental healthcare for adults and children,  it strengthened leadership and accountability for Federal mental health  and substance abuse programs, and it established new programs for early  intervention. It was called by Senator Alexander the largest reform to  our mental health system in decades. I continue to work with President  Trump's administration to implement these reforms.   Now, none of this Federal legislation makes a difference unless there  is State and local leadership, as was demonstrated in the story which I  gave. Last October, I held a mental health summit in Baton Rouge and  brought together Federal, State, and local leaders, and the purpose was  to discuss proven methods in how to work together to improve the  provision of mental health services in both Louisiana and the United  States.   There is still important work to do. If we are going to return these  folks to wholeness, these folks--our family members, our neighbors, our  fellow Americans.   The Mental Health Parity bill became law 10 years ago, but patients  still have trouble accessing mental healthcare in the same way they  access physical healthcare, caused by, among other things, the lack of  mental health providers, prior authorization requirements, and  reimbursement rate setting. I am committed to ensuring patients have  access to the treatment so they return to wholeness.   We need the story of Mary not to be something so unusual that it is  read upon the Senate floor, but something which is so common that we  know it to be true. Instead of throwing up our hands--kind of, oh, my  gosh, serious mental illness; there is nothing to do--instead we look  to hope with a future for someone who could be returned to wholeness so  that her first episode of mental illness is her last episode of mental  illness.   I yield the floor.
