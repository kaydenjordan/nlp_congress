 Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the 200th  anniversary of the Town of Canton, ME. Canton was built with a spirit  of determination and resiliency that still guides the community today,  and this is a time to celebrate the generations of hard-working and  caring people who have made it such a wonderful place to live, work,  and raise families.   The year of Canton's incorporation, 1821, was but one milestone in a  long journey of progress. For thousands of years, the land of fields,  rivers, lakes, and forests of what is now Oxford County was the home of  the Abenaki Tribe, and Canton Point, or Rokomeko, was the headquarters  of the Anasagunticook Band of the People of the Dawn. The reverence the  Abenaki had for the natural beauty and resources of the region is  upheld by the people of Canton today.   In the 1790s, following America's independence, an early settlement  called Phipp's Canada was established. Maine achieved statehood in  1820, and on February 5 of the following year, the town of Canton was  incorporated. With the mighty Androscoggin River providing power,  Canton soon was home to lumber and grain mills, along with many other  small industries. When the first paper mill opened in nearby Rumford in  1893, the people of Canton were part of the skilled and dedicated  workforce that built a great Maine industry. The prosperity produced by  hard work and determination was invested in schools and churches to  create a true community.   Maine is known as ``Vacationland,'' and Canton has played a key role  in the development of our State's tourism industry. A guidebook to the  region published in 1888 described the easternmost town in Oxford  County as ``one of the most beautiful and charming in all this  attractive region.'' With guests arriving by train and, later, by bus  and car, some of the first family vacation resorts were established on  the shores of Lake Anasagunticook. Today, visitors and residents alike  enjoy Canton's scenery, history, and outdoor recreation opportunities.  The energy and planning that are going into Canton's yearlong  bicentennial celebration demonstrate the pride townspeople have in  their town.   The celebration of Canton's 200th anniversary is not merely about the  passing of time. It is about human accomplishment. We celebrate the  people who, from the dawn of our Nation to our time, have pulled  together, cared for one another, and built a great community. Thanks to  those who came before, Canton, ME, has a wonderful history. Thanks to  those there today, it has a bright future.                            ____________________
