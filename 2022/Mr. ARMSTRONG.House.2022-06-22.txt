 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the  Restoring Hope for Mental Health and Well-Being Act.   This bipartisan mental health package includes my legislation, the  Summer Barrow Prevention, Treatment, and Recovery Act. This bill  reauthorizes several substance use disorder programs administered by  SAMHSA that help local communities provide substance use disorder and  mental health services to those most in need.   This is particularly important for rural States like North Dakota,  where individuals struggle to access all treatment options that may  work for them.   The package also includes the Mainstreaming Addiction Treatment Act,  or MAT Act. The MAT Act would remove the burdensome requirement that a  healthcare practitioner apply for a separate waiver, known as the X  waiver, through the Drug Enforcement Agency to prescribe certain drugs  for substance use disorder treatment.   The X waiver requirement limits access to lifesaving treatment, which  is particularly painful considering recent news that drug overdose  deaths hit a record high of more than 107,000 in 2021.   Lastly, I offer my support for an amendment I offered with my friend  Congressman Trone of Maryland that will come to the floor soon. Our  amendment would add the State Opioid Response Grants Act to this  program.   This amendment will provide $8.75 billion over 5 years in flexible  financing for State Opioid Response grants and Tribal Opioid Response  grants, providing States and Tribes certainty and stability to  implement prevention, treatment, and recovery.
