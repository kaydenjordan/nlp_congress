 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 645, I call  up the bill (H.R. 38) to amend title 18, United States Code, to provide  a means by which nonresidents of a State whose residents may carry  concealed firearms may also do so in the State, and ask for its  immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 38.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 38, the Concealed Carry  Reciprocity Act of 2017.   Mr. Speaker, throughout my career in elected office, I have believed  in and adhered to two fundamental principles regarding firearms policy:  first, the right guaranteed to law-abiding Americans by the Second  Amendment must be aggressively protected and preserved; second, the  laws we have on the books need to be enforced to the fullest extent  possible. The bipartisan bill before us today does both.   H.R. 38 ensures that law-abiding citizens' Second Amendment right  does not end when they cross State lines. The bill allows law-abiding  gun owners with valid State-issued concealed carry firearm permits or  those who live in so-called constitutional carry States to carry a  concealed firearm in any other State that also allows concealed carry.   We know that citizens who carry a concealed firearm are not only  better prepared to act in their own self-defense, but also in the  defense of others. Take, for instance, an incident that occurred just  last November on a highway in Florida. Lee County Sheriff's Deputy Dean  Bardes had just concluded a high-speed chase just off Interstate 75. As  Deputy Bardes approached to apprehend the suspect, the suspect, Edward  Strother, violently attacked Deputy Bardes.   A witness on the scene told reporters that the attacker ``just  started punching him and hitting and hitting and hitting. I was afraid  for the police officer. I thought he was going to kill him.''   Fortunately for Deputy Bardes, Ashad Russell, a Florida concealed  carry permit holder, was also watching the attack unfold. Mr. Russell  pulled his gun and approached the altercation. He told Strother he  would shoot him if he didn't stop beating the deputy. The State  Attorney's Office said Strother ignored Russell's commands to stop  beating the deputy, so Russell fired his gun three times, hitting and  fatally wounding the assailant. Lee County Sheriff Mike Scott has  hailed Russell as a hero.   Importantly, this bill also contains the Fix NICS Act of 2017. This  is a bipartisan and bicameral measure. The Fix NICS Act takes steps to  ensure that State and Federal agencies enter all relevant records into  the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check System. This bill  will help ensure people who are legally prohibited from having guns,  like those with violent felony convictions, do not obtain them.   The shooting at Virginia Tech and the church shootings in Charleston,  South Carolina, and Sutherland Springs, Texas, are tragic reminders of  what can happen when all relevant records are not entered into the  system.   Our NICS system is only as good as the information within it. This  important piece of legislation will ensure that more of the information  already required to be uploaded to NICS under current law is actually  placed in the NICS system.   Taken together, the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act and the Fix NICS  Act preserve and protect the right guaranteed to us by the Second  Amendment and ensure that those prohibited by existing law from  receiving a firearm are prevented from doing so.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this  legislation.   I want to thank the lead sponsor, Mr. Hudson of North Carolina, for  his hard work on this bill. I would also like to thank the authors of  the Fix NICS provisions, Mr. Culberson and Mr. Cuellar, for their  important contributions to the legislation before us today.  [[Page H9689]]    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  North Carolina (Mr. Hudson), the lead sponsor of the legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 15 seconds, and I include  in the Record an article entitled, `` `Good Samaritan' Kills Active  Shooter in Texas Sports Bar,'' in which a shooter with two guns and two  knives entered a sports bar and was shot by an individual that the  police labeled a Good Samaritan who happened to be eating at the  restaurant with his wife. He was a concealed carry permit holder. He  told his wife to get down on the ground, and then he shot the  assailant.                      [From nbcnews.com, May 4, 2017]     `Good Samaritan' Kills Active Shooter in Texas Sports Bar: Police                            (By Phil McCausland)         A ``good Samaritan'' with a gun killed an active shooter       who may have been gearing up for a deadly rampage at a Texas       sports bar Wednesday night, police said.        When 48-year-old James Jones walked inside the Zona       Caliente Sports Bar, started yelling and then allegedly shot       and killed Cesar Perez--a 37-year-old restaurant manager       who'd attempted to calm him down--Arlington police said       witnesses were afraid they would be next.        In addition to the gun used to kill Perez, police say Jones       had another semiautomatic pistol and two knives on him. The       serial number on the second gun had been scratched off, and       Jones did not have a gun license, police said.        ``He definitely had the capacity, if he wanted, to commit       further violence and potentially kill other patrons in the       business,'' Arlington Police Lieutenant Chris Cook told NBC       News, adding that it did not appear that the shooter knew his       victim.        An armed ``good Samaritan''--as the Arlington Police       labeled him--happened to be eating at the restaurant with his       wife. A concealed carry permit holder, he told her to get       down on the ground and then shot Jones in the back.        ``I don't think the shooter even knew where the rounds were       coming from because he started shooting at the front door,''       Cook said, who described the scene as ``chaotic.''        Police reviewed video surveillance and pieced together the       incident via witness interviews, but it remains unclear how       many shots were fired by either individual. Police were       looking into Jones' background to see whether he suffered       from any mental illnesses and were awaiting test results to       find out if he was under the influence.        The man who took down Jones wished to maintain his       anonymity, police said, noting that he felt overwhelmed but       relieved that he prevented further violence.        ``We're thankful that the good `Samaritan' acted quickly       and decisively to end the threat,'' Cook said. ``We never       recommend people get involved. That's a personal decision       that a citizen has to make.''        Use of force and firearms expert Emanuel Kapelsohn told NBC       News that, from his understanding, the man who took down the       shooter reacted appropriately.        ``I think it's to be applauded,'' he said. ``Not everybody       in the world ought to own a gun. Not everybody in the world       ought to carry a gun. Not everyone in the world ought to       engage an armed criminal where innocent people could be       potentially injured.''        ``But this good Samaritan obviously had the ability to do       what he did,'' Kapelsohn added. ``Who knows how many people       would be dead if he had not acted?''

This  is taking action by passing this legislation.                                   Attorney General of Missouri,                               Jefferson City, MO, December 1, 2017.      Re Constitutional Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act of 2017 (S.           446) and Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act of 2017 (H.R.           38).       Hon. Mitch McConnell,      Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Chuck Schumer,      Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Democratic Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Congressional Leaders: As the chief legal officers of       our States, we, the undersigned 23 state Attorneys General,       write in support of the Constitutional Concealed Carry       Reciprocity Act of 2017 (S. 446) and the Concealed Carry       Reciprocity Act of 2017 (H.R. 38). We share a strong interest       in the protection of our citizens' Second Amendment right to       keep and bear arms, and we are committed to supporting       federal and state policies to preserve that constitutional       right. These bills, if enacted, would eliminate significant       obstacles to the exercise of the right to keep and bear arms       for millions of Americans in every State.        The Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution provides an       individual right to own and carry a firearm for self-defense.       The Amendment states that ``[a] well regulated Militia, being       necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the       people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.'' U.S.       Const. amend. II. As the Supreme Court recognized in District       of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. 570, 592 (2008), the Second       Amendment ``guarantee[s] the individual right to possess and       carry weapons in case of confrontation.'' Indeed,       ``individual self-defense is `the central component' of the       Second Amendment right.'' McDonald v. City of Chicago, 561       U.S. 742, 767 (2010) (quoting Heller, 554 U.S. at 599).        The core interest protected by this right is self-defense       by law-abiding citizens. This right therefore extends to       weapons ``in common use'' and ``typically possessed by law-      abiding citizens for lawful purposes.'' Heller, 554 U.S. at       624-25, 627 (quoting United States v. Miller, 307 U.S. 174,       179 (1939)).        The Second Amendment historically has guaranteed the right       to carry firearms outside the home for self-defense. In       Heller, the Supreme Court relied on the preeminent authority       on English law for the founding generation, William       Blackstone, who explained that the right to self-defense,       codified by the framers in the Second Amendment, was an       ``individual right protecting against both public and private       violence.'' Heller, 554 U.S. at 594 (citations omitted). As       Justices Thomas and Gorsuch have written, `` `[s]elf-defense       has to take place wherever the person happens to be,' and in       some circumstances a person may be more vulnerable in a       public place than in his own house.'' Peruta v. California,       137 S. Ct. 1995, 1998-99 (2017) (Thomas, J., and Gorsuch, J.,       dissenting from the denial of certiorari) (quoting Eugene       Volokh, Implementing the Right to Keep and Bear Arms for       Self-Defense: An Analytical Framework and a Research Agenda,       56 UCLA L. Rev. 1443, 1515 (2009)).        To be sure, the right to carry firearms for self-defense is       not unlimited, and the Supreme Court has stated that its       decisions do not cast doubt on the ``longstanding       prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the       mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in       sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or       laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial       sale of arms.'' Heller, 554 U.S. at 626-27. But these       exceptions all assume that the right to carry a weapon in       self-defense applies in public places generally.        The Second Amendment, moreover, applies to both the Federal       Government and the States. The Second Amendment is a right       ``fundamental to our scheme of ordered liberty,'' and so it       applies not just to the Federal Government but also to the       States under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth       Amendment. McDonald, 561 U.S. at 767; see also Caetano v.       Massachusetts, 136 S. Ct. 1027, 1027 (2016) (per curiam).        Nevertheless, some activist courts have held that the       Second Amendment has no application at all outside the home,       and thus have upheld state laws banning any firearm ownership       outside the home. See, e.g., Peruta v. California, 137 S. Ct.       1995, 1997, 1999 (2017) (Thomas, J. and Gorsuch, J.,       dissenting from  [[Page H9695]]       the denial of certiorari) (collecting cases); e.g., Williams       v. State, 10 A.3d 1167, 1177 (Md. 2011); Mack v. United       States, 6 A.3d 1224, 1236 (D.C. 2010). Further, ten states       refuse to recognize any out-of-state concealed carry permits,       and many more refuse to recognize out-of-state concealed       carry permits unless certain conditions are met.        The citizen interest in self-defense, supported and       protected by the Second Amendment, is called into serious       question by such blanket refusals to permit carrying firearms       in self-defense outside the home or to allow non-resident       visitors to carry concealed weapons. Because some States       refuse to give the Second Amendment its full import, Congress       should enact concealed-carry reciprocity legislation, to help       implement and enforce the constitutional right to self-      defense for millions of law-abiding Americans across the       country.        The exercise of Congress's power is particularly warranted       in this case because the States that refuse to allow law-      abiding, non-resident visitors to carry concealed weapons       place their occupants in greater danger--not less--from gun       violence. These States leave citizens without any real option       for self-defense, and so it is not surprising that they have       been unable to show that their regulations reduce crime.        Authorizing permit holders to carry across state lines will       not result in an increased risk of crime. Concealed carry       permit holders are among the most law-abiding members of       society, and those States that allow for reciprocal       concealed-carry permits have not encountered any significant       safety issues. In Texas, for example, state data on permit       holders shows that, compared to the general public, they are       ``ten times less likely to commit a crime, eleven times less       likely to commit an aggravated assault with a deadly weapon,       and seven times less likely to commit deadly conduct with a       firearm.'' Kevin Ballard, Peruta v. County of San Diego: An       Individual Right to Self-Defense Outside the Home and the       Application of Strict Scrutiny to Second Amendment       Challenges, 47 Golden Gate U. L. Rev. 25, 59 (2017).        Further, strong evidence indicates that concealed-carry       permit holders actually deter and reduce crime. Those who       engage in lawful and licensed concealed carry are not only       less likely to be involved in criminal activity themselves,       but their presence also deters others from engaging in       violent crime. See John R. Lott, Jr., More Guns, Less Crime       (University of Chicago Press, 3d ed. 2010). County-level data       for the entire United States from 1977 to 2000, the period in       which many concealed-carry laws took effect, shows annual       reductions in murder rates between 1.5 percent and 2.3       percent for each additional year that a right-to-carry law       was in effect, and the total economic benefit from reduced       crimes usually ranges between approximately $2 billion and $3       billion per year.

Rev. 1313       (2003). ``Violent crime falls after right-to-carry laws are       adopted, with bigger drops the longer the right-to-carry laws       are in effect.'' John R.

According to police and witnesses at the scene, Engle, who       is an usher at the church, confronted the accused shooter,       Emanuel Kidega Samson. Engle was then pistol-whipped by       Samson. The two got into a scuffle before Samson shot himself       in the chest.        Engle, who has a carry permit, went out to his car to get a       gun, despite suffering a head injury.        Engle then went back inside the church to confront Samson       and held him at gunpoint until authorities arrived.        Engle, 22, declined an on-camera interview but did send a       statement.        When complimented about his heroism, Engle said, ``I do not       want to be labeled a hero. The real heroes are the police,       first responders, medical staff and doctors who have helped       me and everyone affected.''        ``I've been going to this church my whole life,'' Engle       said ``I would have never, ever thought something like this       would have happened.''        ``(He's) just an outstanding young man, even before       today,'' said Tammy Adcock, one of Engle's neighbors. ``Today       just proved his character.''        Engle also asked for prayers for not just the victims, but       for the shooter and the shooter's family.        ``They are hurting as well,'' Engle said.        Engle and 64-year-old Catherine Dickerson were taken to       Skyline Medical Center with non-life-threatening injuries.        Both Engle and Dickerson have since been released from the       hospital.                                   ____                     [From Florida Today, Nov. 27, 2017]    Schlenker Shooting: Rockledge Gunman Recovering, Worked at Brevard                             Elementary School                              (By J.D. Gallop)         The 28-year-old man suspected of carrying out a shooting at       a Rockledge auto shop last week that left one person dead and       another paralyzed, also worked as a part-time custodian at an       elementary school, authorities said.        Brevard County Public School officials confirmed that       Robert Lorenzo Bailey Jr. was employed with the district       since 2014, working at Lewis Carroll Elementary on Merritt       Island.        ``He's a part-time custodian,'' said Jennifer Wolfinger,       spokeswoman for the school district, adding that Bailey       remains on the payroll. Officials are reviewing his       employment records.        Bailey wandered onto the Schlenker Automotive property on       Friday, and using a .40-caliber handgun, started firing on       workers, killing 50-year-old Schlenker employee Roger Lee       Smith, Rockledge police said. Smith had stepped into the       parking lot after he heard a shot that paralyzed a 25-year-      old, unidentified co-worker, according to police. Police have       not released the identity.        Two other workers--both concealed weapons permit holders--      confronted the gunman and engaged in a shootout that left the       suspect wounded. Bailey continues to recover at Holmes       Regional Medical Center in Melbourne.        The shooting--which happened the day after Thanksgiving--      left family members of the victim, a husband, father and       grandfather, devastated.        ``He would do anything . . . anything for anybody. It hurts       that somebody would hurt him,'' said Bnickcole Smith, a 27-      year-old niece of the victim. ``That man took from us a       longtime husband, a father figure and a grandfather. He loved       being with his family and was such a fun, outgoing person.       Personally, it's just destroyed me.''        Bailey, known to friends as a bouncer and a regular in the       Cocoa Village pub scene, did not have any connections to the       autoshop, police said. Police have not yet confirmed any       criminal or medical history that might give insight into a       possible motive.        Others who knew Bailey, including a manager at the Dog and       Bone British Pub, said he seemed to be acting differently       lately. The manager said Bailey was fired from his job at the       pub after Bailey confronted a patron. Another manager       suggested Bailey see a doctor after Bailey aired thoughts       that he believed the patron had a gun and was attempting to       kill him.        ``You could tell he had gone through some type of stress or       disorder. He kept to himself,'' said 26-year-old Paul Lyal,       who learned about the shooting late Sunday. Lyal said he met       Bailey at the Dog and Bone British Pub several years ago.        ``Sometimes he would be quiet, other times out laughing       with everyone. He would even do karaoke or just go upstairs       and dance for hours,'' Lyal recalled. ``I'm just shocked like       everyone else.''        Rockledge detectives did not comment on Bailey's injuries       or surgery over the weekend to treat his wounds.        Lou Schlenker, owner of the business that has operated in       Rockledge for 36 years, released a statement to Florida Today       on Sunday evening:        ``In this difficult time of mourning the loss of Roger and       the severe injuries that (our other employee) has sustained,       we would like  [[Page H9697]]       to thank all of the community for the overwhelming support       and prayers we have received. We know there will be a long       healing process ahead of us but we want to reassure everyone       that this is an organization full of dedicated, courageous,       and heroic individuals serving this community,'' the       statement read.

Mr. Speaker, I claim the time in opposition to the  motion to recommit.    Mr. Speaker, with this motion to recommit, my  colleagues on the other side of the aisle are trying in vain to hamper  the passage of this important legislation. H.R. 38 seeks to allow law- abiding citizens the ability to exercise their Second Amendment right  when they cross State lines.   The Supreme Court held in District of Columbia v. Heller that the  Second Amendment protects an individual's right to possess a firearm  unconnected with service in a militia and to use that firearm for  traditionally lawful purposes, such as self-defense. Further, the Court  concluded that the Second Amendment guarantees the individual right to  possess and carry weapons in case of confrontation, and that central to  this right is the ``inherent right of self-defense.''   Additionally, in McDonnell v. City of Chicago, the Supreme Court  ruled that the right of an individual to ``keep and bear arms,'' as  protected under the Second Amendment, is incorporated by the Due  Process Clause of the 14th Amendment against the States.   An individual's Second Amendment right is no different than the First  Amendment's protections on speech and free exercise of religious  expression and the Fourth Amendment's prohibition against unreasonable  search and seizure or the Eighth Amendment's prohibition of cruel and  unusual punishment.   Can you imagine my colleagues' outcries if any of the aforementioned  rights stopped at their State's borders? Believe me, I can. They would  be loud and boisterous about it, and justifiably so. Despite that fact,  here they are trying to derail a bill that affords the Second Amendment  the same respect.    Now, this motion to recommit attempts to extend the law, the Federal  law, which already bars people from having firearms if they have been  convicted of a felony or misdemeanor domestic violence crimes, by  saying any violent crime be covered. And they define violent crime by  saying it means ``any offense that involves injury or the threat of  injury to the person of another.''   Well, in my State of Virginia and in most other States, it is up to  the police officer in a traffic accident, if you rear-end somebody and  you injure them, whether or not you are simply charged with a traffic  offense or you are charged with a criminal offense.
