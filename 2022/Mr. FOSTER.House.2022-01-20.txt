 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank the men and women who  have been on the front lines of this pandemic from the very beginning:  our healthcare workers. On MLK Day, I had a chance to deliver care  packages to hospitals and clinics in my district in Joliet, Aurora, and  Naperville as a small token of appreciation for the tireless work of  our healthcare workers.   As our Nation confronts this, hopefully final, winter surge of COVID,  we should all keep in mind the people who are still going to work every  day to care for people who are sick. Their dedication to their jobs is  truly inspiring, and they are literally saving lives every day. After  almost 2 years of battling COVID, our healthcare workers are mentally  and physically exhausted, but yet they still show up every day to  provide care for others.   We can all learn so much from them.   I am honored to represent so many of them in my district in places  like Edward Hospital in Naperville, Silver Cross Hospital in New Lenox,  Rush Copley Medical Center in Aurora, and Aunt Martha's Health Center  in Joliet; just to name a few.   So I want every healthcare worker in America--doctors, nurses, and  support staff--to know that they are not alone. I thank them for being  there.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to share some great news about  our efforts to protect Lake Michigan and the rivers and lakes  throughout Illinois and the entire Great Lakes region from invasive  Asian carp.   Yesterday, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers announced that thanks to  the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, $225 million of  new funding is headed to Illinois for the Brandon Road Project. The  Brandon Road Lock and Dam on the Des Plaines River in Joliet, Illinois,  is the last best line of defense against the spread of this invasive  species into waterways not just in Illinois but to lakes and  tributaries throughout the entire Great Lakes basin.   The economic and environmental consequences of allowing this  infestation to spread would be massive, and that is why securing  Federal funding for the Brandon Road Project has been one of my most  important priorities for several years.   Last year, I joined my colleagues on the Great Lakes Task Force to  urge the Army Corps of Engineers to prioritize the Brandon Road  Project. And 3 years ago, I hosted members of the then-Republican- controlled Transportation and Infrastructure Committee for a tour of  the Brandon Road site so that they could have a first-person look at  the importance of this project.   This injection of much-needed funding means that we can move forward  on getting this project done and protecting our waterways, and not just  our Great Lakes, but the beautiful lakes and rivers that define the  entire Great Lakes region for generations to come.   I just wish that more of my Republican colleagues had actually voted  for the bipartisan infrastructure bill to provide the funding for this  great project.                                Infrastructure     Mr. Speaker, for decades, Americans have been asking  their elected leaders to fix crumbling roads and bridges and modernize  our Nation's transportation infrastructure. For decades, politicians of  both parties promised to deliver on an infrastructure package.  President Trump even promised that he would be the one person to get it  done. But he didn't, not even when Republicans controlled the House,  Senate, and Presidency.                                time  1215    It was President Biden and this Democratic Congress that finally got  it done even though more than 90 percent of my Republican colleagues  voted against it. Thanks to this new law, people in my State will  benefit from robust Federal investment in the infrastructure that they  rely on every day: $11.2 billion for highway and bridge repairs; $1.7  billion to make sure that everyone has access to clean drinking water;  $4 billion to enhance public transportation; $616 million for  infrastructure enhancements at Illinois airports; and over $100 million  for broadband internet expansion.   Just last week, the Department of Transportation announced that $1.4  billion was already on its way to Illinois to repair bridges all across  the State. This is the largest investment in our State's bridges since  the construction of the Interstate Highway System, and it is just the  beginning of the infrastructure investments that will benefit the  people of Illinois every day.   I have to say, I look forward to meeting my Republican colleagues at  the ribbon cutting ceremonies for all of these projects that they voted  against.
