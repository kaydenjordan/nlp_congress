 Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Engel  for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my legislation, H.R. 5433,  the Hack Your State Department Act, that I co-authored with my friend,  Ted Yoho of Florida.    Over the years, the State Department has faced mounting cybersecurity  threats from both criminal enterprises and state-sponsored hackers. In  2014, for instance, the Department was infiltrated by Russian hackers  and had to temporarily shut down its email system.   Just last week, the State Department suffered another cybersecurity  breach that exposed the personal information of a number of its  employees.   As an agency with a critical national security role, we must do more  to protect the State Department's cybersecurity. If there is any doubt  that diplomatic cables cannot be sent to Washington securely or if  sensitive diplomatic subjects are revealed, it jeopardizes the whole  operation.   As a recovering computer science major, I recognize that there are  proven tools at our disposal to improve cybersecurity that the  Department has yet to adopt. One such tool is to enlist the help of  America's top security researchers to find weaknesses in our  cybersecurity. This legislation will bring that tool to the State  Department after it has been proven successful in both the private  sector, as well as at the Pentagon.   My legislation will do two things. The first step of this bill is to  establish what is called a vulnerability disclosure process, which sets  clear rules of the road so that, when people outside the Department  discover vulnerabilities on Department systems, they can report it in a  safe, secure, and legal manner with the confidence that the Department  will actually fix the problems.                                time  2245    We cannot afford to allow vulnerabilities discovered in the wild  remain known to hackers but unknown to the Department. This should be  an easy fix.   The second step is to actually pay vetted white-hat hackers to find  vulnerabilities. The Department of Defense proved the success of their  bug  [[Page H8880]]  bounty program back in 2016. Over a 24-day period, the Pentagon learned  of and fixed over 138 vulnerabilities in its systems.   A 2017 report to the President on Federal IT modernization stated:  ``Agencies must take a layered approach to penetration testing. . . .  At a bare minimum, agencies should establish vulnerability disclosure  policies. . . . Agencies should also identify programs that are  appropriate to place under public bug bounty programs such as those run  by the Department of Defense or GSA.''   Today, with H.R. 5433, the House of Representatives is taking these  recommendations to heart and helping to improve cybersecurity at the  Department of State.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Representative Yoho for partnering  with me on this important legislation. I would like to thank Chairman  Royce, Ranking Member Engel, and their staff for moving this bill  through our committee.
