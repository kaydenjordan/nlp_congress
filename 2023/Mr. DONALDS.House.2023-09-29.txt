 Mr. Speaker, $2 trillion deficit, $33 trillion in debt,  and Washington just wants to continue to grow.   Mr. Speaker, 20 percent inflation year over year is crippling every  family in our country, and 8 percent mortgage rates are squeezing our  real estate market, and Washington just wants to grow and grow.   Our cities are overrun with migrants because of the reckless policies  of the President of the United States. Fentanyl is killing 85,000  Americans year over year, and congressional Democrats refuse to secure  the border.   Mr. Speaker, enough is enough. This bill does one very important  thing--really two very important things.   Number one, it returns our government back to pre-COVID spending  levels of 2019. COVID-19 is over. Why can't our government live within  its means? Our people have to live within their means; our government  should, as well.   I remember when there was a baby formula shortage and mothers  couldn't get food for their infants. Joe Biden was nowhere.  Congressional Democrats were nowhere. All they said was spend more  money while the problems persisted.   They are building shelters in parks in New York City to house  migrants, and congressional Democrats say there is  [[Page H4894]]  no issue at the border even though everybody sees the problems that  exist.   This is the time to secure the border of our Nation and to cut  wasteless spending in our government. If we are going to have a society  and a government worthy of the people that we serve, Washington has to  do something that Washington never seems to want to do: restrain  itself.   We have a fundamental obligation to secure this Nation and to secure  the people that we all serve.   Coming out here talking about what is going to happen with WIC is not  going to solve the problem. Talking about the fiscal health of this  Nation is going to solve the problem.   Our national debt has been downgraded twice now. The Democrats want  to spend more money. Support this measure.
