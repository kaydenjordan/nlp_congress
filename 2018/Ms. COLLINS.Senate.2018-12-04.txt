 Mr. President, on Ocean Avenue in Kennebunkport, ME,  stands a simple yet powerful monument, a gift from the people of that  small community to a friend and neighbor. The monument is a U.S. Navy  anchor, and the friend and neighbor was President George Herbert Walker  Bush. It is a fitting tribute. President Bush often called the family  home at Walker's Point his ``anchor to the windward,'' a special place  of unsurpassed beauty in a caring community. Through the years, it has  been the place that gave him the strength to face the many challenges  he took on in dedicated service to our country. Indeed, every summer of  his life George Herbert Walker Bush spent at Walker's Point, except  when he was defending our country during World War II.   It is a fitting tribute in another way. As a Navy aviator in World  War II, as a Member of Congress, as a Special Envoy to China, as  Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, as Vice President and  President, George H.W. Bush consistently and vigorously demonstrated  the values that are the anchor of American society. Courage, duty,  honor, and compassion defined his life. As he encouraged Americans to  be ``a thousand points of light'' through service to others, he himself  shone the brightest. He always answered the call to serve our country.   I had the pleasure of visiting President and Mrs. Bush at Walker's  Point many times over the years, and how I looked forward to those  annual visits in Kennebunkport. I remember the very first time so well.  It was in 1994, and I had just won the Republican primary for Governor  of Maine. I received a call from President Bush's staff inviting me to  have lunch with him and Mrs. Bush at Walker's Point.   The last time I saw the President was on September 7, just months  after President Bush had lost his beloved Barbara and as his own health  was rapidly declining. Yet, as the Presiding Officer well knows, the  President remained incredibly positive and warm. The qualities that  made him such an inspiring leader were undiminished.   Throughout our long friendship, President Bush, by his example and by  his words, was always so encouraging, kind, and thoughtful. He taught  me that you must always do what your heart tells you is right  regardless of the consequences. He demonstrated that every difficulty  must be met with strength and determination.   George Herbert Walker Bush was so kind to others. I remember one year  when I visited him, he had completely shaved his head in solidarity  with a young boy who was the son of a Secret Service agent who was part  of his detail. This young boy was undergoing cancer treatments and had  lost all of his hair, so President Bush shaved off all of his hair too.  That is the kind of individual he was--caring, compassionate, and  committed.   The end of a life so devoted to the highest ideals of the human  spirit brings to mind the parable of the talents in the Bible. The  master, leaving on a journey, entrusts a servant with a portion of his  treasure. Upon his return, the master is delighted to find that his  wealth was wisely invested and multiplied. George Herbert Walker Bush  was entrusted with the great treasure of principles, determination, and  courage. He invested that treasure wisely and multiplied it to the  benefit of all--not just here in America but throughout the world.   Like the master in the New Testament, to him we say: Well done, good  and faithful servant.   May God bless him, and may his memory always be anchored in our  hearts.   Thank you, Mr. President.
