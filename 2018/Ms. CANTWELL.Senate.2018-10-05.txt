 Mr. President, I come and join my colleague from Oregon  on the floor this evening and thank him very much for his comments and  hard-fought efforts to try to illuminate the issues that are before the  American people in this nomination that we are going to be voting on.         As nightfall does not come at once, neither does       oppression. In both instances, there is a twilight . . . and       it is in such twilight that we all must be most aware of       change in the air--however slight--lest we become unwitting       victims of the darkness.    Those aren't my words; those are the words of the late Supreme Court  Justice William O. Douglas. Yes, that is right, I quoted William O.  Douglas--not because he was from Yakima, WA, via Maine, originally, but  because I wanted to bring up the rights of Americans that could be  undermined by the confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.  That is because for generations the U.S. Supreme Court has been an  institution that affirmed rights of Americans and moved our country  forward, especially when we needed it most.   In 1954, it made a landmark decision to end segregation of our  schools and to rightly give access to equal education. In 1964, it  recognized the right to privacy and the ability to access  contraception. It is hard to imagine today, in this era, that we needed  that fundamental right and that it had been previously blocked. Yet it  was. In 2015, the Supreme Court upheld the fundamental rights of  marriage for same-sex couples, holding that they had equal protection  under the law.   Yes, these are rights that have been decided by our Court and have  moved our country forward. So I became very concerned when President  Trump nominated Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court because he  was on a list of an organization that wanted to see the literal text of  the statute over upholding the hard-won rights of all Americans.   When it comes to the rights of consumers--healthcare rights,  environmental laws, privacy rights, labor rights--I want to know where  a Supreme Court Justice is going to be in upholding those hard-won  rights that Americans and our society have pushed forward for decades.  In this case, he will be replacing a Justice who has been a key vote on  many fundamental rights in America.   So I definitely express my opinion that I do not believe that Judge  Kavanaugh will protect those hard-won rights. And my concern is that he  does not have a judicial philosophy that is in the mainstream views of  America. He has the most dissents of any judge on the DC Circuit. That  is to say that he is dissenting from even the most conservative judges  on that Court. He is still dissenting. So I don't find those views in  the mainstream views of Americans.   Let's just take one example: healthcare. More than 3 million  Washingtonians in my State have preexisting conditions, such as  diabetes, heart disease, and asthma, and Americans don't want to be  discriminated against because of their medical history.   More than 75 percent of Americans support the preexisting condition  protections that have been put into law under the Affordable Care Act.  These protections help keep them from having medical debt and  uncompensated care. All of these issues are very important for us to  continue to protect.   In 2011, Judge Kavanaugh refused to uphold the constitutionality of  the Affordable Care Act, and he has criticized the Supreme Court's  decision to uphold parts of that law. In his confirmation hearings, he  refused to say whether these current protections for Americans are  constitutional. His record suggests that he will not defend these  protections or Congress's clear intent in writing them.   It is not just some theoretical issue. Today, these protections are  being threatened in the courts. They are being threatened by a group of  Republican attorneys general who are trying to get a Federal court in  Texas to strike down these protections in the healthcare law, and the  Justice Department has decided to join those States in asking the  courts to strike down these preexisting condition protections. So this  case is definitely working its way through the court system and could  likely end up before the Supreme Court.   Some have suggested: Well, don't worry about that. Don't worry about  that because Justice Roberts will uphold the healthcare law. He will be  the swing vote, and Judge Kavanaugh's appointment to the Supreme Court  is irrelevant on this point.   That is wrong. First, you really can't count on Chief Justice Roberts  in upholding the Affordable Care Act. In fact, that is what the  attorneys general are arguing, that his previous decision will help to  strike down the law. The times and circumstances are different now  because the Federal Government isn't fighting to protect the Affordable  Care Act, which it did in previous administrations, and there is no  guarantee that Justice Roberts will rule in favor of the law. There are  other aspects of the Affordable Care Act that he has also sided  against.   It is hard to believe now that this fundamental right that has been  so hard fought for so many people may be in danger. I can say that in  my State, I have been in hospital after hospital and healthcare  facility after healthcare facility. Doctors say to me that they can't  even imagine what it is going to be like to go back to prior to the  preexisting condition protections. It has become such a norm that they  are covering people that they couldn't imagine that kind of  discrimination today.  [[Page S6636]]    When it comes to reproductive rights, those are under threat as well.  In 2017, Judge Kavanaugh suggested that he supported Justice  Rehnquist's dissent in Roe v. Wade, which called the landmark decision  a product of ``freewheeling judicial creation of unenumerated rights  that were not rooted in the nation's history.''   As somebody who sat on the Judiciary Committee for the first 2 years  I was in the Senate, I can guarantee that I asked every judicial  nominee whether they believed in the penumbra of rights guaranteed in  the Constitution for the right to privacy or they didn't. The reason I  did that is because those who really don't believe that Roe was rightly  decided believe that those rights are not enumerated and could overturn  them in the future.   While Judge Kavanaugh may now believe that Roe v. Wade is settled  law, records from his days in the administration raise doubts. Perhaps  more importantly, during his confirmation hearing, he refused to say  whether it was wrongly decided. Why is that important? Because in the  near future, if a majority on the Supreme Court decides that it was  previously wrongly decided, they can just overturn it.   If Judge Kavanaugh does not believe the Constitution gives women the  right to make decisions about their own bodies, then whatever assurance  he gives us now about precedent is hollow. This is why it is so  important to people in my State. We voted in 1991 by an initiative of  the people to have this right in our State law. We in the State of  Washington and millions of women want to see every woman in America  have these same rights.   I took President Trump at his word when he said he was going to put a  nominee on the Court who automatically would overturn this. These  Justices--Roberts and conservatives like Alito, Thomas, and Gorsuch-- would now be joined by Kavanaugh and overturn this right in a 5-to-4  decision. Even if they don't fully overturn it, they could effectively  undermine its protections piece by piece. Chief Justice Roberts, for  instance, has repeatedly upheld restrictive limits on reproductive  rights. These Justices have proven themselves very willing to restrict  access to safe and legal abortions.   As I said, the people of my State decided that they wanted to protect  this, and I am here to help and defend that for other women in the  United States of America.   If Judge Kavanaugh were to serve a lifetime appointment on the Court,  he could also pose threats to the rights of LGBTQ Americans not just in  my State but across the country. The Supreme Court will likely hear  cases that impact this community.   There are cases pending like the Arlene Flowers case in the State of  Washington where a florist refused to provide services at a gay  couple's wedding. The Court could also likely hear arguments on  President Trump's discriminatory ban on transgender servicemembers. The  rights of LGBTQ Americans are at stake with Judge Kavanaugh on the  Bench because his broad view of religious freedom could provide a  license to discriminate against these individuals.   Judge Kavanaugh's record also suggests that he will be hostile to the  protection of other privacy rights. In 2015, after it was revealed that  the National Security Administration, NSA, had been collecting  Americans' phone records in bulk without warrant, Judge Kavanaugh  decided that national security needs outweighed individuals' right to  privacy. He supported expanding warrantless surveillance by the  government.   What is more, Judge Kavanaugh has ruled in favor of a restrictive  voter identification law, raising concerns that he would support  scaling back hard-won voting rights. Those rights are sacred in our  country, and the last thing we need is a Supreme Court that would  refuse to defend them.   I am also concerned about his views on issues that could affect  Native Americans. Native Americans need to have their sovereignty  recognized and their rights protected. In this term alone, there could  be three cases before the Court, and some of the most basic Tribal  rights in our country are at risk. Judge Kavanaugh's position, found in  his own writings before he became a Federal court judge, indicated that  he did not take seriously the constitutional rights of Tribal  governments and the sovereign obligation of the United States when it  entered into treaties and agreements with Tribal and Indian people and  Alaska Natives.   Time and again, these issues are before us and before a court, and  that is why, as I said, I believe in a court that protects these hard- won rights. I know that textualists will tell you something different,  but where would we be on just the basic rights of contraception if we  didn't have a court that did not find unenumerated rights in our  Constitution? Where would we be on the future rights of privacy that  need to be protected in the United States of America?   Time and again, Judge Kavanaugh has favored big companies over  everyday Americans, using a twisted logic to defend big corporate  polluters. Kavanaugh seems to have a particular animus against the  Environmental Protection Agency and its efforts to follow Congress in a  direction that has been given in law to reduce air and water pollution.  That is a direct affront to the leadership of people like Ed Muskie,  who led Congress in its effort to pass the Clean Air Act in 1970 and  control pollution and in 1990 when Congress amended the law to combat  acid rain, ozone depletion, and auto emissions. And since then, the  U.S. Supreme Court has upheld the Clean Air Act.   In 2007, in the Massachusetts case, the Supreme Court ruled that the  U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has the authority to regulate  greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act, and Justice Kennedy, whom  Judge Kavanaugh will replace, provided the fifth and deciding vote in  that decision. But as Kennedy's replacement on the Court, the  government's ability to mitigate climate change could be lost. That  would mean everything from not addressing these impacts we are seeing  on our coastal communities to what we are seeing in damage from  wildfires, and it could mean that the report that was done by the  Government Accountability Office saying that climate change impacts are  costing us over $620 billion every 10 years will continue to be  ignored.   We want a Supreme Court Justice who is going to follow the law and  abide by and uphold what Congress has said, and that is what the Court  has said as well. Judge Kavanaugh said he didn't think the EPA had the  authority to regulate air pollution across States. The U.S. Supreme  Court reversed his opinion. In a 6-to-2 decision, they concluded that  Judge Kavanaugh had improperly applied his own policy judgment rather  than the plain text of the statute written by Congress. That is what  the Supreme Court said in reversing him.   I will say it again. The U.S. Supreme Court said Judge Kavanaugh used  his own policy judgments rather than the law as it was written by  Congress.   So, yes, I have concerns that his views are not in the mainstream of  America and of judicial philosophy when it comes to protecting our  environment.   In another case, he opposed the EPA's interpretation that it could  control ``any air pollutant'' because he thought that the terms of the  Clean Air Act didn't include that. He also sought to limit its  authority to protect Americans from greenhouse gases. In a 2013 case-- the Center for Biological Diversity--Kavanaugh said that the Clean Air  Act does not even cover carbon dioxide at all.   In fact, he ruled to weaken environmental protections in 89 percent  of the cases that have come before him. So I do not call that in the  mainstream views of judicial philosophy.   Tomorrow, we will have major issues before us as this vote takes  place. When it comes to whether you are siding on behalf of the  American worker or large corporations, I, too, have concerns.   In a 2015 case, he overruled the National Labor Relations Board,  siding with a hotel that had requested police officers to issue  criminal citations to union demonstrators who were legally protesting.   In another case, Kavanaugh sided with a company that had banned  employees who interacted with customers or who worked in public from  wearing union shirts that said certain words on them. The NLRB found  that the employer committed an unfair labor practice, but Judge  Kavanaugh disagreed,  [[Page S6637]]  concluding that the union members did not have a right to wear the  shirts because the company believed it would be damaged.   In 2013, a SeaWorld trainer was dismembered and killed by a whale  during a live show. Kavanaugh ruled against the Occupational Health and  Safety Commission's conclusions that SeaWorld had acted wrongly and had  insufficiently limited trainers' physical contact with orcas.   I am concerned about the information age that we live in and that  when it comes to issues relating to protecting consumer rights, there  is no bigger consumer right than protecting the right of those on the  internet to access information. We cannot have a two-tiered internet  system in which these rights are not protected by a court.   In this case, Judge Kavanaugh wrote that the FCC did not have the  right to regulate broadband providers as ``common carriers.'' Instead,  he made it clear that he believes that broadband cable companies should  be able to control your internet experience as they see fit.   Part of his flawed analysis rested on the idea that what the FCC was  purporting to do by protecting consumers was a type of rule that was so  consequential that it could only stand if Congress bestowed ``clear and  unambiguous authority'' on the agency. This is in contradiction to the  Supreme Court's own precedent, which determined that the FCC did have  the authority to decide whether and how to regulate broadband.   The other part of his faulty analysis rested on the view that cable  and broadband companies that operate the pipes that serve as a ramp to  the internet have First Amendment rights, and they should be able to  exercise that right to deny or limit consumers' access to content.   I guarantee you that saying that the First Amendment gives cable  companies the right to charge whatever they want to charge you for the  future is not in the mainstream view of judicial philosophy or what the  American people have come to expect.   So let me say again that these important issues are not part of Judge  Kavanaugh's willingness to protect these rights to healthcare, of the  environment, of privacy, of consumer rights, and the things that we  hold so dear, that we have all fought for, legislated for, and had  courts uphold and preserve.   I am not buying the notion that a strict textualist is the way to go.  I believe my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have every right  to disagree with that, but I would ask them, how are you ever going to  move America forward in decisions like our desegregation of education  or on contraception or on these other privacy rights if you don't  interpret the Constitution to today's needs?   I would say now that the biggest threat we face is the overreaching  of an administration that every single day does something to not comply  with the law as it is written. The President just issued an Executive  order weeks ago that exempted administrative law judges from the  competitive service; instead allowing the agencies to hire them.   The President's Executive order does not reflect the mainstream views  of Americans. Administrative law judges should be well qualified and  impartial, and the process to select them nonpartisan and fair.   Is this judge going to challenge the President or is he just going to  say that he agrees with the President of the United States? As one  White House Counsel from the Nixon administration said, if Judge  Kavanaugh is confirmed, it ``will be the most Presidential powers- friendly Supreme Court in the modern era.''   Well, I can tell you this: If those on the other side of the aisle  are promoting this nomination because they want a rubberstamp on the  Trump administration, we will fight them every step of the way. The  Supreme Court is supposed to be the impartial arbitrator, the one that,  even though we have different Congresses and different views,  interprets the law over a period of time, that does not make political  decisions but makes impartial decisions. To have somebody on the Court  now when every day an administration is not following the law and  basically subverting it--it is a time where we need a Supreme Court to  stand up and do their job and hold the administration accountable.   I am sure it is not pleasant to hold an administration accountable,  but this is an important time for checks and balances in the United  States of America. I don't believe that the rights of individuals will  be protected from the overreach of this administration or be defended  by this nominee.   I know a lot has been said today about what the process for this  nominee has been for the Court. I know there is a lot that will  continue to be discussed after this day about how this institution has  handled this situation and the accusations against Judge Kavanaugh. All  I can say is that we need to do better. We need, as an institution, to  have a better process for evaluating these situations and how to make  them less partisan.   But I will tell you this: I found the testimony by Dr. Ford credible,  and those saying ``Well, it must have happened; it just wasn't him'' is  another example of denial of information instead of getting to the  truth of the situation. We have to do better because we are an  institution that is supposed to lead on this issue. We are not supposed  to be an institution like the other institutions we have seen sweep  these allegations under the rug, only to come back at some point in  time when there are 300 cases or 400 cases or X number of people who  have been impacted.   This institution has to figure out a better way to lead on this  issue, and I plan to continue to work with my colleagues on both sides  of the aisle to help us continue to focus on this. So many people in  America are counting on us, so many women in America are counting on  us, and so many Tribal women are counting on us. The statistics are  just too high to leave a nominee on the Court with a doubt about this  investigation, with this situation not rendered to a point where more  people felt that the information was fully investigated. We have to do  better. We are going to be challenged as we move forward.   As I said, I don't believe that Judge Kavanaugh's nomination is in  the mainstream of judicial philosophy in the United States of America.  That is why I am not supporting him. I didn't support him when he was  first nominated for the DC Circuit Court because I had doubts that he  would be that individual who would put political, partisanship aside  and be that impartial Justice. I didn't make a decision right away; I  went back and researched his record. I looked at the decisions on basic  rights that so many Americans are counting on, and I can tell you this:  For these rights, you cannot count on Judge Kavanaugh. Therefore, he  does not get my consent to move forward to the Supreme Court.   I yield the floor.
