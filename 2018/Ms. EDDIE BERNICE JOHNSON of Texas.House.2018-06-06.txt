 I rise today in support of H.R.  8--the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) of 2018. As the most  senior Texan on the House Transportation & Infrastructure Committee and  former chair of the Water Resources and Environment Subcommittee, I am  pleased to support this bill which represents a bipartisan effort to  authorize critical water infrastructure projects and develop our  nation's future water resources.   Our ports, inland waterways, locks, dams, flood protection, and other  water infrastructure are vital to our nation and its global  competitiveness. Water infrastructure forms a critical backbone in  support of our overall infrastructure needs and H.R. 8 will ensure that  the United States can provide not only basic water resources for its  people, but also promote commerce along our nation's waterways.   One element of the WRDA bill that I wish had been addressed is the  full use of the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF). The HMTF was  established to cover the operation and maintenance (O&M) expenses of  our waterways and harbors. As Harbor Maintenance Taxes (HMTs) are  collected, it is the responsibility of Congress to appropriate its  spending for dredging and other O&M activities. A sufficient amount of  HMT revenue is collected each year to meet our nation's annual  authorized harbor maintenance needs. It is critical that we remain open  to the idea of fully utilizing the HMTF for harbor maintenance  purposes.   Mr. Chair, I look forward to working with Congress to continue  authorizing these important projects and sticking to a two-year  authorization cycle. Doing so will ensure that we are able to advance  water resources development projects in a timely manner and provide the  predictability and support that is so desperately needed.
