 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, the world is relieved that Hamas has  stopped firing rockets at Israel's cities and, for the moment, the  fighting has stopped.   Israel's response to Hamas's terrorism was entirely justified. It was  targeted, restrained, and extraordinarily precise. So it was  disappointing to see disproportionate blame heaped upon Israel, the  victim, and disproportionate pressure put on Israel's democratic,  coalition government to spearhead the cease-fire with the aggressors.   Israel's actions appear to have helped restore some measure of  deterrence and damaged Hamas's ability to wage terror, but we have  every reason to expect the terrorist commanders will seek to rebuild  their arsenal with assistance from their sponsors in Tehran.   The Biden administration must not pursue Iran policies that make this  process even easier. We should not lift terrorism and missile sanctions  just to leap back into discussions over the flawed Obama-era nuclear  deal. Already, this administration removed terrorism sanctions on  Iran's Houthi proxies in Yemen, hoping to encourage negotiations.  Instead, the Houthis have escalated their offensive, rejected  diplomacy, and actually fired into Saudi Arabia. Likewise, giving Iran  relief from sanctions will just yield more support for terrorists like  Hezbollah and Hamas.   Now, I am encouraged that the President has committed to refilling  Israel's Iron Dome stockpiles. I hope his budget proposal coming this  Friday will make room for increased military assistance to Israel and  reflect the fact that America's interests are not served by cutting our  own defense budget.   Sadly, here in Congress, more and more Democrats are falling under  the anti-Israel influence of the farthest left branch. From the junior  Senator from Vermont, we have a resolution to block a routine sale of  precision-guided munitions that would make it harder for Israel to  avoid civilian casualties as it defends itself; from a Congresswoman  from New York, the accusation that Israel is an ``apartheid state.''   Historically, support for Israel has been bipartisan. During the last  major flare-up with Hamas back in 2014, when hundreds of rockets were  fired at Israel, the Senate passed a resolution reaffirming our support  for Israel and making clear Hamas's responsibility for the violence,  and we did it by unanimous consent.   Back in 2019, after another rocket attack, the Democratic leader  insisted, ``No government can allow its civilians to be subject to  rocket attack.'' He said he stood ``shoulder-to-shoulder with the  people of Israel . . . and doing what they must do to defend their  homeland.''   That was true in 2019. Well, this month's attacks involved not  hundreds but literally thousands of rockets. Yet, instead of vocal  support for Israel, 29 Senate Democrats pressured Israel's coalition  government to stop defending itself. One of our colleagues who ran for  President said the United States helping our ally means ``supplying  weapons to kill children.'' Their base is energized. An open letter  from hundreds of former Democratic Party and campaign staffers has  urged President Biden to be harder on Israel. Apparently, a lot can  change in just 2 years.   Helping Israel defend itself against terrorists shouldn't be a  divisive issue. The Senate should vote on Senator Sanders' resolution  and reject it overwhelmingly.                            ____________________     Mr. President, now on a related matter, the  despicable, age-old specter of anti-Semitism continues to rear its  head, even here in our country.   Last week, authorities from New York to Los Angeles were  investigating assaults on Jewish people. According to press reports, in  New York City, one Jewish man was kicked, punched, and sprayed with  chemicals by five or six men yelling anti-Sematic things. That  happened, by the way, right in Times Square. A synagogue in Arizona was  vandalized. So was another in Illinois. A Jewish family visiting South  Florida had a car pull up next to them and multiple occupants begin  screaming: ``Free Palestine . . . die, Jew.'' That is what he got for  wearing his yarmulke in public.   The head of the Anti-Defamation League said:         We are tracking acts of harassment, vandalism, and violence       as well as a torrent of online abuse . . . it's happening all       around the world.    This garbage--this garbage didn't begin a few weeks ago. It isn't a  response to geopolitics. This hatred long predates the recent fighting  between Israel and Hamas, and it hasn't gone anywhere since the cease- fire.   This spring, in the shadow of this Capitol Building, a U.S. Capitol  Police officer was killed in broad daylight by an unbalanced follower  of the Nation of Islam, the extremist group led by the anti-Semite  Louis Farrakhan.  [[Page S3387]]    This trash should be the easiest thing in the world for every person  in a leadership position to call out. But perhaps--perhaps--because  Israel has become a strangely controversial issue on the far left, the  condemnations do not seem to be flowing quite as easily and  unequivocally as they should.   Yesterday, a Democratic Congressman from Minnesota tweeted this:         I'll say the quiet part out loud. It's time for       ``progressives'' to start condemning anti-Semitism and       violent attacks on Jewish people with the same intention and       vigor demonstrated in other areas of activism. The silence       has been deafening.    I couldn't say it better myself.   So Senator Cotton and I are introducing new legislation to fight  anti-Semitism. Our bill will support State and local law enforcement  and ensure the bigoted thugs who are attacking Jewish Americans face  the full force of our justice system.   I am proud to be cosponsoring this legislation, although I regret  that in the year of 2021, it remains, unfortunately, necessary. I hope  every one of our colleagues will join Senator Cotton and myself.                            ____________________     Mr. President, now on one final matter, the  President's decision to retreat from Afghanistan is not clear-eyed or  strategic; it is dangerous, wishful thinking.   As discussions with the administration are making clear, this  decision is not underpinned by a coherent plan to mitigate the  geopolitical and humanitarian risks that our departure will create.   When we are gone, after we leave, there is every reason to believe  al-Qaida will regroup in its historic safe haven. Giving up the high  ground while the enemy is still on the battlefield isn't a strategic  move. Neither is banking on conducting so-called ``over the horizon''  counterterrorism missions without presence on the ground. If we have  learned anything in the fight against terrorists, it is the importance  of reliable access and local partnerships. Give up the former, and we  likely lose the latter.   The military currently flies both reconnaissance and strike missions  against terrorists from within Afghanistan. The country is not easy to  get to. Its immediate neighbors are Iran, Pakistan, and Russian- influenced Central Asian nations. They aren't exactly likely to let us  base significant counterterrorism units in their countries. So where  will we be basing these forces? How will we maintain sorties from  thousands of miles away? How many forces will be required to secure our  Embassy? If a pro-Taliban mob threatens to overrun it, what will we do  to protect it? Where will a quick-reaction force be based if not in  Afghanistan? Will it be quick if its response time goes from minutes to  hours? We learned from Benghazi the so-called tyranny of distance. If  the Taliban takes Kabul, will the Biden administration recognize it as  the legitimate government of Afghanistan? Will we shutter our Embassy  and our aid programs? The reality is, they don't know. They can't say.  There is no plan   It is not courageous to abandon our allies. That is a view many  Democrats said they held when the last President considered withdrawing  from Syria and Afghanistan. But now, as Afghans, especially women and  girls, face even worse dangers, many Democrats have suddenly become  much less vocal. The horrific--horrific--reports of the Taliban  beginning to reimpose their version of sharia law are just a taste of  the catastrophes facing our friends in Afghanistan who have borne the  brunt of the fight. Human rights. Women's rights. Counterterrorism  refugee flows. As far as I can tell, the administration has no plan.   But the world is watching--allies and adversaries. Democrats can  dress up this decision in flowery language, but the world will see it  for what it is: retreating from the fight, abandoning our partners.   This is the President's decision. He chose precipitous withdrawal  from Afghanistan. Unbelievably, he even chose the anniversary of  September 11 as the deadline. As his team belatedly confronts him with  the risks and the consequences of this decision, I hope the President  will think again and reconsider.                            ____________________
