 Madam Speaker, it is an honor and a privilege to deliver  this maiden speech from the well of the House Chamber.   First, I acknowledge the late Congresswoman Jackie Walorski. Jackie  delivered results for the district, and she had the utmost respect for  her colleagues in this room. This was never more evident than at her  funeral services in August, where one-third of the room was filled with  hundreds of Members, Republicans and Democrats, from all over the  country.                                time  1845    Jackie fostered relationships on both sides of the aisle and worked  collaboratively to get things done for our families and businesses. She  was particularly dedicated to our veterans, our U.S. military, and our  allies in Israel.   As her successor, I will work every day to honor her memory and  uphold her impeccable work ethic.   Since the founding of our Nation, a little over 10,000 people have  been elected to this body, and it is the honor of a lifetime to stand  here tonight representing Indiana's Second Congressional District.   I am grateful to my beautiful wife, Sallyann, as well as our three  children, Elle, Rudy IV, and Eliza. We also have other family and close  friends who are in the gallery this evening.   To the Hoosiers who have placed their trust in me to best represent  them in this House--the people's House--thank you. I ask for your  continued prayers for wisdom as we work to make our Nation a more  perfect Union.   Yes, there are real policy issues that need to be addressed, such as  our massive deficit and 40-year high inflation rates. But just as  importantly, our country needs unity. And it starts right here.   I often tell my kids to stop complaining and do the hard things. That  is how we grow, how we learn, and how we succeed in life. And I will  apply that same approach here in Congress.   It is time to roll up our sleeves and do the hard work  collaboratively to find common ground and forge solutions for Hoosiers.  That is what Jackie did, and I can't wait to get started.   May God bless the United States of America.                            ____________________
