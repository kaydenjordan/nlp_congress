 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, the Consumer Product Safety Commission  is a small agency with a major mission. Its goal is to protect the  public from the threats of injury or death associated with defective  and dangerous products. That mission is more important today than ever  before because consumers face dangers from fire, electrical, chemical,  or mechanical hazards--not only consumers but their children and  families.   The agency is already resource-starved. It is already depleted in  terms of the support that it needs in Congress, and already it needs  zealous and relentless advocacy.   The individuals who are members of that board should be dedicated to  that mission and to the safety and well-being of consumers above all.  That is their mission.   So, today, when we consider the nomination of Dana Baiocco, we should  keep in mind that no matter how able and skilled and experienced a  litigator she is, the question is whether she will devote those skills,  ability, and experience to the mission of this agency.   Unfortunately, every sign that she has given indicates that her goal  will be contrary to the agency's mission. I say that, first of all,  because of her experience. She has participated in cases that are of  extraordinary concern to Americans.   In 2007 she represented Mattel as a member of their litigation team  when lead was discovered in the paint of 83 different Mattel toy  products; I think nearly 1 million toys. In 2007, when she represented  Mattel, I was the attorney general of the State of Connecticut. I  remember that well because it was known as the Year of the Recall  because of the frequency and the number of recalls involving unsafe  products. In 2007, there were more than four recalls, on average, each  week, and more than half of them were for children's products. It was a  time when our Nation was facing this crisis in dangerous toys. Mattel  ultimately was fined $2.3 million for violating the Consumer Product  Safety Act and knowingly selling children's toys with contaminated  paint or surface coatings.   This decision was an important win for consumers and children. The  Consumer Product Safety Commission did its job. Ms. Baiocco was on the  wrong side of consumer safety in that case.   Similarly, in representing the Yamaha Motor Company, a manufacturer  of off-road vehicles, she was on the wrong side, standing with the  industry that violated basic safety standards, causing multiple  injuries and lawsuits when consumers were seriously maimed, injured,  and harmed in operating Yamaha Rhino off-road vehicles. Those injuries  occurred while the CPSC was conducting a campaign on ATV safety. Ms.  Baiocco's defense of Yamaha put her on the wrong side of that issue at  a time when there were more than 330 ATV-related fatalities and 101,000  ATV-related emergency department-treated injuries in the United States.   Another area that I know well where she was clearly on the wrong side  related to Big Tobacco. Ms. Baiocco represented R.J. Reynolds in the  early part of this century--2007--in a class action lawsuit in Florida  brought by injured smokers who were seeking to recover the damages they  suffered as a consequence of Big Tobacco deliberately and purposefully  addicting them, leading to lives of disease and addiction. She was on  the wrong side of that issue as well--on the side of injury and  industry against consumers. She was instrumental in those lawsuits, and  R.J. Reynolds has been instrumental in lobbying to encourage the  extensive use of flame-retardant chemicals in upholstered furniture to  deflect pressure on cigarette makers to make a fire-safe cigarette.  That issue is squarely within the CPSC's jurisdiction.    She lacks that dedication to this agency's mission that is critical  for any Member to have. She may have skill, ability, and experience,  but if it is devoted to the industry's well-being rather than  consumers, she should be working for a different agency or continuing  to work for a law firm that represents these industries.   In fact, she has worked for a very large law firm that represents  many of those clients and industries, but she has refused to provide a  full list of the clients and companies she has represented. The only  way we have gained full knowledge of these clients is to go to the law  firm's website--where, by the way, her profile cites as follows: ``She  is known for strategic business advice and high-intensity trials  involving mass torts, consumer and industrial products, and medical  devices in federal, state, and international courts.'' The clients are  then listed in her profile.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this profile be printed  in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                              [From Jones Day]                       Profile--Dana Baiocco, Partner         Clients describe Dana Baiocco as a ``very smart and tough''       litigator, who is ``very responsive and thorough'' and       ``provides efficient and effective legal counsel relative to       some very difficult situations.'' She is known for strategic       business advice and high-intensity trials involving mass       torts, consumer and industrial products, and medical devices       in federal, state, and international courts. Dana counsels       clients on minimizing risks, regulatory and reporting       obligations, warranties, and CPSC product recalls.        Dana is go-to counsel for the Boston Red Sox. She led       Vibram USA's defense in Bezdek v. Vibram, et al., a putative       class action based on allegations of false and misleading       advertising regarding Vibram's extremely popular FiveFingers       minimalist shoes, and she was the first chair trial lawyer       winning a victory for Honeywell Safety Products and Bacou-      Dalloz in New York state respirator litigation (Wiacek v. 3M,       et al.) and for Parker Hannifin in aviation component part       litigation (Brewer v. Dodson [aff'd, 9th Cir.]). She defended       Yamaha in its Rhino product liability litigation nationwide       and in a French tribunal. Dana is on Jones Day's Product       Recall & Accident Response Team, a multidisciplinary legal       group prepared to respond in recall or crisis situations.        Dana is a member of Brimmer and May School's Annual Fund       Committee and the Carousel Ball Committee for Children's       Hospital of Philadelphia. She is a former officer of the       Pennsylvania Bar Association and the MDL Steering Committee       for the Boston Bar Association.                                  experience         Fenway Sports Group defends personal injury action--Jones       Day is representing Fenway Sport Group, parent company of the       Boston Red Sox Baseball Club, in a personal injury action.

(all owned by Honeywell International).

She said, in effect, she  was ``duty bound to maintain the confidential nature of legal advice  sought by or provided to any client.''   This claim of attorney-client privilege is absolutely bogus and ought  to insult this body because there is no reason for the name of the  client to be kept confidential or that attorney-client privilege to be  sustained.   I think invocation of attorney-client privilege in this way speaks  volumes to the kind of member of this Commission she would be. In fact,  she has refused to reveal her full list of consumer product clients,  other than the ones like Mattel and Yamaha, which are available through  court filings and other public records. I have entered many of those  other clients into the Record, but we  [[Page S2811]]  have no assurance that we know that full list.   She has also refused to recuse herself from matters involving her  current firm, Jones Day, or its clients for more than 1 year. The  Office of Government Ethics requires 1 year of recusal from the time  she last represented that client, but no more than that length of time,  and she has committed no more than the bare minimum requirement by law.  In addition, her husband has represented IKEA in a major product  liability suit involving furniture tipovers. She has refused to recuse  herself from matters involving IKEA.   We are in a perilous time, when the norms concerning conflicts of  interest have been reduced, almost eviscerated. We have an obligation  to protect consumer interests at the Consumer Product Safety  Commission. That responsibility is to make sure serious defects,  dangerous products, problems, and hazards that will face consumers as a  result of deadly or defective products are prevented from reaching the  market. Consumers may have no knowledge of how they are deadly or  dangerous. The Consumer Product Safety Commission has the mission to  protect consumers.   For someone who has the ability, skills, and expertise to represent  wrongdoers which threaten consumers is the responsibility of admirable  and able law firms, like Jones Day, and those skills and experience  enable lawyers who work there. It is not the job of a Commissioner of  the Consumer Product Safety Commission.   So it is really not about her personal ability, it is about the  mission of this agency and who is qualified to serve on it and whether  they have told us everything we need to know to hold them accountable  if they are confirmed.   On all those scores, this nominee is lacking. Therefore, I urge my  colleagues to vote no today on her nomination.   I yield the floor.
