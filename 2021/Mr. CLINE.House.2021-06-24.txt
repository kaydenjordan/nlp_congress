 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Heritage High  School girls track and field team in Lynchburg, Virginia, for winning  their second consecutive Virginia Class 3 State championship. The  Heritage Pioneers racked up 74 points at the title meet with only five  girls.   Star student athlete junior, Alaysia Oakes said: ``Our coach always  calls us the SEAL team. We go into states with five people, and it was  definitely a tough battle,'' she continued, ``but everybody did what  they needed to do. Just stayed strong. We knew it was going to be a  battle, but we didn't back down, so I'm proud of us.''   Oakes captured three events, and seniors Tya Blake, Kaelynn Hawkins,  Graysen Arnold, and Jalasia Jones helped the Pioneer's pour on the  points.   Oakes came away as the individual State champion in the triple jump,  long jump, and 100-meter dash, while placing second in the 200-meter  and 400-meter dash; all making for a tremendous showing from the junior  phenom.   This team is a shining example of hard work paying off.  Congratulations to the athletes and coaches on an incredible season. We  look forward to seeing what the future has in store for this talented  group.                            ____________________
