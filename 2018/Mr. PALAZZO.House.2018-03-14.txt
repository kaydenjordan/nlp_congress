 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr. Granville  Crane of Gulfport, Mississippi, and the rest of the crew onboard the  USS Indianapolis for their acts of heroism during World War II.   The USS Indianapolis received secret orders in July of 1945 to  proceed to Tinian Island, transiting the Pacific unaccompanied,  carrying components of the Little Boy atomic bomb.   Leaving Tinian, a Japanese submarine spotted the Indianapolis  steaming towards Guam and fired two torpedos, striking and sinking the  Indianapolis within 12 minutes. Approximately 300 crewmen went down  with the ship, and the rest spent the next 3\1/2\ days in the water. Of  the 1,200 crewmen, there were only 317 survivors.   On behalf of Mr. Granville Crane and the rest of the USS Indianapolis  crew, I encourage my fellow Members to support H.R. 4107, the USS  Indianapolis Congressional Gold Medal Act, which honors the crew of the  USS Indianapolis with Congressional Gold Medals for their important  role and dedicated service to our country during World War II.                            ____________________
