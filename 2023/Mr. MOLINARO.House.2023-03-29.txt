 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize April 2 as  Rabbi Menachem M. Schneerson Education and Sharing Day.   April 2 is the Rebbe's birthday, and Rabbi Schneerson believed that  education was not just about acquiring knowledge but also about  developing a strong moral compass. He saw education as a tool for  building a healthy and prosperous society, one that values compassion,  justice, and kindness.   His vision has inspired countless individuals around the world to  pursue excellence in education and to better serve their communities.   Through his tireless efforts, the Rebbe established over 5,500  educational and social institutions across the United States and in  more than 100 countries. These institutions have empowered young people  to reach their full potential and make a positive impact on society.   Madam Speaker, I ask that my colleagues in the House join me in  celebrating Education and Sharing Day by reflecting on the Rebbe's  legacy and commitment to education.                       Recognizing Autism Awareness Day     Madam Speaker, today, I rise to recognize Autism  Awareness Day, a day that promotes understanding and acceptance of  individuals on the autism spectrum.   Autism is a complex neurological disorder that affects millions of  individuals across the United States. It is also a spectrum disorder,  which means each person's challenges can vary significantly.   As the father of four children, one of whom lives on the autism  spectrum, this is deeply personal to me. April 2 is my daughter  Abigail's birthday.   Happy birthday to her.   Before coming to Congress, I founded the ThinkDIFFERENTLY initiative  in my home State to break down barriers and open opportunities for  individuals with physical, intellectual, and developmental  disabilities.   In Congress, we are working in a bipartisan way to expand on this  effort. I started by introducing the Think Differently Database Act,  which creates a comprehensive website of resources for individuals with  disabilities.   This is just the beginning. We must do more to increase funding for  autism research, expand access to early intervention services, and  support families through education and outreach programs. These efforts  will promote greater inclusivity and understanding and help every  person of every ability reach their fullest potential.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in recognizing Autism  Awareness Day and continue supporting this critical work of breaking  down barriers and creating opportunities for everyone of every ability.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, my amendment simply requires a study to  look at the impact that a ban on natural gas appliances would have on  electricity prices.   In my home State of New York, Governor Kathy Hochul has proposed to  implement a ban on gas-powered appliances, including gas stoves,  beginning in 2025, less than just 2 years from now.   The notion that the State is going to tell New Yorkers that they  can't use the most affordable option to heat their homes or cook their  dinner is beyond belief. This proposal will undoubtedly increase the  demand and cost for electricity, which is already incredibly expensive  for my constituents in upstate New York, all spending hundreds, even  thousands of dollars more for their electricity.   My amendment will shed light on the costs of Governor Hochul's  proposal and what that cost will have on New Yorkers, and by extension,  all Americans.   This is not a partisan issue. My Democratic colleagues should join me  in seeking transparency and identifying the effects that this proposal  and others like it will have on the cost of electricity.   H.R. 1, the bill in chief, delivers on our commitment to lower energy  costs for the American people, and I wholeheartedly support it.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   With due respect to all my colleagues, there is a State that is  proposing to ban gas appliances. In fact, New York is not only planning  to ban simply through new construction, but will require that  transition within 2 years, even retrofitting or making changes to  construction of existing homes.   In the case of New York, we know already we shoulder the highest  burden, highest cost of not only taxation and electricity costs, but  this will just add insult to injury. I encourage my colleagues to  support my amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman  from North Dakota (Mr. Armstrong).                                time  1645     Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.
