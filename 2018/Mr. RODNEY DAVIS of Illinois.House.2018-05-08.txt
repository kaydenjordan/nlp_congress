 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  commemorate Private First Class Robert Burke from the United States  Marine Corps, who gave the ultimate sacrifice 50 years ago during  Operation Allen Brook in Le Nam, Vietnam. For his bravery, he was  awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor. At the age of 18, he is the  youngest Medal of Honor recipient from the Vietnam war.   Private Burke enlisted in the U.S. Marines in 1967, while he was  still a student at Monticello High School in Piatt County, Illinois. He  was sent to the Republic of Vietnam with India Company of the 3rd  Battalion, 27th Marines, where he was assigned as a machine gunner.  During Operation Allen Brook on May 17, 1968, Private Burke and his  company came under intense fire from the well-concealed North  Vietnamese. With several of his fellow marines wounded, Private Burke  spared no time. He immediately used his machine gun to launch several  one-man assaults against the enemy, allowing upwards of three dozen  casualties to be evacuated.   He relentlessly delivered fire to the enemy, even obtaining a  casualty's rifle when his own malfunctioned. He continued to advance in  defense of his brothers in arms until he was mortally wounded.   No words of gratitude can properly express how thankful the American  people and the Congress are for Private Burke's selfless actions that  saved the lives of so many. Private Burke gave his life for his friends  and for his country. He is the truest example of bravery, and I am  proud to honor him today.                            ____________________
