 Mr. Speaker, if there is a constitutional way to turn  D.C. into a State, this bill is not it. This bill is a farcical  exercise in legislative virtue signaling because it contains a fatal  constitutional flaw.   Let's talk about what this bill doesn't do. This bill doesn't  magically convert all of D.C. into a State. This bill doesn't create a  new State containing a city called D.C. Because both of these clearly  violate the Constitution.   Some overly clever legislative artists think they have found a new  loophole, a way to create a State in D.C. without violating the  Constitution. What this bill does is it seeks to shrink the city  [[Page H2536]]  of D.C. into a tiny city, and then creates a State from the territory  that is left over.   The problem with that is there is the 23rd Amendment to the  Constitution that gives the city of D.C. presently three electoral  votes. Paradoxically, the bill itself acknowledges the constitutional  flaw within because it contains an expedited procedure to vote on the  repeal of the 23rd Amendment in this Chamber and the Senate Chamber.   The problem is, the bill keeps plowing forward and would create a new  State, even if the 23rd Amendment is not repealed. This creates the  farcical situation where the few residents, which are the residents at  1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, the First Family, would control three  electoral votes. This is crazy.   So, I urge my colleagues to vote for the Constitution today and vote  against H.R. 51.
