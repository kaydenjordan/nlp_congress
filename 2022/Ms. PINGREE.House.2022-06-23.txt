 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate  a great Mainer, Skeek Frazee.   Skeek is retiring this month after 12 dedicated years of constituent  service to the people of Maine's First District.   I believe the great majority of us who work in this institution do so  because we want to make life better for our neighbors. Skeek  exemplifies that spirit.   For over a decade, she has committed herself to some of the most  challenging and sensitive cases that come through my office. She has  fought for asylum seekers and refugees who have lived through horrors  in their home countries. It is no exaggeration to say that new Mainers  can build thriving new lives because of her help.   She is known across the country for her work advocating for survivors  of military sexual trauma bravely seeking benefits that they deserve  from the VA.   Beyond her considerable skill as a caseworker, she has also mentored  countless interns; been an unfailingly generous, hilarious, and kind  colleague; and become a treasured friend to so many of us in and  outside of our office.   Skeek, the people of Maine are infinitely better for having you as an  advocate, a neighbor, and a friend. We will miss you dearly, and we  wish you the very best in your next chapter.                            ____________________
