 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman, and I appreciate it  very much. I do want to thank the Congresswoman from New York and also  Congressman Juan Vargas of California who stepped up as the lead  cosponsor of this legislation.   As Mr. Hill mentioned a moment ago, about two-thirds of our new jobs  in the last decade have been created by small business. This is the  bloodline of our economy, and certainly in Maine, Mr. Speaker, where we  are a State and a district of small businesses, this is very particular  to my interest.   Those of us who have run small businesses know that one of the  biggest challenges you have is how to borrow money--access to capital-- because unless you have access to capital and unless you have the funds  you need to grow and expand, you can't create new opportunities and new  jobs for our kids and our grandkids. So access to capital is absolutely  critical when it comes to growing our economy and providing more  opportunities for the next generation.   As has already been said today, the SEC holds these annual forums  where small-business leaders who are on the ground creating jobs and  those in the public sector get together, and they review and explore  new ways and better ways to change the regulations and the rules we  have in this country such that access to capital is enhanced.   What better idea; what more common sense do we need than to have a  bill, H.R. 1312, that I am very proud to sponsor, that requires the SEC  to assess every recommendation by this forum every year--not  necessarily act upon it, but take it off the shelf, assess it, and  determine if action should be taken.   I want to thank all the folks who have participated in our forums  over the years, both the public and the private sector, and I ask, Mr.  Speaker, that all my colleagues in this House, Republicans and  Democrats, please support H.R. 1312.
