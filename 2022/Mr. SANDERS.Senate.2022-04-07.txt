 Mr. President, S. Con. Res. 14, the fiscal year 2022  congressional budget resolution, included authority in section 4004 to  allow the chairman of the Committee on the Budget to adjust budget  aggregates and committee allocations related to program integrity,  disaster relief, wildfire suppression, and veterans medical care  funding.   H.R. 2471, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022, was enacted on  March 15, 2022, and designates funding eligible for several of these  adjustments. Specifically, the bill provides $18.9 billion in budget  authority for disaster relief, $2.1 billion in budget authority for  program integrity activities to combat waste, fraud, and abuse, and  $2.5 billion in budget authority to fight wildfires. Accordingly, I am  adjusting the allocation to the Committee on Appropriations and the  spending aggregates upward by these amounts and by the amount of  outlays flowing therefrom.   I ask unanimous consent that the accompanying tables, which provide  details about the adjustment, be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:        REVISIONS TO BUDGET AGGREGATES--BUDGET AUTHORITY AND OUTLAYS  (Pursuant to Section 4004 of S. Con.
