 Mr. Speaker, in my home State of Ohio, the largest  nuclear scandal in American history has been perpetuated on our public.   Ohio's only nuclear power is generated in northern Ohio, along Lake  Erie by plants owned by Energy Harbor, previously known as FirstEnergy.  For decades, FirstEnergy's customers have unknowingly paid for the  outfall of this criminal company's nuclear malfeasance, careless  management, and costly outages, and now criminality.   When a hole in the nuclear reactor head at Davis-Besse proved to be  the size of a pineapple, jaws dropped too late here in Washington at  the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.   Where were they?   When a switch failure triggered by FirstEnergy shut off power for 3  days across the entire Midwest; Northeast; and Ontario, Canada, costing  our economy $10 billion and nine lost lives, those in the commercial  nuclear power world should have understood there was a big problem at  FirstEnergy.  [[Page H1764]]    Where were they?   Neither the private sector nor the Federal Government did their jobs.   Nuclear power production requires excellence and vigilance. No  excuses. No passing the buck.   FirstEnergy's business plan started to fail due to its huge repair  costs resulting from its own mistakes. As the company sank into debt,  rather than aspiring to excellence, it resorted to bribery, wire fraud,  conspiracy, and racketeering. Thus, the largest commercial nuclear  crimes in U.S. history are being litigated in Federal court in  Cincinnati, Ohio.   Convictions for accepting FirstEnergy bribes have been levied against  Ohio's former house Republican Speaker Larry Householder and former  Ohio Republican Party chair, Matt Borges. They led a criminal scheme in  which FirstEnergy bribed them with $61 million in dark money.  Householder used it for personal expenses, reelecting himself, and a  slate of willing Republican and Democratic legislators, to bend the law  to serve FirstEnergy's financial interests.   Once in office, Householder led his handpicked politicians in a  legislative bailout of FirstEnergy, foisting $1 billion plus in  corporate nuclear energy and coal losses on Ohio's ratepayers. Never  did Householder or his associates express any concern about  FirstEnergy's nuclear mishaps, its awesome nuclear responsibility, and  what really was required to restore operational excellence.   If FirstEnergy's plan had exploded and fried everything in its radius  in northern Ohio, including my house, Mr. Householder would not have  been affected. He lives too far south, as do most coconspirators to the  bribery scheme. Even prevailing winds generally don't blow in their  direction, but an explosion would have completely polluted Lake Erie.   FirstEnergy itself avoided fraud and criminal indictments by  admitting its corporate guilt. Of course, nuclear malfeasance is not on  trial, but it should be. Thus far, the court has ordered FirstEnergy to  pay a historic $230 million settlement, the largest public fine in  Ohio's history, although there were no fines for bigger crimes against  the public interest by multiple nuclear endangerments.   FirstEnergy's management made huge blunders in nuclear operation.  Were it not for the skilled union laborers who three times put their  lives at risk for our region, a nuclear catastrophe along Lake Erie was  indeed possible. At least three major nuclear incidents have occurred  during my lifetime: 1985, 2002, 2003.   Davis-Besse plant records document the second and third as the worst  nuclear incidents since Three Mile Island.   The ongoing criminal litigation ignores these massive nuclear close  calls. Each major nuclear blunder translated into real threats to  lives, safety, and health.   At what point does our Nation say no to a pattern of persistent  commercial plant nuclear negligence and abysmal nuclear management?   The time is now as our region tries to pick up the pieces and rebuild  advanced nuclear--but not by past standards.   The starting point to get effective safety monitoring in these two  Ohio facilities begins by requesting the Federal Government's  Government Accountability Office to perform thorough and independent  nuclear safety audits of its aging nuclear facilities.   The next step is to require the Nuclear Navy, with independent  experts, to complete a thorough engineering analysis of the plant's  remaining physical infrastructure.   Next, specific individuals who were responsible for criminal activity  at FirstEnergy must be identified and barred for life from working or  contracting with the U.S. commercial nuclear industry, and we must also  identify legal means to restore to ratepayers compensation for their  losses.   As Admiral Hyman Rickover, father of the Nuclear Navy, said:  ``Success teaches us nothing; only failure teaches.''   Let Ohio learn and let America learn, and let's do it right.                            ____________________
