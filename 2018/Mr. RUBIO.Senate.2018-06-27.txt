 Mr. President, reserving the right to object, in this farm  bill, when it was considered in committee, there was an amendment added  that allows for American agricultural interests to promote American  agriculture on the enslaved island of Cuba.   In an effort to be accommodating, I have said: Well, that is fine. It  is not a very large market, and, frankly, as long as we are not lending  them money--because they are never going to pay us back--I am not going  to object to the ability of American farmers to market our products to  a market. In the end, it is food.   What I do think we should not allow, however, is the ability to spend  American taxpayer money in properties and in other places on the island  that are owned and controlled by the Cuban  [[Page S4485]]  military. Last year, President Trump issued an Executive order that  prohibited American citizens who traveled to Cuba from staying at  hotels or frequenting businesses or anything of this nature that is  controlled by GAESA, which is a holding company controlled by the Cuban  military.   So what I have proposed as a way forward on this is to basically say:  That is fine. You can promote American agriculture in Cuba. But while  you are there and doing your activities, you can promote it, but you  just can't spend any of these taxpayer dollars at any of the facilities  or businesses controlled or owned by the Cuban military. The list is  detailed and provided by the State Department via Executive order.   That is the amendment I offered. To date, we have not been able to  get it considered as part of any of these vehicles that are moving.  Therefore, procedurally, I am wanting to protect my right to ensure  this gets included in something that is incredibly important from my  perspective, so I object.
