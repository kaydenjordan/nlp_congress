 Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the  American Dream and Promise Act.   Before I continue with my remarks, I want to remind Mr. Jordan and  the others across the aisle that no human being is illegal. We are all  children of God.   I have dedicated my life to public service to help immigrants who  come to the U.S. in search of a prosperous and dignified life.   Since 2001, when the Dream Act was first conceived, Dreamers have  waited.   In 2012, DACA enabled eligible young adults to work lawfully, attend  school, and contribute to society without the constant threat of  deportation.   However, Dreamers are still waiting.   In Texas, over 213,000 Dreamers contribute $963 million in local,  State, and Federal taxes and have played a critical role in our State's  response to the COVID pandemic.   Dreamers have waited.   It is time for us to deliver. We should treat them with respect. I  urge passage.    Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this  bill. Agricultural workers are crucial to our economy, and this bill  would establish a legal and reliable farm workforce.   I support this bill because it recognizes the humanity--yes, the  humanity--of farmworkers and their families.   This is personal to me. I grew up poor, picking cotton in the fields  of south Texas. I can testify firsthand about the incredibly hard,  backbreaking work that farmworkers do, especially in the heat of the  south Texas sun. Not much seems to have changed since I worked in the  fields. Things pretty much still are handled about the same.   This bill is long overdue and would provide farmworkers with  important worker protections and legal rights that I never had and that  they desperately need today. Texas is home to nearly 250,000 farms, and  the need for a strong agricultural workforce is vital. It is vital to  Texas; it is vital to this country; and it is vital to this world.   Madam Speaker, I urge passage.
