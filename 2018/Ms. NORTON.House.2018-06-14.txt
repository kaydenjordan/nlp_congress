 Mr. Speaker, when Members attack one another on this  floor, we sometimes have to apologize publicly.   What is the appropriate penalty when a Presidential administration  attacks children in our country?   That is what is happening now at the border, as children are forcibly  taken from their parents. Even if these children were being held in  palatial splendor, nothing could make up for being taken from the only  adult they have known since birth.   Our country's policy has always been family unification. Breaking  with that policy and with decency, Donald Trump and Jeff Sessions have  devised a new deterrent for crossing the border to seek asylum.   Says Jeff Sessions: ``If you're smuggling a child, then we're going  to prosecute you, and that child will be separated from you.''   If they want to attack border crossers, the Trump administration  should pick on somebody their own size.                            ____________________
