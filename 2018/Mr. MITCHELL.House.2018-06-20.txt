Office of National Drug Control.......................1001''.....       SEC. 3. HIGH INTENSITY DRUG TRAFFICKING AREAS PROGRAM.         (a) Establishment.--        (1) In general.--There is established in the Office a       program to be known as the High Intensity Drug Trafficking       Areas Program (in this section referred to as the       ``Program'').        (2) Purpose.--The purpose of the Program is to reduce drug       trafficking and drug production in the United States by--        (A) facilitating cooperation among Federal, State, local,       and Tribal law enforcement agencies to share information and       implement coordinated enforcement activities;        (B) enhancing law enforcement intelligence sharing among       Federal, State, local, and Tribal law enforcement agencies;        (C) providing reliable law enforcement intelligence to law       enforcement agencies needed to design effective enforcement       strategies and operations; and        (D) supporting coordinated law enforcement strategies which       maximize use of available resources to reduce the supply of       illegal drugs in designated areas and in the United States as       a whole.        (b) Designation.--        (1) In general.--The Director, in consultation with the       Attorney General, the Secretary of the Treasury, the       Secretary of Homeland Security, the head of each National       Drug Control Program Agency, and the Governor of each       applicable State, may designate any specified area of the       United States as a high intensity drug trafficking area.        (2) Activities.--After making a designation under paragraph       (1) and in order to provide Federal assistance to the area so       designated, the Director may--        (A) obligate such sums as are appropriated for the Program;        (B) direct the temporary reassignment of Federal personnel       to such area, subject to the approval of the head of the       agency that employs such personnel;        (C) take any other action authorized under this section or       chapter 10 of title 31, United States Code, as added by       section 2(c), to provide increased Federal assistance to       those areas; and        (D) coordinate activities under this section (specifically       administrative, recordkeeping, and funds management       activities) with State, local, and Tribal officials.        (c) Petitions for Designation.--The Director shall       establish and maintain regulations under which a coalition of       interested law enforcement agencies from an area may petition       for designation as a high intensity drug trafficking area (in       this section referred  [[Page H5319]]       to as the ``HIDTA''). Such regulations shall provide for a       regular review by the Director of the petition, including a       recommendation regarding the merit of the petition to the       Director by a panel of qualified, independent experts.        (d) Factors for Consideration.--In considering whether to       designate an area under this section as a high intensity drug       trafficking area, the Director shall consider, in addition to       such other criteria as the Director considers to be       appropriate, the extent to which--        (1) the area is a significant center of illegal drug       production, manufacturing, importation, or distribution;        (2) State, local, and Tribal law enforcement agencies have       committed resources to respond to the drug trafficking       problem in the area, thereby indicating a determination to       respond aggressively to the problem;        (3) drug-related activities in the area are having a       significant harmful impact in the area, and in other areas of       the country; and        (4) a significant increase in allocation of Federal       resources is necessary to respond adequately to drug-related       activities in the area.        (e) Organization of High Intensity Drug Trafficking       Areas.--        (1) Executive board and officers.--To be eligible for funds       appropriated under this section, each high intensity drug       trafficking area shall be governed by an Executive Board. The       Executive Board shall designate a chairman, vice chairman,       and any other officers to the Executive Board that it       determines are necessary.        (2) Responsibilities.--The Executive Board of a high       intensity drug trafficking area shall be responsible for--        (A) providing direction and oversight in establishing and       achieving the goals of the high intensity drug trafficking       area;        (B) managing the funds of the high intensity drug       trafficking area;        (C) reviewing and approving all funding proposals       consistent with the overall objective of the high intensity       drug trafficking area; and        (D) reviewing and approving all reports to the Director on       the activities of the high intensity drug trafficking area.        (3) Board representation.--None of the funds appropriated       under this section may be expended for any high intensity       drug trafficking area, or for a partnership or region of a       high intensity drug trafficking area, if the Executive Board       for such area, region, or partnership, does not apportion an       equal number of votes between representatives of       participating agencies and representatives of participating       State, local, and Tribal agencies. Where it is impractical       for an equal number of representatives of agencies and State,       local, and Tribal agencies to attend a meeting of an       Executive Board in person, the Executive Board may use a       system of proxy votes or weighted votes to achieve the voting       balance required by this paragraph.        (4) No agency relationship.--The eligibility requirements       of this section are intended to ensure the responsible use of       Federal funds. Nothing in this section is intended to create       an agency relationship between individual high intensity drug       trafficking areas and the Federal Government.        (f) Use of Funds.--The Director shall ensure that not more       than 5 percent of Federal funds appropriated for the Program       are expended for substance use disorder treatment programs       and not more than 5 percent of the Federal funds appropriated       for the Program are expended for drug prevention programs.        (g) Counterterrorism Activities.--        (1) Assistance authorized.--The Director may authorize use       of resources available for the Program to assist Federal,       State, local, and Tribal law enforcement agencies in       investigations and activities related to terrorism and       prevention of terrorism, especially but not exclusively with       respect to such investigations and activities that are also       related to drug trafficking.        (2) Limitation.--The Director shall ensure--        (A) that assistance provided under paragraph (1) remains       incidental to the purpose of the Program to reduce drug       availability and carry out drug-related law enforcement       activities; and        (B) that significant resources of the Program are not       redirected to activities exclusively related to terrorism,       except on a temporary basis under extraordinary       circumstances, as determined by the Director.        (h) Role of Drug Enforcement Administration.--The Director,       in consultation with the Attorney General, shall ensure that       a representative of the Drug Enforcement Administration is       included in the Intelligence Support Center for each high       intensity drug trafficking area.        (i) Emerging Threat Response Fund.--        (1) In general.--Subject to the availability of       appropriations, the Director may expend up to 10 percent of       the amounts appropriated under this section on a       discretionary basis, in accordance with the criteria       established under paragraph (2)--        (A) to respond to any emerging drug trafficking threat in       an existing high intensity drug trafficking area;        (B) to establish a new high intensity drug trafficking       area; or        (C) to expand an existing high intensity drug trafficking       area.        (2) Consideration of impact.--In allocating funds under       this subsection, the Director shall consider--        (A) the impact of activities funded on reducing overall       drug traffic in the United States, or minimizing the       probability that an emerging drug trafficking threat will       spread to other areas of the United States; and        (B) such other criteria as the Director considers       appropriate.        (j) Annual Hidta Program Budget Submissions.--As part of       the documentation that supports the President's annual budget       request for the Office, the Director shall submit to Congress       a budget justification that includes--        (1) the amount proposed for each HIDTA, conditional upon a       review by the Office of the request submitted by such HIDTA       and the performance of such HIDTA, with supporting narrative       descriptions and rationale for each request;        (2) a detailed justification that explains--        (A) the reasons for the proposed funding level and how such       funding level was determined based on a current assessment of       the drug trafficking threat in each high intensity drug       trafficking area;        (B) how such funding will ensure that the goals and       objectives of each such area will be achieved; and        (C) how such funding supports the National Drug Control       Strategy; and        (3) the amount of HIDTA funds used to investigate and       prosecute organizations and individuals trafficking in each       major illicit drug, as identified by the Director, in the       prior calendar year, and a description of how those funds       were used.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5925, introduced by the  gentleman from South Carolina, Chairman Gowdy.   The Coordinated Response through Interagency Strategy and Information  Sharing, or CRISIS, Act is a bill to reauthorize the Office of National  Drug Control. This relatively small office plays an important role in  coordinating the Nation's drug control efforts. The office has become  increasingly important as we look to engage governmentwide initiatives  to combat the opioid epidemic.   Over the past 2 weeks, we have passed many good bills to help combat  the opioid epidemic. Each will move us closer to ending the opioid  crisis.   This bill is a critical piece of the puzzle. It ensures Federal,  State, and local governments work with each other and other  nongovernmental entities to achieve the results we are seeking.  Congress needs to provide the Office of National Drug Control the  authorities it needs to lead the effort to combat the opioid crisis.  The CRISIS Act does just that.   The CRISIS Act updates and reaffirms the office's important role.  That includes strengthening certain authorities to empower the office  in the midst of this devastating epidemic.   The opioid epidemic has impacted nearly every community across the  Nation. One person dies about every 4 hours from an opioid overdose.  One of the most important aspects of this bill is a comprehensive  response plan. It is not enough to simply have a plan. We need action  and follow-through to end the opioid crisis.   The CRISIS Act requires measurable objectives so we know whether the  programs we are funding are working.   Accountability is at the heart of this bill. The CRISIS Act requires  the Office of National Drug Control to develop a national strategy to  be carried out by a wide array of agencies. It then requires the office  to oversee and coordinate implementation of that strategy each year. It  requires the office to measure whether the agencies are meeting the  specific goals of that strategy.   Our colleagues in the House and Senate are advancing a number of  bills to address the opioid epidemic, and new initiatives are being  announced daily. I offered an amendment in committee markup, with the  support of Congressman Raskin, which brings in requirements from the  CODE RED Act, sponsored by the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.  Rothfus).   The CODE RED Act and the amendment require a coordinated tracking  system of the Federal funding to be put toward drug control efforts  throughout the country. This system includes a central repository of  grants related to substance abuse treatment, prevention, and  enforcement, and to identify those which are duplicative.   The government needs to know exactly what it is spending, where it is  going, and if it is working. This is not the time to invest in  ineffective strategies. We need to identify resources that work and  apply Federal resources accordingly.   I would like to thank my fellow committee members for accepting the  amendment, the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Raskin) for offering it  with me, and, of course, Mr. Rothfus for all the work he has done in  finding an effective approach to tackle the opioid crisis.   There are many bills and proposals that seek to end the opioid  crisis, but it will only be possible with commitment to a coordinated  strategy and a unified approach. This bill, through the reauthorization  of the Office of National Drug Control, will provide the coordination,  strategy, and unified approach we need.   This is an important and timely bill. I urge my colleagues to support  it, and I reserve the balance of my time.           House of Representatives, Committee on Oversight and             Government Reform,                                      Washington, DC, June 5, 2018.      Hon. Edward Royce,      Chairman, Committee on Foreign Affairs,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: On May 23, 2018, the Committee on       Oversight and Government Reform ordered reported H.R. 5925,       the ``Coordinated Response through Interagency Strategy and       Information Sharing Act,'' with an amendment, by voice vote.       The bill was referred primarily to the Committee on Oversight       and Government Reform, with additional referrals to the       Committees on Energy and Commerce, Foreign Affairs, the       Judiciary, Intelligence, and Appropriations.        I ask you allow the Committee on Foreign Affairs to be       discharged from further consideration of the bill so it may       be scheduled for floor consideration by the Majority Leader.       This discharge in no way affects your jurisdiction over the       subject matter of the bill, and it will not serve as       precedent for future referrals. In addition, should a       conference on the bill be necessary, I would support your       request to have the Committee on Foreign Affairs represented       on the conference committee. Finally, I would be pleased to       include this letter and any response in the bill report filed       by the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, as well       as in the Congressional Record during floor consideration, to       memorialize our understanding.

Dear Chairman Gowdy: Thank you for consulting with the       Committee on Foreign Affairs on H.R. 5925, the Coordinated       Response through Interagency Strategy and Information Sharing       Act, and for accommodating appropriate edits in the amended       text of the bill.        I agree that the Foreign Affairs Committee may be       discharged from further action on this bill, subject to the       understanding that this waiver does not in any way diminish       or alter the jurisdiction of the Foreign Affairs Committee,       or prejudice its jurisdictional prerogatives on this bill or       similar legislation in the future. The Committee also       reserves the right to seek an appropriate number of conferees       to any House-Senate conference involving this bill, and would       appreciate your support for any such request.  [[Page H5322]]         I ask that you place our exchange of letters into the       Congressional Record during floor consideration of the bill.       I appreciate your cooperation, and look forward to continuing       to work with you as this measure moves through the       legislative process.

Thank you for your consideration of my request.            Sincerely,                                                        Trey Gowdy.     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the support of my colleague for this  bipartisan effort to address the opioid crisis in this country. I also  appreciate his emphasis on effectively and efficiently addressing that  crisis.   I will note that in the last appropriation cycle, we increased  funding for opioid treatment by almost $4 billion in this year alone.  There is much work to be done; it is a crisis; and we will work  together to address that crisis.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from North Carolina  (Mr. Meadows), the cosponsor of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the support of my colleague from Virginia  (Mr. Connolly) for this bipartisan effort. I certainly hope the  American people have the opportunity to see this effort as we address  this crisis on a bipartisan basis. Far too frequently, they see  conflict and disagreement put forth by media and other sources, but  there is a great deal we work together on, and I think we need to  stress that as we talk to people about this crisis.   Mr. Speaker, in a moment, I will yield to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Rothfus), but first let me give him credit, because  he is the sponsor of legislation on which my amendment was based, H.R.  5980, the CODE RED Act.   The CODE RED Act, like the amendment I offered with Mr. Raskin in  committee, requires a coordinated tracking system of Federal funding  put towards drug control efforts throughout our country. It is a smart  idea, especially given the opioid epidemic in our Nation and the costs  of it, and I strongly supported it.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania  (Mr. Rothfus).    Mr. Speaker, I want to make the gentleman from Maryland  aware that I have no further speakers and I am prepared to close.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my colleague's support of the bill. In my  brief time here, a year and a half, it has become abundantly clear to  me that rarely do we get to dust off our hands and say we are done  around here.   It has also become clear to me that the debate of the bill rarely  stays on the topic of the bill or solely on the topic of the bill. You  see, the ACA, the Affordable Care Act, is not the sole approach to  addressing healthcare issues in this country, preexisting conditions,  or the preexisting conditions that are affected by drug abuse.   I believe when we passed the American Health Care Act in this House,  that that addressed preexisting conditions, treatment for substance  abuse, and, using the words of my colleague, did so more effectively  and efficiently than the Affordable Care Act does now.   We clearly disagree on that. I respect that, and will continue to  work on it.   Today, we are dealing with this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support passage of this bill,  because I believe that H.R. 5925 is an important step not only in  reauthorizing the Office of National Drug Control, but also in  providing additional resources to do so.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption the bill, and I yield back the balance  of my time.
