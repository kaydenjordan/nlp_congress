 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to salute all the men and  women who make up the police forces across this great country. As well,  the men and women in blue have served this country and protect us.   I especially want to salute the 135 officers who gave up their lives  this past year. I also want to say thanks to my own father, who served  as chief of police in El Dorado, Kansas, for 25 years.   My heart is especially warmed as I look out and see the tens of  thousands of police officers in Washington, D.C., this week as they  honor those who made the ultimate sacrifice.                            ____________________
