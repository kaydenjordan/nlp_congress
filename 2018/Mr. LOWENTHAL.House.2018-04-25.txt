 Mr. Speaker, endangered salmon are not the only  species that H.R. 3144 puts at risk. By removing critical protections  for salmon runs, this bill would also push one of our most treasured  whale species closer to extinction.   As pointed out by Congresswoman Tsongas, the Southern Resident killer  whales are critically endangered. In fact, there are only 76 of them  that are left. These whales depend upon healthy and abundant salmon  populations for survival. More than 50 percent of their diet comes from  Chinook salmon in the Columbia River basin. Without access to these  wild salmon populations, Southern Resident killer whales are literally  starving to death.   In order to save both of these iconic species, we cannot undermine  important habitat restoration efforts or improvements in dam  operations, both of which are essential to promoting survival in the  river systems where these salmon spawn. Unfortunately, H.R. 3144 would  do just the opposite.   In addition, the Southern Resident killer whales provide immense  economic benefits to the Pacific Northwest. Whale watching is a major  tourist attraction in Washington and has contributed an additional $65  million to the State's economy each year.   Losing these killer whales would not only have an irreversible effect  on the marine ecosystem, it would be a huge blow to the tourism  industry and to the local businesses that rely on their survival.   H.R. 3144 may be known as the Salmon Extinction Act, but, frankly, we  should tack on Southern Resident killer whales to that name. Without  access to waters beyond the Snake River dams, salmon populations will  continue to plummet, and without salmon, the Southern Resident killer  whales will die.   The fate of both these species rests in our hands. I urge my  colleagues to stand with me and stand with the whales and vote against  H.R. 3144.
