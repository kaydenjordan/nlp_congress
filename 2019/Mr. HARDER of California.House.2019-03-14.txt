 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule I,  I demand a vote on agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the Journal.    Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the  ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order that a  quorum is not present.    Mr. Speaker, this week, the administration  released its proposed budget, and I am here to share what those budget  cuts actually mean for the farmers in my home, California's Central  Valley.   Imagine you are an almond farmer in the Central Valley. Maybe your  farm has been a part of the family for multiple generations. Over the  past 5 years, you have seen your net farm income has dropped by half,  the largest drop since the Great Depression.   Then you wake up this week and hear that the administration, which  promised to be in your corner, wants to cut billions of dollars from  programs that help you and your family put food on tables across the  country:   Programs like crop insurance so if you lose your crops from flooding  or from fires your farm stays afloat. Under this budget, crop insurance  is cut by $26 billion;   Programs like drought relief to make up for damaged properties during  arid seasons. Well, under this budget drought relief is cut by $8  billion.   Or imagine you live in a district like mine where water management  and storage are essential. Well, under this budget, 30 percent of the  Army Corps of Engineers' budget is cut, putting all those structures at  risk.                            ____________________
