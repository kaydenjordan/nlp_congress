 And still I rise, Mr. Speaker, proud to support  H. Res. 382, with its clarion call to condemn and combat all acts of  anti-Semitism. I do so, Mr. Speaker, because those who tolerate anti- Semitism perpetuate anti-Semitism and racism, just as those who  tolerate racism perpetuate it.   Mr. Speaker, I will neither tolerate nor will I perpetuate either.
