 Madam President, today I missed the vote on passage  of S. 914, as amended, in order to attend an event related to vaccine  distribution in Baltimore City with Vice President Kamala Harris. Had I  been in attendance, I would have voted yes on this important,  bipartisan bill.                            ____________________
