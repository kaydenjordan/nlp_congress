 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the George  Floyd Justice in Policing Act, to help constructively change the  culture of law enforcement and strengthen the trust between police and  the communities they serve.   Last summer, communities across the Nation convulsed with raw emotion  after George Floyd was brutally murdered by a police officer.   His death may have been the spark, but the true force motivating  these protests was the systemic racism that harms Black Americans every  day.   Last June, one month after his death, this House passed the George  Floyd Justice in Policing Act, only to see it stall in the Senate.   We will vote again on the bill this week.   George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, these people and  countless others should still be alive today.   We can't bring them and the others back, but we can honor their  memory and, in so doing, strengthen our communities and our Nation. I  urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this bill.                            ____________________
