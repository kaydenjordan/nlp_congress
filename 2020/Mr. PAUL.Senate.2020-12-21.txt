 Mr. President, Republicans like to mock modern monetary  theory--the idea that government can print money with impunity and that  government can spend whatever it wants without the need to tax. Modern  monetary theory is basically the Dick Cheney ``deficits don't matter''  crowd, trussed up with a new fancy title.   Most Republicans rightly lampoon this quackery; that is, when they  are not practicing the quackery themselves. Today, many of these same  Republicans will vote for a bill that makes modern monetary theory look  like child's play in comparison. The monster spending bill presented  today is not just a ``deficits don't matter'' disaster, it is  everything Republicans say they don't believe in.   This bill is free money for everyone. Proponents don't care if you  are fully employed or own your own house or own your own business.  ``Free money for everyone,'' they cry. And yet, if free money were the  answer and if money really grew on trees, why not give more free money?  Why not give it out all the time? Why stop at $600 a person? Why not  $1,000? Why not $2,000? Maybe these new free-money Republicans should  join the ``everybody gets a guaranteed income'' caucus. Why not $20,000  a year for everybody? Why not $30,000? If we can print up money with  impunity, why not do it?   The Treasury could just keep printing the money; that is, until  someone points out that the Emperor has no clothes and that the dollar  no longer has value. To so-called conservatives who are quick to  identify the socialism of Democrats, if you vote for this spending  monstrosity, you are no better. When you vote to pass out free money,  you lose your soul, and you abandon forever any semblance of moral or  fiscal integrity.   So the next time you see Republicans in high moral dudgeon, claiming  and complaining about spending of Democrats and socialism, remind  them--remind them if they supported this monstrous bill, that really  the difference between the parties is less Adam Smith versus Marx and  more Marx versus Engels.   How bad is our fiscal situation? Well, the Federal Government brought  in $3.3 trillion last year and spent $6.6 trillion. The deficit last  year, a record-busting $3.3 trillion. If you are looking for more COVID  bailout money, we don't have any. The coffers are bare. We have no  rainy day fund. We have no savings account. Congress has spent all the  money long ago.   The economic damage from this pandemic is not the reason for this  runaway spending. This spending has been going on for decades. Every  year, even before we get to all the extra COVID-free money, we have  been spending $1 trillion we don't have.   Today's money is gone, so Congress is spending tomorrow's money. The  spending chart is a red line of red ink that goes on forever. When we  talk about spending tomorrow's money, it is not just the money that we  need next month. It is the money we might need in a decade. It is the  money we will need in one, two, three generations from now--for  national defense and for infrastructure. This is the money that your  children and your grandchildren will pay back with interest.   The deficit doubling and tripling--under George Bush, it went from $5  trillion to $10 trillion. Under President Obama, it went from $10  trillion to $20 trillion. We are now at $27 trillion, but we are adding  it at $1 trillion a year before we get to this COVID budget-busting  bailout.   Every tax-paying American already owes over $136,000, and they are  staring at projections into the future that show no end. We are $27  trillion in debt today. How do we expect a child to have the economic  opportunity when this crushing debt is their inheritance from Congress?  The numbers are mind-boggling. It is hard to conceive of what $1  billion is, much less $1 trillion.   How big is $1 billion? Well, a billion seconds ago was 1988 and  Reagan was President. A billion minutes ago, Jesus walked the shore of  the Sea of Galilee. A billion hours ago, man still lived in caves. But  $1 billion ago, was just 80 minutes ago--$1 billion ago, at the rate  Congress spends money, was just 80 minutes ago.   All of this should be setting off alarm bells. But the only alarm  bells in Congress are sounding the alarm for more spending and more  debt. No cuts, no offsets, no pay-fors, and no prioritization. Just  print it up. Print up more money and give it out to everybody because  it is free money. Come and get yours while the getting is good. But it  leads to a mountain of debt. Spend all this money and leave the future  to figure itself out.   John Maynard Keynes was once asked: What about the long run?   He said: In the short run, you can make a stimulus. You can print  money, and you can give it to everybody.   And Maynard Keynes, his response was: In the long run, we will all be  dead; no concern for the future, only for the immediate.   Our budget deficit for 2020 was $3.3 trillion, but this new spending  package will also give us another $2 trillion in the next fiscal year.  By refusing to acknowledge the debt crisis, we are only hastening the  day of economic reckoning.   Total debt was 55 percent of GDP just 20 years ago. Today, it is 128  percent of GDP. So our annual or our total debt is more than our GDP-- 128 percent of our GDP. The World Bank estimates there  [[Page S7896]]  is a tipping point of debt to GDP at about 77 percent. Every percentage  point costs another 10th or so of economic growth. So every year, we  are giving out somewhere between 5 to 8 percent of growth every year  because of this burden of debt. This is thousands of jobs, every year-- tens of thousands of jobs that we lose because of this burden of debt.    We are borrowing and worsening this debt crisis in part because too  many Governors and mayors have imposed heavyhanded restrictions that  crush business. It isn't the pandemic that is killing the economy; it  is the government's overzealous response that is killing the economy.  The pandemic itself was disruptive, but Congress is being asked to help  to perpetuate these lockdowns. The more money we give to the States,  the more they keep us in lockdown.   Every bailout dollar printed and passed out to the Governors only  allows these tin-pot dictators to perpetuate the lockdowns. Their rules  are arbitrary and unscientific. Governors and mayors across the country  are picking winners and losers.   Businesses, some that have been in families for generations, are  being wiped out because they are not allowed to open. Restaurants have  to close their doors for indoor dining, but then they are told they can  open at limited capacity, but then they are told they have to close  again. Then they are told they can open outside, and then they are told  they can't open outside. Confusing doesn't even explain the half of it.   Bars are told they can only serve alcohol if people are sitting and  not standing and only if they have heavy foods on their menus.   Restaurants are told they can serve outdoors, and then they have  their permission revoked after they have sunk time and money converting  their restaurant to outdoor services, but a caterer is told they can  still serve outside.   Businesses are told they have to close at an arbitrary time  determined by government officials, as though the virus only comes out  late at night. A business in one ZIP Code can open, but one in an  adjoining ZIP Code across the street has to close, as if the virus  can't cross an imaginary line.   Airlines are allowed to fly, but hotels have to limit their  occupancy, so you may not have anywhere to stay when you get there.   Mom-and-pop stores and specialty stores are forced to close, but big- box store competitors are allowed to stay open.   How is any business expected to survive with this kind of arbitrary  regulation that changes from day to day? Meanwhile, many schools remain  closed--despite overwhelming evidence showing kids can learn safely in  person--which means parents can't go to work, which forces parents to  leave their jobs and take care of homebound kids. Now they have no  income because the government forced them to leave their jobs to take  care of their kids. And many kids are struggling with this improvised  virtual school.   The need for help is real. I hear it every day from Kentuckians and  across the country. But it is clear that government has worsened the  economic damage and acted as the biggest obstacle to economic recovery.   There is no free money that can get us out of this situation. The  only thing that can save us is to open the economy. If we give these  tin-pot dictators--these Governors--more money, they are less likely to  open the economy.   The answer is not printing up and distributing ``free money''; it is  opening the economy. We are not even debating the real answer to this.  We are like, just print up the money and shovel it out the door, the  deficit be damned, the threat of the destruction of our currency be  damned.   We can choose to let our economies open with guidance and precautions  but not obstruction. Let people rebuild their livelihoods. Reopen our  schools so our kids can return and parents can go back to work.   Congress should do away with automatic spending increases and  scrutinize where in the budget we can find savings to pay for the  pressing needs arising from the pandemic, but we shouldn't simply print  up money and pass it out to everyone. Or Congress can follow the status  quo. Congress can continue to borrow from our kids--the same children  we have locked out of our schools. Congress can keep enabling and  shutting down businesses by force, spend all of today's money and all  of tomorrow's money, and then good luck. Good luck figuring out how to  pay for all of this massive debt.   It doesn't have to be this way. There is another alternative that  won't be debated, and that alternative is to open the economy. It is  not too late to change our course. Cut unnecessary spending. Eliminate  waste. Stop fighting a $50-billion-a-year war in Afghanistan that  hasn't had a military mission in at least a decade.   Make the hard decisions now. We can't keep pretending that more debt  is a sustainable policy course. ``Leadership'' is not passing on the  problem to someone who can't protest; ``leadership'' is making the hard  choices now. This is what we have to do.   I will oppose this new debt, and I will continue to sound the alarm  until we change our course. Our country can be saved. We can survive  this if we pull together. But adding more debt is a mistake. It is not  the solution, and we should resist it.   Thank you.    Mr. President, I rise to honor the passing of a  great Kentuckian, Richard Ronald Knock, or Dick, as he was known to his  friends and family. He died December 8, 2020, at the age of 82.   Dick was born June 28, 1938 in Cold Spring, KY. Dick's name was  always mentioned with high praise. He was valued in his community, as  he was known to lend a helping hand when needed and provided a  thoughtful ear when spoken to. Mr. Knock came from a humble upbringing,  but through his own deeds, he rose to the pinnacle of his profession,  being a respected member of many institutions, including as CEO of  Knock Investments; CEO of Omaha Enterprises; through his service on the  Board of Trustees at University of the Cumberlands; and as chairman of  Board of Commissioners for the Boone County Water District.   Dick was also an active political pundit within his community. His  commitment to freedom was unmatched, and he often proved to be a great  source of wisdom for elected leaders such as myself. Dick worked  tirelessly in bringing Republicans throughout the Commonwealth together  in the name of freedom. I can recall during my first election he opened  his house for an event that featured my predecessor, Senator Jim  Bunning, that helped unify Republicans in a critical area of our State.  A picture from that event hangs in my Washington office to this day.  With his passing, we have lost one of our brightest and loudest freedom  fighters, but, as Dick would want, the voices of liberty will remain  loud and clear.   While we share in the great sadness of his passing, it with great joy  we look back at his life, his many accopmlishments, and the positive  impact he had on his community and Kentuckians across the Commonwealth.  We honor Dick and his family, and may he rest in peace.                            ____________________
