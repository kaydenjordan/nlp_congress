 Mr. Speaker, had I been present for the vote on H.  Res. 796, the resolution providing for consideration of the fiscal year  2019 Consolidated Appropriations Act (Rollcall No. 124), I would have  voted ``no''.   Additionally, had I been present for the vote on H.R. 4467, the  Strengthening Aviation Security Act of 2017 (Rollcall No. 128), I would  have voted ``aye''.                            ____________________
