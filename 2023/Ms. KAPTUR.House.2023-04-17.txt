 Mr. Speaker, I rise to highlight advancing healthcare at  both the Federal and State levels to meet  [[Page H1743]]  the healthcare needs of people living in the northwest quadrant of  Ohio, including the mentally ill.   Our Federal-State joint efforts in combined funding of over $35  million awarded to Toledo's academic medical center at the University  of Toledo through the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid have allowed  UTMC to upgrade critical trauma care from trauma III to trauma II.   In addition, Congress appropriated over $81 million in 2022 and 2023  to Ohio through the Substance Abuse and Treatment Block Grant.   This morning, I had the privilege of welcoming Ohio Governor Mike  DeWine to Toledo, as we toured the University of Toledo Medical Center  and the State's Northwest Ohio Psychiatric Hospital. Governor DeWine is  the first Governor to visit the State facility in the 21st century.   This important visit shows that Ohioans are continuing to make  progress to strengthen critical medical assets for the region in a  bipartisan fashion at every level.   Our medically underserved region must continue to champion medical  advancements on every level. Onward Northwest Ohio, a community that  cares for all people.                            ____________________
