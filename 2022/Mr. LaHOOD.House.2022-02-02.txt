 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding the time.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to the so-called America  COMPETES Act. Instead of following the productive bipartisan efforts  initiated in the Senate, House Democrats have chosen the go-it-alone  approach that fails to meet the urgent needs to strengthen U.S.  competitiveness and protect our national security as it relates to  China.   On the Committee on Ways and Means, I have worked across the aisle on  China policy with my Democrat colleagues, including trade priorities to  bring manufacturing back to the United States, to hold China to their  trade commitments, and to prioritize digital trade agreements with  like-minded allies to combat China's abusive digital standards.   Yet here we are today. Democrats are pushing partisan legislation  stocked with more D.C. control over our economy that fails to address  the critical trade initiatives to put American workers and businesses  first and to counter the market distorting and dangerous economic  practices of China.   As a member of the Intelligence Committee and the China Task Force,  and the co-chair of the bipartisan U.S.-China Working Group, I  understand the unique and urgent action required to strengthen American  competitiveness and combat growing challenges from China. It is  disappointing that House Democrats are again ignoring this opportunity  to work together with Republicans as they did in the Senate,  Republicans and Democrats together, to put forth a commonsense bill.  Where is that bill? It is not here.    We need to address the real challenges presented by China, and  instead, we are cynically pushing forward unrelated liberal agenda  items.   Vote ``no.''
