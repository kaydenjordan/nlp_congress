 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 7301. This  important bill extends and expands critical tenant protections and  authorizes key housing assistance that is vital to keeping our  neighbors safely housed during this ongoing pandemic.   Mr. Speaker, I especially want to thank Chair Waters for including  language I wrote that will authorize additional funding for the Public  Housing Operating Fund and the Section 8 program.   The money we are providing today would allow public housing  authorities to continue taking necessary steps to protect residents  from the coronavirus.   Importantly, this bill also extends the eviction and foreclosure  moratoriums we created in the CARES Act for 1 year. Further, it expands  those protections to all renters and homeowners.   The bill helps subsidize monthly housing costs by creating a $100  billion rental assistance fund and a $75 billion homeownership fund,  crucial resources for those struggling with their monthly housing  costs.   Creation of these funds will also ensure that individuals and  families will not face lump-sum obligations and payments when the  moratoriums end.   The urgency of the moment is upon us. We need this bill more than  ever. The eviction moratorium provided for in the CARES Act is set to  expire in late July.   In New York City, tenants' fear of eviction by unscrupulous landlords  is ever-present. It has been predicted we could see a wave of 50,000  evictions in the city if we do not act fast.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to sponsor the bill. I urge its speedy  adoption.
