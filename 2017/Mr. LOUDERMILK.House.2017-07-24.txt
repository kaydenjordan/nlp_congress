 Mr. Speaker, I give a special thanks to my good  friend from Illinois for his thoughtfulness in this bill.   Mr. Speaker, there are times in our lifetime that leave an impact on  our lives and we never forget that place or time when we experienced  the event or we heard of the event. For my father, it was the attack on  Pearl Harbor. He always remembered that moment and the place and the  feelings he had when he heard of the attack, which motivated him to  join the United States Army. For my children, it was the attacks on  America on September 11, 2001.   For me, Mr. Speaker, it is Flag Day, June 14, 2017, at a baseball  practice. Not only will I remember that event, but I specifically  remember where I was because I was there. Not only was I there, I was  within proximity of 10 to 15 feet from the officers who acted so  heroically. And still, Mr. Speaker, those images of that day are vivid  in my mind. There isn't a day that goes by--and I am sure it is the  same thing for the other players--that I don't relive a portion of that  moment.                                time  1715    But although those images are vivid, time heals all wounds, and at  some point the details will be obscured by the fog of war and other  events in our lives. But I will never forget the heroic actions of  those two officers that day. Even at the moment when Agent Griner took  a bullet--which I believe was destined for me, or definitely in my  direction--which took her down and out of the fight, Agent Bailey came  to check on his partner, and immediately put himself even more in the  line of fire to draw the fire away from us.   I can't express how heroic these officers acted. Some may say, well,  that is  [[Page H6186]]  their duty, but what I experienced, Mr. Speaker, was above and beyond  any call of duty, setting aside their own safety, their own persons,  and putting themselves in a situation where death may have been  imminent.   They were in a gunfight with someone with a more powerful, more  accurate rifle, and all they had was a handgun. But they never let that  dissuade them from protecting the lives of those of us. I would not be  here today if it wasn't for those two agents.   This is the least that we could do, as has been expressed by many  other speakers. The cost upon the families is tremendous when someone  is injured in the line of duty. I believe that this is all fitting, and  it is an expression of our appreciation for what they do for us day in  and day out.   I hope and I pray that we never have an incident like that again, but  as history tells us, something like this will happen again. And I just  hope that we have agents like Agents Griner and Bailey on duty when  that happens again.   There were many miracles on the field that day, and one of those  miracles was having the two right agents there doing their job, just  like all of our Capitol Police do every day.   I support this bill. I support the intent behind it, and I hope that  we move forward with this in an expeditious manner and that we have a  unanimous vote on this.
