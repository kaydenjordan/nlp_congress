 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume, and I thank my colleague from the Rules Committee for yielding  me the customary 30 minutes.   Before I start, I include in the Record a letter from over 20  healthcare provider organizations regarding the danger of cutting  certain providers off from title X funding because they also provide  abortion with private funds.                                                   February 3, 2017.      Hon. Mitch McConnell,      Senate Majority Leader,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Charles Schumer,      Senate Minority Leader,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker of the House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Minority Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Leader McConnell, Speaker Ryan, Leader Schumer and       Leader Pelosi: As organizations representing health care and       public health professionals and the people they serve across       the country, we strongly oppose any effort to prevent Planned       Parenthood health centers from participating in federal       health programs, including Medicaid and the Title X family       planning program. Any proposal to exclude Planned Parenthood       from public health programs will severely curtail women's       access to essential health care services, including family       planning, well-woman exams, breast and cervical cancers       screenings, and HIV testing and counseling. At a time when       there is much uncertainty about the future of affordable       health care in our country, it is dangerous to cut off access       to the life-saving preventive care that Planned Parenthood       provides to some of our nation's most vulnerable patients.        Planned Parenthood health centers play a crucial role in       improving the health and lives of people across the country.       In fact, 2.5 million women, men and young people rely on       Planned Parenthood for health care every year. For many       women, Planned Parenthood is their only source of care--      offering basic preventive services that are fundamental to       women's health and well-being. More than 50% of Planned       Parenthood health centers are in areas with health       professional shortages, rural or medically underserved areas.       In 2014 alone, Planned Parenthood health centers provided       nearly 400,000 cervical cancer screenings and more than       360,000 breast exams. Additionally, Planned Parenthood       provides contraceptive services for over 2 million patients       and more than 4 million tests and treatments for sexually       transmitted infections, including HIV. These services improve       women's health, prevent an estimated 579,000 unintended       pregnancies, and decrease infant mortality.        Policies that would exclude Planned Parenthood from public       health funding would hurt millions of patients and undermine       health care access in communities across the country.       Limiting access to Planned Parenthood's approximately 650       health care centers across the country would prevent patients       from having timely access to basic preventive health care       services. Approximately 60 percent of Planned Parenthood       patients access care through Medicaid and Title X, in       addition to those who rely on other essential programs,       including maternal and child health programs and Centers for       Disease and Prevention (CDC) breast and cervical cancer       screening programs. In some states, Planned Parenthood is the       only provider participating in Title X, and more than 50       percent of Planned Parenthood health centers are located in a       medically underserved or health professional shortage area.       Because federal law already requires health care providers to       demonstrate that no federal funds are used for abortion,       prohibitions on funding for preventive care at Planned       Parenthood health centers will only devastate access to these       life-saving services.        In addition to limiting patients access to health care,       defunding Planned Parenthood is not cost effective. The       Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that       approximately 390,000 women would lose access and up to       650,000 patients could face reduced access to preventive       health care within a year should Congress act to block all       Medicaid patients from receiving care at Planned Parenthood       health centers. The CBO also projects that excluding Planned       Parenthood health centers from receiving reimbursement       through the Medicaid program would result in a net cost to       taxpayers of $130 million over 10 years because of the       increase in unintended pregnancies without the contraceptive       care provided by Planned Parenthood. Other publicly funded       health centers would not be able to compensate for the loss       of affordable family planning and reproductive health care       services provided by Planned Parenthood.        Every day, we see the harmful impact that unequal access to       health care has on women and communities across the country,       and we therefore strongly support policies that improve       access to affordable, quality health care. Policies that       would deny Planned Parenthood public health funds only serve       to cut millions off from critical preventive care, and we       strongly oppose any effort to do so. We also recognize this       as part of a broader effort to undermine access to safe,       legal abortion and curtail access to other reproductive       health care by limiting the ability of abortion providers to       participate in public health programs.

Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from  myself and 161 other Members to Speaker Ryan opposing the Republican  majority's efforts to undermine title X family planning programs and  women's access to health care.                                  Congress of the United States,                                  Washington, DC, February 14, 2017.      Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker of the House of Representatives, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Ryan: We write to express our grave concern       for efforts to undermine Title X family planning. Despite       promises to focus on jobs and the economy, Republicans have       started the 115th Congress with a total assault on women's       choices, access to care, and economic security by:        Charging ahead to sabotage and dismantle the Affordable       Care Act (ACA) while making no promises to preserve vital       protections for women;        Providing little to no details on their plans to replace       ACA, while making a point to announce that their ACA repeal       package will block access to Planned Parenthood, a high-      quality, long-trusted provider of reproductive health       services;        Rushing to impose and dramatically expand the global gag       rule, harming women around the world; and        Advancing the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion and Abortion       Insurance Full Disclosure Act (H.R. 7) through the House,       effectively banning private insurance companies from covering       comprehensive reproductive health services.        Now, with their most recent effort to weaken the Title X       national family planning program through the Congressional       Review Act, Republicans have demonstrated that they will stop       at nothing to limit women's access to vital health care.       Sadly, this includes contraception and family planning       services that all women need.        For more than 40 years, Title X has served as a cornerstone       of safety-net care. As the only dedicated source of federal       funding for family planning, Title X allows a diverse network       of providers to deliver high-quality care to low-income,       uninsured, or underinsured individuals and to those seeking       confidential care. In 2014 alone, Title X-funded clinics       helped prevent approximately 904,000 unintended pregnancies,       326,000 abortions, and 439,000 unplanned births. In addition       to direct clinical care, Title X also supports critical       infrastructure needs for health centers, including new       medical equipment and staff training that are not       reimbursable under Medicaid and commercial insurance. This       infrastructure is vital to ensuring safe, quality care at       health centers which serve and provide basic health services       to high-need populations.        Throughout both Democratic and Republican administrations,       Title X has been interpreted to prohibit state actions that       block providers or classes of providers from participating in       a Title X project based on factors unrelated to a provider's       qualifications to perform the required services. The networks       include providers ranging from state, county, and local       health departments as well as hospitals, family planning       councils, Planned Parenthood affiliates, federally qualified       health centers and other private non-profit organizations. In       fact, in instances when states have passed laws to  [[Page H1195]]       limit provider participation in Title X, federal courts have       consistently held that those state laws are contrary to, and       preempted by, federal law.        In response to a growing number of states targeting family       planning providers for exclusion from key federal health       programs, including Title X, the previous Administration       proposed the regulation ``Compliance with Title X       Requirements by Project Recipients in Selecting       Subrecipients.'' The regulation, which was finalized in       December 2016, helps ensure patient access to family planning       services and supplies through qualified providers by       reiterating that ``no recipient making subawards for the       provision of services as part of its Title X project may       prohibit an entity from participating for reasons other than       its ability to provide Title X services. During the       rulemaking process, the Department of Health and Human       Services received more than 145,000 comments, the vast       majority of which supported the rule.        Women across the United States, and the men who support       them, have had enough. It is unconscionable that this common       sense clarification has become a political football for       members of Congress who want to limit women's access to       comprehensive reproductive health care. We urge you to stand       in support of women and oppose this assault on contraceptive       access and care.

Members of Congress.                                time  1230     Mr. Speaker, the majority is in the midst of an  unprecedented and relentless assault on women's health--and many other  regulations while we are at it--that are being overturned every day  here.   Although it pledged to govern by prioritizing jobs and the economy,  the majority is, instead, escalating its war on women with H.J. Res.  43, a dangerous continuation of its never-ending crusade against access  to health care for women.   The majority started the 115th Congress by moving quickly to  eviscerate the Affordable Care Act, a law that finally barred insurance  companies from treating women as being a preexisting condition. Without  this law, women once again would pay a higher rate for coverage than  men.   Think about that for a moment. If everybody doesn't know it, before  this law, single women paid from 10 to 57 percent more than men for  their health insurance in States that allowed gender rating. A lot of  people don't understand this, but it costs American women nearly a  billion dollars every year. But Republicans are rushing to repeal the  Affordable Care Act without anything to take its place.   The majority has also advanced H.R. 7, a sweeping bill that would go  beyond even the Hyde amendment, a 40-year provision that has been  around for four decades too long.   This legislation wouldn't just make this amendment permanent; it  would also place unprecedented limits on women's access to reproductive  health services even if they wanted to pay out of their own pockets to  access constitutionally protected abortion services.   These moves by the majority, along with the President signing a  dramatic expansion of the global gag rule immediately after taking  office, have brought millions of people pouring into the streets in  protest.   During the National Women's March, millions of people marched all  across the country and even around the globe to defend women's rights.  These marches were likely the largest day of protests in American  history. More than half a million people took to the streets right here  in the Nation's Capital. They were peaceful, without a single arrest  reported anywhere in the country.   Far from respecting those rights, the majority is today considering a  measure that marks an entirely new front in their war against women's  rights. This is the most serious threat facing women so far in this  Congress, and it is only February.   Programs supported by title X help provide lifesaving preventative  healthcare services like contraception, cancer screening, and STD  testing to the men and women who need them most.   It is outrageous that the majority today is trying to allow  conservative State legislatures to pick and choose who can provide this  essential care with Federal money. That is one of the worst things in  the world. The luck of the draw of where you live will determine  whether or not you have access that is entitled to all people from the  Federal money. This would threaten health centers from coast to coast.   Mr. Speaker, we are facing the same problem today we faced for a very  long time: men in blue suits and red ties determining what women can  and should do when it comes to their own health. They believe the  majority of persons--women--in the United States are incapable of  making their own decisions.   Do you think that about your own mother or your wife?   Because Washington, D.C., is controlled by this Republican majority,  the stakes for women are higher today than they have been in  generations, as we turn over laws passed by the elected government of  the District of Columbia.   Mr. Speaker, Republican leaders in Congress turn a deaf ear to the  majority of Americans who oppose this dramatic government intervention  into women's health care. They, unfortunately, have the votes to pass  it, but they will have to reckon with the overwhelming majority of the  public who understands it is time for the government to get out of the  business of taking away women's healthcare rights.   Mr. Speaker, let me take a personal moment to speak about the  departure of a long-time member of my staff on the Rules Committee. I  have always believed that this committee is like family and that we  have one of the most respected staffs on Capitol Hill. Adam Berg, the  deputy staff director and counsel on the Democratic staff personifies  this.   After a decade of working for the Rules Committee, Adam is beginning  a new chapter on a different committee in the House of Representatives.  His knowledge and guidance these last years have been immeasurable.   During his time here, he has married his wife, Erika, who is  beautiful and talented, and became a father to his daughter, Ariel, who  was singing songs with her mother at the age of 3 months. That is a  precocious child.   Adam has played a key role as this committee brought landmark  legislation to the floor of the House, including Dodd-Frank, the  Affordable Care Act, and legislation to raise the Federal minimum wage.  [[Page H1196]]    The committee wouldn't have been as effective without Adam's counsel,  and he will be greatly missed. I wish him nothing but the best in his  new endeavor.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro).   Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this rule,  which would enable States to discriminate against healthcare providers  and deny women access to critical healthcare services.   This rule would put the only Federal program exclusively dedicated to  family planning and reproductive health services in jeopardy. It  reverses the Health and Human Services title X rule prohibiting  discrimination against title X healthcare providers. It would have  devastating healthcare consequences.   In 2015, 88 percent of patients at title X clinics received  subsidized or no-charge care, and many of these clinics provide primary  health care in addition to family planning services. This could upend  public health networks in communities across the country.    Supporters of this amendment claim that other health providers can  absorb the clients who would lose access to their title X clinics. This  is false. Community healthcare centers have said that they do not have  the capacity, and they are often not located near these patients.   We need to protect these healthcare providers. We need to uphold our  responsibility to the American people to provide critical services to  those who need them. I cannot and will not support this rule or this  resolution. It is detrimental to women's health in this country.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1\1/2\ minutes.   Mr. Speaker, I think I need to make this point one more time. I  really believe that everybody in this House understands that not a dime  of Federal money is used for abortions. It never has been, never will.  There is meticulous care taken by Planned Parenthood to separate those  funds. They have never been questioned in any way by the IRS as to how  those funds are being used.   I am sick and tired of everybody saying you can't give anything to  Planned Parenthood. The money that goes to Planned Parenthood from this  Federal Government goes to reimburse for services rendered for the  things I had talked about before: cervical cancer tests, cancer tests  of all sorts, and health care that they cannot get anywhere else, such  as screening for STDs. That is totally separate.   Yet, that fable that Federal money is used for abortions if you fund  Planned Parenthood is totally false. I think it is time that grownups  that can read in the House of Representatives do away with that notion.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr.  Cardenas).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Panetta).  [[Page H1197]]         I yield myself the balance of my time to close.   Mr. Speaker, we are deeply concerned by reports from our intelligence  community regarding the foreign interference in our most recent  election. The fears have only been compounded by the troubling  revelations published in The New York Times last night that members of  the Trump campaign had been in frequent contact with Russian  intelligence officials during that campaign.   Mr. Speaker, the future of our democracy is at stake. We are seeing  the  [[Page H1198]]  same kinds of things that have happened all over Europe, as governments  have been changing away from democracies. It is at stake here, and it  is time this Republican-controlled Congress does its job and gets to  the bottom of this.   Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an  amendment to the rule to bring up Representative Swalwell's and  Representative Cummings' bill which would create a bipartisan  commission to investigate foreign interference in our 2016 election.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentlewoman from New York?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I recently had the privilege of meeting  hundreds of constituents who traveled from Rochester, New York, to  Washington, D.C., for the Women's March on Washington. Some of them  came with three generations, and it was most impressive, but it is  troubling to me that we are fighting many of the same battles that were  fought and won generations ago.   The unprecedented marches and rallies that have been happening are  necessary because of efforts like this to continually chip away at  women's healthcare rights. The sad reality is that politicians have  always worked to put up new roadblocks between women and their health  care. It has always been my personal belief that when faced with a  decision that needs to be made about a pregnancy, a woman should  consult whomever she chooses--certainly her husband, her spiritual  adviser, her medical adviser, but no one wants to wait in the room  until a Congressperson gets there to make the final decision. We are  going way beyond our depth to try to make that decision for persons.  The government should not be in the business of doing that. The  majority has made attacking women's constitutional rights the first  order of business this year, working alongside our new President, and  it is shameful.   Lastly, Mr. Speaker, the other measure before us today would repeal  the Alaska predator rule which protects the interests of all Americans  in national wildlife refuges while banning some of the most inhumane  tactics for killing, like killing black bears from an airplane and  killing coyote pups in their dens. We should be listening to scientists  who study and understand these species, not an ideological minority  that sees every animal with teeth as a threat to civilization and a  potential addition to their trophy hunting collection.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore.
