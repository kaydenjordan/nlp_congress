 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 2652) to award a Congressional Gold Medal to Stephen Michael  Gleason.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 2652         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Stephen Michael Gleason       Congressional Gold Medal Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         The Congress finds the following:        (1) Stephen ``Steve'' Gleason was born March 19, 1977, in       Spokane, Washington to Mike and Gail Gleason.        (2) Steve attended Gonzaga Preparatory School for high       school where he excelled as both a football and baseball       player.        (3) In 1995, Steve enrolled at Washington State University       where he was a 2-sport athlete for the baseball and football       teams and helped the Cougars football team advance to the       1997 Rose Bowl.        (4) In 2000, Steve signed a professional football contract       with the Indianapolis Colts of the National Football League       as an undrafted free agent but later joined the New Orleans       Saints in November of that same season.        (5) Steve would go on to play 7 more seasons as a member of       the New Orleans Saints.        (6) Steve will always be remembered for his blocked punt on       September 25, 2006, against the Atlanta Falcons, the night       the Louisiana Superdome reopened for the first time after       Hurricane Katrina in a game the Saints would win 23 to 3.        (7) In January, 2011 Steve was diagnosed with amyotrophic       lateral sclerosis or ALS, considered a terminal neuro-      muscular disease.        (8) Following his diagnosis, Steve, with the loving support       of his wife, Michel, began a mission to show that patients       can not only live but thrive after a diagnosis of ALS and       established The Gleason Initiative Foundation also known       simply as ``Team Gleason''.        (9) At the time of his diagnosis, however, Steve said there       will be ``No White Flags'', which has become the mantra of       Team Gleason.        (10) The Gleason Initiative Foundation helps provide       individuals with neuromuscular diseases or injuries with       leading edge technology, equipment and services, raises       global awareness about ALS to find solutions and an end to       the disease, and has helped hundreds of people with ALS       experience life adventures they never thought possible after       their diagnosis.        (11) Steve's story and mission have been told by the NFL       Network, ESPN, HBO, ABC, CBS, CNN, and many local media       outlets, as well as in a 2016 documentary titled ``Gleason'',       which was heralded at the Sundance Film Festival and       premiered across the country with Variety calling the       production ``an emotional powerhouse''. The documentary won       several awards, including the 2016 Washington, D.C. Area Film       Critics Association Award for Best Documentary.        (12) Steve was named one of two Sports Illustrated's       Inspirations of the Year in 2014, has been a keynote speaker       for Microsoft and at two United Nations sponsored Social       Innovation Summits, and received the 2015 George S. Halas       Courage Award, given to a NFL player, coach or staff member       who overcomes the most adversity to succeed.        (13) Steve helped advocate for the Steve Gleason Act of       2015 (Public Law 114-40; 129 Stat. 441), and the Steve       Gleason Enduring Voices Act of 2017, H.R. 2465, 115th       Congress (2017), which permanently ensures people living with       diseases such ALS have access to speech generating devices       regardless of their setting, whether at home or a healthcare       institution.        (14) In 2014, Steve and Team Gleason hosted a global summit       to bring together researchers, patients, caregivers, and all       ALS stakeholders to create a plan to ultimately end ALS. That       summit resulted in the single largest coordinated and       collaborative ALS research project in the world, Answer ALS,       which brings together nearly two dozen research institutions,       1,000 patients and 20,000,000,000,000 data points that are       important to the project and that will define the unknown       pathways that will lead to treatments or finally a cure.        (15) In 2015, Steve and Microsoft worked together to create       a method for people who are completely paralyzed to navigate       their power wheelchairs with their eyes. Today, Steve,       Microsoft and all wheelchair manufacturers are working       collaboratively to make it widely available to all who need       this technology. In addition, Microsoft has also made eye       tracking technology part of all Windows 10 products across       the globe.        (16) In 2011, 10 months after his diagnosis, Steve and       Michel made their most significant accomplishment, becoming       parents to their son Rivers.        (17) Steve and Michel Gleason continue to fight to find a       solution for ALS so they can share many years together and as       parents to Rivers.       SEC. 3. CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL.         (a) Award Authorized.--The Speaker of the House of       Representatives and the President pro tempore of the Senate       shall make appropriate arrangements for the award, on behalf       of the Congress, of a single gold medal of appropriate design       to Stephen Michael Gleason.        (b) Design and Striking.--For the purposes of the award       referred to in subsection (a), the Secretary of the Treasury       (hereafter in this Act referred to as the ``Secretary'')       shall strike the gold medal with suitable emblems, devices,       and inscriptions, to be determined by the Secretary.       SEC. 4. DUPLICATE MEDALS.         Under such regulations as the Secretary may prescribe, the       Secretary may strike and sell duplicates in bronze of the       gold medal struck under section 3, at a price sufficient to       cover the costs of the medals, including labor, materials,       dies, use of machinery, and overhead expenses.       SEC. 5. STATUS OF MEDALS.         Medals struck pursuant to this Act are national medals for       purposes of chapter 51 of title 31, United States Code.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include any extraneous material on this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this important bill has wide bipartisan support, and I  urge all Members to support this legislation.   Mr. Gleason who was a former player with the New Orleans Saints, has  done significant work in the area of ALS--in ALS education and advocacy  and its damaging effects.   I, like many people in this Chamber and many people across the  country, have been touched by this personally, with friends or family  members, and we know the ravages that occur with this horrible disease,  ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this important  legislation, the Stephen Michael Gleason Congressional Gold Medal Act,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to reserve, but I would like  to note to my friend from Louisiana, as a Lions fan, it is much easier  to be supportive of a Saints player than if this guy had actually been  a Green Bay Packer.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I will note to my colleagues that as a  Detroit Lions fan, I, too, don't have a football team, but I am proud  to stand on the floor today and note that this is an important time to  address these things. We all, as a nation, are thankful for the work of  Mr. Gleason in this important issue, and I do urge support from all of  my colleagues.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 2765) to amend the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 to exempt  investment advisers who solely advise certain rural business investment  companies, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 2765         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``RBIC Advisers Relief Act of       2018''.       SEC. 2. ADVISERS OF RBICS.         Section 203 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (15       U.S.C. 80b-3(b)) is amended--        (1) in subsection (b)--        (A) in paragraph (6)(B)--        (i) by adjusting the margins accordingly; and        (ii) by striking the period at the end and inserting a       semicolon;        (B) in paragraph (7)(C), by striking the period at the end       and inserting ``; or''; and        (C) by adding at the end the following:        ``(8) any investment adviser, other than an entity that has       elected to be regulated or is regulated as a business       development company pursuant to section 54 of the Investment       Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a-53), who solely advises--        ``(A) rural business investment companies (as defined in       section 384A of the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development       Act (7 U.S.C. 2009cc)); or        ``(B) companies that have submitted to the Secretary of       Agriculture an application in accordance with section 384D(b)       of the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act (7 U.S.C.       2009cc-3(b)) that--        ``(i) have received from the Secretary of Agriculture a       letter of conditions, which has not been revoked; or        ``(ii) are affiliated with 1 or more rural business       investment companies described in subparagraph (A).'';        (2) in subsection (l), by adding at the end the following:        ``(3) Advisers of rbics.--For purposes of this subsection,       a venture capital fund includes an entity described in       subparagraph (A) or (B) of subsection (b)(8) (other than an       entity that has elected to be regulated as a business       development company pursuant to section 54 of the Investment       Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a-53)).''; and        (3) in subsection (m), by adding at the end the following:        ``(4) Advisers of rbics.--For purposes of this subsection,       the assets under management of a private fund that is an       entity described in subparagraph (A) or (B) of subsection       (b)(8) (other than an entity that has elected to be regulated       or is regulated as a business development company pursuant to       section 54 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C.       80a-53)) shall be excluded from the limit set forth in       paragraph (1).''.       SEC. 3. RELATIONSHIP TO STATE LAW.         Section 203A(b)(1) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940       (15 U.S.C. 80b-3a(b)(1)) is amended--        (1) in subparagraph (C), by striking the period at the end       and inserting ``; or''; and        (2) by adding at the end the following:        ``(D) that is not registered under section 203 because that       person is exempt from registration as provided in subsection       (b)(8) of such section, or is a supervised person of such       person.''.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include any extraneous material on this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this critical bill has broad and extensive bipartisan  support, and I urge all Members to support this legislation.   A few years ago, we had gone in and done a technical fix regarding  small businesses, and this Rural Business Investment Company, or the  RBIC, deals with language that will allow the advisers to go in and  deal with rural businesses--not just small business, but these rural  businesses. We think that this is an important step to helping rural  America continue the economic recovery that they have seen over the  last year or two.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I just want to note that we are having our  second Senate bill from Louisiana, so we are covering our colleagues  from down in Louisiana.   I just want to encourage my colleagues to support this important  piece of legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.
