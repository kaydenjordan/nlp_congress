 Mr. Speaker, yesterday, Lieutenant General Austin  Miller, the nominee to lead our forces in Afghanistan, testified before  the Senate that the biggest obstacle to success in Afghanistan is  Pakistan.   He echoes the same frustrations the President expressed earlier this  year and what others in this Chamber, including myself, have said for  years,  [[Page H5348]]  that Pakistan is providing safe havens for terrorists and playing both  sides. Terrorist leaders even arrogantly make public appearances in  Pakistan, with the knowledge of the government.   When we take action against terrorists in Pakistan, Pakistan  officials typically condemn us, rather than take steps to improve  counterterrorism efforts.   President Trump and the incoming commander for U.S. forces in  Afghanistan hold a realistic view of Pakistan. Pakistan is the problem  with success in Afghanistan.   There should be no American money sent to Pakistan until they stop  their treacherous ways. Otherwise, the 17-year-old war in Afghanistan  may never end.   And that is just the way it is.                            ____________________
