 Madam Speaker, 17-year-old Richianna Deguzman was  supposed to start her first job this week. Instead, she is on life  support fighting for her life because of a senseless and tragic act of  gun violence.   While Hawaii has some of the strongest gun safety laws, Richianna's  family and friends know it is not enough. Right now they are praying  for a miracle and pleading for an end to gun violence.   The sad reality is that there are thousands of Richiannas every day  across this country--kids who deserve better than a Congress more  beholden to the gun lobby than to protecting them.   For too long, Congress has ignored the majority of Americans who want  [[Page H3099]]  the killing to stop. We cannot sit idly by as Americans continue to  live in fear.   Last week, I joined my colleagues in signing discharge petitions to  demand House votes on several gun safety measures.   At the same time, House Republicans pushed through a measure to  weaken regulations on stabilizing braces for firearms, an accessory  used in several mass shootings across our country over the last decade.   Enough is enough. We demand an end to gun violence and a safer future  for our ``keiki,'' ``kids.''                            ____________________
