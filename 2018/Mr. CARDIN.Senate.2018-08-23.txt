 Mr. President, before Senator Blunt leaves the floor, let  me thank him for his leadership in regard to the provisions in the bill  before us that relate to Alzheimer's and the research.   As has been pointed out, this is bipartisan. We strongly support the  efforts in this bill. I would just like to put one face on it, if I  might.                           Remembering Sally Michel    Mr. President, this past week, Sally Michel, a distinguished leader  in our community, died after 10 years suffering from Alzheimer's. We  lost her way too early to this disease. She was an extraordinary  person--a professional civilian activist, advisor to Governors, mayors,  and legislators, and she left a great legacy. She established the Parks  and People Foundation in Baltimore and the SuperKids Camp Program. She  helped start the Baltimore School for the Arts.   She developed private sector partnerships, working with government to  get things done. She was a very effective youth in our community, and  underserved areas benefit today from the programs she started. I was  very proud of my granddaughter, Julia, when she volunteered at one of  these SuperKids Camps this summer in Baltimore City.   My point is, she was taken way too early as a result of Alzheimer's.  There are many reasons we have to make an extraordinary commitment to  finding answers to this very challenging and cruel disease. I can  assure my colleague from Missouri, all of us in this Chamber support  the efforts that are being made to make sure we are full partners in  the Senate to move forward on conquering this disease.                                  H.R. 6157    Mr. President, I want to talk about two amendments I filed for the  bill that is before us and the reasons I filed those amendments. One  deals with the cost of prescription drugs. Prescription drug costs are  out of control. Any of us who have been to any townhall meetings--I  have been to many in my State--we hear constituents all the time talk  about the fact that there is a serious challenge as to whether they can  afford to take the medicines they need in order to control their  disease, whether it is diabetes, heart, kidney, or cancer.   So many patients have to make very tough decisions as to whether they  can afford the prescription drugs that are necessary for their care.  Many are going into debt. We are now seeing people going into  bankruptcy because of  [[Page S5880]]  medical debt from prescription drugs, and many are going without the  medicines themselves. We need to do something about it.   According to the Federal Government's own projections of cost, the  projected cost for prescription medicines will exceed $360 billion. A  study in Maryland showed about $1 out of every $4 spent in healthcare  goes to medicines and prescription drugs.   The projected growth rate of prescription drugs is much higher than  the projected growth rate of healthcare costs, which is much higher  than the projected growth rate of our cost of living. The costs of 4 of  the top 10 drugs have increased more than 100 percent since 2011.   It is not just the exotic, expensive, or orphan drugs we are talking  about. These are drugs that are desperately needed to deal with common  illnesses. We all know the EpiPen story. In 8 years, a pack of two has  gone up from $100 to $600.   We might say, well, there is a cost issue in developing new drugs.   When you look at what Americans pay for their prescription drugs  versus what Canadians or individuals in the industrial nations of the  world pay, you cannot justify the pricing in America. It is two to  three times higher. In some cases, it is even more than what consumers  in industrialized nations spend for the exact same medicines that are  manufactured here.   What can we do about it? The amendment offers us the ability to get  the information we need, but there are three proposals I urge our  colleagues to take up in this Congress. One is the Medicare  Prescription Drug Negotiating Act. We should use our bargaining power,  our market power, to bring down the cost of medicines. That is what  every other industrial nation does. Yet we do not allow Medicare to  negotiate a collective price for the medicines they pay for under the  program. That is costing our taxpayers and consumers money.   Second, there is a bill that is known as the SPIKE Act that deals  with the exorbitant price hikes we have seen in certain medicines. The  bill requires disclosure and explanation. The pharmaceutical industry  should at least disclose and explain why we had the extraordinary  increases.   Lastly, we need to improve Medicare Part D. The out-of-pocket costs  are not affordable. We have to put reasonable limits on what people can  afford and cover what is beyond those reasonable limits.   All of us support the development of new drugs to deal with the  challenges of healthcare today. It is a cost-effective way to deal with  the healthcare problems in our community, but we want to see fair  pricing. Why should American consumers have to pay so much more than  consumers in other industrial nations? In many cases, the basic  research that went into developing that drug was paid for by U.S.  taxpayers, the work done at NIH and research facilities in this  country. We need to have fair pricing, and we need to act. We can no  longer wait.   The second amendment I wish to talk about is the amendment I filed  that deals with the Army Futures Command. This amendment would prohibit  funding for the establishment of the Army Futures Command headquarters  for this fiscal year.   The purpose of this amendment is to delay the establishment of the  Army Futures Command's headquarters until two current GAO  investigations looking into the Army's rationale and plans for  establishing a new command as well as the GAO's investigation into the  impacts a new Futures Command, might have on small business have  concluded. It will also give the Army time to respond to the reports on  Futures Command required by the John S. McCain NDAA for fiscal year  2019.   These investigations and reports will conclude by the summer of next  year, allowing the Army time to complete their plans for the command  during this fiscal year. Most importantly, it gives the Army additional  time to take a deliberative approach to their acquisitions overhaul.   Congress has asked questions about the Army's plan to establish this  command. What are the true costs for moving personnel? How many studies  did the Army conduct to develop this plan, and what were the options  presented? Unfortunately, the Army has not been able to provide these  answers. My fear is, the Army is not executing this organizational  transformation in a deliberative and coherent manner.   We all want the men and women of the Army to have the best technology  in the world. However, we also have a responsibility to be good  stewards of the taxpayers' dollars. When the Army can't provide basic  answers, provide clarity on their plan, or even identify how this plan  was formulated, it leads me to believe the Army is building this tank  while it is still moving.   History has proven this strategy has not led to the outcome for which  we hoped. It took the Army almost a decade and multiple studies to  establish a new physical fitness test. Surely, a new Army acquisition  model should take more than a year to develop. How is it possible for  the Army to establish a brandnew acquisition program in a far shorter  amount of time without studying all the impacts and implications?   It is important to note, this amendment does not prevent the Army  from moving forward on its Big Six priorities. This amendment would not  stop the current research and development initiatives in which the Army  is currently investigating the resources and energy. However, it does  give the Army the time to develop a feasible plan to determine if  creating a brandnew bureaucracy with the Army for acquisition is the  wisest approach.   My biggest concern is, these major shifts in resources, time, and  effort by the Army will squander and amount to another waste of $20  billion, as we saw in the Future Combat Systems. The Army has nothing  to show for that program, our troops were not well served by the Army's  leadership strategy, and no one was held accountable.   This measure guarantees the requisite accountability on the Army's  part and congressional oversight in the matter at hand to safeguard our  Armed Forces against another Future Combat System debacle.   Bottom line, oversight is our responsibility. We all support our men  and women. We want the most sufficient system possible, but we have to  get answers to questions before we commit to this type of change. My  amendment will allow us to have adequate information before that  decision goes forward.   With that, I yield the floor.
