 Madam Speaker, today I rise to congratulate the Prosper  High School men's lacrosse team for bringing home their first State  championship title by defeating the Smithson Valley Rangers 11-5.   The team proved their ability to stay composed while overcoming  obstacles under pressure. Winning is not just about talent, skill, or  the type of cleats you wear. Winning is about character, on and off the  field, alongside hard work and dedication to one's team. The Prosper  Eagles showed their commitment to these values from the very beginning.   I know I speak on behalf of the entire community when I say the city  of Prosper is beaming with pride.   I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating the Prosper High  School men's lacrosse team on their successful season.                            ____________________
