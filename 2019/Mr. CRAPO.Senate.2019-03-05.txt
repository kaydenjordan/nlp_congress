 Madam President, I honor my communications director  Lindsay Nothern for his dedication of more than 20 years to Senate  service.   Lindsay has been a valued member of my staff since we both started  Senate service in 1999. When I was sworn in as a U.S. Senator, my  communications director refused to hire a press secretary immediately  because she wanted to bring Lindsay onto the staff, and he was not  available for a few months, so she did double duty until he was able to  join my staff, and I have always been grateful for her insistence that  we wait for him. His instincts and media savvy have been spot-on so  many times over the two decades he has been with me.   Lindsay's strategic view of how activities and policy initiatives are  presented has been instrumental. From press secretary, he moved to  serving as communications director in 2011. While Lindsay may not be an  Idahoan by birth, he has certainly earned his Gem State stripes through  his depth and breadth of knowledge about the State. His experience as a  journalist has served him well, first in reporting and managing the  news from the journalist side and then from the other side as a press  secretary and media representative. His prior work includes serving as  press secretary for former Idaho Governor Phil Batt, who initially  dubbed Lindsay as ``Scoop,'' and campaign press secretary for  Congressman  Mike Simpson in Congressman Simpson's first House  campaign.   Lindsay is unfailingly one of the most pleasant people I have ever  encountered. He can be counted on to be a great sounding board and  listener, regardless of his personal opinions. I trust him to represent  me to Idahoans throughout the State and know that he will always leave  a meeting with a handful of new friends. That includes those who show  up angry and unannounced in my office, demanding a meeting. Lindsay has  demonstrated patience, commitment, and empathy in meeting for hundreds  of hours with those who have taken issue with some aspect of  government, the administration, or me. He is also a great encourager  among staff, helping them to know their good work is valued and  appreciated.   Several issues have become close to Lindsay's heart--among them,  domestic violence prevention and awareness. Somewhere in my office  archives, there is a photo of Lindsay in women's heels as he took part  in a ``walk a mile in her shoes'' event, representing the office. That  was not a comfortable experience for his feet, but he has been a strong  advocate in helping me find ways to illuminate and bring awareness to  domestic violence matters.   Thank you, Lindsay, for your 20 years of dedicated service to our  Nation and the people of Idaho, and thank you for your continual  assistance and friendship over the years. Congratulations on this  milestone of public service for the betterment of Idaho and our Nation.                            ____________________
