 Mr. President, I come to the floor today to discuss the  continued broken promises of ObamaCare--the Affordable Care Act--that  passed in the most partisan of fashions several years ago, and to  discuss the process by which we are putting together a repeal-and- replace package and the pieces we will be voting on tonight and over  the next several weeks and months.   ObamaCare's failures are simple. The promises that have been broken  are clear. While partisan supporters of the administration's plan  continue to promote the success of this poorly conceived law,  Coloradans know far better.   Time and again, hundreds of thousands of Coloradans have felt the  consequences of the Affordable Care Act in their pocketbooks, in their  workplaces, in their doctor's offices, and in the choices they have for  health care. The past 6 years have been marred by higher costs, fewer  choices, and less competition in Colorado and across the Nation.   It is now time that we stand up for the American people to restore  reliable and stable health care, as well as health care markets and  insurance markets, and to undo the damage done to our health care by  the failed law known as ObamaCare.   Let's just review the broken promises we have seen--not just a broken  promise that the President himself made to the American people but  broken promises echoed by the partisan supporters of ObamaCare.  President Obama assured the American people over 35 times: Don't worry  about ObamaCare because if you like your plan, then you can keep it,  period. It is on video. It is on YouTube, and you can probably find it  on Snapchat. It is available to find, this first broken promise.   As Coloradans began to receive cancellation notices, they quickly  learned that this promise was far from the truth. In late 2013, nearly  335,000 small group and individual policies in Colorado were canceled  due to requirements in the Affordable Care Act. These cancellations  also included my family's cancellation, because we had chosen to stay  in the private market in Colorado. But in August of 2013, we received  the letter that 335,000 others received in Colorado saying that our  policy had been canceled thanks to ObamaCare.   But, unfortunately, those cancellations--those 330,000-plus  cancellations in August of 2013--were just the beginning, because in  January of 2014, the Colorado Division of Insurance canceled an  additional nearly 250,000 plans for the same reason.   Again in 2015, Coloradans were made abruptly aware of the failures of  ObamaCare when another 190,000 more plans on the individual and small  group market were canceled. In total, according to the Congressional  Research Service, over 750,000 health insurance plans were canceled in  Colorado between 2013 and 2015.   The promise that if you like your health care plan, you can keep it  was so bad--that promise was so broken--that the fact-checking  organization PolitiFact named it the ``Lie of the Year'' for  2013. PolitiFact didn't really need to name it the ``Lie of the Year,''  because over 750,000 people in Colorado got a letter in the mail  telling them it was a lie.    Broken promise No. 2 from ObamaCare: Americans were told that the  Affordable Care Act would reduce costs for families, businesses, and  our government. In fact, President Obama said that under his new health  care law, a typical family would save up to $2,500 a year on premiums  by the end of his first term. Look it up on video, on YouTube. However,  hit with the rising costs, Coloradans became acutely aware this too was  yet another broken promise. Statewide, premiums in Colorado will rise  by 20.4 percent on average for plan year 2017 on the individual market.  That number is even higher in some of the more rural areas, like the  Western Slope of Colorado. Where is the Western Slope? That is what  most people think of when they think of Colorado, an area with  mountains, forests, and great beauty. That area has been harder hit  than many areas across the country with higher premium increases.   A year prior to this next plan year, in 2016, the Colorado Division  of Insurance found that premiums on the individual market rose a  whopping 25 percent on the Western Slope, plus the higher than 20  percent premium increases.   One woman living in Colorado on the Western Slope saw her premium  rise from just a little over $300 a month to $1,828 per month, or  nearly $22,000 a year. Here is her quote:         It's actually like another mortgage payment. I have friends       who are uninsured right now because they can't afford it.       Insurance is hard up here.    That is the Western Slope of Colorado, where people have seen  mortgage-payment-size health insurance bills being added to them  because of a bill that the President promised would lower their health  care costs.   An increase of nearly 26 percent is devastating for most families,  but in 2014 an Americans for Prosperity study showed that nearly  150,000 Coloradans saw their health insurance become 77 percent more  expensive. These sharp increases in prices and coverage have left  Coloradans reeling, and we have a duty--a duty--to make sure we provide  them with the financial relief they deserve and the health care we know  we can put together.   Broken promise No. 3 of the Affordable Care Act was the menu of  options that was promised--the choices that the Affordable Care Act  would bring to the marketplace. President Obama promised Americans that  a greater choice and a menu of options to choose from would be right  around the corner as a result of the Affordable Care Act, but  Coloradans again found out that wasn't true. Of the 64 counties in  Colorado, 14 counties have only one carrier to choose from and 29  counties have only two plans for the year 2017 on the individual  market. We can see the plans right here. That is the western part of  Colorado that I was talking about seeing such high premiums--77 percent  and a higher percentage next year. Here, we can see counties with only  two carriers to choose from, and 14 counties only have one to choose  from.   So the President's signature health care law failed in this respect  to create the menu of options, but it did succeed in creating  monopolies.   President Obama also insisted that competition would increase through  consumer-run coops. The Federal Government spent a great deal of money  to prop up the consumer coops and to make sure they had the marketing  in place. Over 80,000 Coloradans felt the impacts of this broken  promise when the Colorado health coop was declared to be insolvent by  Colorado insurance commissioner Marguerite Salazar. Eighty thousand  people had their insurance coops declared insolvent because of the poor  Affordable Care Act law.   Not only did the failure of this promise leave 80,000 people  scrambling to find coverage, but it forced the coop to default on its  Federal startup loan, valued at an estimated $72 million. So 80,000  people were out of coverage because of the failure of the Affordable  Care Act, and $72 million went out of the American taxpayers' pockets  because of the Affordable Care Act--money the American taxpayers will  never see again. What is more, it cost taxpayers nearly $40 million to  shut the coop down. Of the 23 original coops, only 6 are remaining and  17 consumer-run coops as a result have failed. The 23 startup insurers  received a total of roughly $2.5 billion in loans under the Affordable  Care Act, and only 6 remain. That means that even more money the  American people gave to this government to be good stewards of--through  their hard-earned tax dollars, through their premium taxes--will never  be seen again. This is an unacceptable and egregious use of taxpayer  dollars.   But the careless spending under ObamaCare doesn't just stop there. An  audit was released 2 weeks ago by the U.S. Department of Health and  Human Services, Office of Inspector General, and it found that Connect  for Health Colorado, Colorado's State exchange,  [[Page S233]]  misspent and mishandled nearly $9.7 million in grants to establish its  marketplace. The audit concluded by recommending that the marketplace  be required to repay the $9.7 million identified by the Federal  Government. The audit found that Connect for Health Colorado did not  adequately document $4.4 million, improperly transferred costs totaling  nearly $300,000, and made $164,000 in overpayments to subgrantees  without identifying a reason.   Furthermore, Connect for Health Colorado spent more than $211,000 on  bonuses to executives without providing performance evaluations. The  kicker on the $211,000 in bonuses--the largest of which was $18,500 for  the CEO--back in 2013, when the exchange was trying to get started, was  that the then-CEO of Connect for Health Colorado wanted a raise even  though the exchange had enrolled far fewer than half the people it was  supposed to. So we have an executive asking for a raise in an exchange  that hadn't even met the lowest of the low predictions for what it  would do. Here we are, with a new audit from the Office of Inspector  General saying that $9.7 million was fraudulently spent. To quote a  member of the board at the time:         Given the poor performance for the first two months of       enrollments, I think it's incredibly audacious for the       executive director to request a salary increase.        I think most people would feel like if you're a CEO and you       are significantly underperforming the goals you helped set,       then you layer on that the money comes from public funds, I       think it is highly inappropriate.    I have heard colleagues in the House and the Senate talk about how  CEOs are overpaid for the work they do. If the stock prices are low or  dividends aren't there, then they shouldn't be as highly compensated as  they are. But here we are, a government-funded program from the  Colorado health exchange and others around the country using Federal  dollars to give bonuses to people who haven't even met the basic  projections they were supposed to. It is an unacceptable use of funds.   But the problem is that it is not just funds wasted somewhere else.  It is funds wasted that came from the American people's pockets--hard- earned dollars that are being misspent.   The Affordable Care Act has had a negative impact on business owners  and individuals. Let's talk about some of the effects on businesses. I  will share a letter given to me, from a small business owner to his  customers, letting them know how the Affordable Care Act impacted his  prices.         Dear Valued Customer,        There is never a good time to announce a price increase but       we have to. Effective February 1, 2017 we will have a 2%       across the board increase for a reason beyond our control.        We've had many challenges over the years but none like       this. 100% of this price increase is due to one thing only,       the Affordable Care Act.        The Affordable Care Act has caused our health insurance       premiums to skyrocket by 42% and our choices of insurance       providers to dwindle down to one.        Some of you may be faced with a similar challenge. It seems       to be a problem all over the U.S.    So now we have the double whammy on the American consumer. Not only  are they required by law to buy insurance they can't afford, but they  then go buy consumer goods whose prices have increased as a result of  the Affordable Care Act. So they are squeezed at home because they have  to pay higher insurance premiums--thanks to the broken promises of  ObamaCare, thanks to the lack of choice they have with ObamaCare. Now  they have to pay higher prices at the grocery store or the implement  dealership--wherever it is--because they have had to increase their  prices--the people who make those goods, the people who manufacture  those goods, the foundries, the equipment dealers. They have to pay for  their insurance premiums that they are required, under a broken law, to  search and find.   But it is important that we talk more than just about the business  impact of the Affordable Care Act, because, day after day, I hear  stories from Coloradans who have felt the brunt of ObamaCare's  failures. Whether it is letters or emails to the office or whether it  is town meetings across Colorado, I hear stories, and I wish to take  this opportunity to share some of these from my constituents that  demonstrate the impacts of ObamaCare.   A letter I received from an individual residing in Aurora, CO, said:         Cory--As a business owner who pays for my own insurance,       ObamaCare is not working. Last year, my premium went up 20%       for less insurance with a higher deductible and less       coverage.        This year we just got a cancelation notice that our       insurance plan will no longer be offered and we must start       looking for a new plan yet again.        I read that more and more insurance companies are pulling       out of the Colorado marketplace.        The system is broken, it has only cost us more and more       money for lower quality health care.        Please--do everything you can to stop this failed program.    That is from a Coloradan who has struggled under the burdens and  broken promises of ObamaCare.   Let's talk about a letter we received from a family living in  Lafayette, CO.         I have a ``Bronze'' HSA plan covering myself, my wife and       my two daughters.        I just received my renewal notice from [the] insurer       informing me that my premium for 2017 will increase by 38.9%.        To put that in perspective our family went from $1,200 per       month or $14,400 per year to $1,667 or $20,000 per year.        While the premium is increasing, the benefits are reduced       as annual deductibles for individual and family plans are       increasing to $5,000 and $10,000 respectively. This is       unconscionable!        The cost of my health insurance coverage has more than       doubled in the last three years and benefits have reduced       with each successive premium increase.        The ACA needs to be repealed immediately!    That is a letter from a family of four who saw a dramatic increase in  price, both from the amount they pay every month to nearly $20,000 a  year, to a deductible that has gone from $5,000 to $10,000.   Here is another story from a young woman residing in Colorado  Springs, CO:         This is the third time since 2010 that I will be losing my       health insurance plan because of Obamacare.    This is the third time. Do remember the promise that if you like your  plan, you can keep your plan?   This woman from Colorado Springs already has had her plan canceled  three times.         Now I am losing the option of being in the plan I want to       be in.    There is the second promise--that if you like your plan, you can keep  your plan; you get the choice of keeping your doctor--broken promises.         I must settle for being in an HMO, and still pay 400% what       I was paying for premiums in 2010.        I also just learned that my carrier is raising rates by 25%       next year on the individual market.        My premiums are already four times higher than they were       before the Affordable Care Act. My deductible and out of       pocket amounts are also much higher.        Obamacare is nothing but a heavy tax for us. Our income       doesn't qualify us for an Obamacare credit.        Since our premiums have quadrupled I figure we are now       paying for the insurance for three or four other families       when we pay for our premiums.        I am very disappointed in Congress for letting this go on       and on and on.        Year after year now my premiums skyrocket and I have fewer       choices in plans. Pretty soon there will be no incentive left       to work hard and earn money in this country.    The government will take it from you and give it to people [to spend  irresponsibly in Washington, DC].   To this young woman in Colorado Springs, we are doing something-- finally. Last year, we put on the President's desk a repeal of  ObamaCare, and of course it was vetoed. But this week, we will be able  to start the process to repeal and replace ObamaCare, signed into law  by a President who will indeed sign it.   Another story I would share from a family in Fort Lupton, CO:         It is impossible to afford health care for us.        We are right above the Medicaid limit by $400, and my       husband has gone without health care for 2 years. They keep       taxing him.        Soon we will be a family of 4 with no health insurance. We       will be paying so much to afford health insurance we will       struggle to buy food. We need help and we don't know where to       find it.    These stories demonstrate what Americans are experiencing as a result  of ObamaCare and its broken promises. No family should have to decide  between purchasing health coverage and putting food on the table. We  owe it to these struggling families--stories we just heard, about  anyone who is sick or might get sick--to roll up our sleeves  [[Page S234]]  and provide real solutions and to recognize that the Affordable Care  Act was a failure, it caused calamity, and it continues to destroy and  crush our health care market.   ObamaCare was a poorly designed law that was rushed through Congress  on the most partisan of votes. Its nearly 20,000 pages of regulations  have had a devastating impact on many hard-working Americans. That is  why I will continue to work hard to find solutions that will relieve  the financial burden this law has imposed on Coloradans and Americans  throughout the country.    We need a health care system that promotes competition, increases  flexibility, encourages innovation, and puts Americans back in control  of their health care--one that gets ``Dr. Congress'' out of the  picture, one that safeguards the doctor-patient relationship, preserves  Medicare for our seniors, and one that protects the most vulnerable  among us.   I will continue to fight for all of those in Colorado and across the  country who are looking for real health care reform, and I look forward  to working with my colleagues in Congress to do so.   We have a chance this week to act, and I look forward to replacing  ObamaCare with something that actually fixes and makes this system work  again.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.
