 Mr. Speaker, the tragic killing of George Floyd, Breonna  Taylor, and so many others has led to a nationwide cry for action to  address racism and target police violence in America.   Across the country, millions of Americans have peacefully rallied,  protested, marched, and prayed for a changing of hearts and a changing  of laws to pursue additional accountability and transparency in police  departments.   In my own district in Virginia, I was proud to join those who stood  up against racism and declare that Black lives matter. A few weeks ago,  I was optimistic that we could collaborate on legislation and rise to  the occasion in the wake of the many injustices that have come to light  across our Nation. But, today, I am saddened, saddened that the  majority has slammed the door shut on Republicans, slammed the door  shut on real reform, slammed the door shut on bipartisanship, and  slammed the door shut on Senator Tim Scott's proposals as we sought to  work together to find a bipartisan solution.   Instead of working across the aisle on this important matter, and  instead of taking Senator Scott up on his offer to work together on a  bill that could be signed into law, the majority is pushing a bill  through the House that cannot be signed into law and that will, in  fact, impede the ability of good police officers to do their jobs  effectively and, further, allow bad cops to hide behind police union  collective bargaining agreements.   During the markup of this legislation, my colleagues and I offered a  dozen reasonable amendments in an effort to improve this bill. My  amendment to ensure collective bargaining agreements do not protect  racist and violent officers was rejected by Democrats at the markup and  under the closed rule today, unfortunately, was not made in order.   While I do thank the gentlewoman, the chair of the subcommittee, in  ensuring that portions of my amendment were included and that the  Department of Justice now would have the ability to pursue bad cops  through consent decrees regardless of collective bargaining barriers,  it fails to directly address the many troublesome provisions found in  collective bargaining agreements that my amendment would have  prevented, provisions like ensuring access to evidence for officers  before interviews or interrogations about alleged wrongdoing occurred;  provisions delaying officer interviews after alleged misconduct;  mandating the destruction of disciplinary records--nobody wants that to  be a policy of a local police department; prohibiting the  investigations of misconduct after a set length of time; prohibiting  the investigation of anonymous complaints; requiring arbitration after  being disciplined or terminated. These are provisions that do not  belong in collective bargaining agreements for our local police  departments.   Between 2006 and 2017, according to The Washington Post, the Nation's  largest police departments fired nearly 1,900 police officers for  misconduct, but those departments were forced to reinstate more than  450 officers after appeals required by union collective bargaining  agreements.   Further, collective bargaining agreements have been linked to an  increase in violent incidents involving law enforcement officers. One  study found a 40 percent increase of violent incidents in Florida after  a change in collective bargaining laws there. In 2006, the Bureau of  Justice Statistics issued a report and found that law enforcement  [[Page H2471]]  agencies operating under a collective bargaining agreement garnered 9.9  use of force complaints for every 100 officers, compared to 7.3 use of  force for nonunionized agencies. During the disciplinary process, only  7 percent of the complaints were sustained or found to have merit in  departments with collective bargaining agreements. In agencies without  unions, the sustain rate was more than double at 15 percent.   This was just another example, by not including my amendment, of how  the majority refused to work with us on this legislation, rather than  accept good amendments on our side where we could find common ground,  but we were cut out of the process. There is nothing in the legislation  to address the dangerous and reckless efforts by some officials further  to defund, dismantle, or disband police departments.   Our dedicated police officers who serve our communities work to  ensure that lawlessness does not prevail in our streets and  neighborhoods. The anarchy and death that unfolded within Seattle's  autonomous zone, or CHAZ, is a perfect example of what defund the  police would look like across America.   Frankly, it is no surprise that the American people are fed up with  Washington. As Mr. Hudson referred to earlier, this was a moment in our  history that calls for unity and healing. But, unfortunately, with eyes  on November elections, the majority has decided to let politics drive  debate rather than sound public policy.    We are all outraged by the horrific tragedies that have occurred  across our Nation, and it is utterly unacceptable that the legislation  before us reached the House floor in such a partisan manner.   I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill in its current form, and I  urge them to reconsider because to get legislation across the finish  line, we need to put politics aside to eradicate racism in America, to  uphold the foundational principles of our Republic and live out the  motto inscribed on the Supreme Court building across the street: Equal  Justice Under Law.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the chair for his leadership and for being a  patron of the bill. And Congresswoman McBath, from the Sixth District  of Virginia to the Sixth District of Georgia, I want to commend her for  her leadership on this important issue.   Mr. Speaker, American technological leadership is critical to the  health and competitiveness of our economy and to the well-being of  people throughout the world. American researchers and biotechnology  companies are currently leading the charge for a COVID-19 vaccine.  Patents are a key factor in our technological leadership by providing  incentives for innovation.   Since 2012, the Patents for Humanity Program has helped the U.S.  patent system encourage such innovation in key areas, such as in  medicine, nutrition, and energy.                                time  1915    Mr. Speaker, the chairman eloquently listed several of the past award  winners and the description of the acceleration certificate that they  have been awarded that encourages them to keep innovating by providing  for the acceleration of a patent application's examination at the PTO.   This bill supports the admirable work of the Patents for Humanity  Program, the inventors it promotes, and ensures that transferability of  their certificates empowers the inventors who are recognized by this  program and grants them greater flexibility to bring their inventions  to market and continue working toward the next great invention.   I am proud to cosponsor this bill and support the inventors powering  technological leadership today and in the future. I urge my colleagues  to support this bipartisan measure.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, again, I want to thank the patron and thank the chairman  and ranking member of the subcommittee and the full Judiciary Committee  for their work on this bipartisan bill, an important measure which  supports the inventors powering American technological leadership today  and in the future. I urge its passage.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
