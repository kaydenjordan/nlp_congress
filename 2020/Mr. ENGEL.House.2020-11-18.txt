 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the  resolution (H. Res. 1033) condemning acts by the People's Republic of  China and the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region  that violate fundamental rights and freedoms of Hong Kong residents as  well as acts that undermine Hong Kong's high degree of autonomy, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows:                                H. Res. 1033         Whereas the Government of the People's Republic of China       (``PRC'') is legally bound to guarantee the civil liberties       of the people of Hong Kong through 2047 and the ``Joint       Declaration of the Government of the United Kingdom of Great       Britain and Northern Ireland and the Government of the       People's Republic of China on the Question of Hong Kong''       (hereafter the ``Joint Declaration''), in which the People's       Republic of China committed that for 50 years, the basic       policies would remain unchanged, including keeping the       ``social and economic systems in Hong Kong'' unchanged;        Whereas Article 39 of the Basic Law of Hong Kong mandates       that: ``The provisions of the International Covenant on Civil       and Political Rights, the International Covenant on Economic,       Social and Cultural Rights, and international labour       conventions as applied to Hong Kong shall remain in force and       shall be implemented through the laws of the Hong Kong       Special Administrative Region.'';        Whereas the Joint Declaration states that ``Rights and       freedoms, including those of the person, of speech, of the       press, of assembly, of association, of travel, of movement,       of correspondence, of strike, of choice of occupation, of       academic research and of religious belief will be ensured by       law in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region'' and that       those rights are reiterated in Chapter III of the Basic Law;        Whereas Chapter III of the Basic Law of Hong Kong       guarantees Hong Kong residents other specific rights and       freedoms, including--        (1) freedom of speech, of the press, and of publication;        (2) freedom of association, of assembly, of procession, and       of demonstration;        (3) the right and freedom to form and join trade unions and       to strike;        (4) freedom from arbitrary or unlawful arrest, detention,       or imprisonment;        (5) freedom from arbitrary or unlawful search of, or       intrusion into, a Hong Kong resident's home or other       premises;        (6) freedom and privacy of communication;        (7) freedom of movement within the Hong Kong Special       Administrative Region (``HKSAR'');        (8) freedom of emigration to other countries and regions;        (9) freedom of conscience; and        (10) the right to institute legal proceedings in the courts       against the acts of the executive authorities and their       personnel;        Whereas the PRC National People's Congress Standing       Committee (NPCSC) has inserted a national security law       directly into Annex III of the Basic Law of Hong Kong, and       said national security law is purportedly intended to prevent       and punish acts of ``separating the country, subverting state       power, and organizing terroristic activities'';        Whereas said action is a flagrant violation of Hong Kong's       autonomy and rule of law in that Article 18 of the Basic Law       provides that laws included in Annex III are ``confined to       those relating to defense and foreign affairs as well as       other matters outside the limits of the autonomy of the       Region as specified by this Law'';        Whereas Article 11 of the Joint Declaration states that       ``The maintenance of public order in the Hong Kong Special       Administrative Region will be the responsibility of the       Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region'';        Whereas the national security law promulgated by the NPCSC       violates Article 11 of the Joint Declaration by establishing       PRC entities in Hong Kong with powers over public order;        Whereas Article 23 further specifies that ``[Hong Kong]       shall enact laws on its own to prohibit any act of treason,       secession, sedition, subversion against the Central People's       Government'';        Whereas through a similar abuse of Annex III of the Basic       Law of Hong Kong, the PRC Government caused the adoption of       the National Anthem Law in Hong Kong, which curtails the       freedom of speech and carries a maximum sentence of 3 years,       mirroring the extent of sentence under the People's Republic       of China Criminal Law;        Whereas the PRC Government's repeated and heavy-handed       actions to undermine the rule of law in Hong Kong and Hong       Kong's high degree of autonomy will only further escalate the       ongoing protests and increase public disapproval of the PRC       and the HKSAR Government, jeopardizing Hong Kong's future as       an open and prosperous international city;        Whereas the full Chinese-language text of the national       security legislation was not revealed until the Hong Kong       Chief Executive promulgated the law in Hong Kong at 11 p.m.       on June 30, 2020, making it only the second law since 2008       that the NPCSC has passed without releasing a draft for       public comment; and        Whereas the imposition of this national security       legislation, which undermines the established rights and       freedoms of Hong Kong residents provided in the Joint       Declaration and the Basic Law, constitutes a violation of       commitments made by the PRC under international law: Now,       therefore, be it        Resolved, That the House of Representatives--        (1) underscores that democratic societies around the world       stand in solidarity with the people of Hong Kong, who face       grave threats to their inviolable rights and freedoms;        (2) condemns the action by the People's Republic of China's       National People's Congress to advance national security       legislation for Hong Kong through irregular procedures, which       constitutes a violation of the letter and spirit of the Joint       Declaration, and the Basic Law which is the implementing       document of the Joint Declaration;        (3) asserts that such actions by the People's Republic of       China undermine its credibility within the international       community, including the People's Republic of China's       credibility in honoring its commitments to international       agreements and respecting internationally recognized human       rights;        (4) calls on the People's Republic of China to immediately       rectify provisions of the national security law inconsistent       with the Joint Declaration and other provisions of the Basic       Law including--        (A) the judicial processes for national security cases; and        (B) the law's asserted extraterritorial jurisdiction; and        (5) advises the President, the Secretary of State, and the       Secretary of Treasury to coordinate with allies and partners       to respond to developments in Hong Kong, including by--        (A) appointing a United Nations Special Envoy for Hong       Kong;        (B) encouraging all relevant United Nations special       rapporteurs to closely monitor and report on People's       Republic of China's policies in Hong Kong, including the       Special  [[Page H5878]]       Rapporteur on freedom of opinion and expression, the Special       Rapporteur on freedom of peaceful assembly and of       association, the Special Rapporteur on human rights       defenders, the Special Rapporteur on the independence of       judges and lawyers, the Special Rapporteur on the promotion       and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while       countering terrorism, the Special Rapporteur on torture, and       the Working Group on arbitrary detention;        (C) providing Hong Kong residents who face well-founded       fears of persecution an opportunity to emigrate from, or not       be compelled to return to, Hong Kong;        (D) condemning the People's Republic of China for       promulgating national security legislation in Hong Kong which       contravenes the Joint Declaration and the Basic Law; and        (E) establishing other measures, including economic       sanctions, to hold the People's Republic of China accountable       for contravention of international law and human rights norms       with respect to Hong Kong.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include in the Record extraneous material on H. Res. 1033, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to have authored this bipartisan resolution  with my friend, Ranking Member McCaul. This summer, Beijing imposed a  national security law in Hong Kong, the latest step in Xi Jinping's  campaign to undermine Hong Kong's autonomy and criminalize any  opposition.   In the last few weeks, we have seen China escalate efforts to squash  all dissent and attack Hong Kongers' rights. They have rounded up and  arrested prodemocracy activists in Hong Kong and even issued an arrest  warrant for a U.S. citizen. They have purged prodemocracy duly elected  leaders from the Legislative Council of Hong Kong, one of the most  important democratic institutions in the city and the single greatest  example of the one country, two systems framework under attack from  Beijing.   The Chinese Government's actions violate the will of the Hong Kong  people and Beijing's commitment to the international community made  under the Sino-British Joint Declaration. H. Res. 1033 condemns  Beijing's effort to further erode Hong Kong's autonomy, undermine its  independent judiciary, and oppress its people.   This measure urges the administration to work with our allies and  partners to hold China accountable for its flagrant violations of  international law and assaults on Hong Kongers and their fundamental  rights.   It also pushes for emigration options for Hong Kongers facing well- founded fears of persecution. This resolution is an important  demonstration of our bipartisan commitment to democratic freedoms in  Hong Kong.   Mr. Speaker, I hope all of my colleagues will join me in supporting  its passage, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I want to again thank the ranking member. I  thank the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Yoho) for joining with me to  introduce this measure condemning Beijing's violations of international  law and attacks on Hong Kong's democratic freedoms. It is really  important that we speak with one voice--both Democrats and  Republicans--to let Beijing know that we are not just going to close  our eyes to what they are doing to the people of Hong Kong.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support this very important  resolution, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the  resolution (H. Res. 697) recognizing the significance of the genuine  autonomy of Tibet and the Tibetan people and the work His Holiness the  14th Dalai Lama has done to promote global peace, harmony, and  understanding, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows:                                H. Res. 697         Whereas the Dalai Lama's principal commitments include       cultivation of warm-heartedness and such human values as       compassion and forgiveness; promotion of religious harmony;       and preservation of Tibetan language and culture and       protection of Tibet's natural environment;        Whereas the Dalai Lama has stated, ``I remain convinced       that most human conflicts can be solved through genuine       dialogue conducted with the spirit of openness and       reconciliation'';        Whereas, in 1989, the Dalai Lama was awarded the Nobel       Peace Prize for his nonviolent struggle for the liberation of       Tibet, his advocacy for peaceful solutions to preserve       Tibetans' historical and cultural heritage, and his       constructive, forward-looking  [[Page H5879]]       proposals for resolving international conflicts, human rights       issues, and global environmental problems;        Whereas Congress has consistently shown overwhelming,       bipartisan, bicameral support for the Tibetan people's       aspirations for internationally recognized human rights and       freedoms and the protection of their distinct religious,       cultural, linguistic, and historical identity, including by       passing the Tibetan Policy Act of 2002 (Public Law 107-228;       22 U.S.C. 6901 note);        Whereas, in 2006, Congress passed the Fourteenth Dalai Lama       Congressional Gold Medal Act (Public Law 109-287; 31 U.S.C.       5111), and in October 2007, President George W. Bush, Speaker       of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi, and other       Congressional leaders awarded the Dalai Lama the United       States Congressional Gold Medal, the highest civilian honor       awarded by Congress, for his contributions to peace,       nonviolence, human rights, and religious understanding;        Whereas Members of Congress have on multiple occasions met       with the Dalai Lama during congressional delegations       overseas, including a bipartisan delegation led by then-House       Speaker Pelosi to meet with the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan       exiled community in 2008, a bipartisan delegation led by       then-House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi in 2017, and a       bipartisan delegation from the House Democracy Partnership in       2019, to spotlight the unjust oppression against the Tibetan       people;        Whereas the Dalai Lama has on multiple occasions visited       the United States Capitol, including most recently in June       2016, during which he met with congressional leadership to       promote respectful inter-religious harmony and protection of       the Tibetan people's identity, culture, language, and       environment;        Whereas the Department of State finds in its 2020 Report to       Congress on Access to Tibetan Areas of the People's Republic       of China (PRC), as required by the Reciprocal Access to Tibet       Act of 2018 (Public Law 115-330), that the Chinese Government       systematically impeded travel to the Tibet Autonomous Region       (TAR) and Tibetan areas outside the TAR for United States       diplomats and officials, journalists, and tourists in 2019;        Whereas, in 2018, the Secretary of State convened the       first-ever Ministerial to Advance Religious Freedom, during       which the Dalai Lama addressed hundreds of members of       religious organizations and civil society by video;        Whereas under the Tibetan Policy Act of 2002, it is the       policy of the United States to support economic development,       cultural preservation, health care, and education and       environmental sustainability for Tibetans inside Tibet;        Whereas the human rights situation in Tibet has       significantly deteriorated since the Tibetan Policy Act of       2002 was signed into law;        Whereas the Government of the People's Republic of China's       repeated insistence that it must control the selection of the       next leader of Tibetan Buddhism, a religion with adherents       across the globe including in Mongolia, where a 2010 census       reports 53 percent of individuals ages 15 and older self-      identify as Buddhists, is a gross violation of international       religious freedom;        Whereas the House of Representatives overwhelmingly passed       H.R. 4331, the Tibetan Policy and Support Act of 2019, which       reiterates support for the Tibetan community and the need to       hold Chinese officials responsible for religious freedom       abuses targeting Tibetan Buddhists;        Whereas after 35 years, the United States Consulate in       Chengdu, which was responsible for operations in and       providing diplomatic reporting on developments concerning       Tibetan populations in southwestern China and the Tibet       Autonomous Region, closed on July 27, 2020; and        Whereas on September 12, 2020, the Dalai Lama addressed a       virtual session of the Group of Seven annual meeting of       Speakers and Heads of Parliament hosted by Speaker of the       House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi: Now, therefore, be it        Resolved, That the House of Representatives--        (1) affirms the cultural and religious significance of the       goal of genuine autonomy for the people of Tibet and the deep       bond between the American and Tibetan people;        (2) supports the efforts of the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan       leadership to achieve genuine autonomy for Tibetans through       negotiations without preconditions with the People's Republic       of China;        (3) supports the 14th Dalai Lama's commitment to global       peace, nonviolence, human rights, and environmental       protection and sustainability;        (4) urges the swift enactment of the Tibetan Policy and       Support Act of 2019 to update United States policy toward       Tibet, particularly on issues related to the succession or       reincarnation of the Dalai Lama, water security and       environmental concerns in the Tibetan plateau, and support       for the Tibetan community, language, culture, and religion;        (5) stresses the urgency of addressing the ongoing climate       crisis, including in the Tibetan Plateau, and working toward       environmental and economic justice and equality;        (6) encourages United States diplomats and other officials,       journalists, and other citizens to seek access to Tibetan       areas and demand that China provide access and treatment       reciprocal to access and treatment the United States provides       to Chinese diplomats and other officials, scholars, and       others in the United States;        (7) calls on the Secretary of State to mitigate any       potential impact the closure of the United States Consulate       in Chengdu may have on the Department of State's ability to       provide timely reporting on and support for Tibetan       communities, such as by allocating additional resources to       other United States missions in China to improve coverage;       and        (8) determines that it would be beneficial to continue       years of bipartisan and bicameral engagement with the leaders       of the Tibetan people, including between Members of Congress       and His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H. Res. 697.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, Congress has consistently demonstrated bipartisan and  bicameral support for the Tibetan community, and I hope it does so  again by supporting Mr. Yoho's, the gentleman from Florida,  legislation.   The Chinese Government has repeatedly insisted that it must control  the selection of the next leader of Tibetan Buddhism--a flagrant  violation of international religious freedom.   We are seeing additional signs of Beijing's efforts to exert more  control, as it has already done in Inner Mongolia and Xinjiang. Radio  Free Asia's Tibetan Service has reported that the rail line being  constructed to connect Chengdu to Nyingtri in the Tibetan Autonomous  Region will tighten Beijing's grip on Tibet.   In addition, the State Department has found that the Chinese  Government has systematically impeded travel to the Tibetan Autonomous  Region and Tibetan areas for U.S. diplomats and officials, journalists,  and tourists.   After the Trump administration closed the Chinese Consulate in  Houston, the Chinese Government retaliated by demanding the closure of  the U.S. Consulate in Chengdu. This consulate, among other things, was  responsible for providing reports on developments concerning Tibet, and  its closure risks further undermining our ability to understand  developments in the region.   H. Res. 697 affirms and supports Dalai Lama's teachings and  commitment to global peace, nonviolence, human rights, and  environmental protection. It also encourages further implementation of  the Reciprocal Access to Tibet Act of 2018. Finally, it calls on the  Secretary of State to mitigate impacts of the closure of the U.S.  Consulate in Chengdu.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to support this measure, I encourage my  colleagues to do the same, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, H. Res. 697 is a strong measure that  encourages the continuation of close engagement between the United  States and Tibet. I therefore urge Members to support it, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, H. Res. 697 is a strong measure that  encourages the continuation of close engagement between the United  States and Tibet.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 6334) to authorize United States participation in the Coalition  for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, and for other purposes, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 6334         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Securing America From       Epidemics Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) Due to increasing population and population density,       human mobility, and ecological change, emerging infectious       diseases pose a real and growing threat to global health       security.        (2) While vaccines can be the most effective tools to       protect against infectious disease, the absence of vaccines       for a new or emerging infectious disease with epidemic       potential is a major health security threat globally, posing       catastrophic potential human and economic costs.        (3) The 1918 influenza pandemic infected 500,000,000       people, or about one-third of the world's population at the       time, and killed 50,000,000 people--more than died in the       First World War.        (4) The economic cost of an outbreak can be devastating.       The estimated global cost today, should an outbreak of the       scale of the 1918 influenza pandemic strike, is 5 percent of       global gross domestic product.        (5) Even regional outbreaks can have enormous human costs       and substantially disrupt the global economy and cripple       regional economies. The 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa       killed more than 11,000 and cost $2,800,000,000 in losses in       the affected countries alone.        (6) The ongoing novel coronavirus outbreak reflects the       pressing need for quick and effective vaccine and       countermeasure development.        (7) While the need for vaccines to address emerging       epidemic threats is acute, markets to drive the necessary       development of vaccines to address them--a complex and       expensive undertaking--are very often critically absent. Also       absent are mechanisms to ensure access to those vaccines by       those who need them when they need them.        (8) To address this global vulnerability and the deficit of       political commitment, institutional capacity, and funding, in       2017, several countries and private partners launched the       Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI).       CEPI's mission is to stimulate, finance, and coordinate       development of vaccines for high-priority, epidemic-potential       threats in cases where traditional markets do not exist or       cannot create sufficient demand.        (9) Through funding of partnerships, CEPI seeks to bring       priority vaccines candidates through the end of phase II       clinical trials, as well as support vaccine platforms that       can be rapidly deployed against emerging pathogens.        (10) CEPI has funded multiple partners to develop vaccine       candidates against the novel coronavirus, responding to this       urgent, global requirement.        (11) Support for and participation in CEPI is an important       part of the United States own health security and biodefense       and is in the national interest, complementing the work of       many Federal agencies and providing significant value through       global partnership and burden-sharing.       SEC. 3. AUTHORIZATION FOR UNITED STATES PARTICIPATION.         (a) In General.--The United States is hereby authorized to       participate in the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness       Innovations.        (b) Board of Directors.--The Administrator for the United       States Agency for International Development is authorized to       designate an employee to serve on the Investors Council of       the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations as a       representative of the United States.        (c) Reports to Congress.--Not later than 180 days after the       date of the enactment of this Act, the President shall submit       to the appropriate congressional committees a report that       includes the following:        (1) The United States planned contributions to the       Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations and the       mechanisms for United States participation in such Coalition.        (2) The manner and extent to which the United States shall       participate in the governance of the Coalition.  [[Page H5881]]         (3) How participation in the Coalition supports relevant       United States Government strategies and programs in health       security and biodefense, to include--        (A) the Global Health Security Strategy required by section       7058(c)(3) of division K of the Consolidated Appropriations       Act, 2018 (Public Law 115-141);        (B) the applicable revision of the National Biodefense       Strategy required by section 1086 of the National Defense       Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 (6 U.S.C. 104); and        (C) any other relevant decision-making process for policy,       planning, and spending in global health security, biodefense,       or vaccine and medical countermeasures research and       development.        (d) United States Contributions.--Amounts authorized to be       appropriated under chapters 1 and 10 of part I and chapter 4       of part II of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C.       2151 et seq.) are authorized to be made available for United       States contributions to the Coalition for Epidemic       Preparedness Innovations.        (e) Appropriate Congressional Committees.--In this section,       the term ``appropriate congressional committees'' means--        (1) the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on       Appropriations of the House of Representatives; and        (2) the Committee on Foreign Relations and the Committee on       Appropriations of the Senate.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include in the Record extraneous material on H.R. 6334.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, we are in a time of crisis. The coronavirus pandemic has  devastated our Nation: over 200,000 Americans have died, our economy is  in shambles, our lives have been turned upside down.   The virus continues to spread and worsen. Part of this is because  there had not been the steps taken that we know are needed to protect  the American people and address this virus head-on.   There is a clear road map ahead on how to beat this. We need to  establish a robust contact tracing and testing system and flatten the  curve by increasing mask wearing and social distancing, all while we  develop a safe and effective vaccine.   We have heard some good news over the past few days about some safe  and effective vaccines. Over the past weeks we have seen this  encouraging news, and two, in particular, are showing real promise. To  further develop, produce and distribute vaccines, we need to work with  our partners around the world and harness the resources of the  government's multilateral organizations, public health experts, and the  private sector.   We are not satisfied--I am not satisfied--with what has been done so  far. I am glad that we are going back to the World Health Organization  and will reboot our coordination with countries around the world. We  cannot go this alone. This is a worldwide pandemic, and we need to work  with all the other countries to defeat it head-on.   This bill puts us on the right track to do just that. Mr. Bera's  Securing America from Epidemics Act would allow the United States to  participate in the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, a  public-private partnership to speed up vaccine development for  infectious diseases like COVID-19 and Ebola.   Mr. Speaker, this is a good measure that would put our country in a  stronger position to respond to the coronavirus and future pandemics. I  am proud to support it and I urge my colleagues to do the same.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Bera), author of this important bill, the chair of the  Subcommittee on Asia, the Pacific, and Nonproliferation.    Mr. Speaker, I would like to once again thank Mr. Bera for  his leadership and hard work on this legislation that everyone should  support, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the  resolution (H. Res. 349) reaffirming the vital role of the United  States-Japan alliance in promoting peace, stability, and prosperity in  the Indo-Pacific region and beyond, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows:                                H. Res. 349         Whereas the United States and Japan established diplomatic       relations on March 31, 1854, with the signing of the Treaty       of Peace and Amity;        Whereas for more than the past 70 years, the partnership       between the United States and Japan has played a vital role       in ensuring peace, stability, and economic development in       Asia and beyond;        Whereas the United States and Japan are deeply committed to       the common values of freedom, democracy, rule of law, and       free market economies;        Whereas the current United States-Japan alliance, forged       over six decades ago with the signing of the Treaty of Mutual       Cooperation and Security, is the cornerstone for stability       and prosperity of Japan and for the Indo-Pacific region, and       plays a key role in global peace and stability;        Whereas the United States and Japan are indispensable       partners in combating the proliferation of weapons of mass       destruction, improving global health, countering human       trafficking and promoting human rights, assisting the victims       of conflict and disaster worldwide, and contributing to       global economic development;        Whereas the United States and Japan have worked closely       during the COVID-19 pandemic to safely repatriate our       respective citizens home and to strengthen our collaboration       on global health research and development through       partnerships such as the United States-Japan Cooperative       Medical Science Program;        Whereas the United States and Japan are partnering to       promote infrastructure investments around the Indo-Pacific       that ensure openness, transparency, economic efficiency, and       debt sustainability, including through the United States-      Japan Mekong Power partnership and the United States-Japan       Strategic Energy Partnership;        Whereas the United States, Japan, and Australia announced       in November 2019 the establishment of a Blue Dot Network that       will promote transparent and quality infrastructure projects       that align with the G20 Principles for Quality Infrastructure       Investment;        Whereas the alliance is a testament to the ability of great       nations to overcome the past and jointly work to create a       more secure and prosperous future;        Whereas approximately 54,000 United States troops are       stationed in Japan and the Japanese Government makes       substantial financial commitments to the maintenance of       United States forces in Japan under the Special Measures       Agreement and other contributions that directly support       operational readiness of United States forces in Japan;        Whereas the current United States-Japan Special Measures       Agreement is set to expire in March 2021, and the two       countries launched working-level negotiations on a new cost-      sharing agreement in October 2020;        Whereas, in October 2020, the United States, Australia,       India, and Japan continued their ongoing cooperation through       the quad framework and discussed collective efforts to       collaborate on COVID-19 pandemic response, maritime security,       cybersecurity, quality infrastructure, counterterrorism, and       other areas;        Whereas our two countries, coming from different cultural       backgrounds, have created an active and dynamic relationship       beneficial to both peoples; and        Whereas cultural and people-to-people ties between the       United States and Japan are long-standing and deep, as       exemplified by the gift of the beautiful cherry trees that       dot our nation's capital from the People of Japan to the       People of the United States in 1912, signifying the affection       and respect between the two nations: Now, therefore, be it        Resolved, That the House of Representatives--        (1) reaffirms the vital role of the United States-Japan       alliance in promoting peace, stability, and prosperity in the       Indo-Pacific region and beyond;        (2) supports the conclusion of an equitable, new United       States-Japan Special Measures Agreement that is negotiated       based on our shared national interests, prior to the       expiration of the current agreement;        (3) supports cooperation between the United States, Japan,       and other like-minded partners to promote high-quality       infrastructure, energy, and development projects that are       open, transparent, and sustainable;        (4) underscores the importance of the close people-to-      people and cultural ties between our two nations;        (5) calls for the continued robust cooperation between the       United States and Japan in the global fight against COVID-19,       and supports the Japanese Government's commitment to hosting       the Olympic Games in 2021;        (6) calls for the strengthening and broadening of       diplomatic, economic, and security ties between the United       States and Japan;        (7) reaffirms the vital role of the Quadrilateral Security       Dialogue as a platform to facilitate further collaboration       between the United States, Australia, India, and Japan on       matters related to protecting freedom of navigation and       promoting democratic values in the Indo-Pacific; and        (8) calls for the continued cooperation between the       Governments of the United States and Japan in addressing       global challenges that threaten the security of people       everywhere in the ``Reiwa'' era of Japan, which the Japanese       Government translates as ``beautiful harmony''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include in the Record extraneous material on H. Res. 349, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Castro for authoring this measure  reaffirming our partnership with Japan, a longstanding U.S. ally and an  indispensable partner for advancing peace, stability, and prosperity in  Asia and beyond.   The United States and Japan share a commitment to upholding human  rights, the rule of law, and democratic values and freedoms. In  challenging times like these, it is all the more important that we work  with like-minded friends to defend and promote our shared interests.   One of those shared priorities is strengthening our alliances. This  is more important than ever as China's behavior becomes increasingly  aggressive and Kim Jong-un in North Korea remains unchecked in his  challenge to regional security and stability.   H. Res. 349 expresses the bipartisan support in Congress for an  equitable agreement with Japan regarding Host Nation Support for our  troops before  [[Page H5883]]  the current one expires. This is a critical way to shore up a key  ally's defenses and protect U.S. national interests.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to support this resolution reaffirming our  commitment to the United States' partnership with Japan, and I urge all  my colleagues to do the same.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, as certain actors continue their aggressive behavior and  destabilize the Indo-Pacific region, it is critical that we continue to  strengthen our allies and friends.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to support this resolution, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the  resolution (H. Res. 809) expressing the importance of the United States  alliance with the Republic of Korea and the contributions of Korean  Americans in the United States, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows:                                H. Res. 809         Whereas the United States and the Republic of Korea enjoy a       comprehensive alliance partnership, founded in shared       strategic interests and cemented by a commitment to       democratic values;        Whereas the United States and the Republic of Korea work       closely together to promote international peace and security,       economic prosperity, human rights, and the rule of law;        Whereas the relationship between the United States and the       Republic of Korea goes as far back as Korea's Chosun Dynasty,       when the United States and Korea established diplomatic       relations under the 1882 Treaty of Peace, Amity, Commerce,       and Navigation;        Whereas, on August 15, 1948, the Provisional Government of       the Republic of Korea, established on April 11, 1919, was       dissolved and transitioned to the First Republic of Korea,       the first independent government;        Whereas regional peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific       promotes shared United States-Republic of Korea interests of       prosperity and economic well-being;        Whereas United States military personnel have maintained a       continuous presence on the Korean Peninsula since the Mutual       Defense Treaty Between the United States and the Republic of       Korea (5 UST 2368) was signed at Washington on October 1,       1953;        Whereas, on May 7, 2013, the United States and the Republic       of Korea signed a Joint Declaration in Commemoration of the       60th Anniversary of the Alliance Between the Republic of       Korea and the United States;        Whereas 63 years ago the Treaty of Friendship, Commerce,       and Navigation between the United States and the Republic of       Korea, with Protocol (8 UST 2217) was signed at Seoul on       November 28, 1956;        Whereas the alliance between the Republic of Korea and the       United States, our shared national security interests, the       9,000 South Korean civilians working to support the joint       mission of United States Forces Korea and the 28,500 United       States military service members currently stationed in South       Korea, are best served by the conclusion of mutually       agreeable, multi-year Special Measures Agreements;        Whereas the economic relationship between the United States       and the Republic of Korea is deep and mutually beneficial to       both countries;        Whereas the Republic of Korea is the United States sixth-      largest trading partner;        Whereas the Republic of Korea is one of the fastest growing       sources of foreign direct investment in the United States;        Whereas the United States is the second largest source of       foreign direct investment in the Republic of Korea;        Whereas, on January 13, 1903, 102 pioneer Korean immigrants       arrived in the United States, initiating the first chapter of       Korean immigration to America;        Whereas the over 2,000,000 Korean Americans living in the       United States contribute to the diversity and prosperity of       our Nation, participate in all facets of American life, and       have made significant contributions to the economic vitality       of the United States;        Whereas members of the Korean American community serve with       distinction in the United States Armed Forces;        Whereas Korean Americans continue to build and strengthen       the alliance between the United States and the Republic of       Korea; and        Whereas the Asia Reassurance Initiative Act (Public Law       115-409), signed into law on December 31, 2018, states that       the United States Government--        (1) is committed to the Mutual Defense Treaty Between the       United States and the Republic of Korea and all related and       subsequent bilateral security agreements and arrangements       concluded on or before the date of the enactment of that Act;        (2) recognizes the vital role of the alliance between the       United States and South Korea in promoting peace and security       in the Indo-Pacific region; and        (3) calls for the strengthening and broadening of       diplomatic, economic, and security ties between the United       States and the Republic of Korea: Now, therefore, be it        Resolved, That the House of Representatives--        (1) recognizes the vital role the alliance of the United       States and the Republic of Korea plays in promoting peace and       security in the Indo-Pacific region;        (2) calls for the strengthening and broadening of       diplomatic, economic, and security ties between the United       States and the Republic of Korea, including through the       conclusion of mutually agreeable multi-year Special Measures       Agreements; and        (3) reaffirms the United States alliance with the Republic       of Korea is central to advancing United States interests,       engagement, and influence in the region, based on shared       commitments to democracy, free-market economics, human       rights, and the rule of law.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include in the Record extraneous material on H. Res. 809.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to support this good measure from Mr.  Suozzi expressing the importance of the United States alliance with the  Republic of Korea and the immense contributions of Korean Americans to  the United States.   The Republic of Korea is a linchpin of United States foreign policy  in Northeast Asia. Our alliance, built upon our shared interests and  commitment to human rights, good governance, and  [[Page H5884]]  other democratic values, has been crucial for promoting international  peace and security, prosperity, rule of law, and freedom in the region  and beyond.   Here at home, we owe much of our success to the contributions of the  millions of Koreans and Korean Americans living in the United States.  Diversity has always been a source of America's strength, and the  Korean-American community is an excellent example of that.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to support this important resolution. I  urge my colleagues to do the same, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from my  home State of New York (Mr. Suozzi), the author of this important  resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I want to again thank Mr. Suozzi for  authoring this measure. I know he has had a deep interest in this for  many, many years. I urge all of my colleagues on both sides of the  aisle to support it, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the  resolution (H. Res. 1012) recognizing the 70th anniversary of the  outbreak of the Korean War and the transformation of the United States- Korea alliance into a mutually beneficial, global partnership, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows:                                H. Res. 1012         Whereas the United Nations Security Council adopted       Resolution 83 on June 27, 1950, recommending ``Members of the       United Nations furnish assistance to the Republic of Korea''       and Resolution 84 on July 7, 1950, recommending members make       military forces and other assistance available ``to a unified       command under the United States of America'';        Whereas, on July 27, 1953, an Armistice Agreement was       signed by United States Army Lieutenant General William       Harrison, Jr., representing the United Nations Command with       the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer       Army to ``ensure a complete cessation of hostilities and of       all acts of armed force in Korea until a final peaceful       settlement is achieved'';        Whereas the Armistice Agreement remains in force today and       that by its terms has neither formally ended the Korean war       nor constituted a permanent settlement of peace on the Korean       Peninsula;        Whereas, on October 1, 1953, the Mutual Defense Treaty       Between the United States and the Republic of Korea (5 UST       2368) was signed in Washington with ratification advised by       the Senate on January 26, 1954, and the shared commitment to       recognize an armed attack on either of the Parties as       dangerous to each's own peace and security and to ``act to       meet the common danger in accordance with [each's]       constitutional processes'' and remains in force today;        Whereas during the Korean war, 1,789,000 United States       soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines served in theater,       36,574 paid the ultimate sacrifice with their lives in       defense of freedom in the Republic of Korea, and over 7,500       United States servicemembers remain classified by the       Department of Defense as missing in action;        Whereas, on October 7, 2016, H.R. 1475, entitled the       ``Korean War Veterans Memorial Wall of Remembrance Act'', was       introduced in Congress by Representative Sam Johnson of Texas       and became Public Law 114-230;        Whereas according to House Report 114-433 to accompany H.R.       1475, H.R. 1475 authorizes a Wall of Remembrance to be added       to the Korean War Veterans Memorial with the names of those       that died in theater, are listed as missing, or prisoners of       war, and would also list the number of members of the Korean       Augmentation to the United States Army (KATUSA) who were       killed in action, wounded in action, prisoners of war, or are       listed as missing in action;        Whereas the ongoing conflict separated countless Korean       families from one another, and an estimated 3,000 elderly       South Koreans die every year without reuniting with their       loved ones;        Whereas in the 70 years since the outbreak of the Korean       conflict, the United States-Republic of Korea alliance has       transformed itself from a security relationship into a       comprehensive global partnership;        Whereas the Republic of Korea is considered one of the       greatest success stories in the post-World War II era and       constitutes a lynchpin of United States foreign policy in       Northeast Asia;        Whereas the United States and the Republic of Korea have       stood shoulder to shoulder in all major military conflicts       the United States has faced since the Korean war while       maintaining peace on the Korean Peninsula;        Whereas this partnership has contributed to regional and       global prosperity through the shared values of democracy,       free market economy, human rights, and the rule of law;        Whereas it is in the national interest of the United States       to maintain its forward deployed presence in the Republic of       Korea through United States Forces Korea (USFK), a premier       Joint Force that is ``well led, disciplined, trained and       ready to Fight Tonight and win'';  [[Page H5885]]         Whereas the 70-year transformation of the United States-      Korea alliance into a mutually beneficial partnership has       recently led to important coordination and cooperation in       confronting global pandemics including H1N1 in 2009, and       COVID-19 in 2020;        Whereas the Republic of Korea has made significant       contributions to the global community in combating and       containing COVID-19, including the manufacture and export of       Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) test       kits to the United States Government and various States;        Whereas, on May 8, 2020, the Republic of Korea donated       500,000 masks to be distributed to Korean war veterans       throughout the United States, including the Navajo Nation, in       a gesture of gratitude and in commemoration of the 70th       anniversary of the outbreak of the Korean war; and        Whereas, on May 10, 2020, the Republic of Korea donated       2,000,000 masks to the United States to help fill shortages       in hospitals most impacted by COVID-19: Now, therefore, be it        Resolved, That the House of Representatives--        (1) underscores the continuing and crucial role of the       alliance between the United States and the Republic of Korea       in ensuring peace and stability in Asia and the world,       including by providing security from the threat posed by the       Democratic People's Republic of Korea and its repeated       provocations;        (2) reaffirms the importance of close cooperation between       the United States and the Republic of Korea in the Indo-      Pacific, including on issues ranging from infrastructure and       development financing to promoting good governance;        (3) encourages the continued close and continuing ties       between the people and governments of the two nations, as       well as the contributions the near two million Korean-      Americans have made to both societies;        (4) commits to continuing and expanding United States-      Republic of Korea medical and scientific and research       collaboration, particularly since cooperation between the two       countries has saved countless lives during the COVID-19       pandemic;        (5) urges both countries to prioritize ongoing Special       Measures Agreement negotiations and to reach mutually       agreeable terms; and        (6) recommits the United States to ensuring the       relationship between the United States and Republic of Korea       continues to grow and thrive into the foreseeable future.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include in the Record extraneous material on H. Res. 1012, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Mr. Bera for authoring this resolution  recognizing the historic alliance between the United States and the  Republic of Korea.   In the 70 years since the outbreak of the Korean War, the U.S.-Korea  alliance has grown to become an indispensable partnership for defending  and promoting peace, prosperity, and stability in the Indo-Pacific and  beyond.   With a shared commitment to human rights and democratic values, our  two countries have worked hand in hand as partners on so much of the  challenges facing us today: Security, trade, global health, and more.   When the United States faced crippling shortages in essential  protective gear during this pandemic, South Korea stepped up to help us  in our time of need.   In times of crisis, it is all the more important that we work closely  with our allies and friends. Our security posture in the Korean  Peninsula isn't just beneficial to the Republic of Korea, it is a  benefit for American security as well.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to support this good measure recognizing  our alliance with the Republic of Korea, and I urge my colleagues to do  the same.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Bera), the author of this important resolution, the  chair of the Subcommittee on Asia, the Pacific, and Nonproliferation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume for  the purpose of closing.   Mr. Speaker, let me say that, as one of the few Members of Congress  who has been to North Korea twice, I think that when you do that, you  see the profound difference between North Korea and South Korea. That  is why it is so important that the United States continue strongly its  alliance with the Republic of Korea, a vital partnership that has grown  stronger and stronger  [[Page H5886]]  over the past 70 years, and I am sure will continue for many more to  come.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this resolution, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 4644) to clarify United States policy toward Libya, advance a  diplomatic solution to the conflict in Libya, and support the people of  Libya, as amended.

(2) United States Africa Command (AFRICOM) identifies       containing instability in Libya as one of its six main lines       of effort in Africa and works to support diplomatic efforts       to reconstitute the Libyan State and to disrupt terrorist       organizations that impede that process or threaten United       States interests.        (3) According to the Defense Intelligence Agency, the       Islamic State in Libya (ISIS-Libya) is ``degraded''. However,       Secretary of Defense Mark Esper said in November 2019 that       there is a continued need for lethal operations to keep ISIS-      Libya in a degraded state.        (4) On April 4, 2019, Khalifa Haftar, the commander of the       Libyan National Army (LNA) ordered forces loyal to him to       begin a unilateral military operation to take control of       Tripoli, the capital of Libya and seat of the Government of       National Accord (GNA), an interim body that emerged from       previous United Nations-backed negotiations which the United       States Government and the United Nations Security Council       have recognized since 2015.        (5) Both the LNA, the GNA, and their associated forces have       failed to observe their obligations under international       humanitarian law, increased the geographic scope of the       conflict, ignored calls for de-escalation and a ceasefire,       recruited foreign mercenaries, and intensified ground and air       campaigns using heavy weapons, aircraft, and reportedly using       armed drones provided by foreign powers.        (6) According to then-United Nations Special Representative       and Head of the United Nations Support Mission in Libya       (UNSMIL), Ghassan Salame, weapons provided by foreign powers       to the warring parties in violation of the United Nations       arms embargo are being sold to or captured by terrorist       groups active in Libya.        (7) According to the United Nations, since the LNA       offensive began in April 2019, the conflict in Libya has led       to the deaths of more than 2,200 people and the displacement       of more than 150,000 people.        (8) All sides of the conflict have requisitioned the houses       of civilians, targeted medical facilities, and inhibited       humanitarian access to food, health, and other life-saving       services, worsening humanitarian conditions.        (9) More than 2,200 refugees and migrants are detained in       detention facilities in Libya with serious risks of torture,       starvation, sexual abuse, and death. On July 2, 2019, an       airstrike against the Tajura Detention Center killed 53 and       wounded 130 people trapped in the center. The United Nations       has called for the immediate release, evacuation, and       protection of refugees and migrants detained in conflict       zones.        (10) The Department of State's 2020 Trafficking in Persons       Report states with regard to Libya, ``Trafficking victims--      including men, women, and children--are highly vulnerable to       extreme violence and other human rights violations in Libya       by governmental and non-state armed groups, including:       physical, sexual, and verbal assault; abduction for ransom;       extortion; arbitrary killings; inhumane detention; and child       soldiering. . .Migrants in Libya are extremely vulnerable to       sex and labor trafficking [and . . .] are vulnerable to       exploitation by state and non-state actors, including       employers who refuse to pay laborers' wages.''.        (11) In November 2019, the GNA and the Government of Turkey       signed a Memorandum of Understanding on maritime boundaries       in the Mediterranean Sea.        (12) According to a July 2020 Department of Defense       Inspector General report, the Wagner Group, a Russian private       military company, has deployed as many as 2,500 mercenary       forces, including some Syrian fighters, advanced equipment,       and advanced capabilities to support the LNA and Russian       objectives in North Africa.        (13) According to a July 2020 Department of Defense       Inspector General report, ``Turkey's president acknowledged       that his country sent many Syrian militants to Libya to       support the Government of National Accord (GNA). .       ..USAFRICOM estimated that 3,500 Syrian mercenaries were in       Libya supporting the GNA as of the end of March. Citing press       reports, USAFRICOM stated that an additional 300 Turkish-      supported `Syrian opposition' fighters arrived in Libya in       early April.''.        (14) In January 2020, LNA-aligned forces shut down oil       production in eastern Libya, which according to the United       Nations threatens devastating consequences for the Libyan       people and for the country's economic and financial       situation.        (15) On January 19, 2020, at a peace conference in Berlin,       representatives of the Governments of Algeria, China, Egypt,       France, Germany, Italy, Russia, Turkey, the Republic of       Congo, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, and the       United States, as well as regional and multilateral       organizations, agreed to refrain from interference in Libya's       internal affairs, abide by the United Nations arms embargo,       and advance a 55-point communique to resolve the conflict in       Libya.        (16) On January 30, 2020, then-United Nations Special       Representative Salame asserted, ``the warring parties have       continued to receive advanced equipment, fighters, and       advisors from foreign states, in violation of the UN arms       embargo and pledges made by representatives of these       countries in Berlin''.        (17) On February 12, 2020, the United States Assistant       Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs testified before       the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, ``The task of       bringing the Libyans back to the negotiating table has been       complicated by the involvement of external actors. Libya is       not the place for Russian mercenaries, or fighters from       Syria, Chad, and Sudan. It is not the place for the Emiratis,       Russians, or Turks to be fighting battles on the ground       through intermediaries they sponsor or support with       sophisticated and deadly equipment in pursuit of their own       agendas.''.        (18) On February 13, 2020, the United Nations Security       Council adopted Resolution 2510, which endorses the       Conclusions of the International Conference on Libya held in       Berlin, affirms the need for a lasting ceasefire, demands       full compliance by all  [[Page H5887]]       member states with the United Nations arms embargo, and       expresses unequivocal support for the United Nations Special       Representative and the ongoing UNSMIL-facilitated intra-      Libyan dialogue.        (b) Statement of Policy.--It is the policy of the United       States--        (1) to advance a peaceful resolution to the conflict in       Libya through a political process as the best way to secure       United States interests, ensure a stable and unified Libya,       reduce the threat of terrorism, and provide peace and       opportunity to the Libyan people;        (2) to support the implementation of United Nations       Security Council Resolutions 1970 (2011) and 1973 (2011),       which established an arms embargo on Libya, and subsequent       resolutions modifying and extending the embargo;        (3) to enforce Executive Order 13726 (81 Fed. Reg. 23559;       relating to blocking property and suspending entry into the       United States of persons contributing to the situation in       Libya (April 19, 2016)), designed to target individuals or       entities who ``threaten the peace, security, and stability of       Libya'';        (4) to oppose attacks on civilians, medical workers, and       critical infrastructure, including water supplies, in Libya,       and to support accountability for those engaged in such       heinous actions;        (5) to support Libya's sovereignty, independence,       territorial integrity, and national unity consistent with       United Nations Security Council Resolution 2510 (2020) and       all predecessor resolutions with respect to Libya, including       by--        (A) taking action to end the violence and flow of arms;        (B) rejecting attempts by any party to illicitly export       Libya's oil; and        (C) urging Libyan parties to eject foreign military and       mercenary forces;        (6) to leverage diplomatic relations to convince the       parties to the conflict in Libya to immediately de-escalate       and halt their current fighting and persuade foreign powers       to stop providing personnel, including mercenaries, weapons,       and financing that exacerbate the conflict;        (7) to support building on the Libyan Political Agreement       as a viable framework for the political solution in Libya and       to urge all Libyan parties to resume the inclusive Libyan-led       and Libyan-owned political process under the auspices of       UNSMIL;        (8) to support a negotiated and peaceful political solution       that includes a single, unified, inclusive, and effective       Libyan Government approved by the Libyan House of       Representatives, the end of a transitional period achieved       through free, fair, inclusive, and credible elections, a fair       and transparent allocation of resources, interim security       arrangements, and a process for the reunification of Libyan       government ministries and Libyan sovereign institutions,       including the Central Bank of Libya, the National Oil       Corporation, and the Libyan Investment Authority;        (9) to support constant, unimpeded, and reliable       humanitarian access to those in need and to hold accountable       those who impede or threaten the delivery of humanitarian       assistance;        (10) to seek to bring an end to trafficking in persons such       as slavery, forced labor, and sexual exploitation, including       with respect to migrants;        (11) to advocate for the immediate release and safe       evacuations of detained refugees and migrants trapped by the       fighting in Libya;        (12) to encourage implementation of UNSMIL's plan for the       organized and gradual closure of migrant detention centers in       Libya;        (13) to support current and future democratic and economic       development; and        (14) to discourage all parties from heightening tensions in       the region, through unhelpful and provocative actions.

(a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:        (1) General Stephen Townsend, Commander of United States       Africa Command (AFRICOM), warned in January 2020 that in       Libya, Russia seeks to ``demonstrate itself as an alternative       partner to the West'' and seeks to position itself alongside       the southern flank of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization       (NATO).        (2) AFRICOM has also stated that the Russian military       presence in Libya threatens future United States military       partnerships and counterterrorism cooperation by impeding       United States access to Libya.        (3) In May 2020, AFRICOM reported that the Government of       Russia deployed 14 MiG-29 and Su-24 aircraft to Libya to       support Russian state-sponsored private military contractors,       including the Wagner Group.

TITLE IV--DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS       SEC. 401. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 4644.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Libya Stabilization Act,  an important piece of legislation introduced by the chairman and the  ranking member of the Middle East and North Africa Subcommittee, Mr.  Deutch, along with Ranking Member Wilson.   This bill responds to years of instability and violence in Libya,  which has given Russia a new foothold in North Africa and contributed  to the growth of violent extremist groups.   Though there is welcome news of an emerging ceasefire in Libya,  facilitated by the United Nations, sporadic violence continues and  dangerous militia groups remain active throughout the country.   The Libya Stabilization Act addresses these threats by sanctioning  outside actors who fuel the conflict or perpetrate human rights abuses.  The bill also directs additional U.S. support to humanitarian relief  and assistance efforts to help strengthen democratic governance; build  a better, peaceful future for Libya; and ensure the security of the  U.S. and our allies.   It is in our interest to help prevent Libya from spiraling even  further into lawlessness. A vacuum of leadership in Tripoli gives way  to extremism, which poses threats to the United States, our allies, and  partners.   I thank Mr. Deutch and Mr. Wilson for their work on this measure, and  I urge my colleagues to support it.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

The Committee on Financial Services takes this action to       forego formal consideration of H.R. 4644 in light of the       mutually agreed changes to provisions within the jurisdiction       of the Committee on Financial Services. We are also doing so       based on our mutual understanding that, by foregoing formal       consideration of H.R. 4644 at this time, we do not waive any       jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in this or       similar legislation, and that our Committee will be       appropriately consulted and involved as this or similar       legislation moves forward with regard to any matters in the       Committee's jurisdiction. The Committee also reserves the       right to seek appointment of an appropriate number of       conferees to any House-Senate conference involving this or       similar legislation that involves the Committee's       jurisdiction and request your support for any such request.        Finally, I would appreciate your response to this letter       confirming this understanding, and I would ask that a copy of       our exchange of letters on this matter be included in the       Congressional Record during Floor consideration of H.R. 4644.            Sincerely,                                                     Maxine Waters,                                                        Chairwoman.     Mr. Speaker, it is now my pleasure to yield 2\1/2\ minutes  to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Deutch), the author of this  important bill and the chair of the Subcommittee on the Middle East,  North Africa, and International Terrorism.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Deutch).    Mr. Speaker, I want to once again thank Mr. Deutch and Mr.  Wilson for their hard work in authorizing this measure.   I want to thank Mr. Deutch for his kind words. We have worked very  closely together through the years on the Foreign Affairs Committee. He  has been one of the best members--always there, always fighting, always  principled--and I thank him for the nice, kind words he said about me.   We all say kind things about him because he is such an important  member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and I have enjoyed  serving with him all these years. So I thank the gentleman from Florida  (Mr. Deutch).   Mr. Speaker, let me say, I urge all Members to join me in supporting  this legislation, again, Mr. Deutch's and Mr. Wilson's hard work in  authoring this measure. I urge all colleagues to support this, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the  resolution (H. Res. 1062) affirming the nature and importance of the  United States-Iraq bilateral relationship, including security and  economic components of the relationship, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows:                                H. Res. 1062         Whereas the United States remains committed to supporting a       sovereign and democratic Iraq at peace with its neighbors and       safe for its citizens, regardless of their religion, sect, or       ethnicity;        Whereas in 2014, forces of the Islamic State (commonly       known as ``IS'' and also known as ``ISIS'' or ``ISIL'')       seized significant territory in Iraq, leading Iraq's Prime       Minister to request international military intervention;        Whereas the United States began military intervention       against the Islamic State in Iraq in 2014, working with       international coalition partners and Iraqi security forces to       combat the Islamic State and to retake Iraqi territory from       Islamic State fighters;        Whereas the Islamic State ruled areas it controlled with       terror and brutal violence, including through heinous acts       such as mass executions, public beheadings, desecration of       holy sites, sexual enslavement and rape, and abuse and       torture of minors;        Whereas the Government of Iraq declared military victory       against the Islamic State in December 2017, but insurgent       attacks by remaining terrorist fighters have continued and       threaten peace and stability in some areas of Iraq;        Whereas an estimated 6 million Iraqis have been rendered       internally displaced since 2014, of whom 1.4 million remain       internally displaced;        Whereas members of religious and ethnic minority groups,       including Iraqi Christian communities and Yezidis, faced       particular brutality under the Islamic State and often lacked       the resources and capacity for protection;        Whereas the Islamic State's destructive rule and ensuing       military campaign left large areas of key population centers       uninhabitable, including Anbar, Salah al-Din, and Ninewa       governorates, where efforts at resettlement, reconstruction,       service delivery, governance, and security remain       challenging;        Whereas the United Nations Office for the Coordination of       Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) 2020 humanitarian needs       assessment previously anticipated that as many as 4.1 million       Iraqis will need some form of humanitarian assistance in       2020, and humanitarian needs are likely to be further       exacerbated by socio-economic disruptions attributable to the       COVID-19 pandemic;        Whereas the United States was the top donor to the 2018 and       2019 United Nations Iraq Humanitarian Response Plans and has       contributed nearly $2.75 billion to humanitarian relief       efforts in Iraq since 2014, including more than $750 million       in humanitarian support since fiscal year 2018;        Whereas in July 2017, the United Nations Office for the       Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) reported that       ``after decades of war, the sheer volume of explosive devices       renders Iraq one of the most heavily contaminated countries       in the world'';        Whereas multiple nongovernmental human rights organizations       and media investigations have reported that areas still       suffering from the lack of reconstruction, service delivery,       governance, and security are acutely susceptible to re-      radicalization by Islamic State underground cells or follow-      on elements;        Whereas human rights organizations have reported that       thousands of displaced Iraqis, including children, are unable       to obtain or replace civil documentation due to displacement       caused by Islamic State;        Whereas some paramilitary forces, including some elements       of the ``Popular Mobilization Units'' or ``PMUs'' that       mobilized to fight Islamic State terrorists have yet to be       fully integrated into national security institutions and       threaten civilian populations in some areas, including       vulnerable minority groups;        Whereas in late 2019, some Iraqi security force units,       including non-state militias, responded violently to peaceful       protests resulting in the deaths of more than 550 Iraqi       civilians and many more injured;        Whereas in 2019 and 2020, Iranian aligned militias, some of       whom operate Iraqi PMUs conducted numerous attacks on United       States and coalition forces in Iraq as well as Iraqi military       facilities and Iraqi nationals, including a December 2019       attack that killed a United States citizen contractor and       wounded others, and a March 2020, attack that killed a United       States servicemember, a United States contractor, a British       soldier, and injured at least a dozen other troops;        Whereas Iranian aligned militias and some PMUs were       reportedly involved in the December 31, 2019, to January 1,       2020, siege on the United States Embassy in Baghdad, in which       attackers set fire to structures and damaged property;        Whereas in July 2019 the Combined Joint Task Force-      Operation Inherent Resolve (CJTF-OIR) informed the Department       of Defense and Department of State Inspector General that the       Islamic State in Iraq continues to recruit from isolated       rural areas ``exploiting perceived weaknesses and failures of       the Iraqi government, particularly in Sunni areas where the       population feels neglected'';        Whereas a July 2019 Department of Defense and Department of       State Lead Inspector General (LIG) Report to Congress on       Operation Inherent Resolve stated the ``Department of State       and USAID reported that the greatest obstacles preventing       IDPs from returning . . . are lack of security and economic       opportunity, and damage to housing'' as well as a lack of       ``legal assistance to recover or renew identification       documents'';        Whereas in March 2020 Iraq confirmed its first case of       COVID-19, which soon spread throughout the country, straining       Iraq's already struggling healthcare system, and infecting       64,000 Iraqis and killing 2,685 Iraqis, including 592 Iraqi       doctors, as of June 2020; and        Whereas the LIG reported in May 2020 that ``the emergence       of COVID-19 in Iraq has further restricted humanitarian       access and presented a significant risk to internally       displaced person (IDP) and refugee camps across the       country'': Now, therefore, be it        Resolved, That the House of Representatives--        (1) supports a sovereign and democratic Iraq at peace with       its neighbors and safe for its citizens, regardless of       religion, sect, or ethnicity;        (2) calls on the Administration to provide continued       support for Iraqi efforts to ensure stability and security       for a democratic Iraq;        (3) calls on the Government of Iraq to take all appropriate       action to protect United States diplomats and United States       servicemembers, including by holding accountable those       involved in the December 31, 2019, through January 1, 2020,       attack on the United States Embassy;        (4) supports robust exercise by Iraqis of the rights to       free speech and assembly as guaranteed to them by the       Constitution of Iraq;        (5) calls on the Government of Iraq to hold accountable all       those responsible for violence against peaceful protestors,       including members of Iraqi security forces as applicable;        (6) calls on all countries to continue upholding the       principle of non-refoulement for refugees subject to       violence, persecution, or death if forcibly returned to Iraq,       including for reasons of religious persecution, and to assist       internally displaced Iraqis to safely and voluntarily return       to their homes;        (7) encourages the United States to continue to work with       bilateral and multilateral partners and international       nongovernmental organizations on the stabilization of Iraq;        (8) calls on the Administration to continue assisting       religious and ethnic minority communities targeted by the       Islamic State for genocide;        (9) calls on the Administration to continue to work with       the Government of Iraq to eliminate child labor and forced       labor in Iraq;        (10) supports expanded bilateral trade and investment       between the United States and Iraq;        (11) supports development of an Iraqi private sector based       on rule of law and free market principles;        (12) supports the 2020 United States-Iraq Strategic       Dialogues and the principles agreed upon by both the United       States and Iraq in such Dialogues and the fostering of       continued dialogue based on such Dialogues;        (13) calls on the Administration to continue providing       medical assistance to support the Iraqi healthcare sector in       combatting COVID-19; and        (14) calls on the Government of Iraq to allow humanitarian       and stabilization assistance programs to be implemented       without bureaucratic delays or impediments.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H. Res. 1062, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of Congressmen Allred and  Reschenthaler's resolution affirming the importance of the United  States-Iraq relationship.   Iraq faces many challenges. ISIS cells are beginning to reemerge;  coronavirus cases have climbed in recent months; and Iraq's economy,  like much of the globe, is suffering. When  [[Page H5893]]  Iraq grapples with such challenges, the United States must show up to  demonstrate leadership and friendship.   This bipartisan resolution expresses support for sovereign,  democratic Iraq and strong relations between our two nations, while  also highlighting the need to address humanitarian challenges facing  Iraq, such as internal displacement, violence against minority  religious and ethnic groups, and recovery of communities impacted by  the counter-ISIS fight.   H. Res. 1062 also calls on Iraq to take all necessary steps to  protect United States diplomats and servicemembers. When diplomats are  able to do their job safely, investment in a growing economy can  follow, benefiting the Iraqi people and their livelihoods.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for putting forth this resolution,  and I reserve the balance of my time.                                          House of Representatives,                                    Committee on Foreign Affairs,                                  Washington, DC, November 11, 2020.      Hon. Richard E.

Res.       1062 to expedite floor consideration.

Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to join me today in  supporting this important resolution, H. Res. 1062, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 7990) to prioritize efforts of the Department of State to combat  international trafficking in covered synthetic drugs and new  psychoactive substances, and for other purposes, as amended.

It is the sense of Congress that--        (1) the President should direct the United States       Representative to the United Nations to use the voice and       vote of the United States at the United Nations to advocate       for more transparent assessments of countries by the       International Narcotics Control Board; and        (2) bilateral, plurilateral, and multilateral international       cooperation is essential to combating the trafficking of       covered synthetic drugs.       SEC. 7. DEFINITION.         In this Act:        (1) The term ``covered synthetic drug'' means--        (A) a synthetic controlled substance (as defined in section       102(6) of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 802(6))),       including fentanyl or a fentanyl analogue; or        (B) a new psychoactive substance.        (2) The term ``new psychoactive substance'' means a       substance of abuse, or any preparation thereof, that--        (A) is not--        (i) included in any schedule as a controlled substance       under the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 801 et seq.);       or        (ii) controlled by the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs       signed at New York, New York, on March 30, 1961 or the       Convention on Psychotropic Substances signed at Vienna,       Austria, on February 21, 1971;        (B) is new or has reemerged on the illicit market; and        (C) poses a threat to the public health and safety.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 7990, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, far too many Americans have witnessed firsthand the  devastating effects of drug abuse. According to the Centers for Disease  Control, our country saw the largest increase in overdose deaths from  2018 to 2019. That is why this bill comes before us at a critical time,  and I thank the author, Mr. Trone, for his leadership and hard work on  this bill and on the entire subject.   Fentanyl is one of the most dangerous synthetic opioids contributing  to the opioid crisis, and since it is largely manufactured outside of  the United States, it is critical that we engage closely with our  international partners to combat this scourge.   The FENTANYL Results Act requires the State Department to update its  approach to illegal synthetic drugs. This bill opens strong channels of  communications with foreign drug enforcement agencies, trains countries  on how to combat synthetic drug production, and promotes exchange  programs for renowned experts who can share their findings around the  world.   With such an imposing task ahead of us, international cooperation is  critical. It is not enough to tackle this issue domestically; we also  must work together with our partners around the world to stop the  transit of these illicit substances.   I was pleased that the House Foreign Affairs Committee passed this  bill unanimously, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting its  passage in the House today.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Trone), the author of this important bill, and a valued  member of the Foreign Affairs Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I thank the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Yoho) for his kind words. I  really appreciate it.   I, again, thank Mr. Trone for being a great champion on this issue  and for his kind words.   This is the kind of cooperation we have on the Foreign Affairs  Committee, and I really have been honored to preside over it and to  have been on the committee for so many years. These are important  issues that affect real people. The Foreign Affairs Committee has  always been at the forefront of these issues because of the gentlemen  and women that you just heard. We call ourselves the most bipartisan  committee, and I think it is true.   I, again, thank Mr. Trone for being a great champion on this issue,  and, Mr. Yoho, thank you.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all our colleagues to support this bill, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 7276) to establish an interagency working group to develop a  comprehensive, strategic plan to eradicate locust outbreaks in the East  Africa region and address future outbreaks in order to avert mass scale  food insecurity and potential political destabilization, and for other  purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 7276         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Desert Locust Control Act''.       SEC. 2. STATEMENT OF POLICY.         It is the policy of the United States to prioritize efforts       to control the ongoing desert locust outbreak in East Africa       and other affected regions, mitigate the impacts on food       security, economic productivity, and political stability,       improve interagency coordination to prevent future outbreaks,       and promote resilience in affected countries.       SEC. 3. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) The United States Agency for International Development       reports that countries in East Africa are currently suffering       the worst desert locust outbreak in decades, which will       devour crops and pasture and destroy local livelihoods across       the region.  [[Page H5896]]         (2) As of June 2020, there were more than 26 million people       experiencing acute food insecurity in Ethiopia, Kenya,       Somalia, South Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, Sudan, and Djibouti,       and these numbers are projected to increase if the desert       locust outbreak is not controlled.        (3) As the desert locust outbreak continues, there may be       insufficient resources to continue to conduct aerial spraying       and without such resources the current outbreak could develop       into a plague by the end of 2020.        (4) The desert locust outbreak in East Africa, particularly       in Kenya, Ethiopia, and Somalia, is negatively impacting food       security, local livelihoods and economic productivity, and       may threaten political stability in the region.        (5) Proactive investments now to control the desert locust       outbreak could reduce the need for a much larger United       States humanitarian response effort later, as well as support       economic and political stability and build resilience in       affected countries.        (6) In order to optimize the United States response to the       desert locust outbreak, an interagency working group should       be established to develop and implement a comprehensive,       strategic plan to control the desert locust outbreak in East       Africa and other affected regions, mitigate impacts on food       security, economic productivity, and political stability and       prevent future outbreaks.       SEC. 4. INTERAGENCY WORKING GROUP.         (a) Establishment.--The President shall establish an       interagency working group to coordinate the United States       response to the ongoing desert locust outbreak in East Africa       and other affected regions, including the development of a       comprehensive, strategic plan to control the outbreak,       mitigate the impacts on food security, economic productivity,       and political stability, and prevent future outbreaks.        (b) Membership.--        (1) In general.--The interagency working group shall be       composed of the following:        (A) Two representatives from the United States Agency for       International Development.        (B) One representative from each of the following:        (i) The United States Mission to the United Nations       Agencies for Food and Agriculture.        (ii) The National Security Council.        (iii) The Department of State.        (iv) The Department of Defense.        (v) The Department of Agriculture.        (vi) Any other relevant Federal department or agency.        (2) Chair.--The President shall designate one of the       representatives from the United States Agency for       International Development described in paragraph (1)(A) to       serve as chair of the interagency working group.        (c) Duties.--The interagency working group shall--        (1) assess the scope of the desert locust outbreak in East       Africa and other affected regions, including its impact on       food security, economic productivity, and political stability       in affected countries;        (2) assess the impacts of restrictions relating to the       coronavirus disease 2019 (commonly referred to as ``COVID-      19'') pandemic;        (3) monitor the effectiveness of ongoing assistance efforts       to control the desert locust outbreak and mitigate its       impacts and identify gaps and opportunities for additional       support to such programs;        (4) review the effectiveness of regional and multilateral       efforts to control the desert locust outbreak and the       coordination among relevant United States Government       agencies, regional governments, and international       organizations, including the World Food Programme and the       United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization; and        (5) not later than 90 days after the establishment of the       interagency working group under subsection (a), develop and       submit to the President and the appropriate congressional       committees a comprehensive, strategic plan to control the       desert locust outbreak, including a description of efforts       to--        (A) improve coordination among relevant United States       Government agencies, regional governments, and international       organizations, including the World Food Programme and the       United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization;        (B) ensure delivery of necessary assets control the desert       locust outbreak and humanitarian and development assistance       to address and mitigate impacts to food security, economic       productivity, and political stability; and        (C) to the extent practicable, prevent and mitigate future       desert locust and other, similar destructive insect outbreaks       (such as Fall Armyworm) in Africa and other parts of the       world, which require a humanitarian response.        (d) Interagency Working Group Support.--The interagency       working group shall continue to meet not less than semi-      annually to facilitate implementation of the comprehensive,       strategic plan required by subsection (c)(5).        (e) Sunset.--This section shall terminate on the date that       is 2 years after the date of the enactment of this Act, or at       such time as there is no longer an upsurge in the desert       locust outbreak in East Africa, whichever occurs earlier.        (f) Appropriate Congressional Committees Defined.--In this       section, the term ``appropriate congressional committees''       means--        (1) the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on       Appropriations of the House of Representatives; and        (2) the Committee on Foreign Relations and the Committee on       Appropriations of the Senate.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 7276.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Desert Locust Control Act, and  I thank Mr. Smith for bringing forward this very important legislation.   In late 2019, swarms of locusts entered the Horn of Africa from the  Gulf of Aden, multiplying and spreading throughout the region.   Locusts are highly mobile and can consume vast amounts of vegetation  in a short period of time. Even a small swarm can consume crops that  would feed up to 35,000 people in day. They have devastated large  swaths of farmland through east Africa, including Kenya, Somalia, and  Ethiopia and across the Red Sea in Yemen.   Food security is already hanging by a thread in these regions, and  efforts to control the locusts have been hindered by the COVID-19  pandemic, lack of reliable data, and the geographical reach of the  swarm across multiple countries.   The Desert Locust Control Act would step up coordination of efforts  to evaluate and respond to the locust outbreak across the United States  Government, bringing in the support of the U.S. mission to the Food and  Agricultural Organization, USAID, and others to effectively respond to  the outbreak.   We have already seen the ripple effects of the coronavirus pandemic  on poverty, food insecurity, health, and education. We must ensure that  we do not let this locust plague compound those challenges.   I, again, thank Mr. Smith for his leadership in authoring this  measure.   I urge Members on both sides of the aisle to support this bill, and,  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, once again, I thank Mr. Smith for his work on this  legislation. Mr. Smith, through the years, has done great work on so  many issues. I think he is the only one on the Foreign Affairs  Committee that has actually been there longer than I have. We have  collaborated on a good many projects, bipartisan projects, through the  years. I thank Mr. Smith for being such a good member of the committee.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to support this legislation. It is very  important. It is very important for our country. It is very important  for the world. I urge all my colleagues to support it, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 5586) to measure the progress of recovery and development efforts  in Haiti and the strength of democracy and rule of law in the country,  as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5586         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Haiti Development,       Accountability, and Institutional Transparency Initiative       Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) On January 12, 2010, a massive earthquake struck near       the Haitian capital city of Port-au-Prince, leaving an       estimated 220,000 people dead, including 103 United States       citizens, 101 United Nations personnel, and nearly 18 percent       of the nation's civil service, as well as 300,000 injured,       115,000 homes destroyed, and 1,500,000 people displaced.        (2) The Post Disaster Needs Assessment conducted by the       Government of Haiti, the United Nations, the World Bank, the       Inter-American Development Bank, and others estimated that       damage and economic losses from the January 12, 2010,       earthquake totaled $7,804,000,000.        (3) The international community, led by the United States       and the United Nations, mounted an unprecedented humanitarian       response to the earthquake in Haiti. Through 2018, more than       $8 billion has been disbursed by donors. Since the 2010       earthquake, the United States Government has disbursed more       than $4,000,000,000 in recovery and development funding.        (4) On October 4, 2016, Hurricane Matthew struck       southwestern Haiti on the Tiburon Peninsula, causing       widespread damage and flooding and leaving 1.4 million people       in need of immediate assistance. Recovery efforts continue       more than three years later.        (5) Prior to both the earthquake and hurricane, Haiti       registered among the lowest socioeconomic indicators and had       the second highest rate of income disparity in the world -       conditions that have further complicated disaster recovery       and resilience efforts.        (6) In June 2019 the World Food Program reported that Haiti       has one of the highest levels of chronic food insecurity in       the world, with more than half of its total population       chronically food insecure and 22 percent of children       chronically malnourished.        (7) In October 2010, an unprecedented outbreak of cholera       in Haiti resulted in over 800,000 reported cases and over       9,000 deaths to date. The Pan American Health Organization       reported in 2018 that the cholera incidence rate in Haiti is       25.5 cases per 100,000.        (8) With United States assistance, almost 14,000 jobs have       been created since the 2010 earthquake, largely in the       apparel industry at the Caracol Industrial Park (in       partnership with the Inter-American Development Bank, the       Haitian Government, and the private sector) in northern       Haiti.        (9) According to the Haitian National Human Rights Defense       Network, on November 13, 2018, at least 59 people were shot       and killed in the Port-au-Prince neighborhood of La Saline.       After months of investigations, no one has been held       responsible for the La Saline massacre.        (10) Since 2018, tens of thousands of Haitians have       participated in popular demonstrations demanding       accountability over government management of Petrocaribe       resources. In early 2019, the Haitian superior court of       auditors released a series of reports implicating high-level       government officials in the misappropriation of funds.  [[Page H5898]]         (11) From August 2018 through February 2019, local human       rights organizations reported that 64 Haitian citizens were       killed in protests.        (12) According to the Committee to Protect Journalists,       five Haitian journalists were shot while covering protests in       2019 and one was killed. On September 23, 2019, Associated       Press photojournalist Chery Dieu-Nalio was shot by Haitian       Senator Jean Marie Ralph Fethiere when the Senator fired       multiple shots near a crowd outside of parliament.        (13) Economic growth in Haiti is projected to drop below       1.5 percent this year. Inflation is estimated to be 15       percent and the local currency has depreciated by 30 percent       in the past year. The Haitian government and parliament have       failed to pass a budget for two years, preventing the       International Monetary Fund and other multilaterals from       disbursing millions in international assistance.        (14) Midterm elections set for October 2019 did not take       place, and since January 2020 President Moise has ruled by       decree.       SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY.         It is the policy of the United States to support the       sustainable rebuilding and development of Haiti in a manner       that--        (1) recognizes Haitian independence, self-reliance,       sovereignty, democratic governance, and efficiency;        (2) promotes Haitian-led efforts for reconstruction and       development of Haiti;        (3) strengthens the capacity of civil society and supports       private sector initiatives that foster economic opportunities       in Haiti;        (4) fosters collaboration between the Haitian diaspora in       the United States and the Haitian Government;        (5) combats impunity and prioritizes delivering justice to       victims of human rights abuses;        (6) ensures the protection of press freedoms and promotion       of a free and independent Haitian press;        (7) promotes respect for freedom of assembly and the rights       of Haitians to peacefully demonstrate;        (8) demands increased transparency and accountability among       all branches of government and supports anti-corruption and       addresses human rights concerns;        (9) prioritizes strengthening community resilience to       environmental and weather-related impacts; and        (10) promotes democratic principles, including free, fair,       and timely elections in accordance with the Haitian       Constitution.       SEC. 4. STRENGTHENING HUMAN RIGHTS AND ANTI-CORRUPTION                     EFFORTS IN HAITI AND HOLDING PERPETRATORS OF LA                     SALINE MASSACRE ACCOUNTABLE.         (a) Secretary of State Prioritization.--The Secretary of       State shall prioritize the protection of human rights and       anti-corruption efforts in Haiti by--        (1) fostering strong relationships with independent civil       society groups focused on monitoring corruption and human       rights abuses and promoting democracy in Haiti;        (2) supporting the efforts of the Haitian Government to       identify human rights violators and corrupt actors in Haiti,       including public and private sector actors, and hold them       accountable for their actions; and        (3) addressing concerns of impunity for alleged       orchestrators of the La Saline massacre.        (b) Assessment.--        (1) Elements.--Not later than 180 days after the date of       the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State, in       consultation with nongovernmental organizations in Haiti and       the United State, shall submit to the appropriate       congressional committees a detailed assessment of the       happenings on November 13, 2018, in the Port-au-Prince       neighborhood of La Saline. The assessment shall include the       following:        (A) An examination of any links between the massacre in La       Saline and mass protests that occurred concurrently in the       country.        (B) An analysis of the reports on the La Saline massacre       authored by the United Nations, the European Union, and the       Haitian Government.        (C) A detailed description of all known actors implicated       in the shooting.        (D) An overview of efforts taken by the Haitian Government       to bring the orchestrators of the La Saline massacre to       justice.        (E) An assessment of the ensuing treatment and displacement       of the La Saline shooting survivors.        (2) Public availability.--The assessment required under       paragraph (1) shall be made publicly available on the website       of the Department of State.       SEC. 5. ACTIONS TO PROMOTE FREEDOM OF THE PRESS AND ASSEMBLY                     IN HAITI.         The Secretary of State shall prioritize the promotion of       press and assembly freedoms, as well as the protection of       journalists, in Haiti by--        (1) advocating for increased protections for the press and       the freedom to peacefully assemble in Haiti;        (2) collaborating with government and nongovernment       officials to develop and implement legal protections for       journalists in Haiti;        (3) supporting efforts to strengthen transparency and       access to information in Haiti;        (4) ensuring that threats and attacks on journalists and       protesters are fully investigated and perpetrators are held       accountable;        (5) developing increased protection measures for peaceful       protesters in accordance with Haitian law; and        (6) financing efforts to strengthen capacity for       independent journalists and increase support for       investigative journalism.       SEC. 6. ACTIONS TO SUPPORT POST-EARTHQUAKE AND POST-HURRICANE                     RECOVERY AND DEVELOPMENT IN HAITI.         The Secretary of State, in coordination with the       Administrator of the United States Agency for International       Development, shall prioritize post-earthquake and post-      hurricane recovery and development efforts in Haiti by--        (1) collaborating with the Haitian Government on a detailed       and transparent development plan that includes clear       objectives and benchmarks;        (2) building the capacity of local institutions through       post-earthquake and post-hurricane recovery and development       planning;        (3) assessing the impact of both the United States' and the       international community's recovery and development efforts in       Haiti over the past 10 years;        (4) supporting disaster resilience and reconstruction       efforts; and        (5) addressing the underlying causes of poverty and       inequality, including by providing health resources, access       to clean water, food, and shelter.       SEC. 7. REPORT.         (a) In General.--Not later than 180 days after the date of       the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State, in       coordination with the Administrator of the United States       Agency for International Development, shall submit to the       appropriate congressional committees a report that includes       the following:        (1) A strategy for carrying out the initiatives described       in sections 4, 5, and 6, including established baselines,       benchmarks, and indicators to measure outcomes and impact.        (2) An assessment of corruption in Haiti, including an       analysis of corruption among the public and private sectors,       a list of government and nongovernment officials known or       alleged to have partaken in corruption or human rights       violations, and a list of United States entities, including       financial institutions, with financial ties to alleged       corrupt actors in Haiti.        (3) An overview of efforts taken by the Haitian Government       to address public and private sector corruption.

[[Page H5899]]      Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include in the Record extraneous material on H.R. 5586.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, let me start by thanking Mr. Jeffries for authoring this  bipartisan bill. He has been a strong advocate for the Haitian people,  and I thank him for his leadership on this issue.   There are many, many colleagues in this Congress who feel very  strongly about the U.S. relationship with Haiti. I am certainly one of  them, and I know Mr. Smith is and, of course, Mr. Jeffries and many  other people on our committee.   We have Haiti, which is not that far from the United States, and is  really, I think, an obligation of the United States, helping the people  of Haiti. There has been such misery and such problems there that they  really need our help, our continued and sustained help.   Again, Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Jeffries for his leadership on this  issue.   On January 12, 2010, a magnitude 7.0 earthquake struck Haiti,  displacing 1.5 million people and killing more than 200,000.   Less than 2 months after the earthquake, I had the opportunity to  visit Haiti and survey the damage. I stand here today with the same  message my colleagues and I delivered to the Haitian people 10 years  ago: The United States remains steadfast in its commitment to assist  Haiti in its time of need.   Over the last decade, Congress has worked closely with the Haitian- American diaspora, the Haitian people, and the Haitian Government to  support rebuilding and development efforts on the island, but Haiti  still has a long way to go.   As we support efforts to reconstruct Haiti, we must learn from our  mistakes over the past 10 years and devise innovative solutions to  overcome the many remaining challenges.   At the same time, it is imperative that the Haitian Government  address the growing and legitimate concerns about the country's  deteriorating human rights situations, attacks against the press and  peaceful protesters as well, and the lack of accountability for corrupt  officials.   The Haiti Development, Accountability, and Institutional Transparency  Initiative Act will help move us toward these goals. It evaluates the  effectiveness of U.S. recovery and developmental efforts in Haiti over  the past 10 years. It also promotes new strategies to enhance the rule  of law, encourage freedom of the press, combat government corruption,  address the root causes of poverty, and improve developmental efforts.   It is the duty of all of us here in Congress to stand with the  Haitian people. Geographically, they are so close to the United States,  and there are many Haitian Americans as well.   We need to stand with the Haitian people as they fight for a more  prosperous and democratic Haiti, and I urge the Haitian Government to  do all it can to engage with their citizens and truly listen to their  concerns.   Mr. Speaker, I was pleased that the House Foreign Affairs Committee  advanced this bipartisan bill unanimously, and I urge my colleagues to  join me in supporting its passage in the House today.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Jeffries), the author of this important bill, the chair of  our Democratic Caucus, the gentleman from New York, even though it is  Brooklyn.    Mr. Speaker, I once again thank Mr. Jeffries for authoring  this important legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to  support this legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.
