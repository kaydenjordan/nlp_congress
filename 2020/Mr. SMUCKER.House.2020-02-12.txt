 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate, to honor, and  to give thanks to Dr. William Griscom, the President of Thaddeus  Stevens College of Technology, who retired recently at the end of  January.   Dr. Griscom, across his 23 years at the helm of Thaddeus Stevens,  transformed the institution into one of the most successful 2-year- degree granting institutions in the Nation, boasting an over 96 percent  placement rate for its graduates. In fact, last year, there were 1,400  employers seeking to fill 4,000 jobs all looking to hire Thaddeus  Stevens' 365 graduates.   Dr. Griscom increased enrollment at the school from nearly 500  students when he started in 1996 to over 1,200 students enrolled today,  completing capital projects worth tens of millions of dollars to  increase the school's capacity, and led the school through  accreditation with the Commission of Higher Education Middle States  Association of Colleges and Schools.  [[Page H1054]]    Mr. Speaker, the lives of thousands of individuals across south  central Pennsylvania and across Lancaster County have been put on the  path to success because of Dr. Griscom's leadership. It has been an  honor to work with him over the past decade during my time in the State  senate chairing the education committee, and now as a Member of  Congress.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Dr. Bill Griscom for his years of committed and  thoughtful leadership of Thaddeus Stevens College of Technology and  wish him continued success and happiness in retirement.                            ____________________
