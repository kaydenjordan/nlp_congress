 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support President Trump's  plan to tackle the opioid epidemic, a crisis that has plagued  communities and devastated families all across Indiana.   In Indiana, roughly 40 percent more people die from drug overdoses  than they do from car accidents. Since 2010, opioid-related deaths have  nearly tripled in my State.   It is past time to address the opioid epidemic and get serious about  saving lives.   Growing up in the 1980s, Nancy Reagan's Just Say No campaign had a  real impact on my life, and I applaud President Trump's plan to do more  to educate young people about the horrific effects of drug use.   I also support the President's plan to address the opioid crisis by  securing our border, stopping the flow of drugs pouring into our  country, and reducing rampant prescription drug abuse. The President is  right. For the worst drug traffickers, the death penalty should be an  option.   Today we took a big step in the right direction, but more must be  done to help families dealing with the devastating effects of opioid  abuse.                            ____________________
