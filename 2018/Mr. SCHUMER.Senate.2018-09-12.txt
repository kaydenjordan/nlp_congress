 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, yesterday was the 17th anniversary of the  9/11 attacks--an event that changed my city and our country forever. I  spent the morning at the 9/11 Memorial in Lower Manhattan. Two deep  scars in the Earth remind us where mighty towers once stood.   I will never forget that day, nor the next: the phones--when they  worked--ringing endlessly; the smell of death; the lines of hundreds of  people holding homemade signs--I will never forget that--as I walked  there. President Bush sent a plane, and we went to Ground Zero the day  after. Hundreds of people were lined up asking: ``Have you seen my  father Joe?'' ``Have you seen my daughter Mary?'' The towers had  crashed, but no one knew how many people had survived. It was awful.   Mr. President, 3,000 souls were lost in one day--one of the bloodiest  days on American soil since the Civil War--people I knew: a guy I  played basketball with in high school, a businessman who helped me on  my way up, a firefighter with whom I went around the city to ask people  to donate blood.   Seventeen years ago today, September 12, 2001, I called on Americans  to wear the flag in remembrance of those who were lost, the brave men  and women who rushed to find those who might still be alive. I have  worn that flag every single day since. I will wear it every day of my  life for the rest of my life in remembrance of those who were lost.   This year, I want to turn everyone's attention to a harrowing  statistic. By the end of 2018, we expect that more people will have  died from exposure to toxic chemicals on 9/11 than were killed on that  day itself. Last year, 23 current or former members of the New York  Police Department died of 9/11-related diseases--the same number who  died on September 11. A new tablet was recently installed at the Hall  of Heroes at One Police Plaza to commemorate all the new deaths of  members of the FDNY. There is now an American living with a 9/11- related illness in every one of the 50 States and 429 of the 436  congressional districts. I guess they have 436 counting the District of  Columbia.   Just as we will never forget the bravery so many fallen Americans  showed that terrible day, let us never forget those first responders  who did survive, only to contract cancer or a respiratory illness from  breathing in a toxic cocktail of dust and ash at Ground Zero.   Nearly a decade ago, I was proud, along with my colleague from New  York, to pass the Zadroga Act to provide healthcare for our first  responders and a victim compensation fund to help survivors who get  sick and the families who lost a loved one to illness. Three years ago,  I was proud to work across the aisle to make the healthcare component  of the Zadroga Act virtually permanent.    Next year, however, Congress must reauthorize the September 11th  Victim Compensation Fund because the administrator of the fund now  predicts that the funding will not last until 2020, as we had  previously hoped. So many new claims are being filed because so many of  these deadly cancers are now showing up. As the death tally from 9/11  continues to grow, we have to make sure the fund is capitalized with  enough money to provide an ever longer list of 9/11 victims. So I want  to remind my colleagues that soon we have to come together once again  to do what is right for the families of the first responders and the  surviving first responders themselves who, without hesitation, risked  their lives to save other lives 17 years ago yesterday.    Mr. President, today I wish to congratulate Helen Keller  Services, HKS, on its 125th anniversary, which will be celebrated at  its gala at the Liberty Warehouse in Brooklyn, NY, on September 13,  2018.   Since 1893, the Helen Keller Services has been committed to improving  the lives of individuals who are blind, visually impaired, or have  combined hearing and vision loss. The talented and dedicated staff at  the Helen Keller Services has made over 60,000 visits to the homes and  communities of individuals who are blind or visually impaired. Over  900,000 children ages 3-5 have received preschool vision screenings to  ensure they are equipped for success in the classroom. The organization  has placed over 14,000 individuals in jobs with the help of their  programs. The totality of their impact over the past 125 years is hard  to overstate.   This fall the organization will move its headquarters to a new  44,000-square-foot facility located at 180 Livingston Street in  Brooklyn. This modern structure will house new classrooms and training  rooms, a specialized gym for prekindergarten students, new offices and  workstations, a Low Vision Center, and a new technology training space.  This will aide HKS in serving the blind and visually impaired community  for decades to come.   While the scope of its services has changed and expanded  substantially over the past century and a quarter, allowing HKS to  touch the lives of countless blind, visually impaired, and deaf-blind  men women and children, what has not changed is its steadfast  commitment to Brooklyn, the surrounding communities, and the entire New  York region. I congratulate the Helen Keller Services on achieving this  milestone and thank them for their outstanding service to New York.                            ____________________
