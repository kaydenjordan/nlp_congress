 Madam Speaker, earlier this year Congressman Emmer  and I introduced legislation to honor the three Minnesota National  Guardsmen who were tragically killed on December 5, 2019, when their  helicopter experienced engine failure.   Chief Warrant Officer Charles P. Nord was just 30 years old and led a  full and happy life with his wife, Kaley, and their daughter, Lydia,  and he was very excited for the arrival of his son, Jack.   He found his calling as a medevac helicopter pilot and also as a crop  sprayer, and often said he felt like he had landed his dream job. He is  deeply missed by the many close friends and family he made in the  service and in his community.   H.R. 6220 would name the post office in Perham, Minnesota, in honor  of Chief Warrant Officer Nord's service and sacrifice. It is my honor  to memorialize him and his service this way.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill.    Madam Speaker, Chief Warrant Officer James A. Rogers  was born and raised in western Minnesota, graduating from St. Cloud  State University earlier in 2019. He joined the Minnesota Army National  Guard in June 2009 and deployed twice to Kuwait in support of Operation  Enduring Freedom. While there, he conducted medical evacuations. He was  a true patriot and was a valued member of his team. Those who served  with him said he was the jokester of the group and a top-notch soldier.  He is greatly missed by his fellow servicemembers, friends, and family  in Winsted.   H.R. 6221 would memorialize Chief Warrant Officer Rogers' name by  naming the post office in Winsted, Minnesota, after him, a small token  of appreciation for his sacrifice.   Madam Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this bill in  honor of this young man. We can never honor our fallen the way they  truly deserve, but every step we can take is a meaningful one.
