 Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Meehan).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Messer).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Paulsen).    Mr. Chairman, I thank Mr. Conyers, Ms.  Jackson Lee, and all of those who have spoken in support of this bill  this morning, the Protecting Young Victims from Sexual Abuse Act.   It is exactly as it has been described. It is an important moment for  us, in a bipartisan consensus that we have reached, to protect our  young athletes. It has been articulated well, the purpose behind the  bill, and it is a proud moment for all of us as we stand for these  young athletes to defend them as they perform and use their God-given  talents that make our Nation so proud.   So, without belaboring the point, Mr. Chairman, I just want to  commend, again, Mrs. Brooks for introducing this important legislation,  and I also urge all of my colleagues to support it.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, as the designee of Chairman  Goodlatte, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   I am happy to introduce this manager's amendment to H.R. 1973, the  Protecting Young Victims from Sexual Abuse Act. This amendment is very  simple. It defines who is covered by the mandatory reporting  requirement in the underlying bill. The definition harmonizes language  with the underlying statute, defining this class not by location, but  by simply keeping the jurisdictional reference where it belongs: in the  national governing body or a member of a national governing body.   The amendment also defines the term ``event'' to include travel,  practice, competition, and health or medical treatment. This definition  is important as events in USA Gymnastics revealed abuse by USA  Gymnastics' team doctor Larry Nassar, who molested dozens of young  girls under the guise of medical treatment. Moreover, other allegations  of abuse show that it sometimes took place during travel to various  competitions.   The amendment also clarifies duties of national governing bodies.  Under the amendment, national governing bodies must implement  reasonable procedures designed to avoid one-on-one interactions between  minors and adults that are not within an observable or interruptible  distance.   This amendment assures that the 47 different national governing  bodies can implement procedures that make sense, given the sport they  cover, the reach of their influence, and the resources available to  them.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chair, in closing, I echo what has been  [[Page H4581]]  said already, and I appreciate the comments of my colleagues and  acknowledge, again, that the manager's amendment is very simple. It  simply seeks to clear up language and define these terms. It is a  necessary alteration to the bill, and I encourage our colleagues to  support the amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Will the gentleman yield?    I appreciate the gentleman's remarks and  his support for this important legislation.   Victims should, of course, have reasonable opportunity to seek  justice and face their accusers in court. This bill is a good one and  fair to all parties, and I look forward to working with the gentleman  to get it to the President's desk.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition,  although I am not opposed to this commonsense amendment, as has just  been articulated.  [[Page H4582]]     Mr. Chair, I want to thank Mr. O'Halleran  and Mr. Biggs for offering this amendment. It will help to prevent  abuse at these national governing bodies and, as stated, it will  encourage children to report abuse when they are able to quickly and  easily access this information.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of  my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from California (Mr. McCarthy).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   I am honored today to speak in support of my legislation, the  Protecting Against Child Exploitation Act, which aims to close a court- created loophole, and as the title suggests, further protect our  children from predators.   When I first arrived to Congress after almost 20 years of litigating  constitutional law cases and drafting legislation for municipalities to  control the proliferation of sexually oriented businesses, I was deeply  concerned to learn that this particular loophole even existed in  current Federal law, which essentially allows a child rapist to admit  to sexually abusing a child and yet still evade punishment.   The background is important to reiterate. As my chairman stated  moments ago, this comes from a 2015 case, United States v. Palomino- Coronado, where the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit  reversed the conviction of a child sex offender simply because the  court determined the perpetrator lacked specific intent to record the  disgusting images that were found on the offender's smartphone. This is  despite the fact that the defendant admitted to sexually abusing the 7- year-old child from next door and memorializing the conduct.   In its opinion, the court decided the lack of purpose or specific  intent was enough to overturn the conviction, even though the defendant  himself took the photo of the heinous act and subsequently admitted to  sexually abusing this child. This is absolutely in clear contradiction  of our responsibility and this Congress' intention to protect America's  children.   In Scripture, Romans 13 refers to the governing authorities as  ``God's servants, agents of wrath to bring punishment on the  wrongdoer.'' I, for one, believe we have a moral obligation, as any  just government should, to defend the defenseless.   My legislation presents a simple fix and updates title 18 of the U.S.  Code to ensure future defendants are not able to circumvent the law by  simply claiming a lack of intent, especially after knowingly creating a  visual depiction of a minor engaged in sexually conduct.   More specifically, my legislation amends section 2251 of title 18 to  prohibit the production and transmission of a visual depiction of a  real minor engaged in sexually explicit conduct.   Furthermore, it amends current law to include prohibiting the  depiction of a minor assisting any person in engaging in a sexually  explicit act.   Lastly, to clarify potential circumstances of misinterpretation of  the statute and to ensure the statute is not used erroneously to  prosecute internet services providers when they have not engaged in  wrongdoing, my legislation emphasizes that to be criminally liable  under section (a)(3), an internet service provider must have actual  knowledge that the child pornography is on its server and that it must  intentionally transmit that image or intentionally cause its  transmission.   We also take the step of prohibiting any criminal or civil liability  for internet service providers who are required to transmit child  pornography to law enforcement in response to a legal process, such as  a search warrant in child exploitation cases. Of course, we would  never anticipate a prosecution of an internet service provider for  merely responding to a legal process, but it is my hope that explicitly  providing for this immunity in the statute will further enhance the  relationship between internet service providers and law enforcement to  work together to combat these predators.    In answer to the opposition that we have heard here, it is important  to reiterate this legislation does not create new mandatory minimums.  However, I would like to address the comments regarding the current law  on mandatory minimum penalties under the production of child  pornography statute.   There is simply no evidence that Federal prosecutors are abusing this  statute. I think we should all recognize that producing child  pornography is a horrific crime. It often means luring young children  into acts that no one, man, woman, or child, should be forced to do.   It is not a photograph of a nude child. It is something far worse.  Each photo is a crime scene. Such a horrific act by the perpetrator  requires the maximum amount of legal deterrents.   While mandatory minimums have reached much scrutiny in the drug  statutes, in this venue for this statute, there could be no doubt that  the penalties that exist under current law are appropriate. Child  sexual exploitation is vastly underreported. The number of images of  child pornography keeps growing and the images are becoming more and  more depraved. The harm is too great to these victims not to have  significant penalties available to deter this conduct and punish the  producers of child pornography.   Every time an image of child pornography is viewed, the victim gets  revictimized. Once an image is on the internet, it is irretrievable and  can continue to circulate forever. This permanent record of a child's  sexual abuse can alter his or her life forever. Many victims of child  pornography suffer from feelings of helplessness, fear, humiliation,  and lack of control, given that their images are available for others  to view in perpetuity.                                time  1045    These images are becoming more sadistic and violent, and the age of  the average victim is becoming younger and younger. It is a horrifying  fact that it is not uncommon for even toddlers and infants to now be  subjects of these images.   It is also important that there is no confusion about one fact: The  very creation of these images is repulsive, regardless of whether or  not the abuse was done with a specific intent of creating an image or  if the intent to memorialize this conduct was a secondary thought.   Consider the facts of the case that led to this bill. As was  mentioned, an adult male had sexual relations with a 7-year-old girl  who lived next door and decided to photograph it. That is the  production of child pornography. There is no question about it. No one  should be permitted to escape responsibility merely by asserting they  did not have a specific intent to create the image before they abused  the child. The act of taking a photo or making a video is enough to  demonstrate intent.   Mr. Speaker, that is what this bill does. It is appropriate that we  are doing all this on the day that we recognize as National Missing  Children's  [[Page H4586]]  Day. I am going to urge all my colleagues to support the bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume to just say a couple of important points in rebuttal to  what we have heard.   For one thing, there has been no evidence that the cases referenced  by the gentlewoman involving conduct between minors are being  prosecuted at the Federal level. I have not seen even one that has been  cited. The point here is that prosecutorial discretion has been a  sufficient buffer.   In committee, our colleagues on the other side have invoked stories  of juvenile offenders being charged for consensual conduct and placed  on sex offender registries unjustly; however, these are all cases that  were prosecuted at the local level. Not one that has been mentioned has  been a Federal case.   It is important to note that, for offenders under 18, the Federal  Department of Justice policy on charging juveniles means that juvenile  prosecutions very rarely occur, and only if no State court can assume  jurisdiction. In fact, certification from the Attorney General himself  is necessary to proceed against a juvenile.   Again, I know of no such case in which a juvenile has been prosecuted  federally under any child pornography statute. So while we appreciate  and understand the concerns about mandatory minimum sentencing and its  abuse, particularly with the drug statutes, again, it is important to  reiterate here, that is not the case with child pornography.   For that reason, Mr. Speaker, I would oppose these arguments and  trust that my colleagues will see the wisdom in supporting this very  important and timely legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, the concerns stated today  are misplaced. The child pornography statutes have never been the  subject of abuse by Federal prosecutors, and there is no evidence that  that would happen in the future. However, the abuse that is being  allowed and that we must address today is that of our children, and  that abuse is being allowed because of a loophole that was, sadly,  created by a Federal court.   Today we have an opportunity to correct that wrong. We have an  opportunity to do what we all acknowledge to be the right thing: to  defend the most defenseless among us. It is, indeed, an honor for us to  take this action on the week that commemorates National Missing  Children's Week and here, even, on this day, National Missing  Children's Day.   I urge all my colleagues to join me in supporting the Protecting  Against Child Exploitation Act. We hope that everyone will do the right  thing here today.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to the  amendment.    Madam Speaker, it is not only unnecessary,  but it is fashioned in such a manner which may potentially create the  type of loophole that we are looking to close.   Under current law, so-called Romeo and Juliet cases, such as those  between 19- and 50-year-olds, could be prosecuted under any of the  child pornography laws--possession, production, or distribution. That  has always been the case.   However, I reiterate that we know of no such instance that has been  brought under any of these Federal provisions under the circumstances  covered by this amendment, which further supports the fact that Federal  prosecutors do not appear to be bringing such cases. There is just  simply no evidence that has been produced to suggest otherwise. For  that reason, the amendment is completely unnecessary, and it is based  upon no evidence at all.   On the contrary, the underlying bill is based upon a real case where  a real 7-year-old girl was sexually abused and photographed by a real  sexual predator.   Our colleagues on the other side have also continually referred to  Attorney General Sessions' recent charging memoranda which suggests  that under the policy in his memo prosecutors will suddenly be forced  to aggressively prosecute 19-year-olds who are engaging in consensual  sexual conduct under this statute. But that notion is preposterous and  is also based on no evidence.   As an initial matter, the minority completely ignores the fact that a  prosecutor makes an initial determination as to whether to commence or  decline prosecution. And this is distinct from the subsequent decision  of what charges should be brought, which would only occur if the  decision to prosecute is made in the first place.   According to the U.S. attorneys' manual, in making the initial  determination to commence a prosecution, a prosecutor must consider  whether ``a substantial Federal interest would be served by the  prosecution,'' and whether, ``in his or her judgment: One, the person  is subject to effective prosecution in another jurisdiction; or, two,  there exists an adequate noncriminal alternative to prosecution.''   The Sessions memo doesn't change any of that, and it is absurd to  think that the memo will cause the Department of Justice to suddenly  shift its prosecutions to aggressively go after Romeo and Juliet cases.  This is especially ridiculous, as Attorney General Sessions had made  clear from the outset, that the priorities of DOJ and this  administration are to prosecute violent crimes and violent offenders.   I think that the minority just fundamentally misunderstands and  mischaracterizes not only the Sessions memo but this legislation. For  that reason, I urge all of my colleagues to oppose the Jackson Lee  amendment.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I have tremendous respect  for my colleagues on the other side, Mr. Conyers and Ms. Jackson Lee. I  understand her amendment is heartfelt and has the proper motive and  attention.   I would just suggest, again, that the risk of this amendment  outweighs any potential benefit because it creates the kind of  loopholes that we are trying here desperately to prevent.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
