 Madam Speaker, and still I rise on this 9/11, a  day that will live in the annals of history eternally, a day when there  were more questions than answers, a day when we thought that our  country was--and, indeed, what we thought was correct--under assault.   I remember the day because I was at work, and as the judge of a small  claims justice court, we were so moved by what was happening that we  paused to sing God Bless America. I remember at least one person  sobbing. It was a day when people within that courtroom were faced with  uncertainties unlike we had seen before, a day when all of our first  responders were challenged.   But allow me, please, for just a moment, to talk and say a few words  about those who were there at the site of the Twin Towers.   We could see on television the cloud of dust as it started to emerge  and settle, people rushing, bodies covered. It was intuitively obvious  to the most casual observer that this was not a place to run to. As a  matter of fact, you could see people running away.   But there were those who took their duties and responsibilities  seriously, and as others were rushing away, as fear would have us do,  they were rushing in. These were the people, many of whom lost their  lives trying to save the lives of others. These were the people, many  of whom still suffer today because they were bound by duty to do that  which most of us would not.   These are the people whom we must never forget. Their lives have been  changed and altered forever. But we have a duty and a responsibility  here to share our thoughts and our feelings with them, but also to make  sure we take care of their health issues.   There is something to be said about this term, ``in the line of  duty.'' Until you have had the opportunity to visit one of the memorial  services, it just may not impact you as it can. It will never impact me  the way it impacts the family members.   But I want this country to know that those who lost their lives in  the line of duty on that day will never be forgotten, and those who  served and still serve will always be remembered.   So I take this moment for my personal privilege, and I will lower my  head for a moment of silent prayer.   God bless the United States of America.                            ____________________
