 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Rashad Wright on  becoming Jersey City, New Jersey's first poet laureate in more than a  decade.   Rashad is a 24-year-old Poetry Slam Champion and recent graduate of  New Jersey City University. Rashad has spent the past 6 years  performing poetry and inspiring people throughout my district.   His poetry challenges society to improve lives. His spoken word and  his written word are full of power that exceeds his 24 years of age.   In a piece of prose, titled, ``Between Lines,'' Rashad writes: ``As a  poet, it feels like the souls of black folks fire through my lips.''   He speaks truth through art and helps elevate everyone who listens. I  am proud to honor a man whose creativity and passion pull people into  poetry.   Poet laureate Rashad Wright's story is just the beginning. I ask my  colleagues to join me in celebrating Rashad for his accomplishments.                            ____________________
