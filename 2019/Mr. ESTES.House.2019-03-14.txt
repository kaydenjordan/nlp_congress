 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Wichita  State University President Dr. John Bardo, who sadly passed away on  March 12, 2019. In his 7 years as president, Dr. Bardo's devotion to  education and Wichita State was unsurpassed as he led the university in  a bold direction that benefited students and the entire Wichita  community.   Dr. Bardo's tenure was not his first job at the university. In 1975,  Dr. Bardo, then an assistant professor of sociology, met his wife,  Deborah.   When Dr. Bardo returned to Wichita State as president in 2012, he  said: ``We came home . . . to reposition this university as a key  driver of the future of Wichita.'' From developing the Innovation  Campus and WSU Tech, to increasing online courses, research, and dorm  space, his leadership accomplished that goal and set the university on  a path to be a nationwide leader in education.   Last July, Dr. Bardo was invited to come testify before the House  Education and the Workforce Committee about Wichita State's leadership  in innovation. As a member of the committee at the time, I will never  forget the pride Dr. Bardo showed for the university and our community.   I know Shockers are better off because of his leadership, passion,  and vision.   I ask my colleagues to join me in praying for the Bardo family.                            ____________________
