SEC. 3. PAUL D. WELLSTONE FEDERAL BUILDING.         (a) Redesignation.--The Federal building located at 212       Third Avenue South in Minneapolis, Minnesota, shall be known       and designated as the ``Paul D. Wellstone Federal Building''.        (b) References.--Any reference in a law, map, regulation,       document, paper, or other record of the United States to the       Federal building referred to in subsection (a) shall be       deemed to be a reference to the ``Paul D. Wellstone Federal       Building''.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on S. 5060.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I rise in support of S. 5060, a bill to designate the Federal  building located at 212 Third Avenue South in Minneapolis, Minnesota,  as the ``Paul D. Wellstone Federal Building''.   S. 5060 was introduced on October 25, 2022, 20 years to the day that  Senator Wellstone; his wife, Sheila; his daughter, Marcia; his staff  members, Todd Lapic, Mary McEvoy, and Will McLaughlin; and pilots,  Richard Conry and Michael Guess, were killed in a plane crash near  Eveleth, Minnesota.   Paul Wellstone was born in Washington, D.C., on July 21, 1944;  attended Arlington, Virginia, public schools; received his BA from the  University of North Carolina in 1965; earned a Ph.D. from the  University of North Carolina in 1969; taught political science at  Carleton College in Minnesota for 21 years; served as a director of the  Minnesota Community Energy Program; was elected to represent Minnesota  in the United States Senate in 1990, was reelected in 1996, and served  from January 3, 1991, until his death in a plane crash on October 25,  2002.   Paul Wellstone was a champion college wrestler and a member of the  National Wrestling Hall of Fame, a college professor for 21 years, a  prolific legislator who sponsored 608 bills during his time in the U.S.  Senate, and a mentor to generations of future public servants and  advocates.   Upon introduction of S. 5060, Senator Klobuchar said, ``During his  time as an educator, an activist, and a United States Senator, Paul  Wellstone touched the lives of people throughout Minnesota and across  the country. That is because he stood up for people, persistently  fighting against injustices, small and large. From his passionate  advocacy for better care and services for those suffering from mental  illness to his leadership on civil rights and campaign finance reform,  Paul showed how getting involved in public service can make a real  difference in improving people's lives.''   Madam Speaker, I support S. 5060, and I urge my colleagues to join  me.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Minnesota (Ms. Omar).    Madam Speaker, in closing, this bill honors the life of  a dedicated public servant, a United States Senator, Paul Wellstone.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and  I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 4017) to designate the United States courthouse located at 111  South Highland Avenue in Jackson, Tennessee, as the ``James D. Todd  United States Courthouse'', and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 4017         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. JAMES D. TODD UNITED STATES COURTHOUSE.         (a) Designation.--The United States courthouse located at       111 South Highland Avenue in Jackson, Tennessee, shall be       known and designated as the ``James D. Todd United States       Courthouse''.        (b) References.--Any reference in a law, map, regulation,       document, paper, or other record of the United States to the       United States courthouse referred to in subsection (a) shall       be deemed to be a reference to the ``James D. Todd United       States Courthouse''.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  and to include extraneous material on S. 4017.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I support the passage of S. 4017, a bill to name the  United States Courthouse located at 111 South Highland Avenue in  Jackson, Tennessee, the James D. Todd United States Courthouse.   Judge James Todd was born in Scotts Hill, Tennessee, in 1943. He  received a bachelor of science from Lambuth College in 1965 and his  juris doctorate from Memphis State University, now the University of  Memphis, Cecil C. Humphreys School of Law in 1972.   He was in private practice in Jackson, Tennessee, from 1972 to 1983,  and served as a judge on Tennessee's Circuit Court from 1983 to 1985.   In 1985, Judge Todd was nominated and confirmed to the U.S. District  Court for the Western District of Tennessee where he served as chief  judge from 2001 to 2007. Judge Todd assumed senior status in 2008.   Madam Speaker, I support S. 4017 to name a courthouse after the  Honorable Judge Todd, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this  important legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1082) to require ride-hailing companies to implement an  enhanced digital system to verify passengers with their authorized  ride-hailing vehicles and drivers, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 1082, as amended.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1082, as amended. I  applaud the gentleman from New Jersey, Representative Smith, for his  tenacity for getting the bill to the House floor for its consideration  today.   The gentleman and his staff have worked tirelessly through many  iterations of this bill. We are here today to take the first steps  toward ensuring the safety of passengers and drivers who utilize ride- hailing platforms. Specifically, we are here to pass Sami's Law, a bill  to honor and remember Samantha Josephson.   Sami, a 21-year-old college student, was brutally murdered after she  entered a car that she mistakenly thought was the Uber that she  ordered.   Her parents, Seymour and Marcie Josephson, have shared their heart- wrenching story firsthand with so many of us on Capitol Hill.   Throughout their grief, they have been committed to working so that  no other family will have to go through this kind of pain, and that  millions of people who use ride-hailing services can do so with safety  protections in place.   Mobility and transportation patterns in many cities have been upended  in recent years by companies that through transformative technology  platforms have revolutionized how we travel.  [[Page H9726]]    In a very short time, many people have come to rely upon  transportation network companies, or TNCs, such as Uber and Lyft, as a  regular transportation option.   These services, however, have operated with little transportation  safety or regulatory oversight.   There are many aspects of TNCs that the Committee on Transportation  has examined, including their impacts on congestion, on wages, and on  public transportation used, as well as gaps in regulatory oversight of  TNCs and drivers.   We held a hearing in 2020 where we examined a number of troubling  aspects of the TNC model.   While the bill under consideration today is a scaled-back version of  legislation as introduced, it marks an important step in oversight of  TNCs.   H.R. 1082, as amended, prohibits the sale of any signage that is  designed to help a passenger identify a TNC vehicle or that contains  TNCs proprietary trademark or logo, unless authorized by the TNC.   The bill also directs the Government Accountability Office to conduct  a study of the incidence of assaults, including sexual assaults, on TNC  passengers and TNC drivers.   In addition, it directs GAO to study the type of background checks  conducted on prospective drivers of TNC vehicles, including any State  and local laws which may require such background checks.   Strong and thorough vetting of potential drivers is the first line of  defense to ensure passenger safety. The study initiated by this bill  will yield important data and will inform decisions on what more needs  to be done to protect the ride-hailing community.   Lawmakers at the Federal, State, and local level will need to think  beyond whether ride-hailing gets people from point A to point B, and  work to ensure that TNC drivers deliver a public service safely and  equitably.   Madam Speaker, I support this important legislation, and I urge my  colleagues to do the same.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                           House of Representatives,                                Committee on Energy and Commerce,                                  Washington, DC, December 13, 2022.      Hon. Peter A. DeFazio,      Chairman, Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure,           Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman DeFazio: I write concerning H.R. 1082,       ``Sami's Law.'' This legislation was additionally referred to       the Committee on Energy and Commerce and amended in such a       manner that would likely result in the Committee having       primary jurisdiction over this measure.        In recognition of the desire to expedite consideration of       H.R. 1082, the Committee agrees to waive formal consideration       of the bill as to provisions that fall within the Rule X       jurisdiction of the Committee. The Committee takes this       action with the mutual understanding that we do not waive any       jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in this or       similar legislation, and that the Committee will be       appropriately consulted and involved as this bill or similar       legislation moves forward so that we may address any       remaining issues within our jurisdiction. I also request that       you support my request to name members of the Committee to       any conference committee to consider such provisions.        Finally, I would appreciate the inclusion of this letter       into the Congressional Record during floor consideration of       the measure.            Sincerely,                                                Frank Pallone, Jr.,      Chairman.                                   ____           House of Representatives, Committee on Transportation and             Infrastructure,                                 Washington, DC, December 13, 2022.      Hon. Frank Pallone,      Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Pallone: Thank you for your letter regarding       H.R. 1082, Sami's Law. I appreciate your willingness to work       cooperatively on this legislation.        I acknowledge that by foregoing formal consideration on       H.R. 1082, the Committee on Energy and Commerce does not       waive any future jurisdictional claims to provisions in this       or similar legislation, and that your Committee will be       consulted and involved on any matters in your Committee's       jurisdiction should this legislation move forward. In       addition, should a conference on the bill be necessary, I       would support your effort to seek appointment of an       appropriate number of conferees to any House-Senate       conference involving provisions within this legislation on       which the Committee on Energy and Commerce has a valid       jurisdictional claim.        I appreciate your cooperation regarding this legislation,       and I will ensure that our exchange of letters is included in       the Congressional Record during floor consideration of H.R.       1082.            Sincerely,                                                  Peter A. DeFazio,                                                             Chair.                                time  1515     Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, this bill honors the memory of Samantha  Josephson and takes steps to ensure that a similar tragedy does not  occur.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this important safety  bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.
