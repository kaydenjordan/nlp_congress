 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to address the  Senate for 1 minute in morning business.    Mr. President, I think we should save the taxpayers a  lot of money by giving States more options under Medicaid.   Unlike Medicare and private insurance, Medicaid doesn't incentivize  bundled payments. This prevents States from testing a method that could  potentially save money.   The bipartisan prescription drug pricing reform legislation I  introduced with Senator Wyden allows States to collect rebates from  drugs in outpatient settings. This removes an existing exemption in  statute for some outpatient drugs and allows States to more completely  utilize and test bundled payments to possibly save money.   Giving States flexibility allows them to focus on the best care for  different populations. Encouraging bundled payments in Medicaid would  do just that.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
