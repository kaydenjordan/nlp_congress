 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong  support of Senate 2163, a bill to address the root causes of inequality  for Black men and boys in America.   Mr. Speaker, today, as the civil rights icon, John Lewis, is laying  in state just a few feet in the Capitol rotunda, I am so moved to know  that the banner of equality, which he waved his whole life is being  picked up by the next generation.   As chair of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, I have  seen Americans of all backgrounds and ethnicities united in filling the  streets to demand reforms to a criminal justice system that does not  value Black lives and to an economy that does not give Black boys an  equal chance of success.   The people have had enough with the systemic inequalities that have  persisted since our founding. But we cannot fix them unless we  understand them. That is what this commission will do by looking at the  obstacles and policy and culture that keep Black youth from having the  same opportunities that Whites do. We must listen to the demands of a  country that is saying ``no'' to racial inequality.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.''
