 Mr. Speaker, on Monday, May 1, I was delayed in my  travels back to Washington due to a delayed flight.   If I had been present, I would have voted: ``Yea,'' on rollcall 237,  passage of H.R. 910--Fair Access to Investment Research Act of  [[Page H2990]]  2017; ``Yea,'' on rollcall 238, passage of H.R. 1312--Small Business  Capital Formation Enhancement Act; and ``Yea,'' on rollcall 239,  passage of H.R. 657--Follow the Rules Act.                            ____________________
