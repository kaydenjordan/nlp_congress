 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the bill,  S. 3895, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I and my good friend and colleague, Anna Eshoo, have  worked together on many religious freedom issues over the many years  and have introduced the House companion bill to the Senate bill before  us to authorize the United States Commission on International Religious  Freedom.   It is both timely and essential that we pass this legislation.  Timely, because USCIRF's authorization runs out at the end of this  month; and essential, because the cause of religious freedom is under  sustained and escalating threat around the globe, particularly in the  world's remaining communistic dictatorships, from Cuba to Vietnam to  North Korea to Iran, and to the world's largest oppressor of religious  freedom in the world today, the People's Republic of China under Xi  Jinping.   Indeed, just today, we see that the great defender for religious  liberty, 90-year-old Cardinal Joseph Zen, has been put on trial in Hong  Kong, a city-state which was once a bastion of freedom, but which now  sadly has buckled to the dictates of Xi Jinping and the Chinese  Communist Party. All of us here in Congress and the White House need to  raise our voices in defense of Cardinal Zen.   Sadly, we also need to add to that list of oppressors Nicaragua,  where Comandante Daniel Ortega has reestablished his Sandinista  dictatorship along communist lines and is waging a relentless war  against the Catholic Church, the one institution which has consistently  stood up for freedom throughout his tenure of abuse.   I would note parenthetically that I met with Ortega in 1984 on a  human rights trip with Tony Hall and Frank Wolf, and the man is back.  He has been back for a number of years, and his proclivity toward  dictatorial rule, imprisoning the very people who run against him--I  held a hearing earlier this year with the wives of two of the opponents  for him in the general election. What does he do? It was with their  wives, and they were very articulate, very passionate, very courageous  in speaking out for their husbands. But Ortega says, ``I don't like  what you are doing; I don't like that you are running against me,'' so  he throws them in prison, and they are still in prison. And his  oppression of the church has reached new lows as we speak.   Mr. Speaker, USCIRF also calls attention to other issues around the  world, including whether you are a Christian or a Muslim or you happen  to be Jewish or happen to be a member of a lesser-known faith, such as  Baha'i or Falun Gong, USCIRF reports--I encourage everyone to go to  their website and read their reports. They are fact-filled, they are  very persuasive, based on all these kinds of investigations. The human  rights NGOs all feed information to them about what is going on. They  talk to the State Department, but they are really a good check on the  State Department in terms of getting it right.   That is particularly true when it comes to designating certain  countries to be CPC countries, countries of particular concern.  Unfortunately, the State Department has a less-than-stellar record of  picking and choosing and giving passing grades artificially to some  countries that ought to be on the CPC designation, which is the worst  violator and, therefore, susceptible to sanctioning by the United  States Government.   As a matter of fact, this just happened with regards to Nigeria,  where USCIRF accurately labeled Nigeria a top-tier violator of  religious freedom while the State Department gave it an unwarranted  upgrade right before the Secretary of State went to Abuja to meet with  the President there.    We should have said to the President of Nigeria, President Buhari:  ``You have got to clean up your act. The killing of Christians, of  churches, houses of worship and schools, has to come to an end.'' Some  of it he can't stop, but the response could be far better for much of  it. Unfortunately, there is serious allegations of aiding and abetting,  particularly with Fulani, the killing of Christians there.   I would also point out to my colleagues that Nury Turkel, who is the  Chairman of the Board of USCIRF, was born, of all places, in a Chinese  detention center during the cultural revolution. He has been a leader  on behalf of the Uyghurs in Xinjiang, as my colleagues on both sides of  the aisle  [[Page H7899]]  know--we all know it--they are committing genocide. Now, we have  walking point of USCIRF, a man who was actually born in a detention  center, and he has been articulate and strong.   Last week, in the China Commission, which I serve as ranking member,  when he testified, he just hit it out of the park in terms of good,  factual information, persuasive, what next to do, with regards to that  genocide and other concerns of all religious faiths that are being  oppressed by the Chinese Communist Party.   I will end by saying that it is this great Commission that keeps  speaking out so boldly about de-Sinicization of all religions in China.  That means they all comport with Xi Jinping's etiology. Whether you are  Catholic, Protestant, Buddhist, Uyghur, or Falun Gong, they are  breathing down your neck and putting people in prisons if they do not  adhere and comport with Xi Jinping's mandates.   Frank Wolf is now a member of the Commission, and I congratulate him  on that. Here is the guy that wrote the law in 1998, the International  Religious Freedom Act of 1998. We had real opposition to it. I was one  of his cosponsors, and I put together a number of hearings in my  committee where the bill first originated. But it was Frank who was the  absolute champion, and we named the 2016 act after him to honor the  champion work that he is doing, the life-changing work across the  globe.   I thank Frank for his tenacious defense of religious freedom of all  people.   Mr. Speaker, USCIRF needs to be reauthorized. I thank my colleague,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the READ  Act reauthorization, and I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Bass), my  good friend and colleague, for championing this effort. I am proud to  be the Republican lead on this bill. There are 50-plus cosponsors on  it. It is a bipartisan bill that seeks to encourage and strengthen our  efforts at education overseas.   Mr. Speaker, investment in basic education is an investment in the  prosperity and the security of the next generation and the communities  they live in, and that applies both at home and abroad.   Without the opportunity to attend school and learn how to read and  write, children around the world are falling behind and are more  vulnerable to extremism, violence, and exploitation.   In the Africa, Global Health, and Global Human Rights Subcommittee,  Ms. Bass and I--when I was chairman of the committee and now she as  chair--have held a number of hearings about this challenge of helping  these children so they can have good lives, care for their families,  and be as well read and as well positioned in their communities as  humanly possible.   That is why the United States is a leader in this sector. The United  States provides $950 million to partner countries to support basic  education around the world, making strategic investments in improving  educational access, quality, and teacher training.   While important gains have been made, COVID-19 had a devastating  impact on learners, both in the United States and around the world. We  all  [[Page H7900]]  know that from our work within our own constituencies. According to the  most recent report to Congress from the ILO on U.S. basic education  programs, in 2021, 24 million additional students were at risk of  dropping out of school; 22 million more girls and young women were at  risk of forced marriages, early marriages especially, as a result of  this; and 9 million additional children were at risk of child labor,  all because of the impacts of COVID.   We need to do a hurry-up offense, I think, to try to get back to  normalcy and back to a better regimen of training and teaching.   Despite these immense challenges, the U.S. Government's efforts to  support basic education programs did reach 33.4 million learners in 73  countries around the world, and I am very proud of the United States'  efforts to invest in future generations. It is a credit to our  taxpayers that they are supportive of this--and they are--as well as  this Congress on both sides of the aisle.   Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of  H.R. 8503, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to support the Securing Global  Telecommunications Act introduced by two of my colleagues on the  Foreign Affairs Committee, the gentlewoman from North  [[Page H7902]]  Carolina (Ms. Manning) and the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Kim).   The Chinese Communist Party does not hide the fact that its end goal  is to replace freedom and democracy with dictatorship and oppression,  and they use advanced communications such as 5G networks to spread  their malign influence. The CCP seeks to spread that influence further  by dominating the international standards-setting bodies that set the  rules of the road for emerging technologies to skew those standards and  industries toward their interests and industries.   This bipartisan bill seeks to bolster U.S. efforts that are already  underway, but I think it takes it even further to promote secure  telecommunications infrastructure around the world.   It will require, for example, that the U.S. Department of State  submit a report on Chinese and Russian efforts to advance their  interests at international standards-setting bodies, as my colleague  from New Jersey just pointed out, like the International  Telecommunication Union, or ITU, and to identify opportunities for  multilateral collaboration to promote secure telecom providers.   Lastly, it codifies the International Digital Economy and  Telecommunication Advisory Committee, which the State Department  created to provide expert advice to the Bureau of Cyberspace and  Digital Policy on ICT policy matters.   Mr. Speaker, it is a good bill and deserves the support of Members on  both sides. I urge its support, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill,  and I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the Countering Untrusted Telecommunications Abroad Act  requires the State Department to conduct a report on the presence and  risks posed by any Chinese telecommunications vendor like Huawei or ZTE  in the networks of defense-allied countries.   It also requires the General Accountability Office, or GAO, to report  on Chinese and Russian telecom suppliers serving U.S. embassies  overseas.   Finally, it tasks the State Department with identifying telecom  infrastructure projects that will strengthen U.S. national security,  and with helping countries currently being serviced by Chinese vendors  to build capacity for replacing those vendors.   I would hope by now that most U.S. officials understand the threats  to U.S. national security posed by tech companies controlled by the  Chinese Communist Party, like Huawei. But we must also ensure that our  allies and partners are not duped by the seemingly low cost of telecom  services provided by state-backed countries. While seemingly cheap, the  real cost lies in giving the CCP control over all of your  telecommunications data, which they will use to spread their malign  influence globally.   So I support the bill strongly, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Russia  Cryptocurrency Transparency Act, H.R. 7338, and I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this bipartisan legislation authored by Chairman Meeks  and Ranking Member McCaul would exercise oversight of the State  Department's use of cryptocurrency as part of its rewards program, as  well as measures to improve the efficacy and enforcement of U.S.  sanctions against Russia.   Emerging technologies like blockchain, the foundation for many  cryptocurrencies, offer immense opportunities. For example, people  around the world sent aid using cryptocurrency to those fleeing  Russia's full-scale barbaric invasion of Ukraine.   However, this bill will ensure that the U.S. is taking the necessary  steps to prevent these emerging technologies from undermining  sanctions, including those currently aimed at bankrupting Putin's war  machine.   While the rise of digital assets like cryptocurrencies promise  innovative financial opportunity, digital assets could be ripe for  abuse as Russia seeks to evade the unprecedented sanctions the United  States and Europe have imposed for Vladimir Putin's brutal war of  choice on Ukraine.                                time  1530    This legislation will provide greater oversight in the State  Department's rewards program, helping ensure that these hard-to-trace  funds are not falling into the hands of bad actors. It also will help  the State Department develop sanctions enforcement mechanisms to  prevent sanctions evasion through the use of cryptocurrencies.   Given the tremendous need for humanitarian support as Europe faces  the largest influx of refugees since World War II, this legislation  also asks the State Department to assess how crypto can be used to  support humanitarian assistance to Ukrainians fleeing the war.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support for the bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr.  Hill), who is the ranking member on the Financial Services Committee.  He is author of this important legislation, and in the past, Mr.  Speaker, he served under George Herbert Walker Bush as the Deputy  Assistant Secretary of Treasury. He also was the special assistant for  economic policy under 41, George Herbert Walker Bush, so he brings a  wealth of knowledge and information that we are blessed to have here in  this House.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend, French Hill, for authoring this  very, very important piece of legislation. It mandates an interagency  strategy on how the U.S. is responding to the destabilizing Captagon  drug trade in the Middle East.   Captagon, as I think my colleagues know, is a highly addictive  amphetamine that is fast becoming the most widely abused drug in the  Middle East. Given the growing threat Captagon poses to the stability  in the region and to individual human lives, the lack of resources  devoted to address its proliferation is alarming.   In addition to this drug trade creating a crisis along Jordan's  border, there is growing evidence that the murderous Assad regime is  deeply involved in Captagon trafficking. This narco trafficking fuels  Assad's war on the Syrian people and further threatens regional  stability. The administration clearly is not doing enough, as was  pointed out by my good friend and colleague, French Hill, to focus on  this threat, which is why we need this bill to admonish the  administration and to force the administration, the executive branch,  to acknowledge this problem and to respond to it.   The CAPTAGON Act will help ensure that we are countering this  destabilizing drug trade which is helping to bankroll one of the most  brutal tyrants of our time.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the resolution.   I would like to start off by thanking my good friend and colleague,  Ted Deutch, for not only introducing this important resolution but his  tremendous work during his tenure in the House, particularly in  combating anti-Semitism. There is no better friend of Israel than Ted  Deutch, and there is no better friend of the Jewish community that is  under siege here in the United States and around the world than Ted  Deutch.                                time  1545    He and I co-chaired the House Anti-Semitism Task Force. As we all  know, and many of my colleagues know, he is leaving on October 1 to  head up the American Jewish Committee, AJC.   What is AJC's gain is our loss, for Mr. Deutch has brought character  and leadership to this Congress, and he will be deeply missed, and I  thank him again for his very, very strong voice.   Mr. Speaker, as the Lebanese lira continues its downward decline,  Hizballah has become increasingly reliant on illicit criminal networks  across Europe to help finance their criminal enterprise.   Combating Hizballah's malign activity requires robust transatlantic  law enforcement cooperation. This can only take place once Hizballah is  designated as a terrorist organization in its entirety.   Recognizing an arbitrary distinction between Hizballah's political  and military wings gives Hizballah space to operate across Europe,  providing legal cover for its military wing to continue financing  terrorism through its political branch.   There is no distinction between Hizballah's political and military  wings--both serve the same ugly malign agenda that seeks to undermine  the stability of the Lebanese state, prop up the murderous dictatorship  of Bashar al-Assad, and threaten Israel's security.   Mr. Speaker, I welcome the recent steps taken by Germany and others  to designate Hizballah in full as a terrorist organization, and all of  the European Union needs to do likewise.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for  time, and I yield back the balance of my time.
