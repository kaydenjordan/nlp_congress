 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 195 which  continues funding the government through February 16. It pays our  troops and provides for a 6-year extension of the Children's Health  Insurance Program. Thirty-six percent of the children in my district  are covered under CHIP, and I am pleased to support this legislation to  ensure that they continue to have access to care that has been delayed  by obstructionist Democrats in this body and over in the Senate.    While I support passage of this bill, I want to draw attention to the  fact that there are other important provisions that have previously  passed this House, yet have fallen by the wayside as Members sought a  compromise on the final bill. I will go through those in a minute.   Again, I am pleased that we are passing a bill that continues funding  for the government, pays for our troops, and extends funding for the  CHIP program.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues, though, not to forget  other important health initiatives that must be addressed, and I hope  they will join me in seeing that these initiatives are again taken up  after passage of the bill. Those provisions that need to be considered  include two of my bills: first, the Youth Empowerment Act which  empowers youth to make healthy decisions; and secondly, language from  the Health Coverage State Flexibility Act also needs to be continued.
