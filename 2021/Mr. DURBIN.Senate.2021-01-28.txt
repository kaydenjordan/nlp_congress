 Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, this morning as I came to work in the  Capitol, I saw our National Guard troops outside. I wanted to thank  them, again, on behalf of the Senate and the people of America for  coming to our assistance during the inauguration ceremonies. Some are  still on the job, making sure that we maintain order in the streets of  Washington, DC, and that we conduct the business of the American people  here in the Capitol Building.   I want to thank them again, particularly the 270 National Guard  forces from my State of Illinois--I had a chance to meet many of them-- sacrificing time away from their families to serve their Nation. It was  a job well done.   For those who continue to do the work, we stand by you, and we thank  you again.   Heather Cox Richardson does a column each day that is really a source  of information that is important. She reminded us in her column this  morning about what happened here in this Capitol Building just 3 weeks  ago on January 6. Let me read what she said:         In testimony yesterday, the acting chief of the       Metropolitan Police Department in Washington told the House       Appropriations Committee that at least 65 officers filed       reports of injury after the January 6 attack. The chair of       the Capitol Police officers' union . . . put the number       closer to 140. ``I have officers who were not issued helmets       prior to the attack [and] who have sustained brain injuries.       One officer has two cracked ribs and two smashed spinal       discs. One officer is going to lose his eye, and another was       stabbed with a metal fence stake,'' he said. One officer died       of injuries sustained on January 6. Two officers have since       taken their own lives.    I want to put that in the Record because in a week, beginning with  the impeachment trial, we are going to reflect, again, on what happened  January 6.   Some of my colleagues, and many people on their side, are saying we  shouldn't spend time talking about what happened on January 6. In the  words of the former Governor of South Carolina, Nikki Haley, we ought  to ``get over it''--``get over it.'' It is hard to get over it when you  consider the facts that I just read into the Record. For the families  of those officers who lost their lives and those who were seriously  injured, they won't get over it for a long, long time.   I don't know what the impeachment trial will find in terms of the  role of the former President of the United States, but I believe it is  an important milestone in America's history for us to stop and recount  what actually happened in this building on January 6, where a mob,  incited by the President, stormed this Capitol, broke through, smashing  windows and doors, and literally took control of this Capitol Building  for several hours. Here in the Senate Chamber, we were evacuated. Thank  goodness, we returned that same evening to complete our business and  complete our work.   There is ample evidence of what happened that day by video,  photographs, and testimony. I hope it is part of the record in this  impeachment hearing so that this generation and future generations will  have no doubt what happened that day.   Already, we have those who are in denial, who are arguing that this  was really some far-left group that was taking over the demonstration-- a ludicrous argument on its face. And we have many who are in complete  denial that it happened or that it had anything to do with rightwing  politics. They are wrong. We saw it. We recorded it. We are going to  put it, in part, as part of the record so that America knows what  happened on that day.   Yesterday, we got a warning that this may not be the end of it, that  there may be more activity. Let me say at the outset that I condemn  extremism and violence on any part of the political spectrum. But  yesterday, the  [[Page S184]]  warning was to the right, who apparently are going to continue in their  efforts to disrupt life in America and endanger the lives of fellow  Americans and law enforcement officers.   We need to stand up as a nation and say, ``Enough.'' Whatever your  political strife, there is no room for extremism and violence in the  exercise of a constitutional responsibility or right.   I wanted to make that as part of the Record as an opening statement                            ____________________     Madam President, now, on another issue, this morning, I  went on a radio show in Bloomington-Normal, IL, WJBC, Scott Miller. The  topic de jour--no surprise--was the vaccines, the COVID-19 vaccines,  and why so many people in that part of Central Illinois can't get  access to vaccinations.   I listened to the frustration of people who called in to the  announcer about waiting on the phone for hours, trying to get through,  unable to make an appointment, and I called the Governor of Illinois,  JB Pritzker, to ask him what was happening. He gave me some numbers in  our part of the world, which probably reflect our country's status at  the moment.   He said that we were receiving 120,000 first doses of COVID-19  vaccine each week--120,000 a week. We have approximately 10 million  people eligible to be vaccinated in Illinois. Those under the age of 16  are excluded for reasons determined by medical professionals, so we  start with 10 million. We anticipate that at least 50 percent are  currently hoping to get a vaccine as quickly as a possible. So we have  to get 5 million people vaccinated in our State with two doses. There  are 10 million doses, and we are receiving 120,000 a week. Is it any  wonder that the new President, Joe Biden, has spoken up that we need to  obtain as quickly as possible new sources of COVID-19 vaccine in large  numbers? I support that completely.   As part of his request for the American Rescue Plan, which has come  before the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives, in that request he  spells out what he thinks are the priorities in this country, and I  believe he is correct.   We talk about $160 billion to provide the supplies, emergency  response, testing, and workforce for our country to stop the spread of  COVID-19. Could there be any higher priority?   There is $170 billion for schools and higher education so they can  safely reopen and operate. Any parent or grandparent knows how urgent  that need is.   There is $80 billion for paid leave. It includes 14 weeks of paid  family medical leave through the end of September. Certainly, people  need to have that option available either because of their own illness  or an illness in the family.   Direct payments--already $600 has gone out to many families in direct  payments. Another $1,400 per person has been promised. That is included  in the Biden proposal.   Unemployment insurance--we still are finding record numbers of people  who are filing for unemployment; $290 billion extends the current  benefits and eligibility and a $400 supplement per week until the end  of September. Rental assistance, SNAP benefits, childcare, relief to  families, such as the child tax credit--the list is lengthy, and I have  read through it carefully.   Should we do it? There are some who argue: No, we don't need more  stimulus. We have done all we need to do.   I have to disagree with that conclusion. The news this morning that  was alluded to by the Democratic leader suggests that we are not out of  the woods by a long shot when it comes to the state of the economy.   CNN reported this morning that the Donald Trump final economic report  card could be very underwhelming.         [For example,] the U.S. gross domestic product, the       broadest measure of economic activity, is forecast to have       grown at an annualized rate of 4% between October and       December [of last year].        In a normal year, that would be [cause for celebration]--an       A+. . . . But 2020 was no normal year.        America is still recovering from the worst economic shock       in living memory. [Our gross domestic product] shrank [by] a       record 31.4% on an annualized basis in the second quarter. .       . . [I]t came screaming back at a 33.4% annualized pace in       the third quarter, [but] that wasn't . . . enough to make up       for the damage [that was] already done.    I ask unanimous consent that this article be printed in the Record  with my statement   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                         [From CNN, Jan. 27, 2021]    Donald Trump's Final Economic Report Card Could Be Very Underwhelming         (By Anneken Tappe)        New York--Economists are grading on a curve. That's not a       good thing if you're former President Donald Trump.        US gross domestic product, the broadest measure of economic       activity, is forecast to have grown at an annualized rate of       4% between October and December.        In a normal year, that would be something to celebrate--an       A+ for Trump's final economic report card. But 2020 was no       normal year.        America is still recovering from the worst economic shock       in living memory. GDP shrank a record 31.4% on an annualized       basis in the second quarter. Though it came screaming back at       a record 33.4% annualized pace in the third quarter, that       wasn't nearly enough to make up for the damage already done.        So if 33.4% isn't good enough, 4% sure ain't gonna cut it,       either. It would get the nation only a small part of the way       back to its pre-pandemic strength--underscoring just how far       we still have to go.        It also doesn't bode well for the recovery in 2021. The US       economy's recovery took a hit in the last quarter of 2020 as       Covid-19 infections spiked and various states reintroduced       lockdown measures.                             A bad sign for 2021         President Joe Biden inherited an ailing recovery and a       broken jobs market. The new administration will need an all-      hands-on-deck approach to get the economy back on track this       year after the pandemic slammed on the breaks.        Rising infections and renewed restrictions on people and       businesses put a damper on hopes for the recovery in the       winter months.        The first quarter of 2021 ``is likely to be even weaker       with little reason to expect a sudden upswing in activity       until Covid restrictions are meaningfully eased,'' said James       Knightley, chief international economist at ING, even with       more help for the unemployed in place.        Biden will need to bring the pandemic under control first       to get the recovery on the right path.                       What's holding the economy back?         Economists have been concerned about the state of the       recovery for a while. Rising infections in the fall and a       renewed increase in weekly claims for jobless benefits       pointed to another rough patch for the economy in the winter.        On the consumer and spending front, retail sales logged       three straight months without any growth between October and       December as big shopping events like Black Friday and       Christmas failed to provide an adequate boost. And the       University of Michigan's survey-based consumer sentiment       index remained still far below its pre-pandemic level and       declined again after its most recent peak in October.        Millions of Americans remain unemployed because of the       crisis, and in December, the economy shed 140,000 jobs--a       major setback for the recovery. It was the first net job loss       since April.        The US economy runs on consumer spending and for as long as       Americans don't spend the way they used to--be it because of       unemployment, lockdowns or plain caution--it will keep the       recovery pace slow.        The rollout of vaccines and ultimate control of the virus       is what will truly transport the economy back to its pre-      pandemic strength, economists believe. But only about 23.5       million vaccine doses have been administered in the United       States so far.        Meanwhile, those who lost their jobs or had their hours or       pay reduced because of the pandemic still require help from       the government.        Trump signed a second stimulus package into law in       December, which extended various programs to continue helping       the jobless. But many economists believe the delay in getting       more measures passed hurt the pace of the recovery.        President Biden's economic agenda includes more stimulus       still, but whether his $1.9 trillion plan will get passed in       its original form remains to be seen.    The statistics are devastating, as well, when it comes to  the number of people filing for unemployment--recordbreaking numbers-- and those are included in this article as well.   So we are counseled by the new Treasury Secretary, Janet Yellen,  approved by this body, that we shouldn't take our foot off the  accelerator for fear that this economy will bog down again. Businesses  will find it difficult to survive--even open--and their employees, of  course, will be without work. We need to get this economy roaring back,  and that means making the investment that President Biden is asking  for.   Similarly, we need to get our kids back in school. I know most  parents would feel that is true, grandparents as  [[Page S185]]  well. And the sooner we do it, the better, but do it safely--safely for  the teachers, administrators, and everyone involved in that decision.   It is hard to imagine what we have been through in the last calendar  year, the year 2020. I am glad it is behind us.   We will still have many challenges ahead, but it is hard to believe  that just 1 year ago this week, in the State of Illinois, we confirmed  our first case of coronavirus--1 year ago. A patient had returned from  China to suburban Chicago and transmitted the virus to her husband. She  was treated successfully, as was her husband.   But in the 365 days since then that transpired, 1.1 million COVID-19  cases occurred in my State of Illinois--from one person a year ago, 1.1  million cases--and almost 19,000 Illinoisans have died. The story is  repeated in every State and every community. What started as a worry  ended up becoming a pandemic and one of the deadliest in American  history.   Last year, I came to the floor to ask unanimous consent for a  resolution with a simple message, that the United States should work  with other nations around the world to address the COVID-19 pandemic.  It seemed like a commonsense proposition. To think that one case in  Wuhan, China, has led us to where we are today tells us that this is a  shrinking world.   We need to tackle that deadly communicable disease because it knows  no boundaries. No nation is safe from COVID-19 if it is raging in any  part of the world. Equally, no nation's economy is immune from the  impacts of the pandemic raging elsewhere.   I am glad the Senate eventually passed the resolution that I  introduced, affirming the need to join with others in fighting the  pandemic.   Now, the first priority is obvious: Take care of the American people  and American families and everyone who lives in our Nation. That is the  first and highest priority for our elected officials at every single  level.   We are now debating a measure to help the American people gain access  to vaccines--the Biden rescue plan--and the harsh economic impact it  has had on America. President Biden understands the immediacy of these  needs, and I hope that we in Congress do as well.   As we respond to the COVID-19 crisis in America, though, we cannot  ignore the need for a global response. This isn't a matter of being  charitable. It is in our national interest and a reflection of our  values to ensure that poorer nations have access to vaccines and tools  to manage their impact.   The New York Times columnist Nick Kristof chronicled this problem in  a powerful piece earlier this month, entitled ``Starving Children Don't  Cry.'' He noted that while some developing countries may have avoided  high COVID death tolls, the pandemic has led, in many places, to what  he calls ``pandemics of hunger, disease and illiteracy.'' Day laborers  can't find work. Campaigns to address malaria, polio, AIDS, and  malnutrition have been disrupted. It is estimated that hundreds of  thousands of children in the developing world will die from  malnutrition. Many who survive will face lifetimes of disabilities.   A study by the International Chamber of Commerce found that the  global cost of unequal global vaccine distribution will hit affluent  countries almost as hard as developing countries.   The study showed what would happen if wealthy nations were fully  vaccinated by the middle of the year but poor countries shut out, a  likely scenario.   This week, the World Health Organization noted that only 1 of 29 low- income countries has begun vaccination, and in that particular country  of Guinea, only 55 out of 12 million people have been reached.   The study concluded that the global economy could lose more than $9  trillion, with nearly half of those costs absorbed by the United States  and other wealthy countries.   We are already seeing how illness in poor nations affects us. U.S.  exports have plunged by nearly 28 percent in the last 6 months,  resulting in lost jobs here, lower profits, and lower wages.   So that is why I am reintroducing legislation to direct the U.S.  Treasury to use its vote at the International Monetary Fund to release  what are known as special drawing rights. These are foreign exchange  reserve assets maintained by the IMF that can be used by developing  nations during severe economic downturns, as done during the 2008  global financial crisis.   A release of these special drawing rights would not cost American  taxpayers a single dollar, but they would help developing nations  purchase and distribute COVID vaccines and stem the pandemic's economic  impact overseas.   This proposal is supported by a broad coalition, including American  farm leaders, business leaders, and trade associations, leading  economists, faith groups, labor unions, and humanitarian groups.   I want to thank my cosponsors in this effort: Senators Sanders,  Cardin, Reed, Merkley, and Leahy. We are joined in the House by my  colleague from Illinois, Congressman Chuy Garcia.   Three-quarters of a century ago, much of the world lay in ruins as a  result of a global war. The United States made an unprecedented  commitment to help the nations of the world rise from the ashes of  World War II and rebuild. We did so because it was in keeping with our  moral beliefs and it served our political and economic interests.   The Marshall Plan and other international aid efforts by the United  States helped make America the most powerful Nation on Earth,  politically and economically. This global crisis, COVID-19, gives us  another opportunity to strengthen America as we help repair a damaged  world.   Of course, our first priority is American families, and this effort  would not take a single dollar away from buying the vaccines that are  necessary to keep our Nation safe. But by using these special drawing  rights, we provide resources to some of the poorest nations around the  world so that they, too, can start vaccinating their population.   This world got sick, we believe, because of one person in China, and  it spread around the world. That is, at least, the theory that has been  backed up by evidence so far. So let's make certain that, as we address  this issue, we do it on a global basis.   I urge the Senate to support this measure as a way to not only do the  right thing for our less fortunate brothers and sisters around the  world but as a way to help our own pandemic and economic recovery.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    I announce that the Senator from Virginia (Mr. Warner) is  necessarily absent.
