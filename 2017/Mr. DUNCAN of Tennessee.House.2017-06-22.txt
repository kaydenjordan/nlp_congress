 Mr. Speaker, for 7\1/2\ years before coming  to Congress, I was a judge in Tennessee trying felony criminal cases. I  tried the attempted murder of James Earl Ray and many other high- profile cases.   Robert Mueller, with his close relationship with James Comey, should  never have been appointed as special prosecutor in a case in which Mr.  Comey is such a central player. Mr. Mueller should never have accepted  such an appointment when offered. That would have been the honorable  thing to do.   Then, to make matters much worse, he has hired several lawyers who  are big contributors to and are active campaigners for Hillary Clinton  and other Democrats.   Most people believe there are many conflicts of interest here. There  are hundreds of thousands of lawyers who could have been hired who had  not been involved in any way for either the President or Mrs. Clinton.   This investigation has been tainted, and any action now will look  like a partisan witch hunt. Former Speaker Gingrich said what we now  need is a special counsel to investigate the special counsel.                            ____________________
