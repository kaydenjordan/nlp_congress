 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of the late  Jan Allen, an extraordinary North Carolinian and a personal friend.   Jan was a trailblazer who worked tirelessly to level the playing  field for women in politics in North Carolina, and she did a tremendous  job at her work.   Twenty-two years ago, she founded Lillian's List to get more women  elected to political office at the State level. I had the great  privilege of working with Jan during my time in the North Carolina  General Assembly over those 21 years. I had the great privilege of  working with Jan during my time throughout Congress, as well.   There is no way to qualify the impact that Jan had on the State of  North Carolina, but I know that, because of Jan, more women have held  office in the State and more women are continuing to run.   Thanks to Jan, laws have been passed to improve the lives of women,  families, and children, and North Carolina is a better place to live  for everyone.   My thoughts and prayers will continue to be with Jan's family, her  friends, and my entire North Carolina community. I thank Jan Allen for  her work, and may the Lord continue to bless her and her family.                            ____________________
