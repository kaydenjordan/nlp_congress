 Mr. President, it is of the utmost importance that we  recognize that the Balkan region is critical to U.S. interests in  Europe due to the implications in the region surrounding security,  counterterrorism, cyber security, and implementation of 5G. It is a  strategically significant region and a primary target of Russian malign  influence.   Each year I have the honor of hosting a Balkan Roundtable Security  Forum with leaders from the Balkans and Members of Congress. NATO's  role in southeastern Europe is critical for the support of our  interests in the region. Integration of the Balkans into NATO, the EU,  and other partnerships with our friends in the region has long been an  important goal, given the mounting threat posed by Russians continued  behavior. In a time where our strategic competitors are seeking to  expand their influence, it is critical that our friends in the Balkan  region know that the United States is here to support them and work  together to counter our common foes.   It is clearly stated in the President's National Security Strategy,  the National Defense Strategy, and the National Military Strategy that  Europe and the Trans-Atlantic NATO Alliance are paramount to our  national security, and this includes the integration of our allies on  the Balkan Peninsula. We have made significant strides in adapting our  capabilities in many areas, including cyber, to meet the growing  threats in the region, but we must continue to work with our partners  to counter the evolving threats from Russia and China and preserve a  Europe that is whole, free, and at peace.                            ____________________
