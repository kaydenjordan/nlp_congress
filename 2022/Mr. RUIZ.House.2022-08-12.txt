 Madam Speaker, as a doctor, I have taken care of many  patients who put their lives and health at risk because they couldn't  afford their medication, patients who either ration their medicine or  didn't get a prescription filled at all.   I will never forget one woman who was so proud to tell me that she  was able to make her insulin last longer because she would only take  half a dose at a time in order to make it last. This is unacceptable.   No one should have to choose between whether to take their medicine  and put food on their table or between their health and not being able  to pay their bills.   That is why I support the Inflation Reduction Act, which will give  seniors the relief that they need from skyrocketing drug costs. It  ensures that people on Medicare with diabetes won't have to pay more  than $35 a month for their insulin. It requires the Secretary of HHS to  negotiate drug prices for expensive Medicare drugs, lowering costs for  seniors and people with disabilities, and it caps out-of-pocket  spending at $2,000 per year for Medicare part D.    These important steps will help ensure that all seniors have access  to lifesaving and health-saving medications, regardless of how much  money they have.  [[Page H7682]]    That is not all this bill does. This bill will make transformational  investments to combat climate change and reduce our carbon emissions.  It will push automakers to make their electric vehicle batteries with  domestic materials, like the lithium we are extracting at the southern  end of the Salton Sea in Imperial County.   With this bill and the lithium in my district, we can power our clean  energy future here in America with American materials.
