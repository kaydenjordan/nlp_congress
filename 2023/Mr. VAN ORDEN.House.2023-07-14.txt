 Mr. Chairman, today I rise in opposition of amendment  No. 3 in the en bloc.   I have tremendous respect for Chairmen Green and Rogers, and I also  view the Chinese Communist Party as a threat to world peace.   I believe the unintended consequences of this amendment will have a  greater negative financial impact on our junior enlisted servicemen who  shop at our base exchanges than on the Chinese Communist Party.   Our junior enlisted currently struggle financially, and  implementation of this amendment will unintentionally raise the cost of  everyday goods and further exacerbate this strain.   Mr. Chair, for this reason alone, I urge my colleagues to oppose this  amendment.
