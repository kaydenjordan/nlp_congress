 Madam Speaker, I rise to address an  impending disaster that is about to face patient care in this country.   Not just 2 years ago in this country, physicians were hailed as  heroes for risking their lives to save others during the pandemic. Now,  when other professions are being given large raises, doctors are facing  double digit Medicare cuts beginning in January.   As a surgeon of 30 years, I can say without a doubt that these cuts  will either force practices to close or severely restrict the number of  Medicare patients who will be seen. The constant attack on physicians  who see Medicare patients has to stop.   At present, the cost of seeing a Medicare patient exceeds its  reimbursement. That is why most internal medicine practices will not  see new Medicare patients.   The constant threat to Medicare needs to stop. We have a growing and  aging population. We need to provide some certainty to doctors and  hospitals if they are going to be able to plan to take care of these  Medicare patients.   Madam Speaker, we cannot end this session without a Medicare fix.                            ____________________
