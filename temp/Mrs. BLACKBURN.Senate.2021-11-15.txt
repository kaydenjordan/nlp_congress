 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, last week, the Senate passed the  Sergeant First Class Sean Cooley and Specialist Christopher Horton  Congressional Gold Star Family Fellowship Program Act.   I would like to thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who  lent their support, because creation of this program was a long time  coming.   I have spent the past few years working with and talking with Gold  Star families, and the one thing they have consistently told me is that  they want a more powerful voice here on Capitol Hill.   This legislation will create a Senate fellowship program open only to  Gold Star family members. These fellows will have the opportunity to  come to Washington, at no cost to their families, and work within the  system our servicemembers work so very hard to defend.   And, Madam President, we thank you for your service in defense of  this Nation.   Just as we here in the Senate are bound together by a duty to serve  the country, Gold Star families are also bound together by a common  thread of loss, grief, sacrifice.   It has been my privilege to work with so many of them, and I hope  that these fellowships will create a renewed sense of healing and  purpose in the hearts of those who come to work with us here in  Washington.    Madam President, as I have been saying, it has been  so difficult to get people to realize what we are facing from the  Chinese Communist Party. They are an adversary, and seeing the evidence  of genocide in Xinjiang didn't seem to be enough to persuade people.   Then you have the reports that Beijing manipulated multiple  international organizations when it comes to the origins of the COVID- 19 virus. That wasn't enough.   Hearing the Chinese officials threaten our pharmaceutical and medical  supply chains in the midst of a pandemic--that didn't seem to be  enough.   Watching in horror as the Chinese Communist Party threatened the Hong  Kong freedom fighters and as they have threatened our friends in  Taiwan--that didn't seem to raise the attention for them that this is  not our friend.   They are not a competitor. They are an adversary.   We have seen these effects of the Belt and Road Initiative on the  global balance of power. They still haven't said: We have to deal with  China.   Not even Beijing going out here and pushing their nuclear power has  seemed to push some of our colleagues across the aisle, as they have  not paid attention to what is happening with our nuclear deterrent  capabilities and what China is doing.   So it leads a lot of Tennesseans that I talk to say: What is it going  to take for Joe Biden and his administration to take these global  threats seriously?   If you look at what is going on in China and that doesn't do it, are  you looking at Iran? Are you looking at Russia and how they are  posturing troops on the Ukrainian border?   What is finally going to get them to say: China is an adversary, the  new ``axis of evil''--with Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea. These  are adversaries. They are intent on global dominance and taking us  down.   You know, and I have to tell the Presiding Officer, I think that the  answer to that question, if we look at these threats, it really  frightens a lot of people.   When I talk to our veterans, as I did last week, many of them--it  frightens them when they see the nonchalance in attitude of this  administration as we talk about these issues that are threatening our  Nation's security and freedom at home and abroad. When you talk about  inflation, when you talk about crime in the streets, when you talk  about what is happening in our schools, when you talk about what is  happening globally, people see this as a threat to their life here.  They see it as a threat to our security abroad.   My hope is that what we will see is real governance and real  leadership that will come from the Senate. And also we would like to  see this come from the administration, that people would see decisions  made in good faith, not decisions made in bad faith or trying to  dismantle the institutions of this government.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
