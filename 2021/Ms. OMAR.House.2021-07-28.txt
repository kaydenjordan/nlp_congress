 Madam Speaker, I thank the chairwoman for her leadership  and for including my amendment in the en bloc.   Madam Speaker, as a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, I travel  around the world and hear so many of our diplomats emphasize the  importance of balancing development, diplomacy, and defense. But in so  many places, I don't see that balance.   My amendment is about restoring balance to our foreign policy by  moving away from military assistance and arms sales and toward  development and addressing the root causes of conflict.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this en bloc.
