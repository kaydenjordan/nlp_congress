 Madam Speaker, today, there is a discussion  going on as to whether or not we should be voting on the build back  broke plan that is being proposed by the Democrats.   I have asked for a score from the Congressional Budget Office to find  out what is actually in this bill and what it is going to cost American  taxpayers. We have heard the phrase before, ``we will vote on it and  then you can find out what is in it.'' But the reality is that Members  of Congress don't even know what is in this reconciliation package that  is being presented.   How in good conscience could we actually pass something that is going  to be fiscally damaging to the country and putting the cost of it on  the backs of hardworking taxpayers across this country? We need to know  what is in this reconciliation package that is being proposed.   I ask for Speaker Pelosi to request a CBO score, and that this bill  be voted on after that is presented to the Members of Congress.                            ____________________
