 Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that  requires the Secretary of Agriculture to conduct a study on the  establishment of, and the potential land that could be included in, a  unit of the National Forest System in the State of Hawaii.   The U.S. Forest Service currently oversees more than 150 National  forests that receive Federal funding for watershed protection, wildlife  conservation, enhancement of recreational access, wildfire prevention,  among other things. Despite having unique forest ecosystems found  nowhere else in the Nation, Hawaii is currently among the few States  that do not have a National Forest. If warranted, a National Forest  designation in Hawaii could provide additional Federal research and  management resources.   This bill directs the U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary,  acting through the Chief of the U.S. Forest Service, to conduct a study  in coordination with the Hawaii Department of Land and Natural  Resources, and in consultation with the Hawaii Department of  Agriculture as well as other State and local stakeholders, on the  islands of Hawaii, Oahu, Kauai, Molokai, Lanai, and Maui.   This study would, among other things, assess unique vegetation types,  opportunities to improve and protect forest resources, secure favorable  water flows, and opportunities for visitor use.   The Secretary of Agriculture is given three years to conduct the  study and report the results to Congress. Information from that report  will then inform which lands in Hawaii, if any, would be suitable for  inclusion in a National Forest. This bill is supported by the Hawaii  Department of Land and Natural Resources.                                  ______                                         By Ms. COLLINS (for herself and Ms. Cantwell):   S. 557. A bill to establish a pilot program for native plant species,  and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural  Resources.
