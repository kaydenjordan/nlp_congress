 Mr. President, I am sure you have been to Paris. The  architect, as you undoubtedly know, who designed the Louvre's iconic  glass pyramid was actually an American. He was an Asian American. His  name was I.M. Pei. Mr. Pei emigrated from China to the United States in  the 1930s.   By the time he passed at the age of 102, he had designed a number of  famous buildings. He had done that all across the world, including on  U.S. soil, including the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library.   America is proud of Mr. Pei. He is just one of millions of Asian  Americans whose talents have helped America continue to be an  exceptional nation, a nation made up of exceptional people who take  advantage of all of the opportunities that these United States have to  offer.   The contributions of individual Asian Americans have helped our  country pioneer--and the Presiding Officer knows this--advances in  architecture, in medicine, in art, and in technology. But, more than  that, Asian Americans are our friends, and they are our neighbors.   The recent murder of Asian-American women in an evil assault in  Atlanta was an assault not just on the Atlanta community but on the  United States of America. President Biden has correctly denounced these  attacks, and he is not alone.   I know the Presiding Officer can join me in this. I condemn these  evil murders in the strongest possible terms. No one can justify--no  one--the brutal theft of eight lives. Every community--every single  one--across our country is grieving for the victims and is grieving for  the families.   These victims were all made, they were each made, in God's image, and  Americans know that. I also feel the same way about the shooting in  Boulder. We all do.   America pioneered government that is based on inalienable rights that  God gives each person. God has imbued every man and woman with dignity,  and Americans answer that dignity with respect, respect for each  individual and their right to make the most of the manifold  opportunities our country offers.   Unfortunately, President Biden's rhetoric in defense of the Asian- American community is not altogether matched by respect for the right  of Asian Americans to reap the reward of their talent and grit.   The Biden administration, thus far--it has time to correct its  course--has shown and did show right out of the gate a determination to  stick its head in the sand while some of America's top universities are  actively discriminating against Asian Americans.   Last year, as the Presiding Officer knows, the Justice Department  sued Yale University. The Justice Department contended that Yale  rejected many qualified Asian-American applicants on the basis of  race--not on the basis of qualification, on the basis of race.   The decision by the Justice Department came 2 years after several  Asian-American organizations filed a complaint with the Department of  Justice  [[Page S1701]]  and the Department of Education that accused Yale of what I just  described: racial discrimination.   Yet only a few weeks--only a few weeks after President Biden set up  shop in the Oval Office, the Department of Justice withdrew its own  lawsuit based on racial discrimination against Yale University, and  that is an actual fact. Watch what we say, not what we do.   Unfortunately, Harvard University also seems determined to  discriminate against Asian-American applicants. In 2014, Students for  Fair Admissions sued Harvard, claiming that the school was using an  application system that intentionally reduces the number of Asian  Americans through evaluations that are subjective and potentially  racially biased.   You see, Harvard apparently believes it knows how to discriminate in  the right way. It believed the same thing a number of years ago when it  limited the number of Jewish people who could attend Harvard.   When Harvard considers an applicant, the school doesn't just look at  their grades or their test scores or their academic awards. In fact,  the admissions team at Harvard often looks past these objective  indicators to a student's--this is what Harvard calls it--personal  ratings, which is an unfair, ridiculous, and a subjective standard.   These personal ratings, as Harvard calls them, supposedly take into  account character traits like humor, sensitivity, helpfulness, and  courage. For years, Harvard has consistently granted lower personal  ratings scores to Asian Americans than it has to other applicants, and  that, too, is a fact.   The judge in the Students for Fair Admissions' lawsuit wrote the  following:         The data demonstrates--    These are the judge's words, not mine.         The data demonstrates a statistically significant and       negative relationship between Asian American identity and the       personal rating assigned by Harvard admissions officers,       holding constant any reasonable set of observable       characteristics.    I didn't say that; the judge in the case did.   Now, I want to be fair. It may look smart or wise for Harvard to look  for well-rounded applicants--I get that--until you realize and think  about that these personal ratings are not just subjective; they are  subversive. If you think about it, the scores, these scores--they are  not objective like test scores or grades or extracurricular activities;  these personal ratings are value judgments that can easily be tainted  by racial bias. It is clear that the personal ratings minimize the  accomplishments of Asian Americans in particular.   Just look at the numbers. Harvard's admission scores work like this:  They use a scale of 1 to 6. One is the strongest possible rating. When  it comes to personal ratings--remember, this is the subjective analysis  of the personhood of the applicant by Harvard, not the test scores, not  the grades, not the extracurricular activities. When it comes to  personal ratings, only 17.6 percent of Asian-American applicants  receive a score of 1 or 2--17.6 for Asian Americans. For African  Americans, that number is 19.01 percent. For Hispanic Americans, it is  18.7 percent. In fact--and these are the numbers--Harvard gives Asian  Americans the weakest personal ratings of any ethnic group, bar none.   Harvard admissions officials have reportedly handed out these scores  without even interviewing all of the candidates in question--personal  ratings without interviewing the applicants. This happens now despite  the fact that Asian Americans have the highest grades and test scores.  So on the objective criteria--test scores, grades--Asian Americans have  the highest scores. What pulls them down? The personal ratings.   Harvard officials admitted in 2013 that if Harvard considered only  academic achievement, then proportional Asian-American representation  that year would have doubled. Think about that. If Harvard went on the  objective criteria--extracurricular activities, grades, test scores-- twice as many Asian Americans would have been admitted to the  university. Why weren't they? Because of the personal ratings. They  call it ``personal'' even though many of the applicants are never even  interviewed.   The Department of Justice has historically supported the Students for  Fair Admissions lawsuit. In 2018, the Justice Department filed a  statement of interest in the case. Last year, the Justice Department  filed an amicus brief in the case. A Federal judge ruled against the  plaintiffs in 2019 in the case. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the First  Circuit upheld that decision last November--this despite the fact that  the Federal district court judge in the case openly acknowledged that  Harvard grants lower personal ratings scores to Asian-American  applicants.   The fruits of Harvard's policy are pretty clear. You don't have to be  Mensa material to figure this out. The Ivy League school has repeatedly  rejected highly qualified Asian-American candidates because of their  race.   But there is still hope for justice for our Asian-American students.  The Supreme Court may well take up this case, and the White House could  defend the cause of merit against Harvard's alleged racial  discrimination.   So let me say this as clearly as I can. If President Biden--if the  Biden team is committed to fighting racial discrimination against Asian  Americans, if President Biden and his team want to lift up Asian  Americans, as they say they do, it is not hard to see how countering  racist policies within the privileged halls of Harvard--a school that  receives Federal dollars--it is not hard to see how supporting that  litigation must be part of President Biden's commitment. So today, with  all the respect I can muster, I am calling on President Biden and his  Justice Department to support the Asian-American students who have  brought their case against Harvard.   Harvard is an extraordinary school. Nothing I say is meant to  denigrate the quality of that great university. But being a pillar of  higher education doesn't mean that Harvard is above the law. I.M. Pei  attended Harvard in the 1940s. Who knows if they would accept him today  because of his personal rating. You know, that is a shame, and it  shouldn't stand.   President Biden should stand up for the rights of Asian Americans to  be treated fairly by America's schools. His Justice Department should  support this lawsuit.   To be is to act. All we are is the sum of our actions. Everything  else is just conversation. Don't just talk about supporting Asian  Americans; do it. Do it. Please don't be selective in the reality you  choose to accept.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
