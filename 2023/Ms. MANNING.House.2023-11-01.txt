 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, Representative  Schneider, for yielding me time.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bipartisan House resolution  that I helped introduce with the House Foreign Affairs Committee  chairman,  Mike McCaul, and Representative Schneider and others to make  clear that the United States will never tolerate Iran acquiring a  nuclear weapon.   Iran is the principle source of instability in the region. It is a  major threat to our interests and remains the world's leading sponsor  of terrorism, supporting terrorist groups like Hamas in their brutal  quest to destroy our ally Israel.   On October 7 we witnessed the gruesome results of Iran's support for  Hamas. This is the kind of terror that Iran facilitates.   An armed Iran with a nuclear weapon would represent an even greater,  entirely unacceptable threat to Israel and the world.   For the past few years, Iran has flagrantly violated the terms of the  nuclear deal, blown past restrictions, continued to enrich uranium to  dangerous levels, bringing it closer than ever to being able to produce  nuclear weapons.  [[Page H5189]]  That is why this resolution emphasizes that it is U.S. policy to  prevent a nuclear armed Iran, as President Biden himself has made  clear, and to support our partners and allies like Israel in the face  of such an existential threat. Sending a clear message that Iran cannot  acquire a nuclear weapon is about deterring Iran, not seeking  confrontation or war with them.   Colleagues on both sides of the aisle should agree that it is  absolutely in our interest to restrain Iran's nuclear ambitions, and it  is in the interest of a more stable, secure, and peaceful region.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to vote in support of the  resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I am proud to speak in support of H.R. 340,  the Hamas International Financing Prevention Act, a bipartisan bill  introduced by Representatives Brian Mast and Josh Gottheimer to impose  sanctions on the terrorist group Hamas.   On October 7, we woke in horror to find Hamas' brutal and despicable  terrorist attacks, firing rockets at innocent civilians, storming the  Israeli border, invading Israel, going house to house, murdering  babies, executing parents in front of their children, massacring 260  young people at a music festival. Hamas killed 31 U.S. citizens and  more than 1,400 Israelis while taking hundreds of innocent people  hostage in Gaza, including babies and toddlers.   Hamas terrorists are not militants. They are not freedom fighters.  They are not a civil resistance movement. They are a brutal foreign  terrorist organization which is dedicated to the destruction of Israel  and the murder of Jews.   It is no secret that this is their goal. It is plainly stated in  Hamas' founding charter. It is also important to recognize that Hamas  has no regard for the lives of innocent Palestinian civilians in Gaza,  the very people they rule over, who suffer under Hamas. Let there be no  mistake. Hamas bears responsibility for their pain as well.    All countries around the world should join the U.S. in demanding  Hamas immediately release all the hostages currently held in Gaza. I am  grateful that the Biden administration has imposed additional sanctions  on senior Hamas officials and their financial backers. We need to  continue to bring pressure to bear on Hamas and cut off their flow of  resources.   That is why this legislation would impose sanctions on foreign  entities that provide material and financial support to Hamas and  Islamic jihad, while also providing for important humanitarian  exemptions.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues for their work on this bill, and I  urge all my colleagues to join me in supporting it.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, Representative Brad  Schneider, for yielding me time.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bipartisan resolution that I  reintroduced with Congressman Brad Schneider and colleagues on both  sides of the aisle.   This resolution, originally introduced by former Congressman Ted  Deutch and passed by the House last Congress, urges the European Union  to designate Hezbollah in its entirety as a terrorist organization.   Mr. Speaker, the terrorist group Hezbollah is a linchpin of Iran's  axis of resistance and is responsible for thousands of civilian deaths  in the Middle East and around the globe, including the 1983 Marine  Corps barracks bombing in Beirut and the 1994 AMIA Jewish community  center bombing in Buenos Aires, Argentina.   Until 9/11, Hezbollah had killed more Americans than any other  terrorist group. Today, it maintains an arsenal of 150,000 rockets  aimed at Israel.   In recent weeks, Hezbollah has fired upon Israel, threatening to open  up a second front in the war along Israel's northern border, risking a  wider regional confrontation and putting civilians in Lebanon at risk.   Given these facts, it is incomprehensible that any EU member state  can credibly assert any distinction between Hezbollah's so-called  military and political wings.   The truth is, there is one unified Hezbollah, and it is dedicated to  carrying out terrorist activities around the world. That is why this  bipartisan resolution calls on our partners in the EU to take a  stronger stand against worldwide terrorism by designating Hezbollah as  a whole as a terrorist organization.   We must continue to keep pressure on Hezbollah, Hamas, and all other  terrorist groups that threaten the United States and our ally Israel,  and that undermine peace, security, and stability throughout the region  and around the world.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support for this bipartisan measure.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, Representative Brad  Schneider, for yielding me time.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to support H.R. 3266, the Peace and Tolerance  in Palestinian Education Act, bipartisan legislation I cosponsored,  introduced by Representatives Brad Sherman and Brian Mast.   Mr. Speaker, this bill is necessary because we continue to see the  use of textbooks and other educational materials in schools run by the  PA and UNRWA containing anti-Israel content which perpetuates anti- Semitism, victimhood, and martyrdom, erases Israel from the map, and  even glorifies violence and terrorism.   Children in the West Bank and Gaza deserve the chance to learn  without using textbooks that are biased, promote intolerance, and  demonize or mischaracterize Israel.   That is why this bill would require the State Department to  investigate, report to Congress, and make publicly available important  information about the content of the curriculum used in these schools.   The PA and UNRWA have a responsibility to address and remove  problematic content in textbooks that violates the U.N.'s own  principles of neutrality and tolerance.   We know that no child is born to hate. They have to be carefully  taught. Educational materials that teach them hate by demonizing Israel  only make it harder to resolve the conflict and achieve lasting peace.   In closing, Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support this  important bipartisan bill that I am proud to cosponsor.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution. I thank  my colleague, Representative Burgess Owens, for sponsoring this  resolution condemning support for terrorism and anti-Semitism on  college campuses.   Anti-Semitism is a persistent, shape-shifting hatred that is an  affront to our values as Americans. It should be condemned by all. It  has no place on college campuses and universities or in our society.   I am committed to countering anti-Semitism in all its forms as a co- chair of the House Bipartisan Task Force for Combating Anti-Semitism  and as a member of the Education and the Workforce Committee.   Tragically, anti-Semitism is on the rise across the United States and  around the world. We have witnessed a particularly disturbing increase  in anti-Semitic incidents at colleges and universities. According to  the Anti-Defamation League, anti-Semitic incidents on college and  university campuses increased by 40 percent from 2021 to 2022.   Since the horrific terrorist attacks by Hamas against Israel on  October 7, we have witnessed an even greater increase in incidents and  threats targeting Jewish students across the country--by some accounts,  a 400 percent increase.   Students at Cooper Union were barricaded inside a library building.  Shocking anti-Israel messages were projected onto a building at George  Washington University. Just yesterday, a Cornell University student was  arrested and charged for posting horrifying threats online targeting  Jewish students on campus, threatening to shoot up the kosher dining  hall, and calling for Jewish students to be eliminated.   It is also deeply disturbing to witness student-led demonstrations  and rallies excusing and glorifying the terrorism or expressing  sympathy for foreign terrorist organizations like Hamas and Hezbollah,  groups whose driving ideology is anti-Semitic and which are dedicated  to the destruction of Israel.    College and university leaders have a moral responsibility to make  clear that they reject hatred, violence, and anti-Semitism, to hold  those responsible for these acts accountable, and to prevent a hostile  and intimidating environment for Jewish students, faculty, and staff.   I am grateful for the Biden administration's commitment to fully  enforce Federal civil rights law prohibiting anti-Semitic  discrimination and to take steps, including those outlined in the  ``U.S. National Strategy to Counter Anti-Semitism,'' to combat the rise  of anti-Semitism in higher education.   Congress should also make clear that we condemn terrorism, anti- Semitism, and violence and that we remain committed to protecting all  students.   Madam Speaker, colleges and universities are places where students  learn from one another and where they decide who they want to become in  life. We can respect and uphold Americans' free speech and First  Amendment rights without tolerating discrimination and hate. No matter  what your opinion is on foreign policy or any other issue, it does not  excuse or give anyone a license to engage in hate against any group.   When anti-Semitism and bias against Jews take hold on campus, it  deprives students of their equal right to an education and harms  everyone in the campus community.  [[Page H5203]]    That is why I am proud to support this resolution condemning support  for terrorism and anti-Semitism on campuses and calling for protections  against hate targeting Jews, just as we should for all Americans of any  background who are facing increased threats.   Madam Speaker, I encourage all of my colleagues to support this  resolution, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I acknowledge that my colleague is standing against  anti-Semitism and that he introduced a measure to require the teaching  of the Holocaust. I also introduced an amendment at that same hearing.  My amendment would have prohibited the banning by schools and school  districts of books about the Holocaust because school districts across  the country are banning books like ``The Diary of a Young Girl'' by  Anne Frank and the award-winning graphic novel ``Maus'' because they  found those books too disturbing.   This is exactly what we should be talking about in our hearings, that  we should be teaching students the history of the Holocaust using  award-winning books because these are the perfect vehicles for making  sure that students understand what has happened when anti-Semitism has  been allowed to go unchallenged.   I thank my colleague for raising this issue in today's setting and  hope they will continue to support efforts to avoid the banning of  books on the Holocaust.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume  for the purpose of closing.   For the past 2 weeks, I have been inundated with phone calls, emails,  and texts from frantic parents and terrified students who have  experienced online hate, taunting from their fellow students, exposure  to swastikas on their dorm walls and doors, chants of death to Israel  and Jews, and seeing those words chalked on campus walkways. These  students sat through anti-Israel and anti-Semitism rants by professors  who were supposed to be teaching them, not spreading anti-Israel  propaganda.    Rallies were held by students and others who are ignorant about the  history of the Middle East and ignorant about the 2,000-year history of  anti-Semitism.   Our education system is failing us, and we are seeing it come alive  on our college campuses. We are seeing that failure at some of the most  illustrious institutions in my State of North Carolina and at my own  alma mater in Cambridge, Massachusetts.   We are seeing the failure and inability of university presidents and  university chancellors--people who are able to take the simple step of  condemning terrorism against Israel and of condemning the gruesome  attack by Hamas on innocent Israeli civilians and the taking of  hostages--to simply call out and condemn anti-Semitism.   They do this under the guise of free speech.   Madam Speaker, I am glad that Members of Congress on both sides of  the aisle are committed to standing strong against terrorism, anti- Semitism, and all forms of hate on college campuses. This is critical.  [[Page H5205]]    This is an important and timely resolution that seeks to call out a  deeply disturbing pattern of support for terrorism and anti-Semitism  that we have been seeing on all too many college campuses in recent  weeks.                                time  1615    I am appalled by the inability of our institutions of higher  education to be able to stand up for what is right and to take on the  initiative to use these incidents as a teaching opportunity. After all,  what are our colleges and universities for if they are unable to use  this opportunity to teach about what is right and what is accurate.   I ask all my colleagues to join me in voting in support of this  resolution, and I yield back the balance of my time.
