 Mr. Chair, I rise today in concern over  implications and consequences of what is before us with this bill. I  rise in opposition to proposed cuts to Amtrak that will diminish the  funding it needs to provide the service Americans rely on every day.   I know how important Amtrak is because I am one of those Americans  who rely on its service. I am one of 9.3 million Americans who used the  Northeast Corridor in 2022 to get home, see family, or conduct  business. In fact, I just rode the Amtrak train down today to be here  at the Capitol to do the work of this country. I am one of nearly 23  million Americans nationwide who have used Amtrak last year to bring  our communities closer together and help create economic opportunities  for working people.   For this reason, at the appropriate time, I will offer a motion to  recommit this bill back to committee and will insert this as text into  the Record. If the House rules permit, I would have offered the motion  with an important amendment to this bill.   My amendment would increase the level of grants for the Northeast  Corridor and National Network to match the fiscal year 2023 enacted  level. In short, it would help make sure a critical program that  millions rely on has the funding it needs to continue operating at the  level the American people expect.   Unfortunately, delivering for the American people is not a priority  in this Republican budget. This budget guts Amtrak funding by 64  percent. It guts funding for the Northeast Corridor by 92 percent, and  it eliminates critical programs for rail safety at a time when we  should be prioritizing safety for our workers and our communities.   This Republican budget impacts my home State of New Jersey  particularly hard. At a time when train derailments are costing lives,  this budget would result in nearly 200 fewer safety inspections in my  State of New Jersey alone. At a time when we should be investing in our  infrastructure, New Jersey stands to lose nearly $173 million in  funding for our transit and highway projects.    New Jersey deserves better, and America deserves better. We can start  to make this right for them by passing this MTR to provide the funding  we need for programs that millions of Americans depend on.   Mr. Chair, I include in the Record the text of this amendment.         Mr. Kim of New Jersey moves to recommit the bill H.R. 4820       to the committee on Appropriations with the following       amendments.          Page 55, line 7, after the dollar amount, insert       ``(increased by $1,160,769,000)''.          Page 55, line 23, after the dollar amount, insert       ``(increased by $416,624,000)''
