 Mr. Speaker, I am equally honored to stand  here with the gentleman and fellow veteran, Mr. Mast, as well as my New  York colleague, Mr. Meeks.   Mr. Speaker, America has always stood up to bullies. I am a veteran  of the Cold War. For half a century, our Nation stood against the  tyranny of the Soviet Union.   I volunteered to serve in the Navy, making six strategic deterrent  patrols in the Pacific aboard a nuclear submarine.   The mission was clear: to project strength, to stand ready to defend  our Nation and our allies, and to deter the aggression of our enemies.   Today, we are reminded what happens if American leaders fail in that  mission. The Russian military, emboldened by their invasion of Ukraine,  making veiled threats of nuclear escalation, suppressing the voices  even of their own people, they have deliberately provoked this Nation-- you and me.   On March 14, 2023, one of our MQ-9 Reaper drones, flying safely in  international airspace and in accordance with international law, was  attacked by two Russian Su-27 fighter jets.   These lawless pilots dumped their fuel, hitting our aircraft in mid- flight, forcing an American reconnaissance asset to ditch in  international waters.   I remain shocked not only at the unprofessional and reckless nature  of the Russian pilots, but also of the Russian Government's accolades  and awards that it heaped upon them.   Mr. Speaker, I am reminded from my naval service that the only thing  necessary for the triumph of evil is for good people to do nothing.  That is exactly why I have proposed H. Res. 240, a resolution  condemning the reckless actions of the Russian military resulting in a  loss of a U.S. aircraft.   The resolution is simple. It recognizes the events that took place,  highlighted by the declassified video from European Command. It  resolves that the House of Representatives condemns the Russian  military's actions and reaffirms that the United States will not be  deterred from operating our drones in the Black Sea. This resolution  speaks not for a single political ideology but on behalf of all  Americans who desire peace.   I would take a moment to thank Representative Costa, who has joined  me in this bipartisan effort of standing up to tyranny and the direct  act of aggression against our military.   At this time of escalating tensions around the world, we must speak  out against brazen provocation. Today, the world can see that Americans  across the political spectrum speak with one voice in condemnation of  this act.   By standing together here on the floor of the House of  Representatives, we project strength by standing together, we reassure  our allies that we are committed to defend ourselves and our friends,  and together, we will ensure the peace through deterrence in unity.    Mr. Speaker, this month marks the 60th  anniversary of the loss of the nuclear submarine the USS Thresher, SSN  593.   On that fateful day, on April 10, 1963, 129 sailors and shipyard  workers went out on an engineering trial. They encountered engineering  problems that they were unable to recover from and, tragically, all  hands were lost.   The submarine service that I served in became much safer as a result  of this tragedy, and I am honored, as the first nuclear submarine  veteran to serve in Congress in 50 years, to remember those that were  lost today.   Even more importantly, we remember the widows that were created that  day and the children that grew up fatherless. We stop and we remember  them and say thank you for the life that you have lived without those  loved ones.                            ____________________
