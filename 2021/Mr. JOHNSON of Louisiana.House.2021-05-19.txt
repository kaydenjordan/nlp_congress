 Mr. Speaker, on this somber occasion, we  rise to honor the late Buddy Roemer.   He was born in Shreveport, Louisiana, in 1943. He was a Harvard- educated reformer with big ideas.   He represented Louisiana's Fourth Congressional District here in the  House from 1981 to 1988. He served as the 52nd Governor of Louisiana,  and he was a former candidate for President of the United States.   He passed away at the age of 77 on May 17, 2021.   Please join us in a moment of silence in honor of his public service  and his important contributions to Louisiana and our Nation.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks  and to include extraneous material on the subject of my Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, during my time tonight, my  colleagues and I will address three major crises happening here at  home, happening close to home at our southern border; and happening to  our closest ally in the Middle East, and that is Israel.   Each of these issues that my colleagues will discuss tonight can and  should be addressed in a bipartisan way. We should all want Americans  to get back to work. We should all want to end the humanitarian crisis  at our border, and we should all want to support one of our closest  allies from terrorism.   It is time for President Biden and our Democrat colleagues to work  with Republicans to solve these problems for the American people and  for our allies.
