 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of this package because I  have small businesses in my district that are closing, after being in  business for decades, right before our eyes. This bill is better than  what the Republicans originally proposed.   And make no mistake about it, if it wasn't for Democrats pushing to  make changes, the businesses, the true small businesses--not the  publicly traded companies--would still continue to be left behind.  There would be no money for hospitals, no money for PPEs, no money for  testing. It is the push of the Democrats that made this bill better and  is why I am supporting it.   I also want to be clear that this virus is on a different timeline.  No matter what people think, no matter what people say, this is just  the end of the beginning and not the beginning of the end.
