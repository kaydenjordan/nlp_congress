 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding time.   Mr. Speaker, I have the honor of representing Joint Base Lewis- McChord, the largest military base on the West Coast, and tens of  thousands of servicemembers and their families who call the South Puget  Sound home. I am pleased that the NDAA raises base pay by 4.6 percent  and includes inflation bonuses.   The top concern that I hear from command staff and servicemembers and  their families is a lack of housing and housing that is affordable.  That is why in April, I introduced a four-bill package ensuring every  servicemember has a home.   I am very pleased that this bill includes:   The Basic Allowance for Housing Calculation Improvement Act; and   Increasing Home Ownership for Servicemembers Act.   This act directs DOD to create a more transparent and modernized way  to calculate the housing allowance.   The defense bill also directs DOD to consider restoring the housing  allowance back to 100 percent.   I am also pleased that we will direct DOD to collect data on  scholarship awards and ROTC program completion by gender, by race, and  ethnicity. Many officers come through ROTC, but unfortunately, fewer  officers of color come through ROTC compared to other commissioning  sources. We must find out why.    This year's NDAA invests in the lives and livelihood of  servicemembers and their families. I strongly urge adoption of this  important legislation.
