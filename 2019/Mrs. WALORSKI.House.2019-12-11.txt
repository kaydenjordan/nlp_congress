 Madam Chair, I rise today in strong opposition to H.R.  3.   This misguided, partisan legislation was written behind closed doors.  It will result in fewer cures, less innovation, and worse health  outcomes. We all agree that prescription drug affordability is a vital  issue for the American people. However, we shouldn't be sacrificing new  cures in the process. The bill tells patients with cancer, Alzheimer's,  and other terrible diseases to keep waiting for the cures they so  desperately need.   That is why I support H.R. 19, the Lower Costs, More Cures Act. This  bipartisan bill will lower out-of-pocket spending while also protecting  access to new medicines and cures.   Madam Chair, we have an important opportunity to work in a bipartisan  fashion for the American people. But here we are again, considering a  partisan bill that has no path forward in the Senate. This has become  such a disturbing trend.   I urge my colleagues to vote against this flawed legislation so we  can work together on a bipartisan solution.
