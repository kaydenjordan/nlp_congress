 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Republican Conference,  I send to the desk a privileged resolution and ask for its immediate  consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:  [[Page H5404]]                                     H. Res. 1159         Resolved, That the following named Members be, and are       hereby, elected to the following standing committees of the       House of Representatives:        Committee on Ways and Means: Mr. Kustoff.        Committee on Financial Services: Mr. Norman.    Mr. Speaker, earlier today, a man was arrested for  plotting to kill Justice Kavanaugh.   Over a month ago, the Senate unanimously passed a bill to provide  more security for Supreme Court Justices and their families, but House  Democrats have let that bill gather dust. This is the same party whose  heated rhetoric has encouraged political pressure on conservative  Justices.   Former White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said:         I know that there is an outrage right now, I guess, about       protests that have been peaceful to date, and we certainly do       continue to encourage that, outside judges' homes, and that       is the President's position.    And Majority Leader Schumer said:         I want to tell you, Justice Kavanaugh and Justice Gorsuch,       you have unleashed a whirlwind, and you will pay the price.       You won't know what hit you if you go forward with these       awful decisions.    Mr. Speaker, with words like that and threats like these, Congress  cannot afford to wait. We have a duty to protect the Court, the  Justices, and their families from political violence and intimidation.  And we can meet that duty tonight before the House adjourns by sending  this bill to the President's desk.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to take from the Speaker's table  S. 4160, Supreme Court Police Parity Act, and ask for its immediate  consideration in the House.    Mr. Speaker, it is cleared on the Republican side.    No. I am just stating there is no objection on the  Republican side, so that would only be the Democrats holding the bill  up.
