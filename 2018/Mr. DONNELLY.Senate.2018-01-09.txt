 Mr. President, for the past decade, health policy,  unfortunately, has proven to be one of the most bitterly partisan  issues. It doesn't have to be this way.   I want to take a few minutes to discuss some health-related issues  that Congress left unfinished before the holidays: providing relief  from the medical device tax, reauthorizing the Children's Health  Insurance Program, funding for community health centers, and doing more  to address the opioid crisis. Each has strong bipartisan support and  could provide help to our constituents now.   First, many of us, on both sides of the aisle, agree on the need to  provide relief from the medical device tax, which went back into effect  on January 1. The medical device tax is one of these issues that leaves  most Hoosiers scratching their heads. First adopted as part of the  Affordable Care Act, the device tax was one of the few issues  Republicans and Democrats agreed needed to be fixed, and in 2015, with  bipartisan support, President Obama enacted a 2-year suspension of the  tax.   The argument was really pretty simple. The medical device tax was  making it harder for innovative companies to invest in the research and  development of new technologies, and, in the process, we were stifling  job creation. If there was a question as to whether this was the case,  the last 2 years provided evidence. When we agreed to suspend the tax  in 2016 and 2017, manufacturers used that additional money to hire new  workers, invest in research and technologies, and continue producing  innovative, lifesaving products in the United States.   For example, Zimmer Biomet, headquartered in Warsaw, IN, my home  State, used the money from the device tax suspension to invest in new  innovation to improve musculoskeletal health across the world. They  were also able to upgrade their manufacturing equipment and facilities.  Perhaps more importantly, these investments not only supported existing  jobs, but they also helped to create new jobs--new, good-paying jobs.   Yet, despite this evidence, despite this strong bipartisan support  for repeal, and despite a wide-ranging package of changes to the Tax  Code becoming law in recent days, Congress has failed to address the  medical device  [[Page S93]]  tax, which went back into place on January 1.   As we again discuss the policy priorities that were left unaddressed  in 2017, I strongly urge my colleagues to work with me to quickly and  meaningfully address the medical device tax. This would allow these  innovative companies to make the long-term investments that not only  lead to life-changing technologies but support thousands of high-paying  jobs across the country, including in my home State of Indiana.   Another issue that has garnered bipartisan support is a healthcare  program that covers millions of our children. We must reauthorize the  Children's Health Insurance Program--also known as CHIP--that expired  in September.   I have long supported the CHIP program. It provides health coverage  for millions of kids, including nearly 115,000 children from Indiana. I  am not alone in my support for this program. The fact is, CHIP has had  strong bipartisan support for the past 20 years, and Democrats and  Republicans in both the Senate and the House have shown they support a  5-year reauthorization of the program. That gives States the certainty  they need to plan their budgets and provide high-quality care to these  children.   Despite this shared commitment for the program and agreement on the  need for a long-term reauthorization, we were only able to fund the  program through March before Congress departed for the holidays. This  short-term extension bought some time, but according to the Centers for  Medicare and Medicaid Services--CMS--some States will start running out  of money after January 19. This means families and States will very  soon face the harmful consequences of congressional inaction.   Just last week, the Congressional Budget Office said that funding the  CHIP program for the next 5 years will cost significantly less than  previous estimates. This program is vital to our families and vital to  our children. We should reauthorize the CHIP program right away.   Like the CHIP program, community health centers have enjoyed long  bipartisan support for the high-quality care they provide to our  families. Also, like CHIP, the funding for community health centers  expired on September 30, leaving many health centers across Indiana  worried about if they will have the resources they need to continue to  serve Hoosiers.   We have the ability to work together now to ensure that our community  health centers can continue to provide cost-effective, high-quality  healthcare to people all across the country.   Finally, we have demonstrated a common desire to address the needs of  the opioid and drug abuse crisis. It is a scourge. It took the lives of  63,000 people just in 2016--63,000 of our brothers and sisters, our  husbands and wives, our sons and daughters. It is a heartbreak that is  crushing the entire country.   I welcomed President Trump's declaration of a public health  emergency, and both Republican and Democratic Senators have highlighted  the need for Congress to do even more to help those struggling with  addiction.   Like many other States, the opioid epidemic has been particularly  devastating in underserved areas in Indiana that lack adequate  treatment providers.   Senator Murkowski and I have partnered on a bipartisan bill that  would encourage addiction treatment professionals to serve in  underserved areas by making addiction treatment facilities eligible for  National Health Service Corps student loan repayment and forgiveness.   We can show our commitment to increasing access to treatment by  reauthorizing the National Health Service Corps program, which expired  in September. We also must recognize that a meaningful response to the  opioid crisis will require robust and meaningful funding to help our  communities as soon as possible.   I have often said that most people think Congress can do something to  help make life better--to provide working parents with the peace of  mind that their children can grow up healthy and to instill confidence  in our communities so that they will have the tools they need to  respond to this heartbreaking crisis. At the very least, Congress  should not make this situation worse.   By failing to take action in 2017, medical device companies are once  again paying a counterproductive tax that inhibits growth in Indiana.   On all of these issues--medical device taxes, our families and our  children and this opioid crisis, community health centers--we can work  together as Democrats, as Republicans, but more than either of those,  as Americans to make sure that our families can get decent healthcare,  to make sure that no one else dies because of this terrible opioid  scourge we are dealing with. These are critically important issues.  These are issues that know no political party, that know no special  agenda. What we do know is that we need this Congress, this Senate, to  deal with them now.   Mr. President, I yield back.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Johnson). The Senator from North Dakota.
