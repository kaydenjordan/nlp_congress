 Madam President, the Biden border crisis continues  unabated. Far from being the seasonal surge the President claimed  months ago, the numbers at the border keep growing.   Last month, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection encountered more  than 188,000 individuals attempting to cross our southern border. That  is not only the highest number seen so far this year; that is the  highest monthly number in 21 years--21 years.   In all, Customs and Border Protection has had more than 1.1 million  encounters along our southern border so far in fiscal year 2021, and we  still have 3 months to go. In fiscal year 2019, by  [[Page S5152]]  comparison, the year before COVID, total--total--encounters for the  entire fiscal year were under 980,000 individuals.   We have a border crisis--a crisis that President Biden seems unable  or unwilling to address.   And as massive as those numbers I have mentioned are, they don't take  into account those individuals who are sneaking across the border  without being apprehended. Some of them are, no doubt, individuals who  are looking for a better life. Others are almost undoubtedly criminals,  engaged in the kind of illicit activities that we have to combat along  our southern border--human trafficking, drug smuggling, and others.   In June, Customs and Border Protection seized more than 1,000 pounds  of fentanyl along our southern border, an incredibly dangerous drug  that some have pushed to classify as a weapon of mass destruction. That  is more fentanyl than was seized in that area in the previous three  Junes combined.   What has the Biden administration been doing to deal with the crisis  along our border? Well, not much.   There has been no move to reinstate the national emergency  designation for our southern border that President Biden canceled after  he took office. There is no meaningful plan for stopping the flood of  illegal immigration and enhancing security along our southern border.  There is no move to reinstate funding for the congressionally mandated  border wall that President Biden canceled.   In fact, the President is apparently contemplating ending title 42,  which has allowed the government to immediately remove apprehended  individuals in order to help manage the COVID crisis.   That is right. At the same time the CDC is expanding its masking  guidance for Americans, the administration is contemplating ending a  measure to help stop COVID-infected individuals from entering the  United States.   And I haven't even mentioned the fact that apparently the  administration has released tens of thousands of individuals into the  United States without court dates, many of whom have failed to show up  at Immigration and Customs Enforcement offices as directed.   The border situation is out of control, and President Biden bears a  big part of the blame.   Immigration has helped build this country, and I strongly support  making sure that the United States continues to offer a chance for  individuals the world over to achieve their dream of a better life. I  also support temporary worker programs, like the H-2B visa program,  that allow individuals from other countries to come here for a limited  time period to work and for the economic opportunity and then return to  their home countries.   I also support a solution that would allow Dreamers to stay in the  United States if--if--such a solution is developed in the context of  immigration reform and enhanced border security.   But we cannot have endless floods of illegal immigration. No country  can. It is a humanitarian nightmare and a serious security risk.   Immigration has to have limits, and, most of all, it has to be legal.  We need to protect and encourage legal immigration, while cracking down  on illegal immigration.   Unfortunately, Democrats are going in the opposite direction. The  word is that Democrats would like to include amnesty in the budget- busting, tax-and-spending spree that they are pushing to vote on later  this year.   That is right. With a serious humanitarian and security crisis along  our southern border, Democrats want to include amnesty in their  spending plan.   Now, I can only imagine that this will encourage thousands more to  make the dangerous trek to and across our southern border, not to  mention how such a policy would undermine respect for the rule of law.   I wish I could say that I see some light at the end of the tunnel  when it comes to the border, but if the Biden administration continues  along its current path, I fully expect this security and humanitarian  crisis to continue.   I can only hope that President Biden will recognize the problems his  policies, or lack thereof, are causing, before too many more  individuals suffer the consequences.   I yield the floor.
