 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, 1 year ago, a gunman stormed into an El  Paso Walmart and opened fire. There were 46 people shot; 23,  tragically, died; and the devastation in this tight-knit community was  beyond imagination. The heartbreak and confusion quickly turned to rage  when we learned that this out-of-town shooter was a white supremacist  whose crime could only be described as domestic terrorism.   As my good friend El Paso Mayor Dee Margo has said many times over  the last year, we will not let this evil define us. He wrote in an op- ed this weekend: ``El Paso will not be known for tragedy but for our  strength and grace in the midst of tragedy.''   That strength comes to mind when I reflect on this terrible  anniversary. When I visited El Paso the day after the shooting, I saw  the makeshift memorial that was created to honor those who died. On  that first day, the collection of photos, flowers, and mementos was  relatively small--maybe just a few feet wide--but by the time I came  back 3 days later, it had grown to over half a mile. This massive  memorial, the long line of folks waiting to donate blood, the generous  donations made to support the victims and their families, these were  the real reminders of the power and resilience of the El Paso  community.   As we remember this anniversary amidst a pandemic, there will not be  groups of strangers hugging, crying, or holding hands like I witnessed  in the days following the shooting. Instead, we will have socially  distanced memorials, like the vigil held yesterday, that will allow El  Pasoans once again to prove that hate will not win.   Together, we will remember the 23 lives which were lost 1 year ago,  as well as those who were wounded, and we stand in solidarity with El  Paso, a border community that has looked hate in the eye and  unequivocally chosen strength, grace, and love for one another.
