 Madam Speaker, pursuant to section 7 of House  Resolution 486, I call up the joint resolution (S.J. Res. 13) providing  for congressional disapproval under chapter 8 of title 5, United States  Code, of the rule submitted by the Equal Employment Opportunity  Commission relating to ``Update of Commission's Conciliation  Procedures'', and ask for its immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the joint resolution.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks  and insert extraneous materials on S.J. Res. 13.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of S.J. Res. 13, a  Congressional Review Act resolution disapproving the Equal Employment  Opportunity Commission, or EEOC, Conciliation Rule.   This resolution will help ensure fairness for those who bring forth  charges of unlawful workplace discrimination.   When the EEOC has found that an employer likely violated the law, it  is required under title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1984 to engage  in conciliation before filing a lawsuit. This conciliation process is  meant to be an informal and confidential opportunity for parties to  settle a charge of discrimination in lieu of going to court.   Unfortunately, in the final weeks of the Trump administration, the  EEOC issued a final rule that imposed onerous new requirements on the  conciliation process.   Under the new rule, the EEOC must provide an employer with a written  summary of the facts and the nonprivileged information the EEOC relied  on to determine that the employer violated the law. Notably, the rule  requires the EEOC to expose the identities of workers or groups of  workers for whom relief is being sought unless they proactively request  anonymity, and their witnesses.   This new rule will put a thumb on the scale in favor of employers in  cases where the EEOC found that they likely violated workers' civil  rights. Specifically, the rule incentivizes employers to focus  litigation on whether the EEOC failed to satisfy the rule's new  requirements instead of whether the employer engaged in unlawful  discrimination.   In fact, on settlement--settlements had been more likely since the  Supreme Court ruled that this conciliation process should be informal,  unlike the rule that was promulgated late in the Trump administration.  This will allow unscrupulous employers to drag out the conciliation  process, possibly for years--and even avoid accountability altogether-- by just litigating over whether the EEOC complied with the conciliation  rule rather than correcting the discriminatory process.                                time  1430    The EEOC rule conflicts with the Supreme Court's 2015 decision in  Mach Mining v. EEOC. It was a unanimous decision. It held that the EEOC  must  [[Page H3111]]  have the discretion to use whatever informal means of settlement are  appropriate in each individual case. However, under the new rule, a  rigid conciliation process will apply across the board, one-size-fits- all, in every case of workplace discrimination.   This solution will likely lead to increased retaliation against  victims of discrimination and witnesses, as well as needless delays in  justice for workers. We know that justice delayed is justice denied.  This is why civil rights leaders and worker advocates across the  country have called on Congress to pass this Congressional Review Act  resolution and restore fairness for victims of workplace  discrimination.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a Statement of Administrative  Policy from the Biden administration in support of this resolution.                     Statement of Administration Policy    S.J. Res. 13--A joint resolution for congressional disapproval under  chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, of the rule submitted by the      Equal Employment Opportunity Commission relating to ``Update of     Commission's Conciliation Procedures''--Sen. Murray, D-WA, and no                                 cosponsors         The Administration supports Senate passage of Senate Joint       Resolution 13 to nullify the Equal Employment Opportunity       Commission's (EEOC) recently promulgated ``Update of       Commission's Conciliation Procedures,'' which became       effective on February 16, 2021, under the Congressional       Review Act. The rule that S.J. Res. 13 would nullify imposed       onerous and rigid new procedures on the EEOC's obligation to       conciliate or ``settle'' meritorious claims of employment       discrimination, that risks unduly delaying and diverting       limited resources from agency efforts to investigate and       resolve meritorious claims of employment discrimination. The       rule increases the risk of retaliation by making it easier       for employers to demand the identities of those with       information about unlawful discrimination, which will likely-      have a chilling effect on the willingness of victims and       witnesses to come forward. S.J. Res. 13 would nullify the       rule's unnecessary and burdensome standards that would likely       result in increased charge backlogs, and lengthier charge       investigation, resolution and litigation times. The       resolution will also ensure that EEOC has the flexibility to       tailor settlements to the facts and circumstances of each       case, thus increasing the likelihood of voluntary compliance.       The resolution will furthermore ensure that justice for       workers subject to discrimination is not delayed, or       potentially denied, due to costly and time-consuming       collateral litigation.    Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support  the resolution, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Oregon (Ms. Bonamici), the chair of the Subcommittee  on Civil Rights and Human Services, and cosponsor of the House version  of this resolution.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, just to state on the question of whether or not the  individuals can be revealed, identifying the aggrieved individuals must  take place, but not if the individual or individuals have requested  anonymity. That means you have to know that you are about to be  revealed. You have to proactively request anonymity. If you haven't  gone through those steps, then you will be revealed.   That is an unnecessary step. It puts people in unnecessary jeopardy,  and I hope they would not subject that. It is not necessary. The EEOC  has an obligation to do conciliation, but they need to do it on an  individualized case, best aimed at settlement and based on an  individual case, and reveal the information that is best for that  purpose, and no more.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Madam Speaker, it is our responsibility to reverse the EEOC's new  conciliation rule. Before this harmful rule change, the EEOC's  conciliation process was what it was meant to be, an informal,  flexible, confidential opportunity to settle discrimination claims  before going to court. That is what the Supreme Court ruled unanimously  in 2015.                                time  1445    Now, the new conciliation rule is threatening to stack the process  against workers by subjecting those who make discrimination claims to  an increased risk of retaliation and allowing employers to hijack the  process to focus on whether it failed to conciliate, not whether the  employer violated the law.   Simply put, this is an unnecessary new regulation which will, at  best, delay justice for victims of discrimination and, at worst, open  the door for collateral litigation, adding potentially years to the  process before ever reaching the merits of the discrimination claim.   That is why advocates of victims of discrimination support the  resolution.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the Leadership  Conference on Civil and Human Rights signed by 24 civil rights groups  in support of the resolution.                                          The Leadership Conference                                       on Civil and Human Rights,                                       Washington, DC, June 9, 2021.      Re Support S.J. Res. 13, a Congressional Review Act           Resolution of Disapproval to Protect Workers from a           Harmful EEOC Rule        Dear Representative: The undersigned 24 civil and workers'       rights organizations urge you to vote for S.J. Res. 13, a       Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolution of disapproval to       undo a January 14, 2021, Equal Employment Opportunity       Commission (EEOC) final rule that threatens to harm working       people seeking relief from discrimination and to impede the       work of the EEOC.        The EEOC final rule made several changes to conciliation,       the process by which the EEOC tries to settle a charge of       workplace discrimination. Instead of ensuring that       discrimination charges are resolved fairly, the EEOC's final       rule imposes several new obligations and disclosures that:        Significantly weight the conciliation process in favor of       employers;        Delay justice and increase the likelihood of harm to       working people;        Divert scarce EEOC staff time and resources away from       investigating discrimination; and        Contravene controlling U.S. Supreme Court precedent.        The Senate passed S.J. Res. 13 on May 19, 2021. If the       House now passes this resolution, Congress could undo this       harmful rule and restore the status quo with respect to the       EEOC's procedures. A resolution of disapproval is an       appropriate exercise of Congress's power in this case,       because the CRA is the most expeditious and effective option       for addressing the negative impacts of the EEOC's final rule.        The EEOC must be able to conduct its work efficiently in       order to be effective in its mission to prevent and remedy       workplace discrimination. This mission is even more critical       in the middle of a global pandemic that continues to have       severe economic repercussions for women, people of color, and       other marginalized communities, including a heightened risk       of job loss, health and safety hazards, and discrimination       based on sex, race, age, and disability.        Individuals who experience discrimination on the job       already face significant hurdles to seeking redress,       including retaliation, lack of information about their       rights, and lack of access to legal assistance. When an       individual does file a charge of discrimination against their       employer with the EEOC, the agency collects information and       conducts an investigation. If the EEOC finds ``reasonable       cause'' to believe employment discrimination has occurred,       the parties are invited to participate in the conciliation       process, which seeks to settle or resolve the charges of       discrimination informally and confidentially, in lieu of       filing a lawsuit. Title VII requires the EEOC to attempt       resolution of charges informally before considering or       proceeding with litigation, and the EEOC may only pursue       litigation if conciliation has failed.        The final rule will only deepen the barriers working people       face coming forward to report discrimination and obtain       justice. It requires the EEOC to grant the employer access to       details of the victim and witnesses' identity and       allegations, escalating the risk of retaliation for workers.       Claims of retaliation made up more than half of all charges       filed at the EEOC in FY 2020, and fear of retaliation       prevents many victims of discrimination from coming forward       and many witnesses from being forthright--something that may       be especially true during an economic crisis. The rule also       requires the EEOC to disclose critical information concerning       the EEOC's legal analysis of the case to employers, and       employers only. In other words, the EEOC would be required to       automatically tum over its case files to employers whom the       agency believes to have acted unlawfully, but not to the       working people who are seeking a remedy for the       discrimination they faced. This practice would exacerbate       resource and information inequities between the parties to       the benefit of employers only. Although the proposed rule       would allow disclosures to the charging party upon request,       many working people who file charges are unrepresented by       counsel and will not know to make such a request. The EEOC,       whose mission is to prevent and remedy discrimination, should       not, in its own procedural rules, disadvantage the very party       seeking to remedy discrimination.        By imposing inflexible rules on the conciliation process,       the EEOC final rule also flouts congressional intent and is       inconsistent with Supreme Court precedent. In its unanimous       2015 decision Mach Mining, LLC v. EEOC, the Supreme Court       explained that  [[Page H3113]]       ``every aspect of Title VII's conciliation provision smacks       of flexibility,'' which allows the EEOC to tailor its       approach to conciliation in the way most appropriate in each       case. Without flexibility, the EEOC will be forced to divert       resources away from investigating and remedying workplace       discrimination and put them toward satisfying the final       rule's burdensome standards, resulting in increased delays at       the expense of victims of discrimination.        In addition, the rules would saddle EEOC with wasteful       collateral litigation attacking the conciliation process,       prolonging harm to workers through increased delay. This       tactic was prevalent before Mach Mining, and that case itself       shows the potential impact: The workers in Mach Mining--women       excluded from coal mining jobs due to sex discrimination--      were forced to wait nine years after the first charge was       filed for relief, in part because of unmeritorious employer       challenges to the conciliation process.        By invoking the CRA and passing a resolution of       disapproval, Congress could quickly restore the status quo       with respect to the EEOC's conciliation procedures,       minimizing the harm to workers and eliminating the need for       the EEOC to expend its scarce resources either undertaking       rulemaking processes to rescind the conciliation rule or       implementing the onerous new procedures in the final rule,       and defending the sufficiency of the new conciliation process       in collateral litigation by employers.        Importantly, application of the CRA to the final rule       ensures that the EEOC would be prohibited from promulgating a       ``substantially'' similar rule in the future that would       hinder vigorous enforcement of federal workplace       antidiscrimination laws. The final conciliation rule was both       procedurally and substantively flawed, raising concerns about       its integrity. As such, Congress's exercise of the CRA would       be warranted here.        Accordingly, we urge you to support and vote for S.J. Res.       13, the CRA resolution of disapproval of the EEOC's final       rule. Please contact Gaylynn Burroughs of The Leadership       Conference on Civil and Human Rights at       [email protected], or Maya Raghu of the National       Women's Law Center at [email protected], if you have any       questions.

Madam Speaker, we cannot allow employers to  drag out the conciliation process rather than be held accountable for  violating workers' civil rights.   As I said at the beginning of this debate, justice delayed is justice  denied. That is why I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for this  resolution and taking a critical step to ensuring that those who suffer  workplace discrimination can get timely and fair justice.   Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Oregon (Ms. Bonamici) for  working with me on the House version of the resolution.   I ask for the support of the House to pass the resolution to overturn  the EEOC regulation, and I yield back the balance of my time.
