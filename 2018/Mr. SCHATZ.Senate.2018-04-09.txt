 Madam President, I thank Senator Hirono for her poignant  remarks, and I want to offer my condolences to the family.   Senator Daniel Kahikina Akaka died on Friday at the age of 93,  leaving behind a legacy of integrity, kindness, and service to Hawaii  and to the Nation.   In Washington, Senator Akaka was an ambassador of ``aloha.'' He  showed people kindness, respect, and hospitality rarely seen in this  town. He didn't just represent Hawaii's interests in the Congress; he  showed the world what Hawaii represents; in the words of President  Kennedy, ``all that we are and all that we hope to be.''   He started that service as a welder in the U.S. Army Corps of  Engineers. He fought in World War II in the Pacific arena, traveling to  places like Tinian and Saipan. When World War II ended, he took  advantage of the GI bill to attend the University of Hawaii to become a  teacher--an occupation he never fully left behind.   Senator Akaka served for 36 years in Congress--14 years in the House  and 22 in the U.S. Senate. He was loved by colleagues in both parties  because he was kind to everyone. In fact, he never said a bad word  about anyone, not even in private. The foundation for his kindness came  from his faith, which he learned from his mother Annie.   He was a faithful attendee of the weekly Senate Prayer Breakfast,  where he would lead Members singing hymns. He always began with the  history of each song--a tradition he passed on to our own Chaplain,  Chaplain Black, who continues it today.   Danny Akaka was also very humble. There were times he didn't get  credit for the work he did here because he didn't care about the  credit. He cared about the work, about making a difference for people,  especially those whom he represented.   He was deeply convinced that the government could improve people's  lives because he had seen that in his own life as a beneficiary of the  GI bill. He would become the Senator who modernized that bill, bringing  it into the 21st century. He always fought hard for veterans--for their  benefits and their recognition, no matter the color of their skin or  their country of origin. When someone once challenged him on the cost  of benefits for veterans, he answered by saying: ``The price has  already been paid, many times over, by the service of the brave men and  women who wore our nation's uniform.''   Senator Akaka never forgot the costs of war on our country, and he  did everything he could to make sure his colleagues didn't either. He  voted against the Iraq war and advocated for peace and nuclear  nonproliferation throughout his career.   He was unrelenting when it came to the causes that were most  important to him. As the only Native Hawaiian to ever serve in the U.S.  Senate, he never stopped working to see Native Hawaiians recognized in  a government-to-government relationship with the United States.   In his years on the Indian Affairs Committee, including as the  chairman, he successfully sponsored the apology resolution, which  recognized that the overthrow of the Queen--the only monarch in the  United States--was illegal and facilitated by agents of our own Federal  Government.   This was the theme of Senator Akaka's career--to advocate for people  who did not have power and for people who were vulnerable. He was a  champion for the Federal Government employees who, to this day,  continue to be a punching bag for some. He sponsored the 2012  Whistleblower Protection Act, which ensures that Federal workers cannot  be retaliated against if they report waste, fraud, and abuse. That was  just one of the many things he did to make the Federal Government a  better employer.   Senator Akaka also fought for consumers. He helped people who were  trying to get out of credit card debt. He made sure investors had an  advocate at the Securities and Exchange Commission, and he protected  people who sent remittances around the world so they aren't swindled  out of their hard-earned money.   Every morning he would begin his day by meeting visitors from Hawaii.  Those connections to his constituents--to home--drove his work and kept  him focused on helping Hawaii.   Much of his work was possible because of the bipartisanship  relationships he built with other Senators. Some of his best friends in  the body--Senators Inhofe, Cochran, and Barrasso--were people with whom  he did not agree very often. Every Member of this body--those who knew  Senator Akaka and those who didn't--can learn from his legacy--a legacy  of quiet leadership, of treating others the way you want to be treated,  and focusing on the things that matter to the people we are here to  represent.   I want to end with a few words from Chaplain Black. This is what he  had to say about Senator Akaka:         There's something called ethical congruence--it refers to       when your actions back up your rhetoric. And most of us       struggle with that, because it's very easy to say something       but much more difficult to live it. There's a verse in       Scripture that says, we are living letters, so our lives       should be something that people should be able to read.       Francis of Assisi said: preach the gospel everywhere you go;       when necessary, use words. Senator Akaka preached the gospel       everywhere he went, and very rarely had to use words. That's       the kind of ethical congruence that he had.   [[Page S1998]]     The U.S. Senate and our country would be better off if there were  more leaders like Danny. He fought for the vulnerable, promoted peace,  and looked for common ground. Most of all, he embodied the ``aloha''  spirit and showed us all what it means to have a pure heart and be a  true public servant.   Our thoughts are with the family of Senator Akaka today, with Millie,  his children, his grandchildren, his great-grandchildren, and his  staff. He will be remembered and greatly missed.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
