 Mr. President, I rise in support of the ``Preventing  Online Sales of E-Cigarettes to Children Act,'' which would help  address the concerning rise of electronic cigarette use among America's  youth.   This common-sense bill would protect children by requiring online  retailers of e-cigarettes to meet the same standards as those that sell  regular cigarettes and other tobacco products online.   E-cigarette use among teenagers has increased dramatically over the  past few years. According to the Centers for Disease Control and  Prevention, approximately 20 percent of high school students used  electronic cigarettes in 2018. In comparison, only about 1.5 percent of  high school students reportedly used e-cigarettes in 2011.   Even more disturbing, the rise of teenage use of e-cigarettes appears  to be accelerating. Between 2017 and 2018, e-cigarettes use among high  school-aged children jumped 78%. Today, e-cigarettes have become the  most commonly used tobacco product among America's youth. These severe  levels of e-cigarette use by middle and high school-aged children are  staggering.   According to a U.S. Surgeon General report on e-cigarette use among  youth and young adults, the developing adolescent brain is uniquely  sensitive to nicotine. Studies have also shown that the development of  the brain during adolescence can be permanently altered by nicotine. As  a result, children exposed to nicotine may be at greater risk for  acting out drug-seeking behaviors, experiencing deficits in attention  and cognition, and suffering from mood disorders. These effects may  continue into adulthood, long after e-cigarette use has stopped.   Given the effects of nicotine on children, it is critical that we  close any legal loopholes that have allowed underage youth to gain  access to tobacco, particularly through e-cigarettes.   Among underage e-cigarette users, 86 percent reported that they  obtained the product from somewhere other than a retail store. And a  recent survey of adolescent e-cigarette users showed that 32 percent of  them reported purchasing their products online, making online sales the  single largest source of underage purchases.   Our legislation would build off the ``Prevent All Cigarette  Trafficking Act,'' which has been a tremendous success in preventing  underage use of cigarettes. Since it passed, the number of middle and  high school students who use cigarettes has been nearly cut in half. We  should expand on this success by requiring e-cigarette retailers to  meet the same requirements as those that sell regular cigarettes  online.   By applying the same safeguards that have worked with online sales of  regular cigarettes, our bill would ensure that online e-cigarette  sellers are verifying the age of their customers, properly labeling  packages, and checking identification at delivery.   In addition, our bill requires deliveries of e-cigarettes to comply  with relevant State tobacco taxes and reporting requirements, as is  currently required of online sales of regular cigarettes and smokeless  tobacco products. E-cigarette retailers will also need to register and  maintain a record of their online sales, which will be accessible to  State and Federal law officials. Law enforcement will be able to  identify and shut down online vendors that are systematically breaking  the law by marketing their e-cigarette products to children.   This bill complements efforts by the Food and Drug Administration,  which has recognized the epidemic of youth e-cigarette use and proposed  a number of policies meant to prevent underage retail purchases, limit  flavors that appeal to children, and enforce age verifications.   Over the last 50 years, the United States has made remarkable  progress in reducing the number of Americans that use tobacco products.  However, the dramatic recent rise of e-cigarette use among our youth  threatens that progress and requires a strong response.   I want to thank Senator Cornyn for joining me in introducing  legislation on this important issue. I urge my colleagues to join us in  supporting this bill to address the epidemic of e-cigarette use among  America's youth. Thank you Mr. President. I yield the floor.                                  ______                                         By Mr. REED (for himself and Mr. Grassley):   S. 1256. A bill to promote transparency by permitting the Public  Company Accounting Oversight Board to allow its disciplinary  proceedings to be open to the public, and for other purposes; to the  Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.
