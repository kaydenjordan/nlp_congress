 Madam Speaker, I rise today to  congratulate Keystone Central Career and Technology Center in Clinton  County, Pennsylvania.   Keystone Central Career and Technology Center was named a  semifinalist and received $10,000 as part of the Career Z Challenge.   The Career Z Challenge, run through the Department of Education's  Office of Career, Technical, and Adult Education, aims to expand work- based learning opportunities for Gen Z students.   Schools, nonprofit organizations, and local educational agencies in  urban and rural communities across 35 States submitted entries  describing their plans to create collaborative and sustainable work- based learning ecosystems to provide students with interconnected and  expansive career development opportunities from grades 9 through 12.   Semifinalists will be eligible to move on to phase three, and during  the 2023-2024 school year, semifinalists will receive technical  assistance to support the refinement and implementation of their  proposed WBL ecosystem plans.   They are also participating in a community of practice and have  access to learning workshops, peer collaboration opportunities, and  other resources.   Madam Speaker, as co-chair of the Bipartisan Career and Technical  Education Caucus, I am pleased to see the next generation of learning  of the many job opportunities CTE provides.   Madam Speaker, I congratulate Keystone Central Career and Technology  Center and wish them good luck in phase three.                            ____________________
