 Madam Speaker, I come to the floor today to honor Stewart  McNally, a United States Army veteran who sadly passed away last  summer.   Before he began his honorable service in the United States Army in  the late 1960s, Stewart was the captain of the Arthur Hill Tech  football team and went on to work at GM shortly after graduating.   He served honorably, and after his service in uniform, he came to  Florida in my district to begin another kind of service, his family.   He moved to Florida's Seventh to take care of his elderly father,  another civil servant, who served in the United States Army during  World War II.   His friends and family remember him as a loyal friend with a great  sense of humor. He loved to cycle, fish, and run in his free time.   Stewart is survived by his son, Jacob, and I am honored to help  celebrate his life and incredible service to the United States of  America.                            ____________________
