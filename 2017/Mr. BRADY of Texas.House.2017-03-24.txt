 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, last month, President Trump stood right here in this  room and said to Congress: ObamaCare is collapsing. He called on us to  take decisive action to protect all Americans.   Today we have a choice to make: will we answer the President's call  to action and pass this legislation to repeal and replace ObamaCare? Or  will we allow ObamaCare to remain fully in place and deny our  constituents the relief they urgently need?   I, for one, refuse to allow my constituents in Texas to suffer  ObamaCare's impacts any longer. For the past 7 years, we have watched  ObamaCare fail Americans on every single promise, and throughout this  time, as the Obama administration turned a deaf ear to the American  people, House Republicans were listening. We were listening to all  those facing severe premium increases, people like Lauren in my  district, in my hometown of The Woodlands. Lauren recently emailed me  to say that her premiums this year have gone up by nearly 70 percent.  Now they are $900 a month.   We were listening to all those who can no longer see the doctor of  their choice or access the care they need at an affordable price,  people like Elizabeth from Conroe, Texas, another constituent of my  mine. Her family pays about $800 a month in healthcare premiums, yet  they can no longer see any of the doctors they know and trust. This  includes the primary care doctor that Elizabeth and her husband have  been seeing for over a decade. It includes her children's longtime  pediatrician. All of these doctors are now out of reach, thanks to  ObamaCare.   That is the thing with this law. It has helped some, no doubt, but  far more people have been hurt, people like Lauren and Elizabeth, who  are paying significantly more for significantly less access to health  care.   It doesn't have to be this way. After 7 years of listening carefully  to the American people, we have now arrived at this moment of decisive  action. With the American Health Care Act, we have the best opportunity  since ObamaCare's enactment to repeal this harmful law, clear the deck,  and begin over with a step-by-step process to deliver a healthcare  system based on what patients and families truly want and need, not  what Washington thinks is best.   This bill gets us off to an excellent start. First, it delivers swift  relief to the American people by immediately repealing ObamaCare's most  harmful provisions. The individual mandate--the tax penalty--is gone.  The employer mandate tax penalty is gone. Nearly $900 billion in  ObamaCare tax hikes that have driven up costs and reduced access to  care for families, patients, and jobs, those tax hikes are gone.    From here, the American Health Care Act takes significant action to  replace ObamaCare with patient-focused solutions that expand choice,  lower  [[Page H2425]]  costs, and enhance competition. This is where we reclaim control of  health care from Washington and put it back where it belongs--with  patients, families, and States.   We expand health savings accounts, making them more flexible and more  user-friendly. We protect health coverage for the more than 150 million  Americans who receive it through their job. We deliver the largest  entitlement reform in decades, giving power to States to improve and  streamline Medicaid so they can better serve the needs of local  patients and families.   For low- and middle-income Americans who don't receive coverage  through work or a Federal program, we offer an advanceable, refundable  tax credit that people can use immediately to help purchase coverage  that is tailored to their needs. These tax credits provide a  conservative, free-market alternative to inefficient ObamaCare  subsidies that exist today. They deliver support to low- and middle- income Americans. At the same time, they will encourage real  competition and choice in the health insurance market.   Finally, as a committed pro-life conservative, I am pleased to say  this bill defunds Planned Parenthood while funding the community health  centers for women's truly needed health care, and takes vital action to  protect the right to life. No Federal funding can be used for elective  abortions. The language is crystal clear.   The American Health Care Act represents a critical first step in our  multiphase effort to tear down ObamaCare and reinstate patient-focused  solutions that help all Americans. But we know there is more work to  do. ObamaCare was a massive government takeover of health care. To  fully uproot the law, it is going to take a sustained, coordinated, and  relentless effort from both Congress and the administration.  Fortunately, we have incredible partners in President Trump and  Secretary Price at the Department of Health and Human Services. They  are already beginning work on the next phases of the process, stripping  away ObamaCare's regulations so we can enact additional free-market  solutions. These include consensus conservative proposals, such as  allowing insurance to be sold across State lines.   But to see success in the next phases, we have to take the first step  today. We have to pass the American Health Care Act, deliver immediate  relief to the American people, and provide a conservative path forward.   In closing, I thank all the leaders in the House who worked hard to  craft the bill before us today: Chairman Greg Walden, Chairman Diane  Black, and so many others.   I also want to offer my gratitude to everyone from the Congressional  Budget Office, the Joint Committee on Taxation, and the House Office of  Legislative Counsel who provided analysis and support as we developed  this legislation.   I would like to give a special thanks to Emily Murry, Stephanie  Parks, and all of our hardworking staff on the Ways and Means  Committee.   At the end of the day, on this day, we will have our first true vote  to repeal ObamaCare. History will record where we stand. This is a  clear choice. We can stand with President Trump and more freedom for  Americans to buy health care they choose, or stand with ObamaCare and  more government that gets in the way. I proudly stand with President  Trump and more freedom for the American people.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman  from Ohio (Mr. Tiberi), the chairman of the Health Subcommittee, who  played an invaluable role in solutions to lower healthcare costs for  Americans.  [[Page H2426]]         Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Nebraska (Mr. Smith), the chairman of the Human Resources  Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Nebraska (Mr. Smith), the chairman of the Human Resources  Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional  30 seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I first would remind my friend from  Georgia that nearly 700,000 Georgians have chosen to either pay a fine  or exempt themselves from ObamaCare because it has failed them so  badly.   And to my friend from Michigan, 420,000 Michiganders, more than half,  chose to exempt themselves from ObamaCare rather than accept that  failed health care.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Minnesota, (Mr.  Paulsen), a key member of the Ways and Means Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I remind my friend from Texas that 2  million Texans eligible, forced into ObamaCare and getting deep  subsidies, have said: No thanks. ObamaCare has failed me.   Two out of three Texans eligible.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr.  Reed), a key member of our Committee on Ways and Means.    Mr. Speaker, I remind my friend from California,  1.5 million Californians forced into ObamaCare and given generous  subsidies found a way to exempt themselves because ObamaCare failed.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Kelly), a small-businessman and a key member of our  committee.    Mr. Speaker, I would remind my friend from  Connecticut that 190,000 residents in Connecticut, two out of three  eligible for ObamaCare, believed it failed them so badly they paid a  tax or exempted themselves.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from South Dakota  (Mrs. Noem), who has weighed in in such a key way on health care.    Mr. Speaker, I remind my dear friend from Oregon,  153,000 Oregonians eligible for ObamaCare with generous subsidies said  thank you, but no thank you.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from South Carolina  (Mr. Rice), my good friend and a key member of the Ways and Means  Committee.   Mr. RICE of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I stand in strong support of  the American Health Care Act and urge my colleagues to vote in favor of  the bill.   ObamaCare was built on broken promises. President Obama said you  could keep your policy, keep your doctor, and it would bring down the  cost of the insurance for a family of four by $2,500 per year.   It is time for the lies to stop. Let me share with Members the  shameful reality of ObamaCare in South Carolina.   It turns out you couldn't keep your doctor. In fact, the Medical  University of South Carolina is not an accepted provider under  ObamaCare in South Carolina. That is right. South Carolinians cannot go  to the Medical University of South Carolina if they are  [[Page H2430]]  covered by ObamaCare exchange policies.   It turns out you couldn't keep your policy. It is hard to believe,  but more South Carolinians had their plans canceled by ObamaCare than  have enrolled in the exchanges. 237,000 South Carolinians' policies  were canceled in ObamaCare.    It turns out South Carolinians did not see a $2,500 reduction in  their healthcare premiums. In fact, premiums have increased by double  digits every year since the exchange opened; and this year, premiums  increased 28 percent and deductibles 26 percent.   I submit to you that if you have a health insurance policy with  $6,000 in deductibles and copays so high you can't afford to use your  policy, regardless of the fact that statistics say you are covered, you  are not covered.   206,000 South Carolinians have signed up for ObamaCare--4 percent of  the population. Ninety-six percent of South Carolinians are not on  ObamaCare. Three times as many people in South Carolina have chosen to  pay the mandate penalty rather than to pick up ObamaCare policies.   Mr. Speaker, President Obama promised South Carolinians we would have  many competitive plans to choose from, but after only 3 years of  Obama's damage to our healthcare system, only one provider remains, and  they are threatening to pull out.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 15 seconds to  the gentleman from South Carolina.   Mr. RICE of South Carolina. The CEO of a major hospital in South  Carolina stated, the way it is going right now, it is probably going to  implode in the next year or two. Our State's director of insurance,  last year, said companies have given their best shot and can't sustain  this business model, can't make a profit. The Affordable Care Act has  not worked, does not work, and cannot work under this structure in  South Carolina.    Mr. Speaker, I remind my good and thoughtful  friend that 290,000 Wisconsinites that chose not to get ObamaCare were  willing to pay a tax to stay out of a failed healthcare system.   I am proud to yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Indiana (Mrs.  Walorski), a new member of our committee who is doing tremendous things  in health care.    Mr. Speaker, I remind my good friend from New  Jersey that 314,000 residents of New Jersey said ``no thank you'' to  ObamaCare because it failed them.   I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Bishop), a new  member of the committee, who dove into this issue with great thoughtful  and conscientious work.    I remind my friend from New York, nearly four out  of five New Yorkers said no to ObamaCare because it failed them.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. King),  my dear friend.    I remind my friend from New York, nearly four out  of five New Yorkers said no to ObamaCare because it failed them.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. King),  my dear friend.    Mr. Speaker, I remind my good friend from  Illinois, half a million Illinoisans have said no to ObamaCare because  it failed them.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time to close.   Mr. Speaker, do you want to know how bad ObamaCare is?   Twice as many Americans have exempted themselves, have paid a fine,  or found another way out of ObamaCare for everyone who took it.   I am a conservative, and I am proud of the conservative win in this  bill. I am proud of the $1 trillion in tax relief on our small  businesses, our patients, and our families. I am proud of the more than  $1 trillion of spending cuts that Washington cannot afford nor sustain.  I am proud of the first reforms in Medicaid since the program was  created in giving States back control of that plan, including the  option of a work requirement.   I am proud to repeal ObamaCare mandates that have forced Americans  into health care they can't afford and don't want. I am proud to defund  Planned Parenthood once and for all. And I am proud of the $150 billion  of deficit reduction.   This is a clear choice, and we will stand where we stand today: the  choice between President Trump and more freedom or ObamaCare and less  freedom. I stand with President Trump.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
