 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, across the country, Americans watched in  horror as news stations reported the shooting of two sheriff's deputies  in Los Angeles, who were brutally targeted by a murderous, violent  criminal.   In North Carolina, just 2 days earlier, sheriff's deputy Ryan  Hendrix, a father of two young children, a man planning to get married,  was murdered in cold blood while responding to a family under siege by  an evil criminal.   So far in 2020 alone, 37 law enforcement officers have been murdered  by violent criminals and hundreds have been wounded while protecting  our communities.   Despite these senseless deaths and the gruesome violence against  police, there are those who support radical ideas like defunding or  abolishing the police. These dangerous policies would allow criminals  to roam free throughout our communities, unchallenged and unafraid.   The agitators pushing to abolish the police have sown the seeds of  discord in our country by disrespecting law enforcement and  disregarding their brave service to our Nation. Just look at Asheville,  NC. Since June 1, over 30 police officers have left the law enforcement  profession. These brave men and women are tired of being attacked  physically, emotionally, and personally, simply for trying to keep  their communities safe, every single damn day.   They put on a uniform to go protect their community, not sure if they  are going to come back safe, and they do it anyway, and we owe them a  debt of gratitude. But they are sick of the opportunistic politicians  like the Democratic leader and AOC attacking them for just doing their  jobs.   Worst of all is the specter of targeted attacks like those against  the deputies in Los Angeles. The harmful rhetoric being used by the  radical, anti-police leftists encourages an environment of hostility,  which emboldens criminals and murderers. The result is brazen attacks  against law enforcement officers in broad daylight.   In light of the toxic environment being created in this country,  which devalues police, I believe the Senate must act to protect law  enforcement officers and show them our support. That is why I have  introduced the Protect and Serve Act with 16 of my Republican  colleagues.   The Protect and Serve Act would punish criminals who target law  enforcement officers and harm them. These criminals will receive up to  10 years in prison, and if they murder or kidnap a law enforcement  officer, they will get a life sentence.   It is sad that Congress even needs to consider a bill to protect  police officers, but let me be clear: Attacks against any law  enforcement officers are no laughing matter. Congress must pass the  Protect and Serve Act immediately and boldly say there is no escape  from justice for dangerous criminals who intentionally assault or kill  a law enforcement officer.   Today, I call on every single Democrat to support this commonsense  legislation. The question is simple: Do you support the men and women  in blue who fight every day to keep our communities safe or do you  support lawless, reckless, liberal mobs who want to defund the police?   It is a yes-or-no question. You either back the blue or you back  anarchy.   As long as I am a U.S. Senator I will do everything I can to protect  our men and women who protect our communities every single day. I  expect and they deserve no less.   I hope my Democratic colleagues can stand up to AOC, the Squad, and  their radical liberal base and do the same. It is time to back the  blue. It is time to restore safety in our communities. It is time to  end the killing of law enforcement officers and people just trying to  protect us every single day.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I rise today to honor the  achievements of the organizations and people who led the successful  redevelopment of Historic Ashe Hospital in Jefferson, NC. This once  abandoned property on the National Register of Historic Places today  provides 46 affordable homes for seniors, people with disabilities, and  homeless individuals at a time when affordable housing is needed more  than ever.   This incredible property was developed through the use of the Low- Income Housing Tax Credit, known as the Housing Credit. In North  Carolina and across the country, it is one of our most important tools  in the fight to provide affordable housing for at-risk families in our  communities. More than 87,000 North Carolina homes have been developed  using the Housing Credit, and more than 3 million homes nationwide.  They serve our low-income  [[Page S5829]]  seniors, veterans, disabled individuals, and working families.   That is why I am pleased to announce that this important site has  been recognized by the Affordable Housing Tax Credit Coalition as a  2020 recipient of the Charles L. Edson Tax Credit Award, which  recognizes excellence in the affordable housing industry and  organizations that have demonstrated the most impactful use of the  Housing Credit.   Historic Ashe Hospital in Jefferson is no exception. The historic  building includes a community room for residents to gather, office  space for those now working from home, a library for residents of all  ages, and a memory room with artifacts from the original hospital. Wide  hallways, tall ceilings, and large windows remind residents of the  great public spaces of the past and beautiful views of the Blue Ridge  Mountains.   Historic Ashe is also located across the street from the Appalachian  District Health Department, which delivers services including case  management, skilled nursing, physical and occupational therapy, and  respite care. Vaya Health of western North Carolina provides a variety  of mental health services on-site, and other community partners provide  GED classes to those interested, transportation to the local senior  center, volunteer opportunities, and a variety of other education and  support services.   It is truly a monumental achievement in terms of creative property  development and the judicious use of public and private funding to  benefit the residents of Jefferson, while contributing to the Nation's  vital supply of affordable housing.   Several groups and individuals were instrumental in bringing the  project to fruition, including Northwestern Housing Enterprises,  Incorporated, Redstone Equity Partners, Foss & Company, Bank of  Tennessee, Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati, Tise-Kiester  Architects of Chapel Hill, and notably E. G. ``Ned'' Fowler, President  of Northwestern Housing Enterprises.   To everyone involved in the development of Historic Ashe Hospital for  affordable housing in Jefferson, I offer my congratulations and  gratitude on behalf of the people of North Carolina. Thank you.                            ____________________
