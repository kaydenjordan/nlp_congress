 Mr. President, I rise today because our national parks  have been neglected for far too long.   Due to years of chronic underfunding, the Park Service has been  forced to defer maintenance on thousands of assets, including trails,  buildings, and historic structures, as well as thousands of miles of  roads and bridges.   Today, the National Park Service faces a deferred maintenance backlog  of nearly $12 billion. Incredibly, more than half of all Park Service  assets are in dire need of repairs. Every member of this body has a  national park in their State with a maintenance backlog of over a  million dollars.   I will give you a few examples from my home State of Virginia.   At Richmond National Battlefield, the deferred maintenance backlog  tops $6.5 million. At Petersburg Battlefield, one of our most historic  national battlefields, the backlog is nearly $12 million, with well  over half of these costs associated with the maintenance of historic  buildings and landscapes.   Look at Shenandoah National Park, which is truly one of the crown  jewels  [[Page S7768]]  of the National Park Service. Unfortunately, Shenandoah has accumulated  over $79 million in deferred maintenance, which can impact the ability  of visitors to take in the breathtaking sights along Skyline Drive or  explore the historic Appalachian Trail.   The Blue Ridge Parkway, ``America's Favorite Drive,'' has over $460  million in deferred maintenance needs. That is almost $1 million per  mile of the parkway. Over $186 million is needed in Virginia to address  the parkway's backlog and ensure visitors can continue to enjoy the  beauty of the Appalachian Highlands.   I will give one final example: Colonial National Historical Park,  which is home to Historic Jamestown and the Yorktown Battlefield. At  that park alone, we have deferred maintenance needs totaling over $420  million.   In just the last year, the maintenance backlog at Park Service sites  in Virginia grew by $250 million, to over a billion dollars. Virginia  now ranks third among all States in total deferred maintenance,  trailing only California and the District of Columbia.   We hear lots of talk in Washington about rebuilding our  infrastructure, but sometimes, we forget that a great way to begin is  by revitalizing our national parks, an investment which can generate  $10 in economic activity for every public dollar invested. A recent  study found that fixing our national parks would create over 100,000  jobs nationwide. In Virginia, we could create nearly 10,000 jobs just  by clearing the maintenance backlog.   To that end, last year Senators Portman, King, Alexander, and I  introduced the National Park Service Legacy Act, which would utilize  otherwise unobligated Federal mineral revenues to reduce the backlog  over a 30-year period.   Since then, we have worked with a broad coalition of stakeholders,  including the administration, to produce this bipartisan consensus bill  to reduce the maintenance backlog at the Park Service.   Like the Legacy Act, the Restore Our Parks Act would create a fund at  the Treasury Department, which would be used exclusively to address  high-priority deferred maintenance needs. This fund would receive 50  percent of all unobligated annual Federal mineral revenues.   It is important to emphasize that the fund would only receive  unobligated mineral revenues, meaning that allocations for other  programs, such as the Land and Water Conservation Fund, would not be  affected by this legislation.   In total, the bill is expected to raise $6.5 billion over 5 years,  enough to address more than half of the current deferred maintenance  backlog and completely fund the highest priority deferred maintenance  projects.   This represents one of the most significant investments in the  infrastructure of our national parks in the 100-year history of the  Park Service. That is one reason why it has gained the support of over  100 organizations, including the Pew Charitable Trusts, the National  Parks Conservation Association, and many others.   More importantly, a recent poll found overwhelming support for this  legislation among the American people; 76 percent of Americans support  the Restore Our Parks Act.   While this legislation will not address all of the funding problems  plaguing the Park Service, it is an important first step to addressing  our deferred maintenance backlog.   Again, I want to reiterate my appreciation to Senator Portman,  Senator Alexander, and Senator King for their work recognizing the  importance of properly funding and maintaining our National Park  System. I also want to thank the administration for its support and  willingness to advance this important legislation on a bipartisan  basis.   I think we all agree that the time for action is now. Congress cannot  continue to deny the Park Service the resources it needs to properly  maintain these national treasures for future generations.   I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass this commonsense  legislation.                           Tribute to Senator Hatch
