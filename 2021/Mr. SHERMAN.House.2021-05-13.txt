 Mr. Speaker, Hamas has fired 1,600 rockets into Israel.  Each rocket is a war crime, for each was fired solely for the purpose  of killing as many civilians as possible.   President Biden has declared, unwaveringly, our support for Israel's  right to defend itself. We grieve every civilian death, Israeli and  Palestinian. We cannot accept at face value reports of Palestinian  deaths since they come from Hamas, a terrorist organization, recognized  as such by both the U.S. and the EU.   Hamas has caused many Palestinian deaths since one-quarter of its  rockets aimed at Israel actually explode in Gaza, and because Hamas  locates its military operations in civilian neighborhoods, using human  shields.   Mr. Speaker, I want to commend Israel for its efforts to avoid  civilian casualties while striking successfully at terrorists. I want  to commend this Congress for funding Iron Dome, which has successfully  avoided so many Israeli civilian deaths.                            ____________________
