 Madam Speaker, Democrats claim their bill  will cost $1.7 trillion. That number, by itself, should cause alarm.  But this number is reached through budget gimmicks.   If Democrats succeed in making the provisions of this bill permanent,  as they have publicly said they intend to do, then the cost will be  much, much higher.   The Penn-Wharton Budget Model estimates total spending for this bill  would be $4.6 trillion over 10 years if the provisions are made  permanent. The Committee for a Responsible Budget estimates the cost at  $4.9 trillion.   If Democrats are going to spend this kind of money, they should at  least be honest about the true cost to the American people. I urge my  colleagues to reject this reckless spending.
