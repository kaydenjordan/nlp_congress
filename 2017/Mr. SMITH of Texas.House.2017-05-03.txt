 Mr. Speaker, are we losing our democracy?   CNN has censored and refused to air an ad by Trump for President,  claiming that it is inaccurate. Of course, that is their opinion and  they are entitled to it. What they are not entitled to do is violate  the Constitution's protection of free speech.   Where are all the editorial boards of the media who rightly advocate  for free speech? Why are most silent?   To censor a political ad because CNN disagrees with it is to threaten  our democratic form of government.                            ____________________
