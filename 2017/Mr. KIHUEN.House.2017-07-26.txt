 Mr. Chair, I thank the ranking member and the chairman  for accepting my amendment.   Mr. Chairman, veterans have made an incredible sacrifice for our  country, and they deserve the highest quality treatment and care when  they return to their civilian lives.   The Department of Veterans Affairs has the obligation to provide  critical services to veterans and ensure that America's veterans have  access to high-quality and affordable healthcare in their communities.   Recently, the VA decided not to renew its contract with the Ely  Community Clinic in my district, and it is forcing veterans in Ely and  the surrounding communities to rely solely on the Choice Program to  access care.   We owe it to our veterans not to use the Choice Program as a crutch,  but to make the proper investment in the healthcare of our veterans and  the healthcare that they deserve. Veterans  [[Page H6420]]  have already fought for their country. They shouldn't have to fight to  keep their VA clinic in Ely.   The intention behind my amendment is to remind the VA that they have  the responsibility to continue operating the healthcare clinic in Ely,  Nevada, and to emphasize the importance of continuing to provide care  in rural communities across the country.   The Choice Program was not intended to allow the VA to shirk its  responsibility for certain veterans; instead, it was supposed to help  veterans who have nowhere else to turn.   I was sent to Congress by the people of the Fourth Congressional  District to fight for Nevada's veterans, and I will continue fighting  to ensure that veterans in rural Nevada and communities across the  country do not lose access to the VA and make sure that they receive  the healthcare that they have earned and deserve.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, my amendment strikes language in the bill  that would prohibit the closure of the Yucca Mountain project, which  includes the storage of high-level nuclear waste in my district.   As you may know, in 1987, Nevada was targeted as our Nation's nuclear  waste dump through the ``Screw Nevada'' bill. In the 30 years since the  bill passed, Congress has wasted $3.7 billion of taxpayer money.   Yucca Mountain sits in a seismically active area less than 100 miles  away from Las Vegas, which holds an urban area with over 2 million  residents. Mr. Chairman, just last week, there was an earthquake 33  miles away from Yucca Mountain. This place is not safe for our nuclear  waste.   Moreover, the city sees tens of thousands of visitors traveling to  Las Vegas each and every year, many of whom are your constituents from  your districts. In 2016 alone, over 40 million visitors traveled to Las  Vegas.   I have grave concerns with the transportation of nuclear waste to  Yucca Mountain should this project continue against the will of my  constituents. This project will not just impact my constituents. It  impacts constituents in 329 congressional districts in 44 different  States and Washington, D.C. Putting a nuclear repository in our  backyard means that this high-level nuclear waste must travel through  your backyards first.   Your constituents will see high-level nuclear waste transported  through their communities on rail and truck. A simple car crash or  train derailment would leave your constituents at risk and cost our  taxpayers more money to clean up the mess.   As it stands, Mr. Chairman, this transportation plan also damages our  national security and the ability of the Nevada Test and Training  Range, the largest air and ground range in the contiguous United  States, to meet and train our servicemembers.                                time  2215    Mr. Chairman, I have been to Yucca Mountain. I have driven through  the desert that is home to the bighorn sheep and desert tortoises and  ancient petroglyphs and relics of the westward expansion. It is clear  that reopening Yucca Mountain threatens the health and safety of  Nevadans and Americans from across the country.   Our State, which has no nuclear energy-producing facilities, should  not be the dumping ground for the rest of the country's nuclear waste.  And the bottom line is this: If any of my colleagues would support this  bill to bring Yucca Mountain nuclear waste to our State, then I am sure  you support bringing it to your State. I am sure we can find a location  in your State, and I would love to work with you on that. I am sure you  wouldn't like your neighbors bringing their trash to your backyard.  Don't bring it to my backyard either. Don't bring it to my  constituents. Don't bring it to Nevada.   I urge your support for my amendment. Prevent billions and billions  of dollars, taxpayer dollars, being wasted by continuing to pursue the  Yucca Mountain project.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield the balance of my time to the  gentlewoman from Nevada (Ms. Rosen), my esteemed colleague.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
