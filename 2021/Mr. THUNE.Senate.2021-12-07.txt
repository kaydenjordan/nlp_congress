 Mr. President, before I begin, I want to take just a few  minutes to honor two members of the ``greatest generation'' whom we  lost recently, Marcella LeBeau and Bob Dole.   Marcella LeBeau died on Sunday, November 21. She was from my home  State of South Dakota and a member of the Two Kettle Band of the  Cheyenne River Sioux who served in the Army Nurse Corps during World  War II, including time on the frontlines treating the wounded at the  Battle of the Bulge. She was decorated by both France and Belgium for  her service.   After the war, she returned to South Dakota, spending 31 years  working for the Indian Health Service, including as Director of  Nursing, while raising eight children.   She was a powerful advocate for Native Americans throughout her  entire life and was a member of the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribal Council  for 4 years and a founding member of the North American Women's  Association.   Even in retirement, Marcella continued to advocate for Native  Americans and also found time to open a quilting shop with her  granddaughter featuring, among other things, the Lakota star quilt,  used for honoring and naming ceremonies, memorials, and various life  achievements.   Earlier in November, she traveled to Oklahoma to attend the ceremony  for her induction into the National Native American Hall of Fame.    The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator  from Oklahoma (Mr. Lankford).   The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 52, nays 47, as follows:                        [Rollcall Vote No. 482 Ex.]                                  YEAS--52       Baldwin      Bennet      Blumenthal      Booker      Brown      Cantwell      Cardin      Carper      Casey      Cassidy      Collins      Coons      Cortez Masto      Duckworth      Durbin      Feinstein      Gillibrand      Hassan      Heinrich      Hickenlooper      Hirono      Kaine      Kelly      King      Klobuchar      Leahy      Lujan      Manchin      Markey      Menendez      Merkley      Murphy      Murray      Ossoff      Padilla      Peters      Reed      Rosen      Sanders      Schatz      Schumer      Shaheen      Sinema      Smith      Stabenow      Tester      Van Hollen      Warner      Warnock      Warren      Whitehouse      Wyden                                  NAYS--47       Barrasso      Blackburn      Blunt      Boozman      Braun      Burr      Capito      Cornyn      Cotton      Cramer      Crapo      Cruz      Daines      Ernst      Fischer      Graham      Grassley      Hagerty      Hawley      Hoeven      Hyde-Smith      Inhofe      Johnson      Kennedy      Lee      Lummis      Marshall      McConnell      Moran      Murkowski      Paul      Portman      Risch      Romney      Rounds      Rubio      Sasse      Scott (FL)      Scott (SC)      Shelby      Sullivan      Thune      Tillis      Toomey      Tuberville      Wicker      Young                               NOT VOTING--1               Lankford            The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator  from Arkansas (Mr. Cotton) and the Senator from Oklahoma (Mr.  Lankford).
