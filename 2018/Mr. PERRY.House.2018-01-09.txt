 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, simple things mean a lot. That is why I, too, stand in  support of H. Res. 676, which sends a clear message that the United  States strongly condemns the arrest of peaceful protestors by the rogue  Iranian regime.   Mr. Speaker, the Iranian people deserve to be free. The last  administration witnessed such protests about 8 years ago and turned its  back. The world saw that America turned their back on the freedom  effort and movement in Iran.   The current administration has noticed immediately and recognized  immediately, and we are here today to say that no longer will terrorism  be appeased; no longer should we help pay for the funding of Hezbollah  and Hamas through payments in the Iran nuclear deal.   Simple things mean a lot, and simple things like this resolution, Mr.  Speaker, mean that we stand with the Iranian people who breathe and  live to be free, just like we do.
