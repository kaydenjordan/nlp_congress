 Mr. Speaker, Americans are sick and tired of seeing the  Biden administration spend millions of their taxpayer dollars to fund  and enable an invasion of our southern border.  [[Page H2277]]    This administration is using nongovernmental organizations, NGOs, to  push illegal immigrants all over the country. A report by The Heritage  Foundation found that these illegal aliens were shipped to 431 out of  435 congressional districts. This report also shows the overwhelming  number of resettled illegal immigrants were sent to, oddly enough,  Republican districts. This is a massive resettlement program, Mr.  Speaker.   Under President Biden, the number of illegal immigrants entering the  U.S. exceeds the population of some U.S. States.   We have had over 5 million illegal crossings plus over 1.3 million  got-aways.   Title 42 ends tonight, as we all know, and the flood will get worse.  We have seen the pictures, Mr. Speaker. We have no idea who these  people are, where they are going, or what they will do. The situation  will take a huge toll on our Nation and touch every community in every  State.   We have caught people in the past that have been on the terrorist  watch list. We have Communist Chinese coming over our border. We don't  know what they are up to, as well.   Mr. Speaker, we owe it to the American people to finish the wall, end  catch-and-release policies, and close the asylum loopholes that are big  enough for a caravan to walk through.   President Biden and Secretary Mayorkas have dug a big hole for the  American people. If we want to save this country, we need extreme  border security measures to stop this open invasion now.
