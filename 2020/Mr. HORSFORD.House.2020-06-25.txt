 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in favor of the  Justice in Policing Act. I want to commend our chairwoman of the  Congressional Black Caucus for her tremendous leadership.   George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, Rayshard Brooks, Elijah  McClain, for them, and for all of the other Black lives that matter, we  need, and this bill provides, concrete Federal reforms to address the  root causes of these injustices.   George Floyd and so many others like him should be alive today. With  the Justice in Policing Act, we can, like the Reverend Dr. Martin  Luther King said, bend the arc of justice, when all Americans will be  treated with humanity and dignity by law enforcement.   During this moment of national anguish, we must insist on bold  change. This legislation is necessary to save lives and to seek  justice, and I am proud to cast my vote in favor of this legislation  today.
