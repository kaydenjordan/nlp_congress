 And still I rise, Madam Speaker, because I love  my country and because I have reason to be concerned, and I believe  that every American has reason to be concerned about the issue that I  shall address today.   Those of us who are in the House of Representatives should be  especially concerned because the issue involves war and peace. It  involves the sons and daughters of Mr. and Mrs. America--war and peace.   We have, by and through our Chief Executive Officer, the President of  the United States of America, caused a Nimitz-class battle group to go  into the Gulf region.   For those who do not know, this is the ultimate expression of  American military prowess, a Nimitz-class battle group. Above it, we  have the generationally reliable B-52 bomber. They can rain lethality  on anything within their range. Beneath the battle group, you have,  lurking, a submarine that can launch without surfacing.   But the centerpiece of a Nimitz-class battle group, especially this  one, is the USS Abraham Lincoln. The Abraham Lincoln is an aircraft  carrier that is 1,092 feet long. It can carry 90 fixed- and rotary- winged aircraft. The Abraham Lincoln has two A-4 Westinghouse nuclear  reactors. When it is fueled and it is sent out on a mission, it does  not have to come back for 25 years. It is the centerpiece of American  military prowess.   To borrow a term from where I grew up, you don't send the Abraham  Lincoln if you are shucking. You send it when  [[Page H4925]]  you are not bluffing. You don't send the Abraham Lincoln, Madam  Speaker, unless you want to make a statement.   This is the ultimate in American military prowess. It has the ability  to rain lethality unlike the human mind can imagine. This is the  Abraham Lincoln, a Nimitz-class aircraft carrier, a part of a battle  group. It is the equivalent of sending a military base. You don't send  it to bluff.   This is why we must be concerned. We have to be concerned because, if  you send it because you are bluffing, Madam Speaker, you are playing  with American military prowess; and if you send it because you are  going to use it, you have to come to Congress. Congress has to give the  word.   We don't play with this kind of lethality. There is a reality  associated with this lethality that we cannot imagine. We have no way  of predicting what can happen if we use this ultimate form of military  force.   We obviously have it to defend ourselves and defend our allies. I  don't object to the defensive nature of military action, but I am  concerned if you send in this level of lethality because you are  bluffing.   So I am calling on all Americans to please pay attention to what is  happening in the Gulf region, and I am saying to my brethren and my  sisters here in Congress: We are going to regret it if this level of  lethality is being used and we did not exercise our duty, our  obligation, and our responsibility to review impeachment of this  President. We are going to regret it if it happens.   This is the ultimate in lethality. You don't send it because you are  bluffing. It is time for us to do what we should do here in this  Congress: require an Authorization for Use of Military Force; make sure  that we play our role in this process. This is the Congress. We declare  war. Don't let all of our authority be usurped by the executive branch.   We ought to have some sense of duty to what the Constitution requires  of us. We see what is coming, and we are going to regret it if this  ultimate in lethality is utilized in this Gulf region for a bluff that,  unfortunately, was called.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, and still I rise. It is a  preeminent privilege to stand here and address this august body--to  address those who are within the sound of my voice would probably be  more appropriate--and those who are onlookers by way of various means  of telecommunications. It is an honor and a privilege to do so, and I  am grateful to the leadership of this House for extending and allowing  the privilege. I believe that it is one of the great honors of being a  Congressperson, to be able to stand and address the Nation, if you  will.   So tonight, as a Member of this body, it is my honor to speak on a  topic very near and dear to my heart and the hearts of a good many  Americans. I would like to talk about some of the current factors that  are impeding impeachment.   I have mnemonic notes that I will refer to from time to time so as to  address seven different topics that are factors currently impeding  impeachment.   The first that I shall address is the belief by many that not enough  bipartisanship exists as it relates to impeachment, not enough persons  from both sides of the aisle, and, more specifically, not enough  persons who are representative of the Republican Party.   There is this belief that impeachment must be an effort that is  bipartisan, and it must be to some significant amount of  bipartisanship. That amount has not been announced, so it is hard to  say what the significant amount of bipartisanship is that is being  sought.   But I think that at this point, so as to address the question of  bipartisanship, which I believe in, would hope for--I think that  bipartisanship is a wonderful thing. But to address it, I believe we  will have to go to Federalist 65.   For those who are interested, the Federalist Papers consists of some  85 articles that were published between 1787 and 1788, published by the  first Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, John Jay. He was also  assisted by the first Secretary of the Treasury, Alexander Hamilton.  And, of course, the third part of this group of persons was Madison,  the fourth President of the United States.   These persons, the three of them, the trio, were to, if you will,  present reasons to the country why the Constitution should be ratified;  and in presenting reasons for ratification, they published Federalist  65.   Federalist 65 explains what impeachment is all about. It does a  little bit more than just explains what it is about. It explains what  one might expect, what we might expect if impeachment is sought.   And I must say, at this point, that these three Framers of the  Constitution were prophetic, absolutely persons who could see into the  future, one might think, because they prognosticated what we are having  to concern ourselves with currently in terms of what will happen among  the people and in society should we move toward impeachment.   Prophetic--they had their flaws; they were not perfect; but on this  issue, they seemed to have been prophetic, because they prognosticated  that at a time such as this, there would be division, that you would  have parties separating in their own corners, if you will, that the  people among us in society, that they would have very hard opinions;  that people would sometimes base their opinions upon the circumstances,  and others, just based upon the knowledge that they might have of the  person who is being impeached.   They prognosticated that this would not be a time of great unity,  that it is more likely to be a time of division. And they knew,  however, that the Constitution could survive this.   The Constitution survived the impeachment of Andrew Johnson in 1868.  It was rancorous; there was a lot of divisiveness; but the Constitution  survived. The Constitution is capable of surviving it, and the people,  more importantly, are capable of surviving. And society is capable of  surviving, which means the country can survive impeachment.   But it is there for a reason. It is there because there is a belief  that, from time to time, you may have one  [[Page H5000]]  holding public trust in the highest office of the land, the Chief  Executive Officer, known as the President. The Chief Executive Officer  may engage in conduct that would cause the trust in the Chief Executive  Officer to be assumed less than what it should be.   The Chief Executive Officer might breach his trust that the public  has in him. The Chief Executive Officer would do harm to society, and  in doing harm to society, the Framers of the Constitution concluded  that there should be a means by which the Chief Executive Officer could  be removed, and this, of course, would be impeachment.   Impeachment is not something that anyone relishes. We don't seek  impeachment. It is sometimes forced upon us, something that you have to  do if you truly believe that no one is above the law.   Let's look at some of the historic impeachment cases. There are but  two: Johnson in 1868, and Clinton in 1998. And in both of these, the  parties were separated. There was not a moment when the Republicans and  Democrats decided: Yes, this is what we must do, and we will unite and  get it done.   Andrew Johnson was not impeached, and the impeachment failed by one  vote.   President Clinton was not impeached, but there was not this rush of  Democrats to support Republicans to impeach President Clinton. It just  didn't happen.   So an expectation of national unity is probably setting the standard  so high that we may not ever impeach.   The Framers understood that there might not be this unity, probably  wouldn't be, and prognosticated that unity would not exist in  Federalist 65. So we are setting the bar pretty high when we decide  this must be done.   By the way, no one can impose that standard upon us. That is a  standard that we can accept, but it doesn't have to be a standard for  the Members who would vote for impeachment. That is absolutely not the  case. There is no one person who can impose such a standard on this  body.   Each person has the opportunity to make up his or her mind based upon  the evidence presented using the standard that he or she believes to be  appropriate. So imposing a standard of national unity is probably  setting the bar a bit too high.   Next, there is this notion that we should defeat, not impeach.  Defeat, not impeach.   Well, we say that no one is above the law, and I have heard a good  many Members of this body say so. It has been published: No one is  above the law.   And usually there would be the following words thereafter: No one is  above the law, and this includes the President of the United States.   Well, if no one is above the law and you believe that the President  has committed impeachable acts, then you probably wouldn't want to say  that we should defeat at the next election as opposed to impeach now-- if no one is above the law. Because, in essence, you are saying: No one  is above the law; however, I won't enforce the law. I won't honor  Article II of the Constitution. No one is above the law, but I am not  going to impose the law upon one who has committed impeachable acts.   I don't see the consistency in doing this, but it is the prerogative  of people to do what they may. I am merely explaining some of the  impediments to impeachment. This is one: Defeat, not impeach.   And if no one is above the law, as I have indicated, and I believe  this--and this includes the President--then I believe we have a duty, a  responsibility, and an obligation to move forward with impeachment. I  don't think you wait until the next election to avoid your duty,  responsibility, and obligation.   One salient point that can be made is some ugly things can happen  when you have no guardrails, when you send a signal to the Chief  Executive Officer that there is no one to hold you accountable, that  the Congress is not going to fulfill its responsibilities under the  Constitution--no guardrails.   Well, the Chief Executive Officer, who has already committed  impeachable actions, will proceed probably to do what he may and will  simply because he knows that he does not have the deterrent that the  Congress is supposed to impose by virtue of having this awesome amount  of authority to remove from him office--assuming that the President is  impeached and the Senate convicts.    But, if you don't have guardrails, you don't have a Chief Executive  Officer who is being deterred from doing things that we might find  totally inappropriate, for example, going to war. The Chief Executive  Officer could decide: I need not go to Congress to go to war. The  Congress has the duty and responsibility to declare the war, but since  Congress isn't going to do anything, why bother?   Congress is but another entity, not a coequal partner in the  government with the executive.   So I think you can't hold the position that you will defeat, not  impeach, especially when you have said, if you have, that the President  has committed these impeachable actions.   Now, there are a good many people who are walking back comments. And  everybody has a right to walk back comments--happens quite regularly  here--but you might take note of this: You can't walk back history. You  can walk back comments, but you can't walk back history.   So if you have already said that the President has committed these  impeachable actions and you have already said the President should be  impeached, you won't be able to walk that back from history.   Time tells and history judges. The truth is known. The truth will be  published at some point about what we have said and how we have  behaved.   Impeachment cannot be but a talking point to be used for political  expediency. You can't on one day say, ``Oh, yes, he ought to be  impeached,'' and then the next day say something that contradicts this  in an effort to walk it back.   Well, you can do it, but history will record both of your comments,  and history will judge you. At some point, that judgment will be  codified such that the world will know what was said on all occasions,  not just on the latest rendition of the commentary that is made.   Time tells; history judges. The truth will be known. Defeat, not  impeach is not an option if you believe that the President has  committed impeachable actions.                                time  1945    Then, there is, of course, the notion that the Senate won't convict.  There is no requirement that the Senate convict. This is something that  a person or some persons can require of themselves, a belief that since  the Senate won't convict, there is no need to impeach. But that is not  what impeachment is all about. It is about the House of Representatives  doing its job.   The House does its job quite routinely here sending bills of great  importance to the Senate that the Senate doesn't act on. It did so last  week and will do so again and again. H.R. 1 was not acted on, and a  good many others. I need not go through all of them. But the point is,  you cannot conclude because it is impeachment that you have a different  standard, in my opinion.   You have to have one standard. Either we are going to decide we will  not send things to the Senate, and cease and desist, I suppose being  the House of Representatives, which I would not abide with, but that, I  suppose, would be a decision that you might make, one might make, but  not one for me to make.   I think that we have a responsibility to do our jobs, and then we  give the Senate the opportunity to do its job. If we do our job, we do  more than simply impeach, which is important. We act as a deterrent  that impeachment is to deter the next President; to let the next  President know that the House of Representatives will not shy away from  its responsibility; that it will do what it is supposed to do when a  President commits impeachable actions.   So this notion that the Senate won't act is a reason for us not to  act, would mean then that the Senate controls impeachment, which is the  responsibility of the House of Representatives.   Do we want to give the Senate the authority to do its will and not  have the House do its will? Do we want the Senate's will to become the  will of the House? What we are saying is, until we can get a Senate  that will follow our lead, we will not take the lead and do as we  should, do what we, according to Article II section 4, and in my  opinion, must.  [[Page H5001]]    We cannot allow the Senate to control the House of Representatives no  more than we can allow another party, if I am on one side of the aisle  and we have a party on the other side, we can't allow another party to  dictate what we would do on this side of the aisle.   If you have overwhelming majority, you cannot blame the other side  for your failure to act. That is my opinion. If we have an overwhelming  majority, then at some point, it will be noted in history that we  didn't act. And it won't be said in history that we didn't act because  the minority prohibited us from acting here in the House.   It won't be said that we failed to act because the Senate had the  authority to prevent us from acting. The Senate does not trump the  House of Representatives. We cannot decide that only the Senate can  determine whether the House should move forward. This is not what the  Framers intended. But this is, in effect, what we will be doing if we  predicate our actions upon the actions of the Senate.   I don't think that is appropriate and I take issue with the notion  that we must wait until the Senate is ready to act before we can act.   By the way, no one knows what the Senate would do until the Senate  has an opportunity to do it. Once the Senate is confronted with having  to vote, we may find that the Senate will take a different course of  conduct than that we have presupposed the Senate will do or take.   The Senate could very well have an epiphanous moment. Probably not,  but it could, meaning some two-thirds of it, and act. But whether it  does or doesn't, we have a duty to do our job and then let the Senate  take a vote, go on record, and we will let the chips fall where they  may in history.   I think all of us, we should all be on record. We know what the  circumstances are. We know the harm that is being caused in society. We  know that the trust has been breached, and we only have to now do what  the Framers have given us the way to do, assuming that we have the will  to do it.   They gave us the way, but they could not give us the will. We have to  have the will to act ourselves. Impeachment in the Senate, where the  trial is to take place, is not to be predicated upon the House  following the will of the Senate.   Now, there is another reason that I would like to call to your  attention, another impediment, and it is the notion that impeachment  will divide our Nation. I have covered this to a limited extent, but I  will go back because some things bear repeating.   In Federalist No. 65, the Framers of the Constitution made it very  clear that you will not have, as they saw it at that time, this  national unity. It doesn't work that way. People are going to take  sides. And when they do, you are likely to have things develop along  party lines. But we have to still do our job. We cannot set standards  that may be impossible.   We can't have the standard be the Senate must decide it will go along  with us before we will act. That is not a reasonable standard for us to  have as Members of the House. We are independent. We can't have the  standard that we can only do this if we have the consent of the  opposing party.   What you are doing is putting the fate of the country in the hands of  the minority. You are putting the fate of the country in the hands of  the Senate when the House has a duty to act.   So I conclude with this on this point, the notion that it will divide  the Nation is something that was prognosticated. Now, I would love to  have the country in unity. I believe in unity, and I think you can have  unity without uniformity. We don't all have to do the same thing all  the time to have unity on certain issues.   But there is no constitutional requirement that we have the minority  support what the majority can do, and the Senate be aligned with the  House before the House can act. There is no constitutional requirement  for such a thing.   Next, we have the notion that impeachment can benefit the Chief  Executive Officer. Impeachment will benefit the Chief Executive  Officer. It is hard to imagine a Chief Executive Officer wanting to be  impeached.    I have seen and heard statements from the Chief Executive Officer  that would give me reason to believe that the Chief Executive Officer  really does not want to be impeached.   There is something called reverse psychology that we are all familiar  with. Say that you want the thing that you don't want, to the extent  that you convince the people who can have the impact to do the thing  that you do want them to do, which is the thing that they think you  don't want them to do.   My point is simply this: We cannot assume that we are walking into  some sort of petard, by virtue of our taking up our constitutional  responsibility. This is not a trap. This is our responsibility, and we  should not allow a Chief Executive Officer to convince us that we  should do this because the Chief Executive Officer thinks that it would  benefit him, when, in fact, the history of impeachment seems to provide  evidence to the contrary.   The history of events is that Andrew Johnson did not get reelected  after he was impeached.   And for those who have been in this debate about what happened with  President Clinton, I assure you, his Vice President did not get  elected. One would assume that the mantle would be passed on to the  Vice President. Such was not the case. He was not elected.   There are those who would say: Well, but the House of  Representatives--no, the House didn't change hands. The Republicans  maintained control of the House of Representatives. Well, they lost  some seats. Well, they did, but they still had 218 and they controlled  the House.   The point is, you cannot assume that impeachment is going to be a  benefit. As a matter of fact, it is an indelible stain on the record of  the Chief Executive Officer. It would be forever known, whether he is  removed from office or not, that this Chief Executive Officer was  impeached. It will have an impact on the Chief Executive Officer's  brand. This person will forever have the brand of an impeached Chief  Executive Officer.   I am not saying you do it just to brand a person. I am talking about  impeachment, because we would fulfill the responsibilities under  Article II section 4, which indicate that the President can be  impeached for high crimes and misdemeanors, bribery, treason. We would  fulfill those responsibilities pursuant to Article II section 4.   In so doing, we would indelibly place the brand of impeachment on the  Chief Executive Officer. Whether he is convicted and removed or not, he  still suffers eternally throughout all of time the fact that  impeachment was imposed upon him, which I think is an appropriate  remedy. Even if we don't get a conviction I think we should let the  world know that the House took up its responsibility. The House of  Representatives did its job.   Of course, there is this notion now, another standard, that you have  to have what I am calling a rock-solid case. I hear commentary that  would lead me to believe that this has to be done only when you have  evidence beyond all doubt; not a reasonable doubt, which is what we  might have in court; not by clear and convincing evidence; clearly, not  by the preponderance of the evidence, which is a very low standard, but  beyond all doubt.   I am hearing persons speak such that one could conclude that if you  didn't see it yourself, whatever the impeachable act is, that we need  more evidence.   We have the Mueller report. We were told, let's wait for the Mueller  report. We waited for the Mueller report. And then, well, we need to  hear from Mr. Mueller. Mr. Mueller has spoken and has pretty much said:  What you see is what you will get. He may ratify what is there, but it  doesn't appear, based upon what I heard him say, that he will be giving  nuanced testimony above and beyond what is contained in the report.   For those who want to hear from Mr. Mueller, I wouldn't get in the  way of that. Let's have Mr. Mueller come and testify. But the truth is,  the report, in and of itself, is evidence, because all of the  statements contained in the Mueller report were taken from persons who  were giving their testimony at the expense of committing perjury if  they didn't give truthful statements.   So perjury was a consequence of giving an untruthful statement to the  FBI  [[Page H5002]]  agents who were asking these questions. And the Mueller report is  pretty good evidence. We could use that to impeach if we chose to do  so.   I believe that the Mueller report contains some 10 opportunities for  this Congress to engage in impeachment, bringing impeachment to the  floor of this House for a vote. And for edification purposes, the  President doesn't have to commit a crime to be impeached. We won that  battle. That was one of the first things that was said when impeachment  was called to the attention of this body some more than 2 years ago.  What crime has he committed?   Well, we know now that you don't have to commit a crime. We knew then  that you don't have to commit a crime. But it seems that there was an  effort, almost, among some to distort what the law is for purposes that  I cannot announce. But there seems to have been a desire to convince  the public that the President must commit a crime to be impeached. That  is not true.   What is the evidence of it not being true? The fact that Andrew  Johnson was impeached in article 10 of the Articles of Impeachment  against him in 1868 for speaking ill of Congress, which wasn't a crime  then, and isn't a crime now.   Speaking ill of Congress is not a crime. He was impeached for  speaking ill of Congress in article 10 of the Articles of Impeachment  against Andrew Johnson. That is the best evidence, what has happened.                                time  2000    What has happened?   What we know to be the case. So those who would like to change the  standard, you have got history to deal with, Madam Speaker. If you want  to change the standard. To change the standard, you would have to  literally erase what happened with Andrew Johnson.   There is no requirement that the President commit a crime to be  impeached. He has to do harm to society. He has to breach the public  trust--breach the public trust, cause harm to society--and you can be  impeached if you are the Chief Executive Officer. There is no  requirement that you commit a crime, no requirement that the Senate has  to agree with the House before the House can act, and no requirement  that there must be a national unity government before you can have  impeachment.   These are standards that are being set that are, quite frankly,  beyond the rationale that the Framers of the Constitution provided for  us.   Read the Federalist Papers, Madam Speaker, and you will get a better  understanding. Federalist 65 would be a good read. It is a short read,  and you will get a better understanding.   So these standards--these unreasonable standards, in my opinion--are  such that we will probably end up engaging in expediency and saying  that we want to impeach for the purpose of expediency, but not making  impeachment an action item. It is one thing to have political  expediency, but another thing to turn that into an action item. The  action item would have to be impeachment. You cannot just talk about  this with certainty and not act, Madam Speaker.   The final thing that must be done pursuant to the moral imperative to  act is to impeach. And I find that we are talking about this to the  extent that we will do it eventually--if we are not very careful of  what Dr. King called, engage in the paralysis of analysis--just analyze  this and set standards. All standards keep changing from time to time.   But remember this, no one can set the standard for any one of us in  the House of Representatives. All 435 of us have been given the  standard of being a Member of the House and making a decision. I say  this based upon what your conscience dictates and based upon a belief  that Article II section 4 of the Constitution has been violated.   Speaking of Article II section 4 and the President not having to  commit a crime, it is important to note this: high crimes and  misdemeanors.   By the way, Madam Speaker, you can be impeached for a high  misdemeanor. It doesn't have to be a high crime and misdemeanor. This  is what a good many persons are still saying. Not true.   How do you know that you can be impeached for a high misdemeanor?   Because Andrew Johnson was impeached for a high misdemeanor. It  doesn't have to be a high crime and misdemeanor. It can simply be a  misdemeanor. A misdemeanor, Madam Speaker, can be a minor criminal  offense or it can be a misdeed. The word ``misdemeanor'' was defined at  the time the Framers wrote the Constitution, and to this day, as a  misdeed. Andrew Johnson was impeached for a high misdeed in article 10  of the Articles of Impeachment against him.   Make notes. Write that down. Read it. Check. You will find the truth  is there for a misdeed, a high misdeed, a high misdemeanor, and a  misdemeanor is a misdeed.   Let's debunk the notion that impeachment will benefit the President.  It has been debunked. The notion that you have to have a rock-solid  case, there is no such thing as a rock-solid case or maybe some other  term similar. There is no requirement.   The notion that impeachment is not political, well, that is not what  the Framers of the Constitution said. That is not what is said in  Federalist 65. Read Federalist 65. There is no requirement that you  avoid politics. The Framers used that very word, ``political'', in  Federalist 65. So the notion that impeachment can't be political is  contrary to what the people who wrote the Constitution thought should  be contained therein.   What is interesting to me is that we have a good many people here who  believe in the intent of the law.   What was the intent?   I am starting to think that it is for convenience some of the time.  Either you are for intent or you are not, Madam Speaker. Well, the  intent of the Framers was that this would be political, and it is going  to be political. You are not going to escape the politics of it with  clever phrases. It is not going to happen. This is political the notion  that you have to have a rock-solid case. That is beyond what is  expected from the Framers. And I am not sure you are going to ever  finish your investigation if you are going to continue to investigate  until you have exhausted every possible thing before you move forward,  and nobody can set that standard for the 435 Members of this House.   Next, we have the question of bigotry in policy. There are some who  believe that it is okay to have bigotry intentionally placed in policy.  Bigotry in policy, to decide that you are going to do something that  will be bigoted as the Chief Executive Officer and you will put that  into policy, to decide you are going to ban certain people from the  country, to decide that you are going to change the rules because  people may be from what might be called a s-hole country, change the  rules for those from that s-hole country. And then to give some  indication that you have bigotry within you by announcing that people  who would say phrases like, ``blood and soil'', ``Jews will not replace  us'', protesting out in the street, calling themselves members of  groups that have been known infamously for behaving in invidious  discrimination, give us all of the evidence that we need. I guarantee  you that bigotry in policy is impeachable.   I assure you of this: I believe in the deepest corners of my soul  that if a previous President said and did the things that the Chief  Executive Officer has said and done, he would be impeached. He would be  removed from office. And I would be one of the persons to support it.  We cannot have double standards.   Madam Speaker, you can't have a standard that exists because you have  a beneficial bigot, a bigot that serves a useful purpose, a bigot that  benefits your agenda. All of your adult life you have been preaching  against certain things, and then you get a beneficial bigot, someone  that might do something such as, appoint persons to the court that you  would like to have, and then your standards change. You accept bigotry  in policy against people that I would call the least, the last, and the  lost.   You would accept it against these babies, Madam Speaker. You would  accept, accept, accept having a 4-month-old baby separated from his  parents. At 4 months old, taken out of the arms of his father. And some  time thereafter, when the father is trying to gain custody of his  child, say to the father that  [[Page H5003]]  we will have to deport you, when you take your seat on the plane, we  will bring your child to you. We will give you the child back.   This is the United States of America I am talking about. I love my  country. I don't love that kind of behavior. I have great disdain for  that level of behavior. Tell this man he is going to get his child, and  then have him deported without his baby. This was reported some 2, 3  days ago in a reputable news source--separated. We know babies are  being separated or have been separated. This is supposed to be the  youngest, 4 months old. Later on you take the 4-month-old to court, you  have a hearing. The baby is now with some people who are taking care of  the baby. And then you finally decide the baby is now 6 months of age  or there about and you will return this baby to his parents.   They have suffered greatly.   Can you imagine, someone taking your 4-month-old baby?   Can you imagine the pain, the sleepless nights, and the crying?   Can you imagine how your life would just be torn apart?   Your baby has been removed. Well, you finally get your baby back. One  would assume that this would be a joyous occasion, but the baby doesn't  recognize the parents.   Imagine the pain of reaching out to your baby, Madam Speaker, and  your baby withdraws and turns to someone else, because a government had  a policy of deterring people from coming by separating babies as young  as 4 months old from parents.   I just don't abide with this. I cannot accept this. Those who can are  a better person than I am. They are. It really does not matter what  happens to me. The story of the Good Samaritan is not the story of the  person who said: If I cross over and help this person, what is going to  happen to me?   The story of the Good Samaritan is the story of the person who said:  If I don't help this person, what is going to happen to him?   We use that parable quite a bit in this country.   The story of the person who is the brother's keeper is the story of a  person who said: Am I my brother's keeper?   Well, we know this: you can't be your brother's keeper without  keeping your brother. Brothers and sisters are our relatives. Distant  though they may be, they are a part of humanity. They are ours. We  belong to them, and they belong to us.   This kind of behavior is unacceptable. I have said before, and I will  say again and again, if these babies were coming across the northern  border we would have a different mindset. We would not have the mindset  that we have now such that we put them in cages.   I went to the border. I wanted to see for myself, and I saw babies  lying on a cement floor with some sort of tinfoil blanket over them in  conditions that the SPCA would not allow animals to exist in.   If it doesn't touch your heart, Madam Speaker, you are a better  person than I am, because it touched my heart. When I saw it, it hurt.  This is about humanity. This is about persons fleeing harm's way. This  is about a law that allows them to approach one of our agents, make a  proper announcement, and get a fair hearing.   It is not about circumventing the law, trying to find clever ways to  keep people out who are following the law. It is not about that. It is  about people. It is about humanity. It is about the greatest country in  the world and what people around the world think of us now.   I assure you, Madam Speaker, the image that we had is being  tarnished, I won't say irreparably, but I will say it is being  tarnished.   The lady with the golden lamp, or light, if you will, torch, give me  your poor, you know the rest of the story, your tired, you know the  rest of it. We have honored that. We took about 11 million people, I  believe, from Europe. We didn't separate babies from mothers. We  welcomed them.   Something has changed. Something has changed. We are witnessing  before our very eyes a change in the culture and a change in our  country, because we are witnessing before our very eyes that we seem to  think that it is okay or that it is not something that we ought to  address.   The President doesn't have to commit a crime, the Chief Executive  Officer doesn't have to commit a crime to be impeached. We but have to  have the will to do what we must, in my opinion.   By the way, my opinion is that we are more likely to impeach than  not. This is my opinion. I really do believe that in this House there  will be people who are going to conclude that they will not tolerate  the level of injustice being perpetrated.                                time  2015    I believe it. I believe that there will be a majority to do it, more  likely than not. I believe that it can and will happen. I really do.   I think that we should be deliberative, but I don't think that we  should allow the paralysis of analysis to prevent us from doing our  job.   I believe there will be enough people who are going to come forward  to say we will hold the Chief Executive accountable for this behavior  and other behavior: the whole notion that the Chief Executive can tell  members of the constabulary, the police, that when they arrest people  and they have them within their care, custody, and control, that they  don't have to be nice to them; and the whole notion that the Chief  Executive can ban people, that he can send out a tweet and kick people  out of the military who have been serving honorably or prevent people  from coming in because of who they are.   I believe that there are enough people who will find this offensive  and that they will take the action that the Framers of the Constitution  fully intended we take.   I close with this, a belief that we have been given an awesome  responsibility. We were elected to the people's House. We were elected  to do the work of the people, but we were also elected to do the  morally righteous thing.   There are some times when we have to step beyond where the people may  be at a given time because we know what is right and we are going to do  the righteous thing. Sometimes, we have to do this. We just have to  step out.   We don't take a poll, by the way. This whole notion that, until the  country is with us, we can't do that which the law requires us to do,  in my opinion, that whole notion that we can't do it until the country  is with us, well, that is taking a poll.   A poll is a snapshot in time. That is all it is, just a snapshot in  time. Are we going to allow something as necessary as impeachment to be  governed by a poll?   I thank God that Dr. King and those who crossed the Edmund Pettus  Bridge did not do so based upon a poll, that they had huddled and said,  ``Well, Dr. King, what do the polls say?''   If it is a righteous cause, the polls don't matter. We have to do  that which is right, be led by the spirit sometimes, as a friend said  to me, to do the right thing.   Polls. What if Rosa Parks had taken a poll? ``Let's take a poll  before you take that seat on the bus, risking everything.'' She had no  idea what her fate would be.   ``Take a poll, Rosa.'' Would she have taken the seat if she had  relied on polls?   What if Lincoln had said, ``Let's take a poll before we attempt to  pass the 13th Amendment.''   Polls can prevent us from doing that which is bold. Bold actions are  not predicated upon a poll. They are predicated upon the righteousness  of the cause. If the cause is righteous, we ought to do the right  thing.   Dr. King said the time is always right to do what is right.   I believe that we need not take polls, that we have enough evidence,  that we shouldn't have unreasonable standards, and that this House can  and will do its job.   I say ``more likely than not'' simply because anything is possible, I  suppose. But I just believe that there are enough people here of  goodwill who are going to decide that what we have seen is enough  before we end up seeing something that we cannot reverse, something  that could be beyond what we would want to see happen, not only to this  country but to all countries, by way of what happens to one directly  happens to all indirectly, according to Dr. King, because life is an  inescapable network of mutuality.  [[Page H5004]]    I don't want to see something happen, but I do want to say this:  Given that we know we can impeach right now, if we fail to impeach and  some dastardly thing occurs, there will be Members of this House who  will regret not having taken the appropriate action.   It is bigger than any one of us. This is about humanity. We ought to  respect the means by which we can preserve integrity, the means by  which we can preserve the lives that we have been charged with the  responsibility of caring for as Members of this body.   Let us move forward.   I greatly appreciate the leadership for giving me this opportunity to  be heard.   My dear friends, unless leadership changes the rules, I will be heard  again because I plan to come back again and again. I assure my  colleagues that if no one else does, there will be another vote on  impeachment on the floor of the House of Representatives, not because I  want to do it but because I believe I am forced to do it. I have little  choice if I want to protect the integrity of the Constitution and  preserve the notion of no person being above the law.   I believe I have a responsibility to do it. I don't like using the  personal pronoun ``I'' as it relates to this, but I have no choice. It  will be done. We will all go on Record.   I assure my colleagues, I will not approach any individual person to  try to convince a person that he or she should do a given thing. I will  talk from this podium, as I have, and I will answer those who may ask  me questions. But I do believe we have to take this duty seriously, and  we have to have a vote in the House of Representatives.   I am thankful for the time, Madam Speaker, and I greatly appreciate  the opportunity to be a Member of this august body. While I am here, I  plan to do all that I can to make sure, for the people I have been  elected to serve, that I do what is in their best interests, even if  they may not think it is in their best interests.   There are some things that are bigger than individuals. It is about a  country. It is about humanity.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
