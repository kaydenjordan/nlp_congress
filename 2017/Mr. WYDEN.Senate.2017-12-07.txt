 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, this fall, I met with Dreamers in my home  State of Oregon. At meetings in Eugene and in Portland, these young  people gave powerful accounts of how the Trump administration has  needlessly and cruelly injected fear into their lives and the lives of  their families.   Right now, these Dreamers--these young people who have done nothing  wrong, who have terrific grades, wonderful conduct, who are helping  their  [[Page S7920]]  families--are faced with the very real threat that they may be ripped  away from the only lives and the only country they have ever known.  These young people might be little more than numbers on a page to those  who spend their days waging political fights in the Nation's Capital,  but this is not just some academic topic for the thousands of young  people across the land who would be affected by these vicious policies.  This is a real-life issue with real-life consequences and real-life  dangers for many of our friends and neighbors.   It is real for those like Cynthia Aguilar, whom I met this fall at  the University of Oregon in Eugene. She spoke eloquently about how her  mother sacrificed so much for her, living paycheck to paycheck so  Cynthia could have an education and a better life.   It is real for those like Eastern Oregon University student Daysi  Bedolla, who spoke just as movingly when we met in Portland, as well as  in La Grande at a townhall I held in her community. Not only does Daysi  talk about the huge contributions that Dreamers are making in their  hometowns and college campuses, she demonstrates her contributions each  day at Eastern Oregon University as the school's student body  president.   Cynthia, Daysi, and so many others are what I call the real dream  team, and I am proud to be their teammate in this fundamental fight for  fairness. It is not a small fight. In Oregon alone, there are an  estimated 11,000 Dreamers--enough to fill almost every seat in the  Memorial Coliseum--and every one of those young people has parents and  brothers and sisters and friends in their communities. They have well- laid plans to work hard in school, make something of their lives, and  start families of their own in the United States. The strength of their  stories fuels our fight, and that is why I join colleagues today in  insisting that the Dream Act come to the floor of this Senate. This has  been a long battle.   I am proud to have been with the Dreamers every step of the way from  the Dream Act legislation to President Obama's actions on DACA. I am  also pleased to have worked with my colleagues to introduce legislation  like the Protect Dreamer Confidentiality Act. This bill would ensure  that the information Dreamers provided to the government isn't somehow  used against them for immigration enforcement.   Congress has to come together and work in a bipartisan way on a fair  path forward for Dreamers. This effort from the White House to punish  innocent young people and split families goes against the values we  cherish as Americans and further divides our country. These children  have known nothing but the United States as their home. They have done  nothing wrong and everything right. They deserve an opportunity to stay  here. Our government made a promise to Dreamers when we encouraged them  to share their stories publicly, submit to background checks, and pay  taxes. It would be wrong to go back on that promise now.   I am pleased to be on this floor to say that we are just going to  battle every step along the way until there is justice done for the  Dreamers.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I thank Senator Moran, who graciously gave  me some time, and I want to briefly talk about one other subject.   I am the ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, and I am  pleased to serve with my colleague from Louisiana who also serves on  the committee and will be a conferee on the tax bill.   I would like to bring up a matter the President introduced yesterday.  The President has long said that there was going to be a ``fantastic  tax bill''--his words, not mine--and obviously the American people  don't see it that way. Overwhelmingly, we see in surveys--I saw it in  townhall meetings over the weekend, in a community Hillary Clinton won,  in a community where Donald Trump was extremely popular--that this tax  bill was incredibly unpopular.   The President admitted yesterday that there was a ``tiny little  sliver'' of Americans who, as he said, ``just through circumstances  maybe don't get the full benefit of the tax bill.'' I am not sure what  tax plan he is talking about, but it sure can't be the one that hikes  taxes on middle-class folks that Republicans are working out in the  conference right now.   So I want to get to the numbers, just briefly, from the independent,  nonpartisan referees at the Joint Committee on Taxation. These are the  folks we pay. The numbers they have given us really aren't in line with  what the President is talking about when he says only a ``tiny little  sliver'' of Americans are going to be hurt and come out behind.   Thirteen million low- and middle-income Americans are facing an  immediate tax hike of $100 or more because of this bill. Apparently, in  the President's view, 13 million Americans is a ``tiny little sliver.''   That is just the immediate impact. The bill gets worse and worse for  middle-class folks with each passing year, and 2027 is when the numbers  put your jaw on the floor. Under this plan that the President says is  so ``fantastic,'' 150 million middle-class taxpayers either get a  couple of crumbs or they get hit with an outright tax hike. I am going  to say that once more. One hundred and fifty million Americans will get  nothing but crumbs or an outright tax hike. That is what the President  calls a ``tiny little sliver''? It is pretty close to 90 percent of the  middle class.   That is just the raw math of who is facing a tax hike. As I have  said, this bill drives a dagger into the heart of the Affordable Care  Act. Thirteen million Americans are going to lose their healthcare, and  tens of millions more will get hit with a hidden tax hike in the form  of higher insurance premiums. Then, of course, we all understand that  the coverage requirement in the Affordable Care Act that Senate  Republicans seek to remove is what makes it possible for us to get  loophole-free, airtight protection for those who faced discrimination  when they had a preexisting condition.   This is pretty troubling stuff, and it sure doesn't strike me that  when this administration says that only a ``tiny little sliver'' of  people are going to get hurt--the reality shows something very  different.   The fact is, after all the giveaways to the multinational  corporations and the well-connected and high-fliers, this bill is going  to cost more than $1 trillion. It is a real head-scratcher, how you can  spend so much money, help so few people, and convince yourself that  what you are doing is so terrific.   Peddling the idea that there is just a ``tiny little sliver'' of  people out there who don't benefit from this tax plan, in my view, is  preposterous, and the tens of millions of Americans this bill is going  to hurt deserve far better.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
