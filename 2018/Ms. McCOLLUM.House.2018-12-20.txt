 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this new  Republican continuing resolution that is going nowhere. House  Republicans continue to cater to every whim and Twitter temper tantrum  that the President throws, abdicating their responsibility to the  American people.   Last night, the Senate passed by voice vote a continuing resolution,  and the House was ready to follow suit today. And the President said he  would sign it. But, rather than keeping his word, the President appears  to have put the demands of conservative pundits over the American  people, causing a government shutdown.   It is time for Republican leadership to stand up to the President and  pass the agreed-upon continuing resolution that will bring back  economic certainty to our economy.   The President has still not used the money that Congress appropriated  for border security last year, yet Republicans are ready to give him  the same amount of funds this year, and we agreed to that. But there is  no reason to waste $5.7 billion on a border wall that experts have  stated will not do what the President has promised.   Our country faces many challenges--opioid epidemic, increasing  effects of climate change, the rising cost of prescription drugs, an  infrastructure that is crumbling--and Congress should be working on  these issues.   So let us stand together. Let us pass a responsible spending bill  that will keep the Government open, give our local and State  governments, our businesses, and, most importantly, the American  people, a sense of stability this holiday season.
