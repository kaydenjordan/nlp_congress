 Mr. President, I am proud that the Senate has passed  the FIRST STEP Act. As a cosponsor of this bill, I am heartened that  Republicans and Democrats came together to address an issue that  affects millions of Americans and their families.   Although one of my colleagues across the aisle has said that we have  an ``under-incarceration'' problem, that is simply not the case. The  United States represents only 4.4 percent of the world's population,  but we hold approximately 22 percent of the world's prisoners. Over the  past decade, Americans and Congress have taken a long hard look at who  we incarcerate and why. This review has made us realize that too many  elements of our criminal justice system are based on prejudice and have  inflicted unnecessary harm in communities across the country. We should  strive to ensure that ``liberty and justice for all'' is not just a  phrase we say, but a promise we keep to all Americans.   The FIRST STEP Act allows prisoner rehabilitation so that they can  return home ready to contribute to their communities. Education and job  training opportunities provide individuals with a real second chance.   The bill incorporates important provisions that allows for the  retroactive application of the Fair Sentencing Act, which removed the  sentencing disparity between the crack-powder and cocaine. We were able  to include provisions that prohibit the use of solitary confinement of  juvenile offenders, prohibit the shackling of pregnant and postpartum  women, and ensure that prisoners are placed in prisons closer to home.  The bill also offers low and minimal-risk offenders the possibility of  supervised release, home confinement, or release to halfway homes.   The three amendments offered to the bill by Senators Cotton and  Kennedy do not protect victims, are redundant, and are so broad as to  subvert the bill's purpose. The first amendment requires mandatory  notification to crime victims of an offender's impending release.  However, current law and agency policies already allows victims to  choose if they want to receive these updates. Mandated reporting harms  victims who do not want to receive this information. That is why this  amendment is opposed by organizations such as the Crime Survivors for  Safety and Justice and the Fairness, Dignity & Respect for Crime  Victims & Survivors Project.   The second amendment will require wardens to notify victims of early  release and review victim statements prior to determining if an  offender is eligible for pre-release custody or supervised release.  Again, this amendment diminishes the rights our current laws give  victims by allowing them determine if they want to receive this  information. Victims already have the right to submit statements of  opposition or support prior to parole or early release. Additionally,  prison wardens should not be burdened with calculating risk assessment.  The bill establishes an independent review committee that will  recommend and assess the best evidence-based tools to ensure that risk  assessments are bias-free and objective.   Lastly, the expanded ``crime of violence'' definitions offered are  vague, redundant, and would exclude the very population the bill is  designed to help. On its face, the final amendment seems to be common  sense but the language is so vague that one analysis claims that only  low-level drug offenders and white-collar criminals would be eligible  for earned credit. The amendment has a catchall to prevent anyone who  has been convicted of any offense that involved substantial risk of  physical force against a person or their property from receiving pre- release. The U.S. Sentencing Commission estimates that this amendment  would exclude 30,000 prisoners from participating in the program. I  believe that the goal of criminal justice reform is rehabilitation and  reducing recidivism and restricting incentives would defeat that  purpose. The bill has been carefully crafted to only include low-risk  offenders.   The FIRST STEP Act is by no means perfect. For example, the bill does  not include provisions to address the flaws in the money bail system or  the discrimination in housing or employment that many offenders face  upon release, nor does it prohibit the use of private prisons or  address discriminatory loopholes in our Tax Code that make it harder  for released offenders to finance their education.   But the bill's name is clear: This is the first step and not the last  in our commitment to reform our criminal justice system.                            ____________________
