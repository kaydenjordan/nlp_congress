 Mr. President, it is a historic day and busy week in  the Senate. The historic day happening is happening just south of us  right now. There is debate in the House of Representatives over  impeaching the President of the United States. It is only the third  time that has ever occurred in our Nation's multicentury history.   Current impeachment conversation is an interpretation of a phone call  President Trump had with President Zelensky; that if you twist that  phone call just the right way, it sounds like he is trying to influence  the President of Ukraine, except the President of Ukraine never said he  felt influenced by that, and they never took any action President Trump  is being accused of. Five different meetings happened in the days after  that phone call and none of those meetings ever included any  conversation about Rudy Giuliani or Hunter Biden or Joe Biden. The  money did go to Ukraine in time. It was the 11th of September, and the  deadline for it to arrive was the 30th of December. The whole time the  Ukrainians, who apparently were threatened by President Trump according  to the Articles of Impeachment, said they never knew they were  threatened.   I have a feeling that if President Trump wanted to threaten somebody,  they would know it, but apparently, in this situation, the House is  currently impeaching the President because they perceived the President  meant to do something he didn't actually do, when the whole time the  President said that, no, that was never his intent. The only one fact  witness the House called through the entire process--the one fact  witness they called--said they actually talked to the President, and  the President said: No, there is not any quid pro quo; of course I  don't want to do that.   But they are going through impeachment anyway. That will then come to  the Senate in January, and all of January will be consumed with walking  through the two Articles of Impeachment the House is choosing to send  over.   It is ironic to me that earlier today, Michael Horowitz, who is the  inspector general for the Department of Justice, was in a hearing in  the Senate, talking about the process on the Russia investigation. I  happened to be on that committee as we went through the process. It was  very ironic to me today, in the line of questions and the issues and  things that were coming up in the Horowitz report, one of the things  that probably the media will never report on, but Michael Horowitz, the  inspector general, pulled out through this process, was, in October of  2016, Christopher Steele--famous for the dossier that was an opposition  research project from the Democratic National Committee on President  Trump leading up to the election that was supposedly all this dirty  information about Russia. Christopher Steele was contacted by someone  in the State Department, the Obama-led State Department. In October of  2016, Christopher Steele was invited to the State Department where,  [[Page S7147]]  at that time, State Department officials gave Christopher Steele  information that they said was from a Turkish businessman who had been  visiting with a Russian member of the FSB that was derogatory to  President Trump, and they were encouraging Steele to take that back and  then use it before the election.   The irony of the day today for me is, while the House is impeaching  the President, at the same time that is being debated, Michael  Horowitz, the inspector general, is giving testimony about individuals  in the Obama-era State Department getting information from foreign  individuals, slipping it to individuals working on the Clinton  campaign, and literally using foreign sources to fight against  Candidate Trump from Hillary Clinton's staff at the State Department.   Sometimes the world feels more upside down than others. This is one  of those weeks. A year ago today, the Senate was working in a  bipartisan fashion to be able to pass the criminal justice reform bill,  called the FIRST STEP Act. It was a landmark piece of legislation  dealing with helping us in Federal prisons deal with recidivism. That  was a good day for us in Congress.   We started getting more job training to people who are in prison,  more opportunities for faith-based programs in our Federal  penitentiaries--just like they are in our State penitentiaries--more  opportunities for prisoners to connect with their families because the  vast majority of prisoners in our Federal prisons will be released one  day, and it would be helpful if they had job training and if they had a  faith-based background, if they choose to, and if they have connections  to make with their families. It helps us bring down the crime rate in  the days ahead. That was a year ago today in the Senate, instead of  fighting through the impeachment process that is happening now.   There are a lot of people who said to me recently that nothing is  getting done. That was true for the past couple of months while we have  been waiting on the House to be able to move on other issues, but this  week has been a pretty busy week moving through pieces of legislation.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 551 and all nominations on  the secretary's desk in the Air Force and Army; that the nominations be  confirmed; the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon  the table with no intervening action or debate; that no further motions  be in order; that any statements related to the nominations be printed  in the Record; the President be immediately notified of the Senate's  action; and the Senate then resume legislative session.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session for a period of morning business, with  Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 314, S. 153.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  committee-reported amendment be agreed to; the bill, as amended, be  considered read a third time and passed; and that the motion to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation be discharged from  further consideration of H.R. 3196 and the Senate proceed to its  immediate consideration.    Mr. President, I further ask the bill be considered  read three times and passed and the motion to reconsider be considered  made and laid upon the table, with no intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of S. 3105, introduced earlier  today.    I ask unanimous consent that the bill be considered  read a third time and passed and that the motion to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of S. Con. Res. 31, introduced  earlier today.    I ask unanimous consent that the concurrent resolution  be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider  be considered made and laid upon the table.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Judiciary Committee be discharged from further consideration of S. Res.  450 and the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration.    Mr. President, I further ask unanimous consent that the  resolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no  intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  mandatory quorum calls with respect to the cloture motions filed on the  House messages to accompany H.R. 1865 and H.R. 1158 be waived.    Mr. President, I understand there are three bills at  the desk, and I ask for their first reading en bloc.    I now ask for a second reading and, in order to place  the bill on the calendar under the provisions of rule XIV, I object to  my own request, all en bloc.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 9:30 a.m.,  Thursday, December 19; further, that following the prayer and pledge,  the morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be  approved to date, morning business be closed, and following Leader  remarks, the Senate resume consideration of the House message to  accompany H.R. 1865 with the time until 11 a.m. equally divided between  the two leaders or their designees; finally, notwithstanding the  provisions of rule XXII, the cloture motion filed during Tuesday's  session of the Senate ripen at 11 a.m. tomorrow.    If there is no further business to come before the  Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned under the  previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 8:07 p.m., adjourned until  Thursday, December 19, 2019, at 9:30 a.m.                            ____________________
