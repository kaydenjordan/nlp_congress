 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and I  thank him for his extraordinary leadership in articulating what is  right, what honors our oath of office to protect and defend the  Constitution of the United States, the separation of power contained  therein, and the integrity of our judicial system.   I also thank our distinguished ranking member of the Permanent Select  Committee on Intelligence, Mr. Schiff, for his leadership, his courage,  and his beautiful and inspirational statement this morning, full of  facts, but also full of values.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today not only as leader, but also as one who has  served on the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence as a member,  as a ranking member, and as an ex officio since the early 1990s. And I  can say, while I have seen a lot in that time, I have never seen  anything that has stooped so low on the part of the Republicans as what  they are doing today.   It is just as if they have said, you take an oath of office to the  Constitution. We took an oath of office to Donald Trump. It is  shocking. And many of these are lawyers. I don't know how they justify  or reconcile that.   And so it is with great dismay that I see them doing violence to this  body, to this Constitution, to this judiciary system, and to this  country.   They are so curious about prying into a legal case, but they don't  have the faintest interest in looking into what the Russians did to  disrupt our elections. Not one hearing, nothing. No oversight, nothing.                                time  1115    Why is that? Why is that?   Now they are saying they must, they have a right to know this, that,  and the other thing. They have no right to do that. So I am not going  to take up any more time. I said my piece on this.   But I do want to acknowledge that Mr. Schumer and I, as well as Mr.  Schiff and Senator Warner, the ranking member on the Senate side, sent  a letter to the Honorable Rosenstein, the Deputy Attorney General, and  to Christopher Wray, the Director of the FBI, saying to them: Please,  please, do not yield on any of this. Your role in preserving the  integrity and, most importantly, our justice system has become ever  more vital.   First of all, I urge a ``no'' vote, and I hope that some Republicans  will do what is right and urge a ``no'' vote on this. This is taking us  into very dangerous territory. If the Democrats wanted power, I would  say the same thing. We wouldn't want to have this access. You shouldn't  have this access. This is wrong.   Again, if you are honoring your salute and your oath of office to  Donald Trump, then vote ``yes.'' If you are honoring your oath of  office to the Constitution of the United States, then vote ``no.''                                  Congress of the United States,                                      Washington, DC, June 27, 2018.                               [Unclassified]       Hon. Rod J. Rosenstein,      Deputy Attorney General of the United States, United States           Department of Justice, Washington, DC.      Hon. Christopher Wray,      Director, Federal Bureau of Investigation,      Washington, DC.        Dear Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein and Director Wray:       Earlier this month, you provided important verbal assurances       in response to our June 5, 2018 letter to you. In that       letter, we expressed deep and ongoing concern about President       Donald Trump and his legal team's persistent efforts to       interfere with the Special Counsel's ongoing investigation       and undermine your agencies' lawful and appropriate       activities. In particular, we underscored that, if fulfilled,       demands by the President's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani,       that the White House and the President's lawyers be given       access to classified information and investigatory material       of the utmost sensitivity--including information related to       the Special Counsel's ongoing investigation that implicates       the President's own campaign and his associates--would       grossly violate our system of checks and balances, long-      standing, well-founded, and established procedure, and       fundamental norms.        You confirmed that the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the       Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) will not provide the       White House or any of the President's attorneys with access       to such sensitive information. You also assured that       briefings and materials related to this matter would not be       shared with others in Congress beyond the ``Gang of 8.''        Unfortunately, it appears that part of this assurance has       already been breached. As of June 20, 2018, the Department       has made available to a wider group of Members and staff       materials directly related, and similar in kind, to the       information that was supposed to be restricted to the ``Gang       of 8.'' This followed recent pressure from House and Senate       Republicans on DOJ and FBI not to adhere to ``Gang of 8''       restrictions on access to and dissemination of information       that can implicate sources and methods and/or ongoing       investigations.        The Department and Bureau's departure in this matter from       longstanding policy and precedent governing your agencies'       relationship with Congress risks a repeat of similar mistakes       that the DOJ Office of the Inspector General recently       identified in his review of the Clinton ``Midyear''       investigation.        In 2016, DOJ broke with past practice by making       investigative files in the Clinton investigation available to       Congress, while the Bureau, in the name of ``maximal       transparency,'' publicly disclosed information related to the       investigation at key junctures. In his June 2018 report, the       DOJ Inspector General correctly criticized this sharp       deviation from DOJ and FBI guidelines:        ``The Department and the FBI do not practice ``maximal       transparency'' in criminal investigations. It is not a value       reflected in the regulations, policies, or customs guiding       FBI actions in pending criminal investigations. To the       contrary, the guidance to agents and prosecutors is precisely       the opposite--no transparency except in rare and exceptional       circumstances due to the potential harm to both the       investigation and to the reputation of anyone under       investigation.''        This harmful cycle is now repeating itself with respect to       the criminal and counterintelligence investigation into       Russia's 2016 election interference and any links and/or       coordination between the Russian government and individuals       associated with the campaign of President Trump. The       President's congressional allies are applying growing       pressure on your agencies, in line with the President's       improper demand for ``total transparency,'' to disclose       sensitive information and material that is not usually shared       with Congress and that relate directly to the ongoing       investigation into President Trump, his own campaign, and his       associates.        Unfortunately, DOJ and FBI are increasingly bowing to this       pressure, despite the corrosive implications. Unlike the       Clinton investigation, your agencies are disclosing sensitive       material to Congress even though the Russia investigation is       ongoing under the leadership of the Special Counsel and your       oversight. And given the pending nature of the Special       Counsel's investigation, these persistent and unrelenting       document requests are not for legitimate oversight purposes.       Rather, time and again, sensitive information shared with       Congress has been selectively and misleadingly seeded into       the public domain to advance the President and his legal       team's strategy of undermining  [[Page H5842]]       public trust in DOJ and the FBI and attacking the legitimacy       of the Special Counsel and his ongoing investigation. Every       such disclosure to Congress, moreover, has and will continue       to result in demands for more information about the ongoing       investigation, which the Department and the Bureau will be       unable to satisfy without further contravening its own       policies and norms.        With every disclosure, DOJ and FBI are reinforcing a       precedent it will have to uphold, whether the Congress is in       Republican or Democratic hands, of providing materials in       pending or closed cases to the legislative branch upon       request.        As the attacks on the Special Counsel intensify, it is       imperative that you withstand pressure on DOJ and FBI to       violate established procedures and norms. Your role in       preserving the integrity of the Special Counsel's       investigation and, most importantly, our justice system has       become even more vital.        We would appreciate your written reply and your       confirmation of this understanding.            Sincerely,      Nancy Pelosi,        Democratic Leader, House of Representatives.      Adam B. Schiff,        Ranking Member, House of Representatives, Permanent Select       Committee on Intelligence.      Charles E. Schumer,        Democratic Leader, U.S. Senate.      Mark R. Warner,        Vice Chairman, U.S. Senate, Select Committee on       Intelligence.
