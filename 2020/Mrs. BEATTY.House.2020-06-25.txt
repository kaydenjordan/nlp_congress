 Mr. Speaker, it is indisputable that George Floyd should  be alive today. His killing was the result of police violence that too  many Black Americans have experienced, many in my district.   Black lives matter.   I was honored to attend George Floyd's funeral and proud to support  this historic bill in honor of his name.   Today I breathe--today we breathe--in honor of George Floyd. This  bill will honor his life. And in the words of his  [[Page H2479]]  daughter: My daddy will change the world.   I ask all of my colleagues to help change the world by ending some of  the most dangerous and egregious practices of law enforcement in our  Nation. Beyond this bill, we must get to the root of structural racism  that has plagued our country for centuries.   As I have called out in my resolution, H. Res. 990, racism is a  national crisis. We must move toward a truth and reconciliation  process.   Today, my colleagues, we go from agony to action. I support this  bill, and I ask you to join me.    Mr. Speaker, I stand here today on the United States  House floor to say thank you to my colleagues who voted for House bill  7120, Justice in Policing Act 2020. Tomorrow, I go back home to the  Third Congressional District, and I say to them, ``This is what we did  for you.''   Mr. Speaker, it was worth me marching. It was worth me kneeling for 8  minutes and 46 seconds so many times in my district. And now, today, I  can say that I was Speaker pro tem when this bill came to the floor. It  sends a great message home to my district. It tells them if we can do  this at the Federal level, then we can do this at the State, the  county, and the city level.   Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to stand here and say: From agony to  action.                            ____________________
