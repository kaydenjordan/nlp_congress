 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate National  Apprenticeship Week and to highlight the importance of registered  apprenticeships in building a diverse and talented workforce, expanding  economic opportunity, and growing a more inclusive and resilient  economy.   Registered apprenticeships allow workers to learn and earn both a  living wage and a nationally recognized credential within their  industry of choice.   Workers who go through apprenticeships earn an average starting  salary of $70,000 a year, a salary that provides them with social  mobility and economic security.   This Congress, we have passed historic legislation to fix our roads,  bridges, ports, and infrastructure; to shore up domestic semiconductor  manufacturing; and to combat climate change. The laws we pass create a  need for thousands of well-prepared and fairly compensated workers.   Mr. Speaker, during this year's National Apprenticeship Week, I urge  all of my colleagues to join me in expanding the opportunity to get  more people, including more women and people of color, on the path to a  good job by investing in registered apprenticeships.                            ____________________
