 Mr. President, today I recognize Tammy Freeman, the  Broward County Teacher of the Year from Monarch High School in Coconut  Creek, FL.   Tammy received the Teacher of the Year award because of her efforts  to challenge and encourage young learners to grow as critical thinkers.  She empowers her students by not only instilling skills to help them  become successful in life, but also by helping them see how important  their own voice truly is. Instead of giving her students the answers,  which she believes makes them dependent on her, Tammy instead empowers  her students by teaching them the process to discover the answers on  their own. According to her, this will help them become better thinkers  and learners throughout their lifetime.   Tammy believes a commitment to personalized instruction builds  students' confidence in their abilities and a strong foundation for a  lifetime of learning. Tammy is dedicated to knowing each of her  students and walks into her classroom each day with the desire to  inspire her students, the same way she was inspired by her own  teachers.   Tammy has been an English teacher at Monarch High School for 10 years  and serves as chair of the language arts department. Her passion for  her work has earned the respect and admiration of both students and  colleagues, and she has shown outstanding ability as both collaborator  and leader.   I would like to express my sincere thanks and appreciation to Tammy  for all the hard work she has done for her students, and I extend my  best wishes on her continued success in the years to come.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I recognize Lilliemarie Gore,  the Alachua County Teacher of the Year from Idylwild Elementary School  in Gainesville, FL.   When Lilliemarie was named Teacher of the Year, she thanked two of  her own teachers who played important roles in her life, Mrs. Jackson  and Mrs. Gloria Jean Merriex. Mrs. Jackson was her third-grade teacher  who inspired her to use education as a vehicle to escape the tough  Miami neighborhood where she grew up. Mrs. Merriex was a teacher  Lilliemarie worked with at Duval Elementary School who was known for  using rhymes, music, and other innovative techniques to teach math to  students.   While Lilliemarie learned about teaching concepts and theories in  college, she said the 4 years of mentoring by Gloria taught her the  fundamentals of teaching. Lilliemarie says teaching starts with having  a genuine love for students and believes that, when the children know  you love them, they are willing to jump through hoops to do whatever  needs to be done. She loves her kids with everything she has, and they  know she loves them.   Lilliemarie attended the University of Florida and earned degrees in  early elementary and special education. She is a fourth-grade teacher  at Idylwild Elementary School and has been an Alachua County Public  School teacher for 5 years.   I would like to extend my sincere thanks and appreciation to  Lilliemarie for all the fine work she has done and wish her continued  success in the years to come.                            ____________________
