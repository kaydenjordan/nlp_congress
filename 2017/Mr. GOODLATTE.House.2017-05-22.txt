The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte) and the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson  Lee) each will control 20 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous materials on H.R. 1188, currently under  consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Virginia?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous materials on H.R. 1188, currently under  consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Virginia?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   In preventing child victimization, Congress, working in tandem with  law enforcement, has long recognized the importance of monitoring sex  offenders.   In 1994, Congress passed the Jacob Wetterling Crimes Against Children  and Sexually Violent Offender Registration Act. This legislation  mandated that States track violent sex offenders and establish  guidelines for tracking those offenders.   Over the years, Congress continued its vigilance in monitoring sex  offenders, which ultimately culminated in a comprehensive piece of  legislation titled the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of  2006. Among other things, the Adam Walsh Act established a national sex  offender registry, provided for post-conviction civil commitment of  certain sex offenders, eliminated the statute of limitations for  certain sex offenses against children, and created an office at the  Justice Department specifically designed to monitor sex offenders.   Today I am proud to be here on the floor to champion the  reauthorization of this landmark legislation.   H.R. 1188, the Adam Walsh Reauthorization Act of 2017, authorizes  funds for the Department of Justice's Sex Offender Management  Assistance program and for the great work the United States Marshals do  in locating and apprehending fugitive sex offenders who do not comply  with the law's requirements.   H.R. 1188 also contains numerous measures to encourage more States  and Tribal jurisdictions to comply with the requirements of the Federal  system, in part by making changes to the law to address concerns some  States have expressed.   For instance, the bill lowers the duration of sex offender  registration requirements for certain juveniles and allows States to  register juveniles adjudicated delinquent on a nonpublic system. It  also clarifies that only juveniles who commit violent sexual assaults  should be placed on a State registry.   The bill also permits alternative methods for in-person verification  so that rural jurisdictions can verify location of offenders remotely,  in most instances only requiring in-person verification once per year.   H.R. 1188 requires parole officers and pretrial services officers to  stay informed of the conduct and provide supervision of sexually  dangerous persons. Moreover, the bill strengthens civil remedies for  survivors of exploitation and trafficking by allowing individuals who  were victims of exploitation or trafficking as juveniles to have 10  years after becoming an adult to file suit for a civil remedy.   Mr. Speaker, we must not forget why we are here. In 1981, Adam Walsh,  a 7-year-old boy, was abducted and brutally murdered in Hollywood,  Florida. His death was devastating. And for many families, that kind of  inconsolable pain would be incapacitating. As a father and grandfather,  I cannot even imagine it.   We are thankful for the work of the Walsh family, who have dedicated  their lives to child advocacy and whose work is responsible for saving  the lives of countless children. I am also grateful to our colleague,  Mr. Sensenbrenner, the author of the original Adam Walsh Act, for  introducing this reauthorization bill and for his own tireless advocacy  on behalf of our Nation's children.   Mr. Speaker, scripture reminds us that ``children are a heritage from  the Lord.'' I urge my colleagues to support this strong, bipartisan  legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1188, the Adam Walsh  Reauthorization Act of 2017.   For those of us who have met John Walsh and know of his family, it is  both unspeakable and unimaginable the feeling that families have faced  when a beautiful young child has gone missing and ultimately brutalized  and killed. That is what happened to John, his wife, and his family's  beautiful child in 1981.   So out of that came a lifelong commitment to ending this kind of  violence against children, but, more importantly, finding the Nation's  worst criminals who would brutalize families and fail to be  apprehended.  [[Page H4398]]    The Adam Walsh Act, in particular, established the Sex Offender  Registration and Notification Act--often referred to as SORNA--as a  national system for the registration of sex offenders.   This bill is an important bill, and I want to thank the gentleman  from Wisconsin (Mr. Sensenbrenner) again for his energized and  effective effort reauthorizing this legislation and his commitment to  fighting for the needs of protecting children. We join him in that. I  am reminded of the great work of the National Center for Missing &  Exploited Children and how they have continued their work for years. As  they came into fruition, it seemed that children were missing every  day. Violence was perpetrated, but laws were brought about to make a  difference.   So I support this bill and I raise some reflective thoughts. I am  glad that this bill reflects changes to SORNA that were agreed to by  the Judiciary Committee when it last reauthorized the Adam Walsh Act in  2012 to improve the requirements for States to register sex offenders,  for that was a very difficult system, and some States were complying  and others were not.   Whatever one's belief may be about the wisdom of sex offender  registries, prior to SORNA, many States had already developed sex  offender registries on their own and devoted substantial resources to  identify the most effective methods to manage sex offenders.    In the legislation, there was a certain way that SORNA wanted to  handle that, therefore, States were made to disregard those efforts in  favor of a one-size-fits-all. One of the principal concerns with SORNA  is that it deprives States of flexibility in dealing with juvenile sex  offender registration. I am glad that there is at least a recognition  that States have put in good programs, so I am delighted that that  flexibility can be addressed.   I also think that it is important to note that the bill has to  address longstanding implementation issues. As we noted in 2012,  although the legislation made some useful reforms, it failed to address  fundamental concerns with SORNA, and we are still working to achieve  that accomplishment.   Commendably, H.R. 1188, however, would allow States discretion in  determining whether juvenile sex offender information would be  accessible to the public via the internet. Of course, it continues to  be a steadfast legal prohibition and structure to diminishing--or  hopefully diminishing--the sex violence against children.   It will reduce the time that certain, but not all, juvenile sex  offenders adjudicated as a delinquent are required to register from 25  to 15 years.   The bill has many merits, and I think the changes that have been made  are extremely positive, one, in dealing with flexibility, and, two,  with recognizing some flexibility as it relates to juvenile offenders.   This is legislation that many have poured their heart into because  they believe that there should be a day when this kind of violence  ends, and I hope my colleagues will support this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss H.R. 1188, the ``Adam Walsh  Reauthorization Act of 2017.'' While it is an improvement over current  law dealing with a very important subject, it should do more.   This bill is a step forward in our effort to address concerns about  the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act, commonly known as  SORNA.   There is no doubt that child sexual exploitation is a plague on our  country.   The mistreatment of children should not be tolerated in any form.   Congress has a duty to carefully craft solutions to this problem  without creating confusion or new problems.   The creation of a uniform, nationwide standard for sex offender  registries in the Adam Walsh Act of 2006 was motivated by laudable  goals--prevention and protection.   Congress soon found, however, that state implementation of SORNA  would not occur quickly or easily.   Many states were unable to comply, and some would not comply because  of disagreements about who should be subject to mandatory registration.   Problems with SORNA were still evident in 2012 when we last  considered, but did not complete, reauthorization of the Adam Walsh  Act.   Now, ten years after enactment, problems with SORNA remain.   According to the Department of Justice, Office of Justice Programs  (OJP), only 17 states, 3 territories, and 103 Indian tribes, have  substantially implemented SORNA.   States continue to incur penalties imposed on Byrne Justice  Assistance Grants funding for noncompliance, monies that fund essential  state and local programs.   Juvenile registration is still the most significant barrier to state  implementation of SORNA.   Research has shown that treatment of juvenile sex offenders can and  does work through therapy that involves community-based intervention,  adapted to the needs of juveniles, working within multiple systems-- individual, family, and school--to address the various causes of  childhood delinquency.   Researchers have also found that adolescents who completed sexual  offender treatment had significantly lower recidivism rates than  untreated adolescents, whereas registration serves only to marginalize  and label youth, causing more harm than good.   In order to implement the approaches to the treatment of juvenile  offenders that have proven successful, states must have flexibility in  the manner in which they handle juvenile sex offenders--flexibility  that is all but denied to states by SORNA.   Although I believe juveniles should be completely removed from  registration requirements, I am glad that this bill includes a  provision that allows states to exempt juveniles adjudicated delinquent  for sex offenses from the public website and reduces the time some  juveniles will be potentially required to register from 25 to 15 years.   Under this bill, the Attorney General's annual report to Congress on  sex offender registration will now include an analysis of common  reasons for state noncompliance, including more detailed information on  offenders, particularly juveniles, including a breakdown of the number  of registered offenders who are juveniles and adults who are required  to register because of statutory rape convictions or other conduct  committed as juveniles.   Hopefully, this information will inform future efforts to amend  SORNA.   While this bill includes provisions that address some of the concerns  raised when the Adam Walsh Act was considered by this Committee in  2012, it is clear that work remains to be done if the Act is to ever  achieve its purpose.   I thank Mr. Sensenbrenner for his dedication to this issue.   I support this bill--as far as it goes--and hope my colleagues will  support efforts to improve it.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Sensenbrenner), the former chairman  of the Judiciary Committee and the chief sponsor of this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this  important bipartisan legislation. I thank the gentleman from Michigan  (Mr. Conyers), the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee), the  gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Gowdy), and the chief sponsor, the  gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Sensenbrenner), for working with me and  my staff on this legislation. I urge my colleagues to support it.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte) that the House suspend the  rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1188, as amended.   The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1862) to amend title 18, United States Code, to expand the  scope of certain definitions pertaining to unlawful sexual conduct, and  for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1862         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Global Child Protection Act       of 2017''.       SEC. 2. EXPANDING THE DEFINITION OF ILLICIT SEXUAL CONDUCT.

SEC. 3. EXPANDING THE DEFINITION OF FEDERAL SEX OFFENSE.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte) and the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Conyers)  each will control 20 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous materials on H.R. 1862, currently under  consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Virginia?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Children are the most vulnerable and innocent members of our society,  and we have a duty to make sure our laws protect them to the fullest  extent possible. H.R. 1862, the Global Child Protection Act of 2017,  closes regrettable loopholes in existing child exploitation statutes to  do just that.   Currently, dangerous sexual predators who violate children overseas  can avoid culpability simply by engaging in what the United States Code  defines as sexual contact rather than what the law defines as illicit  sexual conduct. That is, they can go abroad, cause a child to sexually  touch them, and return, without exposure to the criminal liability they  would face had they engaged in what the law defines as illicit sexual  conduct.   I am sure my colleagues would agree that it should not matter whether  the offender engages in sexual conduct or contact with a child. Either  way, he is a child predator. This is the very definition of a loophole,  and it is putting children at risk. That is because these predators are  aware of this loophole, and they are able to share this information  quickly in chat groups on the internet. They plot their foreign sex  tourism accordingly, to circumvent criminal liability.   H.R. 1862 closes this loophole by expanding the definition of illicit  sexual conduct to include sexual contact. No longer will these  predators be able to escape justice and continue to offend with  impunity.   This bill also closes a loophole for recidivist offenders. It is  estimated that only between 8 and 20 percent of victims of childhood  sexual abuse report they have been abused. That is why it is vitally  important that, when we do become aware of these offenses and secure  convictions, our justice system imposes penalties to adequately punish  and deter this evil.  [[Page H4400]]    Current law provides that an offender convicted of committing a  Federal sex offense against a minor shall be sentenced to life  imprisonment if that offender has a prior conviction for a sex offense  against a minor. In defining sex offense, however, this provision  inexplicably excludes two serious offenses. It is missing offenses  covering abusive sexual contact with a minor under 12 and also does not  apply to offenders who commit their sex crimes against children  overseas. H.R. 1862 fixes these oversights--and they were clearly  oversights--by adding these provisions into the definition of Federal  sex offense.   When an offender has previously harmed a child, been punished for  that offense, and goes on to harm another child, the risk that he will  go on to abuse again is extremely high, and we must ensure our children  are safe from such a dangerous predator. That dynamic of deterrence,  ensuring repeat offenders face harsher penalties, is at the core of our  system of justice. It is even more important here where the victims are  our children. Children are one-third of our population and all of our  future. We must prioritize their protection.   I commend the gentlewoman from Alabama (Mrs. Roby) for introducing  this important legislation. I urge my colleagues to support it.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to  the gentlewoman from Alabama (Mrs. Roby), a member of the Committee on  the Judiciary and the chief sponsor of this legislation.                                time  1630     Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to  the gentlewoman from Alabama (Mrs. Roby), a member of the Committee on  the Judiciary and the chief sponsor of this legislation.                                time  1630     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   First, let me make it very clear that there are no new mandatory  minimums in this bill. The mandatory minimum that is already in the law  is appropriate for those who are a danger to children, particularly  where these enhancements apply when they have abused a minor, not once,  but twice.   We are closing a loophole in the current law and we are adding to  this provision the sexual abuse of children under 12 years old. Having  already harmed two children, an offender poses too great a risk to our  vulnerable citizens. There are victims here and potential victims to  protect.   As I mentioned before, child victims report abuse at a shockingly low  level. It is important that this conduct is adequately deterred for  someone who has already abused a child. Clearly, one conviction was not  adequate.   Prosecutorial discretion in these cases act as an appropriate buffer  to ensure these provisions are being used reasonably. There are no new  mandatory minimums in this bill. We simply close a loophole to make  sure that people do not sexually abuse children under 12 years of age,  not once, not twice, but more than twice. That is why this mandatory  minimum should have a loophole closed to include it, but there is not a  new mandatory minimum sentence in this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, my friend and colleague, the ranking member, asked that  we look at this in a broad and general way, but that is not what this  bill is all about. I ask my colleagues to look at this in the very  specific way that this bill is designed: to address a loophole in  current law that allows sexual predators of children under 12 years old  to avoid the sentencing consequences of their actions.   We are about protecting children. This law is about protecting  children. But predators know this loophole in the law, and it needs to  be closed, so that is what this is about.   This is about making sure that sexual predators are taken off the  streets and prevented from not abusing children once or twice, but many  more times. This will stop that. This will close that loophole.   This is not the place--sexual predators for children under 12 years  old. This is not the place to have a general, broad discussion about  mandatory minimum sentences.   Let's fix this problem. And we can and will as we address criminal  justice reform, look at our overall sentencing, but this problem needs  to be addressed. It needs to be addressed now for the sake of  protecting our children. I urge my colleagues to support this  legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte) that the House suspend the  rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1862.   The question was taken.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds  being in the affirmative, the ayes have it.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1842) to amend title 18, United States Code, to include  State crimes of violence as grounds for an enhanced penalty when sex  offenders fail to register or report certain information as required by  Federal law, to include prior military offenses for purposes of  recidivist sentencing provisions, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1842         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte) and the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Conyers)  each will control 20 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous materials on H.R. 1842, currently under  consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Virginia?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous materials on H.R. 1842, currently under  consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Virginia?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   For victims, the effects of child sexual abuse are devastating. It  disrupts the victim's development and increases the likelihood that he  or she will experience other sexual assaults in the future, and it is,  likely, one of the most underreported crimes in the United States. That  is why we have to do all we can to prevent these crimes. We promote  prevention by closely monitoring sex offenders and by imposing  recidivist enhancements on those who have shown a proclivity to abuse  children.   H.R. 1842, the Strengthening Children's Safety Act of 2017, closes  two significant loopholes to help accomplish these goals.   First, the bill closes a loophole in the statute that criminalizes a  sex offender's failure to register. Under current law, a sex offender  who fails to comply with registration requirements is guilty of a  crime. An enhanced penalty applies to offenders who, while in  noncompliant status, commit a Federal crime of violence, a crime of  violence under the D.C. Code, a military code crime of violence, a  Tribal crime of violence, or a crime of violence in any territory or  possession of the United States. This is logical since offenders who  have been convicted of both crimes against children and crimes of  violence are deserving of more severe punishment.   However, significantly, this provision fails to include offenders who  have been convicted of crimes of violence under State laws. It makes no  sense that a person convicted of a crime of violence under the D.C.  Code is subject to an enhanced penalty, while a person who committed  the same offense in Virginia would not be. Given their propensity for  violence, these offenders, regardless of what U.S. jurisdiction  convicts them, must be held accountable when they fall off the radar.   The bill further ensures that those offenders who have been  previously convicted of sex crimes under the Uniform Code of Military  Justice are exposed to the same recidivist enhancements as those  convicted of the same crimes in Federal, State, and Tribal courts. The  way the U.S. Code is currently written, many of these Federal  recidivist statutes unintentionally fail to cover significant sex  crimes committed under military law, including certain child  pornography offenses. Again, it is important that repeat offenders are  subject to the same sentencing enhancements, no matter where they were  convicted, in order to protect our children.   H.R. 1842 is commonsense legislation that closes loopholes in Federal  law, promotes uniformity, and will help keep our children safe.   I want to thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Ratcliffe), a member of  the Judiciary Committee, for introducing this important bill, and I  urge my colleagues to support it.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, at this time I yield such time as he may  consume to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Ratcliffe), the chief author  of this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Once again, this bill has no new mandatory minimum sentences. These  are not low-level offenders. These are not nonviolent offenders. They  are violent sexual predators, and these added offenders--which this  bill does to close, again, a loophole--these added offenders have  committed the exact same crimes with the exact same conduct as those  already covered in existing law. This bill aims to apply the mandatory  minimums equitably, and that, I think, should be an important goal for  all of us.   Again, there are no new mandatory minimums in this bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, the gentlewoman from Texas cited a personal experience  she had with someone she knows who has been convicted of a crime and  given a mandatory minimum sentence. It was not a violent crime, not a  sex crime, and not relevant to this bill, which does not add any new  mandatory minimum sentences. It simply makes sure that the sentences  already imposed under the law are equitably applied, regardless of  where their prior offenses took place.   These are sexual crimes. These are violent crimes. These offenders  should receive the exact same sentences for the exact same conduct as  others already covered under the current law.   I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation to protect  our children and get sexual predators off the street.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte) that the House suspend the  rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1842.   The question was taken.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds  being in the affirmative, the ayes have it.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 883) to amend title 18, United States Code, to provide a  certification process for the issuance of nondisclosure requirements  accompanying certain administrative subpoenas, to provide for judicial  review of such nondisclosure requirements, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 883         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Judicial review of nondisclosure requirements.''.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte) and the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Conyers)  each will control 20 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous materials on H.R. 883, currently under  consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Virginia?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous materials on H.R. 883, currently under  consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Virginia?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, over the years, we as a society have made great strides  in combating crimes against children. As with many crimes, however, law  enforcement often struggles to keep pace with modern technology. That  is why H.R. 883, the Targeting Child Predators Act, is both an  important and a timely piece of legislation.   While many of the bills we have discussed today have been aimed at  prevention and punishment, H.R. 883 provides law enforcement with the  tools necessary to stop ongoing abuse, occurring in real time, and to  locate offenders.   Because of the severity of sex crimes committed against children and  the often irreparable harm they cause, we must take steps to ensure  that law enforcement has the ability to swiftly locate sexual  predators.   In 1998, Congress recognized this urgency by passing the Protection  of Children From Sexual Predators Act, which permitted the FBI to use  administrative subpoenas in cases of child exploitation. That  legislation was intended to enhance the FBI's ability to  [[Page H4407]]  investigate online child exploitation offenses in an expeditious  manner.   Administrative subpoenas are especially useful in child exploitation  cases because they are not burdened with grand jury secrecy  obligations, so the information may be shared among law enforcement to  quickly locate offenders in emergency situations.   Under current law, the FBI is permitted to use an administrative  subpoena to obtain non-content information from internet service  providers in child exploitation cases.   H.R. 883 allows the government to prohibit the recipient of a  subpoena from disclosing the existence of the subpoena, provided the  government certifies there is reason to believe that disclosure may  result in endangerment to the life or physical safety of any person,  flight to avoid prosecution, destruction of or tampering with evidence,  or intimidation of potential witnesses.   Presently, if agents want to obtain this information with a  nondisclosure provision, it must go through the courts, which, of  course, defeats the purpose of a speedy mechanism to obtain non-content  information.   Importantly, the bill contains a provision that allows a company in  receipt of such a subpoena to insist that the government obtain a court  order prohibiting the company from disclosing the subpoena to the  target. Alternatively, the company may initiate such proceedings itself  in a relevant court to challenge the nondisclosure requirement.   Mr. Speaker, a nondisclosure provision is vitally important in child  exploitation cases. If a bad guy who has taken a child knows that law  enforcement is on to him, or is looking for him, what might he do to  get away? What might he do to that child?   H.R. 883 is an important bill which promotes Congress' original  intent to ensure law enforcement has quick access to this information.  It is narrowly tailored to ensure that its provisions apply in cases  where time is of the essence. It provides a mechanism for companies to  challenge the nondisclosure requirements.                                time  1730    I commend Mr. DeSantis, the gentleman from Florida and a member of  the Judiciary Committee, for introducing this bill, and I urge my  colleagues to support it.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Florida (Mr. DeSantis), who is the chief sponsor of  this legislation.   Mr. DeSANTIS. Mr. Speaker, every year, thousands of children are  victims of cyber exploitation. As a former prosecutor who has handled  child exploitation cases, I know just how important it is to preserve  evidence that can bring predators to justice.   After speaking with Florida law enforcement officials about the  challenges they face when tracking suspects online, I introduced the  Targeting Child Predators Act. This is a sensible reform that will  better protect our children by preventing suspected child predators  from destroying evidence and covering their tracks.   When tracking a suspected child predator online, law enforcement far  too often hits roadblocks that can critically threaten their  investigation. Internet service providers who have been issued a duly  issued, lawful subpoena from law enforcement will often inform the  suspect that police investigators have requested their information.  Once notified that they are the target of an investigation, child  predators can wipe their systems clean and go into hiding, leaving law  enforcement empty-handed and potentially putting their victims at  further risk.   The Targeting Child Predators Act is a simple and necessary amendment  to our criminal code requiring that ISPs wait 180 days before  disclosing to suspected child predators that their information has been  requested by law enforcement. The bill is narrowly targeted to child  exploitation cases where the destruction of valuable evidence could  endanger the safety of a child or seriously jeopardize an ongoing  investigation. Additionally, the Targeting Child Predators Act provides  judicial review of subpoenas and affords both ISPs and suspects due  process as required by law.   The Targeting Child Predators Act will protect our children from  those who wish to exploit them while maintaining the constitutional  rights of suspected criminals. This is an issue that should garner wide  bipartisan support from the House.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to step up. Let's support our  vulnerable children. Let's target child predators, and let's vote  ``yes'' on this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to  urge my colleagues to support this very important, very targeted  legislation.   This is not some broad authority. This is very targeted under  circumstances where the sexual predator has the child and the  authorities need to get information from third parties now so they can  find that child and they need those third parties to not disclose  information that they are yielding to the government about their  whereabouts and other information about them because of the emergency  circumstances that are at play here, or you are dealing with someone  who has a child and needs to be found so that child can be saved. That  is the purpose of this legislation.                                time  1745    It is a good purpose. This legislation should be supported by all the  Members of the House. I urge them to do so.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore.

SEC. 3. EFFECTIVE DATE.         This Act and the amendments made by this Act shall be fully       implemented by not later than 1 year after the date of       enactment of this Act.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte) and the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Conyers)  each will control 20 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous materials on H.R. 695, currently under  consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Virginia?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous materials on H.R. 695, currently under  consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Virginia?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, we have spent a great deal of time this afternoon  discussing legislation designed to detect and punish sexual predators.  These bills are all strong, well crafted, and laudable. I urge my  colleagues to support them.   However, there is another facet to this problem, which is prevention.  This may be the most important action we as Congress can take in the  realm of child exploitation laws. We must do all we can to prevent  child exploitation from happening in the first place.   Mr. Speaker, that is why I am pleased to bring H.R. 695, the Child  Protection Improvements Act, before the House today. This legislation  is extremely important in that it makes permanent a successful pilot  program that allowed youth-serving organizations access to FBI  fingerprint database searches.  [[Page H4410]]    In 2003, the PROTECT Act created the Child Safety Pilot Program,  which ran from 2003 until 2011, and provided access to FBI fingerprint  background checks for a variety of child-serving nonprofits.   The pilot conducted over 105,000 background checks during its  existence. 6.2 percent of potential volunteers were found to have  criminal records of concern. While that may seem like a small  percentage, Mr. Speaker, it works out to over 6,500 individuals.   In addition, over 40 percent of individuals with criminal records of  concern had crimes in States other than where they were applying to  volunteer, meaning that only a nationwide check would have flagged  these individuals' criminal records.   The criminal offenses detected among some of these checks included  convictions for criminal sexual conduct with a child, child  endangerment, and manslaughter. Twenty-six percent of these individuals  showed a different name on their record than the one they used on their  job application.   H.R. 695 allows organizations such as the YMCA to submit fingerprints  to a designated entity which, in turn, submits them to the FBI for  processing. The system protects privacy rights by ensuring that the  specifics of a criminal record are never disclosed without explicit  consent by the applicant, and it provides opportunity for individuals  to correct errors in their records directly with the FBI.   Importantly, the bill does not mandate that youth-serving  organizations use this process. It merely makes the process more  accessible and more affordable for organizations that wish to use it.   Mr. Speaker, the harsh reality is that there are individuals who will  put themselves in positions where they are entrusted with children so  they can then betray that trust in the worst way imaginable. That is  why bills like H.R. 695, and other bills we have discussed today, are  so important.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from California (Mr.  Schiff) and the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Bishop) for introducing  this bill, and I urge my colleagues to support this strong bipartisan  legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, at this time, it is my pleasure to yield  such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr.  Bishop), one of the two chief sponsors of this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers, and I am  prepared to close. I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I commend the gentleman from California  (Mr. Schiff) and the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Bishop). I thank the  ranking member of the full committee and the ranking member of the  subcommittee and the chairman of the subcommittee for working on this  important legislation with me and the committee staff.   I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte) that the House suspend the  rules and pass the bill, H.R. 695, as amended.   The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________
