 Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the transformation that  the American Rescue Plan has made in all of our communities.  [[Page H2558]]    A week or so back, I traveled to a town called Kewanee, Illinois, to  visit our Head Start classrooms there.   There was a teacher named Miss Candice, who told me that she loves  her job. But she doesn't stay for the pay, she doesn't stay for the  benefits, but for the families.   Miss Candice has a student in her class, and before that student, she  had that student's siblings. All of the siblings in that family had  passed through her classroom. She feels that she has helped this family  grow up. And she has.   The American Rescue Plan isn't just about the numbers, though. It is  about the 143,000 children in the district I serve who will be helped,  the 27 million children nationwide. Child poverty cut in half. We are  rebuilding our communities all over this great country, and we can't  stop now.   We can keep rebuilding with the American Jobs and Families Act. Today  and together, we can make this a once-in-a century investment in our  families, the future of our children, and our Nation.   Let's make sure teachers like Miss Candice can continue helping our  families.                            ____________________
