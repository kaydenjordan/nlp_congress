 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I  thank him for his work as the chairman of the Appropriations  Subcommittee that deals with funding public health as well as medical  research.   I heard some comments about extension of the funding for the  Children's Health Insurance Program at the beginning of the debate, and  I wanted to  [[Page H102]]  come to the floor and remind people that the Energy and Commerce  Committee did do its work as far as continuing the funding for the  Children's Health Insurance Program. It completed its work. We delayed  a little bit at the request of committee Democrats, we delayed a little  bit at the request of the ranking member of the full committee, but we  did deliver a product the first part of October.   That product passed the floor of this House late October, early  November. It passed with, of course, almost every Republican vote and  over two dozen Democratic votes. It was, indeed, a bipartisan effort.   It funded the Children's Health Insurance Program for 5 years, which  was the Democratic request; the funding levels were requested by the  Democrats; and it was offset in a responsible way.   That bill is pending over in the United States Senate, and I,  frankly, do not understand why the Senate minority leader will not  release that bill for a vote by his Senators because it is, after all,  Democratic Senators who represent States around this country that are  going to suffer as a consequence of not passing this bill.
