 Mr. President, I rise today to address a matter that has  been very much on my mind. At a moment when it seems that our democracy  is more defined by our discord and our dysfunction than by our own  values and principles, let me begin by noting a somewhat obvious point  that these offices that we hold are not ours indefinitely. We are not  here simply to mark time. Sustained incumbency is certainly not the  point of seeking office, and there are times when we must risk our  careers in favor of our principles. Now is such a time.   It must also be said that I rise today with no small measure of  regret--regret because of the state of our disunion, regret because of  the disrepair and destructiveness of our politics, regret because of  the indecency of our discourse, regret because of the coarseness of our  leadership, regret for the compromise of our moral authority, and by  ``our,'' I mean all of our complicity in this alarming and dangerous  state of affairs.   It is time for our complicity and our accommodation of the  unacceptable to end. In this century, a new phrase has entered the  language to describe the accommodation of a new and undesirable order,  that phrase being the ``new normal.'' But we must never adjust to the  present coarseness of our national dialogue with the tone set at the  top. We must never regard as normal the regular and casual undermining  of our democratic norms and ideals. We must never meekly accept the  daily sundering of our country, the personal attacks, the threats  against principles, freedoms, and institutions, the flagrant disregard  for truth and decency, the reckless provocations, most often for the  pettiest and most personal reasons, reasons having nothing whatsoever  to do with the fortunes of the people whom we have been elected to  serve. None of these appalling features of our current politics should  ever be regarded as normal. We must never allow ourselves to lapse into  thinking that is just the way things are now. If we simply become  inured to this condition, thinking that it is just politics as usual,  then Heaven help us.   Without fear of the consequences and without consideration of the  rules of what is politically safe or palatable, we must stop pretending  that the degradation of our politics and the conduct of some in our  executive branch are normal. They are not normal. Reckless, outrageous,  and undignified behavior has become excused and countenanced as  ``telling it like it is'' when it is actually just reckless,  outrageous, and undignified.   When such behavior emanates from the top of our government, it is  something else. It is dangerous to a democracy. Such behavior does not  project strength, because our strength comes from our values. It  instead projects a corruption of the spirit and weakness.   It is often said that children are watching. Well, they are. And what  are we going to do about that? When the next generation asks us ``Why  didn't you do something? Why didn't you speak up?'' what are we going  to say? Mr. President, I rise today to say ``enough.''   We must dedicate ourselves to making sure that the anomalous never  becomes the normal. With respect and humility, I must say that we have  fooled ourselves for long enough that a pivot to governing is right  around the corner, a return to civility and stability right behind it.  We know better than that. By now, we all know better than that.   Here, today, I stand to say that we would better serve the country  and better fulfill the obligations under the Constitution by adhering  to our article I ``old normal''--Mr. Madison's doctrine of the  separation of powers. This genius innovation, which affirms Madison's  status as a true visionary and for which Madison argued in Federalist  51, held that the equal branches of our government would balance and  counteract each other when necessary. ``Ambition counteracts  ambition,'' he wrote. But what happens if ambition fails to counteract  ambition? What happens if stability fails to assert itself in the face  of chaos and instability or if decency fails to call out indecency?   Were the shoe on the other foot, would we Republicans meekly accept  such behavior on display from dominant Democrats? Of course we  wouldn't, and we would be wrong if we did.   When we remain silent and fail to act when we know that silence and  inaction are the wrong things to do because of political  considerations, because we might make enemies, because we might  alienate the base, because we might provoke a primary challenge,  because ad infinitum, ad nauseam, when we succumb to those  considerations in spite of what should be greater considerations and  imperatives in defense of our institutions and our liberty, we dishonor  our principles and forsake our obligations. Those things are far more  important than politics.   I am aware that more politically savvy people than I will caution  against such talk. I am aware that there is a segment of my party that  believes anything short of complete and unquestioning loyalty to a  President who belongs to my party is unacceptable and suspect. If I  have been critical, it is not because I relish criticizing the behavior  of the President of the United States. If I have been critical, it is  because I believe it is my obligation to do so as a matter of duty of  conscience.   The notion that one should stay silent as the norms and values that  keep America strong are undermined and as the alliances and agreements  that ensure the stability of the entire world are routinely threatened  by the level of thought that goes into 140 characters, the notion that  we should say or do nothing in the face of such mercurial behavior is  ahistoric and, I believe, profoundly misguided.   A Republican President named Roosevelt had this to say about the  President and a citizen's relationship to the office:         The President is merely the most important among a large       number of public servants. He should be supported or opposed       exactly to the degree which is warranted by his good conduct       or bad conduct, his efficiency or inefficiency in rendering       loyal, able, and disinterested service to the Nation as a       whole.        Therefore, it is absolutely necessary that there should be       full liberty to tell the truth about his acts, and this means       that it is exactly as necessary to blame him when he does       wrong as to praise him when he does right. Any other attitude       in an American citizen is both base and servile.    President Roosevelt continued:         To announce that there must be no criticism of the       President, or that we are to stand by a President, right or       wrong, is not only unpatriotic and servile, but is morally       treasonable to the American public.    Acting on conscience and principle is the manner in which we express  our moral selves, and, as such, loyalty to conscience and principle  should supersede loyalty to any man or party.   We can all be forgiven for failing in that measure from time to time.  I certainly put myself at the top of the list of those who fall short  in this regard. I am holier than none.   But too often, we rush not to salvage principle but to forgive and  excuse our failures so that we might accommodate them and go right on  failing until the accommodation itself becomes our principle.   In that way and over time, we can justify almost any behavior and  sacrifice any principle. I am afraid this is where we now find  ourselves.   When a leader correctly identifies real hurt and insecurity in our  country, and instead of addressing it goes to look for someone to  blame, there is perhaps nothing more devastating to a pluralistic  society. Leadership knows that most often a good place to start in  assigning blame is to look somewhat closer to home. Leadership knows  where the buck stops, humility helps, and character counts.   Leadership does not knowingly encourage or feed ugly or debased  appetites in us. Leadership lives by the American creed, ``E Pluribus  Unum''--``From many, one.'' American leadership looks to the world, and  just as Lincoln did, sees the family of man. Humanity is not a zero-sum  game. When we have been at our most prosperous, we have been at our  most principled, and when we do well, the rest of the world does well.   These articles of civic faith have been critical to the American  identity for as long as we have been alive. They are our birthright and  our obligation.  [[Page S6736]]  We must guard them jealously and pass them on for as long as the  calendar has days. To betray them or to be unserious in their defense  is a betrayal of the fundamental obligations of American leadership,  and to behave as if they don't matter is simply not who we are.   Now the efficacy of American leadership around the globe has come  into question. When the United States emerged from World War II, we  contributed about half of the world's economic activity. It would have  been easy to secure our dominance, keeping those countries that had  been defeated or greatly weakened during the war in their place. We  didn't do that. It would have been easy to focus inward. We resisted  those impulses. Instead, we financed reconstruction of shattered  countries and created international organizations and institutions that  have helped provide security and foster prosperity around the world for  more than 70 years.   Now, it seems that we, the architects of this visionary, rules-based  world order that has brought so much freedom and prosperity, are the  ones most eager to abandon it. The implications of this abandonment are  profound, and the beneficiaries of this rather radical departure in the  American approach to the world are the ideological enemies of our  values.   Despotism loves a vacuum, and our allies are now looking elsewhere  for leadership. Why are they doing this? None of this is normal. What  do we, as U.S. Senators, have to say about it? The principles that  underlie our politics, the values of our founding, are too vital to our  identity and to our survival to allow them to be compromised by the  requirements of politics because politics can make us silent when we  should speak, and silence can equal complicity.   I have children and grandchildren to answer to, and so I will not be  complicit or silent. I have decided I will be better able to represent  the people of Arizona and to better serve my country and my conscience  by freeing myself of the political considerations that consume far too  much bandwidth and would cause me to compromise far too many  principles.   To that end, I am announcing today that my service in the Senate will  conclude at the end of my term in early January 2019. It is clear, at  this moment, that a traditional conservative who believes in limited  government and free markets, who is devoted to free trade, who is pro- immigration has a narrower and narrower path to nomination in the  Republican Party--the party that has so long defined itself by its  belief in those things.   It is also clear to me, for the moment, that we have given up on the  core principles in favor of a more viscerally satisfying anger and  resentment. To be clear, the anger and resentment that the people feel  at the royal mess we have created are justified, but anger and  resentment are not a governing philosophy.   There is an undeniable potency to a populist appeal, but  mischaracterizing or misunderstanding our problems and giving in to the  impulse to scapegoat and belittle threatens to turn us into a fearful,  backward-looking people. In the case of the Republican Party, those  things also threaten to turn us into a fearful, backward-looking  minority party.   We were not made great as a country by indulging in or even exalting  our worst impulses, turning against ourselves, glorifying in the things  that divide us, and calling fake things true and true things fake, and  we did not become the beacon of freedom in the darkest corners of the  world by flouting our institutions and failing to understand just how  hard-won and vulnerable they are.   This spell will eventually break. That is my belief. We will return  to ourselves once more, and I say, the sooner the better because to  have a healthy government, we must also have healthy and functioning  parties. We must respect each other again in an atmosphere of shared  facts and shared values, comity, and good faith. We must argue our  positions fervently and never be afraid to compromise. We must assume  the best of our fellow man and always look for the good. Until that day  comes, we must be unafraid to stand up and speak out as if our country  depends on it because it does.   I plan to spend the remaining 14 months of my Senate term doing just  that. The graveyard is full of indispensable men and women. None of us  here is indispensable, nor were even the great figures of history who  toiled at these very desks in this very Chamber to shape the country we  have inherited. What is indispensable are the values they consecrated  in Philadelphia and in this place--values which have endured and will  endure for so long as men and women wish to remain free. What is  indispensable is what we do here in defense of those values. A  political career does not mean much if we are complicit in undermining  these values.   I thank my colleagues for indulging me here today. I will close by  borrowing the words of President Lincoln, who knew more about healthy  enmity and preserving our founding values than any other American who  has ever lived. His words from his first inaugural were a prayer in his  time and are no less in ours:         We are not enemies, but friends. We must not be enemies.       Though passion may have strained, it must not break the bonds       of our affection. The mystic chords of memory will swell when       again touched, as surely as they will be, by the better       angels of our nature.    Thank you, Mr. President.   I yield the floor.   (Applause, Senators rising.)
