 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Louisiana for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise on this year's National Police Week to recognize  the brave men and women in law enforcement all over the country, as  well as honoring the many police officers who have lost their lives in  the line of duty. While some folks around this country and across the  aisle are calling for defunding and debanding the police department, I  am proud to be a strong supporter of our law enforcement, and I will  always back the blue.   Nothing was more obvious than this last week and a half when I was  with the Border Patrol. We have got to put more money into our law  enforcement. We are choking them down. We have got to get them more  resources. Now more than ever, police officers are in need of  increasing resources as well as increasing support from our communities  that they serve.   Police officers are willing. They choose an incredible and tough job  with long hours and not enough pay, so it is critical for us to give  them support and the respect that they deserve. I will continue doing  all I can do to support law enforcement in south Alabama and all over  the country. I encourage all my colleagues to support and fully fund  the police.
