 Madam President, yesterday I had an opportunity to go  through and thank all of the appropriate people.   This is arguably the most significant bill that we will have this  year--as we have had every year. This is the 58th consecutive year we  had a Defense authorization bill. This is dedicated and named after  Senator McCain. It is the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization  Act. We are very proud of the input we had from his staff and from him,  and we went through it in record time.   I certainly thank my counterpart, Senator Reed. He and I have worked  very closely together for many years.   I yield back the remainder of my time.    Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.
