 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding me the  time.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in favor of granting a waiver for  retired Army General Lloyd Austin and this historic nomination to serve  as the 28th Secretary of Defense, the first African American in U.S.  history.  [[Page H217]]    For four decades, Secretary-designate Austin served our Nation  valiantly in the United States Army. Before retiring, he led one of the  most important commands in the military, CENTCOM, or Central Command,  where he oversaw America's military strategy and joint operations  throughout the Middle East.   During his service in the Middle East, he oversaw the safe return of  150,000 brave American troops, working closely with our allies as a  statesman and a diplomat.   As our Commander in Chief, I support President Biden in his selection  of Lloyd Austin to protect our national security, strengthen our global  alliances, depoliticize the Defense Department, and be a leader and  role model for our brave servicemembers.   I had the opportunity to speak directly with Secretary-designate  Austin about the needs of servicemembers and their families in Nevada's  Fourth District. He committed to work with me on issues important to  those servicemembers and their families stationed at Nellis and Creech  Air Force Bases and the Nevada Test Site, including issues dealing with  housing, mental health, childcare, and education.   His leadership, his experience, and his commitment to civil control  of the military will ensure our country meets its national security  needs.   As our Secretary of Defense, he will also send a powerful message of  belonging to all servicemembers but particularly to members of color,  who represent more than 40 percent of our armed services today.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this historic  nomination, approve the waiver required today, and confirm Secretary- designate Austin's nomination.
