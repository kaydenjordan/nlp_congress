 MALONEY of New York asked and was given permission  to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her  remarks.)    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in  support of the Build Back Better Act, which makes critical investments  to green our economy and protect our environment.   The Committee on Oversight and Reform's portion of this bill provides  nearly $12 billion to transition Federal fleets, including the Postal  Service, to electric vehicles, making the United States a leader on  climate change by building an environmentally friendly fleet of the  future.   I am especially pleased that we have included dedicated funding for  implementation of the President's Justice40 Initiative, a commitment to  ensure that at least 40 percent of the benefits of infrastructure  investments go to communities most impacted by environmental injustice.   The Build Back Better Act is a crucial piece of legislation that will  promote equity and protect our environment.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support it.                            ____________________
