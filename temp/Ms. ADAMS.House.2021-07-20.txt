 Madam Speaker, I am honored today to stand on the floor of  the House of Representatives to pay tribute to and to honor the life of  a trusted friend of 4 decades, a cherished mentor, and an extraordinary  woman of faith, Mrs. Leona Jane Brown Fernander Samuda.   Rosie, as I knew her and she was fondly referred to by her family and  friends, passed away on June 14, 2021.   I extend my sympathy and condolences and prayers along with the more  than 700,000 citizens of North Carolina's Twelfth Congressional  District to the Brown, Fernander, Samuda families during this difficult  time.   Born in Alice Town, Eleuthera, Bahamas, Rosie was a woman who spoke  her mind, never mincing words, always genuinely wise in thought and  deeds.   A mother, grandmother, great-grandmother who raised six children,  five boys and one girl, she was the rock and fortress of her family.   A matriarch to family and community, Rosie shared her many talents,  including cooking her favorite mac and cheese to the love she and I  both had for wearing hats.   Rosie's glowing smile, the infectious personality that she had, and  always a few jokes, made her a lover of people who loved her back.   A global citizen, she never met a stranger and was genuinely  interested in the politics of every community where she lived, from the  Parliament in her native Bahamas to the Black community politics in  Charlotte, North Carolina.   Always engaging, interacting with political leaders, advocating for  human and civil rights, Rosie never ceased to make her opinions known.   Rosie's contributions were extensive and her lessons invaluable.  Rosie loved children and she became an entrepreneur and a businesswoman  who owned and operated Aunt Jane's Edu Care for preschoolers.   Widely traveled, living in places such as Switzerland, Chippingham,  and as a resident in my district in Charlotte, she studied and earned  her degree from the University of North Carolina at Charlotte.   Small in stature, Rosie was a mighty little giant who made an  indelible impact on so many people for more than eight decades, and I  was blessed to have known her and have her as a friend.   Mrs. Leona Jane Brown Fernander Samuda, dedicated woman of faith,  gained the respect of men, women, and little children, and she made  this world much better than she found it.   She served to fulfill the scripture in Psalm 84:10, which says:  ``Better is one day in your courts than a thousand elsewhere; I would  rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God than dwell in the tents  of the wicked.''   Rest in peace, Rosie. We love you. We miss you.                            ____________________
