 Mr. Speaker, I rise this evening to recognize the  General Baptist State Convention of North Carolina on the occasion of  its 150th anniversary. The story of this great Baptist convention is a  testament to its founders, Reverends William Warrick, Edward Eagles, C.  Johnson, L.W. Boone, B.B. Spicer, H. Grimes, John Washington, Charles  Bryant, Sutton Davis, and R.H. Harper, the visionary men who founded  the convention on October 18, 1867.   Since its founding, Mr. Speaker, great men and great women have  maintained the convention's strength and viability. The General Baptist  State Convention is the oldest convention of African-American Baptists  in the United States of America. The General Baptist State Convention  consists of more that 500,000 Baptist believers belonging to more than  1,400 churches, including my home church, the Jackson Chapel First  Missionary Baptist Church of Wilson.   The convention is subdivided into 58 associations, each presided over  by a moderator. Over the last 150 years, the convention has been led by  well-trained and spirit-led theologians. The current president and  executive board chair is my friend Dr. Nilous M. Avery, II, of  Salisbury, North Carolina. He is the 32nd president of the convention.   Mr. Speaker, the current officers of the convention are: First Vice  President At Large, Dr. Leonzo Lynch; First Vice President, Dr. Ricky  Banks; Second Vice President, Dr. J. Vincent Terry, Sr.; Third Vice  President, Reverend O.D. Sykes; Fourth Vice President, Reverend Prince  R. Rivers; Recording Secretary, Reverend Curtis O. Donald; Assistant  Recording Secretary, Reverend Matthew Rouse, III; Statistician, Dr.  Nathan Scovens; Parliamentarian, Reverend Reginald Wells. The Historian  is Dr. Harry L. White, and the hardworking Executive Secretary- Treasurer is Dr. Haywood T. Gray.   Mr. Speaker, the Black church in North Carolina did not begin at the  end of slavery. It became more pronounced and more transparent at  slavery's end, but it existed for many years. It existed for many years  prior to the end of slavery.   In 1831, the North Carolina General Assembly passed a law making it a  crime for any free person of color or slave to preach or exhort in  public, or in any manner officiate as a preacher or a teacher in any  prayer meeting or other association for worship where slaves of  different families were collected together.   Can you imagine?   The punishment for preaching the gospel--beginning in 1831, it was a  crime. The punishment for violation was a whipping of up to 39 lashes  on the bare back.   Notwithstanding this prohibition against preaching, the Black church  existed as a secret association of slaves who worshipped privately. As  the antebellum period proceeded, a few of the White churches, at the  urging of the North Carolina Baptist State Convention, finally allowed  people of color to hold church meetings under the supervision of a  White person; and, at times, a member of the White race would conduct  the service.   Now, Mr. Speaker, when the Emancipation Proclamation was signed on  January 1, 1863, and the 13th Amendment ratified on December 6, 1865,  there were 4 million slaves who obtained their freedom; 300,000 of  those lived in North Carolina. The former slaves, with assistance from  White northerners and the Freedmen's Bureau, began the struggle toward  freedom and equality. It was the Black church that led the way. This  movement consisted of Black Baptist leaders and Black Methodist leaders  and other religious leaders, both Black and White, who understood the  importance of the former slaves having the ability to worship and serve  their God without fear.                                time  2015    At the end of the Civil War, the former slaves built churches  throughout North Carolina. Many were of the Baptist denomination, and  they were erected with lightning speed.   In 1867, they came together, Mr. Speaker, at First African Baptist  Church in Goldsboro, North Carolina. And I have a picture of it on  display. They came together at the First African Baptist Church in  Goldsboro to form the General Association of Colored Baptists of North  Carolina, which was the original name for the convention. And I might  say, Mr. Speaker, that my grandfather, Reverend Fred Davis, would, in  1916, become the fourth pastor of this church.   Not only did Black Baptists build churches, but one of their greatest  achievements was the establishment and maintenance of historic Shaw  University in Raleigh, which will be discussed by my colleagues,  Congressman David Price and Congresswoman Alma Adams, in just a moment.  Shaw University's contribution to African-American empowerment must be  known and understood by all North Carolinians.   Those pioneers, who were trained at Shaw University, went into  communities and established institutions and engaged in professions  that empowered future generations. They went to all corners of our  State. They went to eastern North Carolina; Piedmont, North Carolina;  Triad; and the Federal area, which is where our esteemed sergeant at  arms grew up in, Ms. Hamlett. Ms. Joyce Hamlett grew up in the Federal  area. There were many other areas that were covered by graduates from  Shaw University.   Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to include in the Record a list of names  of African-American physicians, dentists, pharmacists, lawyers,  ministers, and teachers who were also trained at Shaw University.

Parker, Jr. 2010-2014        Nilous M. Avery, II 2014-2018     Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from North  Carolina (Ms. Adams), a former Bennett College professor.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Adams for those  enlightening remarks and for her extraordinary leadership not only here  in Congress, but for 40 years that she spent in the classroom at  Bennett College. She has been a trailblazer for sure.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr.  Price), who also is a former college professor, who represents the  Fourth Congressional District. I thank him for joining us tonight.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Price very much for  those words, I thank him for his leadership and his relationship with  Shaw University, and I especially thank him for mentioning Estey Hall.   For many of us, who have grown up in North Carolina, we know the  relevance and the importance of Shaw University. We know how Shaw  University trained many hundreds, if not thousands, of individuals, who  came into communities all across North Carolina and made a difference.  They came into the classroom, and they taught at elementary schools and  high schools all across our State. They went onto college campuses and  became college professors. Many of them became lawyers because Shaw  University had a law school during those days. Some became physicians  and dentists. Some became pharmacists.   Shaw University was a real educational engine not just in North  Carolina, but throughout the country, during those very difficult days.  And I say all that to say that it was the General Baptist State  Convention and its predecessor that helped enable Shaw University to be  born. Shaw University has done so much for so many.   I recall, as a child, my parents would tell me that they, too,  attended Shaw University. My dad went to Shaw University from 1919 to  1923. My mother attended Shaw University for high school. During those  days, African Americans did not have the benefit in most communities of  a high school education and so many of the young teens would go to Shaw  for high school. It was there at Shaw University that my parents met.  My dad was in undergraduate school, my mother was in the high school,  and they met right on the porch of Estey Hall back in 1919.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Dr. Price and Dr. Adams for raising up Shaw  University and just telling the world what the General Baptist State  Convention did by creating the environment where Shaw University could  thrive.   Mr. Speaker, I thank both of them for coming to the floor.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms.  Adams) for any concluding remarks.    Very well said, Congresswoman Adams.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Price)  for any concluding remarks.    Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have remaining?    Mr. Speaker, as I was listening to Congressman Price  a moment ago recite the names of those great men who have led the  General Baptist State Convention, I could not help but to think that I,  too, remember all of them. And then I glanced down at the list of  presidents that I am going to enter into the Congressional Record in  just a few moments from now, and there have been 32 men who have served  as presidents of this great convention, and I have had the privilege of  knowing 12 of them.                                time  2030    I did not realize that until I actually pulled out the list and  started counting: C.R. Edwards, who Mr. Price recognized a moment ago;  Joy Johnson; John Manley; E.B. Turner; J.B. Humphrey; W.B. Lewis;  Clifford A. Jones, Sr.; John D. Fuller, Sr.; Charles T. Bullock;  Gregory K. Moss, Sr.; Howard W. Parker, Jr.; and the current president,  Dr. Nilous M. Avery, II.   I might say, Mr. Speaker, that of these names that I just mentioned,  three of those passed away in this calendar year.   They have been great Baptists and they have been great North  Carolinians and great Americans.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleagues and I want to thank the  General Baptist State Convention for 150 years of incredible work in  North Carolina, and I thank the men and women of both clergy and laity  who keep this convention alive and well.   Mr. Speaker, if I can close by simply using my dear, departed uncle  as but one example of a Black preacher who gave his entire life to his  ministry.   Reverend F.L. Bullock of Enfield, born 1896, pastored four churches  that were one-Sunday-per-month churches. Married to my mother's sister  who was a teacher, he was paid very little. Every day of his life,  Reverend Bullock would visit the sick and minister to the needs of his  community.   After serving as pastor for 64 long years, he was diagnosed with  cancer. No health insurance, no life insurance, no pension from any of  his churches, he died at age 84, several days after preaching his last  sermon.   Mr. Speaker, thousands of pastors have devoted their entire life to  the ministry. Many are remembered, but so many of them are not.   Today, the three of us pay tribute to all of them from the floor of  the United States House of Representatives.   May God bless the memory of each of them for making our communities a  better place to live, and may God continue to bless the General Baptist  State Convention of North Carolina and its current leaders as they  continue to serve God and his people of all races, creeds, and stations  in life.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 8 o'clock and 33 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Thursday, October 26, 2017, at 9 a.m.                            ____________________
