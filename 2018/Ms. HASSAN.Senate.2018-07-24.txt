 Mr. President, I am honored to recognize as July's  Granite Stater of the Month an individual who truly embodies the best  of New Hampshire's all-hands-on-deck spirit, consistently rolling up  her sleeves and helping her community, Dianne Paquette of Salem, NH.   Dianne's efforts started with two elementary school playgrounds that  needed repairs. She led efforts to raise money to repair the  playgrounds because, in her words, ``somebody has to.'' After she was  successful in her fundraising efforts for the playgrounds, Dianne moved  on to other town landmarks and was instrumental in raising funds and  gathering volunteers for several projects, including restoring the  historic Salem Depot Train Station.   Dianne has formed a core group of friends--a group that she calls the  Village--made up of law enforcement officials, firefighters, and  Granite Staters who share her commitment to helping their community.  Recently, Dianne and the Village have focused on helping those in need  after two separate apartment fires in Salem. She helped organize a  spaghetti dinner that raised nearly $6,000 and then, following a second  fire, and with the help of firefighters working in the kitchen, a  pancake breakfast that raised over $5,000.   Dianne said that these fires increased awareness about an issue that  is near to her heart, the lack of affordable housing in the Salem area.  The funds she helped raise are going to address many of the challenges  the victims of the fires will face, including relocating. As she said,  you can't fix everything with pancakes and spaghetti, but you can do  what you can to help.   Dianne reminds us all that sometimes helping your community is about  being the person to take the first step and voice the idea, and her  efforts to mobilize friends and neighbors to work together has made a  difference throughout her community. For her dedication to Salem, I am  proud to recognize Dianne as July's Granite Stater of the  Month.                            ____________________
