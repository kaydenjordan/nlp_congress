 Mr. Chair, I thank the chairman for yielding and for his  incredible work on this FAA reauthorization bill. It has been a  bipartisan experience working with Ranking Member Larsen, and I thank  him, as well, for his work on my amendments.   I thank them both for including Yakym amendment 100 in this en bloc.  This amendment which was developed in a bipartisan manner and  partnership with my colleague, Representative Titus from Nevada,  extends the requirement that the FAA take a maximal approach to hiring  and training air traffic controllers through the full life of the  reauthorization.   This summer, we have seen headlines, heard from constituents, and  maybe some of you have even experienced delayed flights and the chaos  that that can bring--one big reason is that we have 1,200 fewer fully  certified controllers than we did just 10 years ago. Hiring isn't  keeping up with the attrition, and short-staffed facilities impose  mandatory overtime and 6-day workweeks, which isn't sustainable for the  controllers we have.   An Inspector General report recently found that the FAA ``lacks a  plan to address'' the controller shortage.   The American traveling public needs the FAA to pursue a sustained,  long-term commitment to maximum hiring of air traffic controllers, and  Congress should require it.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support my amendment.    Madam Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the life and  honor the legacy of Ernestine Raclin, who recently passed away at the  age of 95.   The youngest daughter of Ernest and Emma Morris, Ernestine was born  and raised in South Bend, Indiana. Ernestine made it her life's mission  to make her home community a better place to live, work, and raise a  family.   Ernestine was a trailblazer, taking on roles and responsibilities  like few women before her. In addition to chairing 1st Source Bank,  Ernestine was the first woman to serve on both the Notre Dame Board of  Trustees and the Board of the United Way.   She was a strong supporter of the arts, devoting her time, talent,  and treasure to countless projects in the South Bend/Mishawaka area.   Above all, Ernestine was a leader who loved her family and possessed  a unique ability to rally people around causes greater than themselves.   The sheer number of remembrances that have come in since her passing  just goes to show you how many lives Ernestine touched and the people  that she shaped for the better.   I know Ernestine's family misses her during this deeply difficult  time, but I also know that they ``do not grieve as those who have no  hope,'' and they take comfort in knowing that they will one day be  reunited with Ernestine for all eternity.   May God bless Ernestine Raclin.                            ____________________
