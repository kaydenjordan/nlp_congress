 Mr. Speaker, ending forced labor--and holding China  accountable for these gross abuses of human rights--must be a global  effort. America should lead the world in halting China's brutality, and  all democracies around the world should join us.   As I've said many times, this is a completely bipartisan issue, as  demonstrated by the overwhelming bipartisan vote in the House on a  similar bill in September 2020. The United States has no tolerance for  China's human rights abuses, in Xinjiang or anywhere.   There are real challenges to further tighten the dragnet around China  and force it to eliminate atrocities, while supporting legitimate  trade. All of us agree: we want to create opportunities for our  producers to comply with the law while removing forced labor from our  global supply chains.   And just as important, we must urge our trading partners to work with  us. Inexplicably, this entirely bipartisan issue has been pushed to the  back burner, with Democrats delaying consideration for 14 months. And  Ways & Means did not mark this bill up or update the trade provisions  in any way. This is difficult to understand, because a core provision  of this bill, which is the rebuttable presumption that importation of  goods made in Xinjiang must be blocked because they are made with  forced labor, is clearly in our Committee's jurisdiction.   This issue is not only bipartisan. It's bicameral. Both the House and  the Senate have strong bills that send a clear and unequivocal message:  the United States has zero tolerance for these abuses.   While I'm disappointed that this was delayed, taking strong action  today is an important step.   Republicans support strong and effective legislation that addresses  China's atrocities while supporting legitimate trade, and I look  forward to working with the Senate to perfect our approach and enact  this bill into law promptly.   It is vital that we stop the scourge of modern-day slavery in China.                                time  1415
