 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, as Senators continue to return from the  State work period, we return here in the Senate to the topic of  healthcare, which everyone in America should continue to focus on.   Even after weeks of work, it seems my friends on the other side are  no closer to having enough votes to proceed to their bill--which, of  course, they insisted on doing with no Democratic votes or input.   The biggest challenge proposed to the legislation during the break  was an amendment offered by the junior Senator from Texas, Ted Cruz,  which would remove crucial protections for sicker Americans and  unbalance the marketplace. The Cruz amendment is a hoax. Under the  guise of lowering premiums, the Cruz amendment would actually make  healthcare more expensive because deductibles and copayments would be  so onerous that many Americans would pay more, not less, in out-of- pocket expenses than they pay today. These lower premium policies will  have such high deductibles and copays that the policies themselves  would be virtually worthless. Imagine you have a $2,000 premium and a  $1,000 deductible in your policy. Imagine now that, under the Cruz  amendment, an insurance company is allowed to offer a cheaper policy  because they aren't required to cover very many services. That policy  might have a premium of $1,000 but a deductible of $10,000. You would  be paying less monthly, but you would have to put down a huge amount of  money for your policy to even kick in. In that way, a Cruz insurance  policy is worse than no policy at all because the vast majority would  pay a monthly premium and never hit their deductible, so they would be  getting no health insurance benefit at all. You would pay the premium,  but the deductible is so high, your insurance never kicks in. What good  is that? In effect, for many, it is a policy that would have a premium  but no insurance.   In addition, Americans with preexisting conditions will almost  certainly be left without access to affordable and quality healthcare,  making the Senate bill even meaner than the House bill on this issue.  Even the Republican Senator from Iowa, Senator Grassley, said that  about the Cruz amendment. Here is what he said:         There's a real feeling that [it's] subterfuge to get around       pre-existing conditions. . . . If it has the effect of       annihilating the pre-existing condition requirement that we       have in the existing bill, then obviously I would object to       that.    Those are the words of Senator Grassley.   Members of both parties agree that the most significant potential  change to the Republican TrumpCare bill is an amendment that would make  the legislation even worse. So make no mistake about it--the Cruz  amendment is a cruel, mean hoax.   Let's not forget that even without the Cruz amendment, the substance  of the base Senate Republican bill is devastating. The CBO reports it  would cause costs to go up, care to go down, and force 22 million  Americans off their health insurance. It would end Medicaid as we know  it.   This weekend, I had the good experience once again to go to the Utica  Boilermaker, a famous 15K road race in my dad's hometown, the largest  in the country. People from 45 States participated.   As usual, I walked through the crowd afterwards, congratulating  people on a great race. They were sweaty, but they were happy. I came  upon three men in wheelchairs. Here they are. Just after they crossed  the finish line, the first thing they said to me was this: ``Senator,  please protect Medicaid; we'd be lost without it.''   These were proud men, and they deserved to be proud for finishing a  difficult race made harder by their disability. They could be forgiven  for taking a moment to celebrate. Instead, they wheeled up to me to  talk about how important Medicaid was to them.   These are not slackers. They wouldn't be in a race like this if they  were. They needed some help. They are disabled. I don't know how their  disabilities came about--probably from work. They look like really  strong guys. Are we going to take away their Medicaid so we can give  tax breaks to the wealthiest people in America? I hope not.   These folks know that Medicaid is a lifesaver for Americans with  disabilities. They want it maintained and strengthened, not dismantled  so our Republican friends can give another tax break to the very  wealthy.   These three should remind everyone that dismantling Medicaid is the  wrong way to go. It is time to move on from the failing Republicans- only approach and start over in a bipartisan way in healthcare.   Republican leadership has been trying to cajole their Members into  voting for this bill by saying that if Republicans fail to pass this  bill, they will have to work with Democrats. Republican leadership is  not telling their Members: Vote for this bill because it is a good  bill. No, they are saying: Vote for this bill or you will have to work  with Democrats.   When you can't defend the substance of the bill at all, it is time to  move on. When using bipartisanship as a threat is your only argument,  it is time to move on.   My Republican friends should not be so afraid of working with  Democrats that they are bullied into supporting a terrible bill. The  Senate--we all know this--was intended as a forge for bipartisan  consensus--a cooling saucer, as the Founding Fathers said. In the  Senate, bipartisanship should be the first option, not the last resort.   I repeat: We Democrats are willing to work. We are ready to work with  our Republican colleagues on healthcare. Today Democratic leadership  sent a letter to my friend the majority leader again offering to work  with him on specific legislation to stabilize the marketplaces and  improve the quality and lower the cost of care.   The majority leader said over the break that he may be forced to work  with Democrats to stabilize marketplaces. Democrats say: Let's do it.  Let's do it now.   We sent the majority leader four specific proposals, led by Senator  Shaheen's amendment to guarantee cost-sharing reduction payments--the  most important thing we can do to stabilize the marketplace and even  lower premiums for many right now. Whatever your views on healthcare,  we should agree that we need to stabilize the marketplaces. I look  forward to a response from the majority leader to our letter.   When will my Republican friends realize that their partisan approach  to healthcare is a dead end, that the only way to truly improve our  Nation's healthcare system is to finally heed Democrats' requests to  come together and work in a bipartisan way? I hope our Republican  colleagues realize this sooner, not later.  [[Page S3875]]                                ____________________     Mr. President, there was the G-20 and President Trump's  bilateral meeting with President Putin. While a few good things came  out of this summit, overall, it was an embarrassment to our country and  our ideals. Clearly, the lowest moment of all was President Trump's  meeting with Vladimir Putin, on several counts.   As our intelligence community has concluded, the President of Russia  deliberately interfered in our elections and sought to undermine our  democracy. That is not Democrats making it up. That is 17 intelligence  agencies--men and women, many of whom risk their lives for us every  day, people we look up to, people we admire. They are the ones who said  there was interference--not Democrats, not politicians. I wish  President Trump would stop saying it was Democrats who came up with  this idea. It was our own intelligence community. Rather than  decisively confront the Russian President on these actions--the Russian  interference--the President reportedly acquiesced to Putin's denial.   To give equal credence to the findings of 17 U.S. intelligence  agencies and an assertion by Mr. Putin is disgraceful. They are not  equal. Our 17 intelligence agencies are far more important to us and  far more credible to us than Vladimir Putin. Every American--every  American--no matter their party affiliation, should take umbrage with  the President of the United States equating our own hardworking,  dedicated intelligence community with Mr. Putin, who has shown contempt  for our democracy and has spent his professional and political career  trying to undermine it.   This almost certainly paves the way--the President's actions almost  certainly pave the way--for future Russian interference on our  elections. If Russia feels there will be no punishment for interfering  in our elections, no reprimand at all from the United States, surely  they will try and try again.   President Trump went so far as to float the absolutely absurd  possibility of a joint cyber security unit with the Russians. Then he  backtracked after he was hailing it as one of the great things about  the summit. When he got such reaction--particularly, from Senators  McCain and Rubio, from his own party--he backtracked.   The thought of working with our adversary on cyber security should  send chills down the backs of all Americans. It is clear that President  Trump is not willing to be the guardian of American interests when it  comes to Vladimir Putin. The House of Representatives must step in and  fill the void by passing the Senate's tough, bipartisan sanctions bill  to finally punish Russia for their intrusions in our 2016 elections.   The Founding Fathers established Congress as a check and balance on  the executive branch when necessary. The House must be that check and  balance now.   Given the President's actions at the G-20, there is now even more  reason for the House to pass the Senate sanctions bill, which passed 98  to 2--overwhelmingly bipartisan.   Given President Trump's casual dismissals of the findings of our  intelligence community and face-value acceptance of Mr. Putin's word,  there is even greater cause to tie the hands of this administration  with a tough Russia sanctions bill.   Now more than ever, it is clear that President Trump should not have  the final and only authority to lift sanctions on Russia. He has shown  that he is willing to turn a blind eye to the direct assault on our  democracy and did so this weekend in his meeting with Mr. Putin.   Congress should step up and say: President Trump, if you are not  going to punish Russia for meddling with our democracy, we will.   The American people are wondering: How can the President of the  United States fail to stick up for our democracy? How can the President  fail to seriously challenge the man responsible for violating the  sanctity of our elections?   Candidly, I am dismayed that the Republican leadership in this body  and in the other has been so quiet in the wake of these events. The  Republican Party's foreign policy for decades was predicated on  opposition to the Soviet Union and now Russia. It was the linchpin of  their foreign policy. Now, when a President of their party is soft on  Russia--even after Russia blatantly interfered in our elections--we  hardly hear a peep from the Republican leadership.   I certainly acknowledge, respect, and admire the words of my friends,  Republican Senators McCain, Graham, Sasse, and Rubio, who have spoken  out and should be recognized and applauded for it. They have been the  exception, not the rule. We need to hear more from the Republican  leadership because this situation is getting ever more troubling.                            ____________________     Mr. President, finally, a word on the revelation that  President Trump's son, his son-in-law, and his campaign manager met  with a lawyer with ties to the Kremlin with the pretext of discussing  information that would be damaging to Secretary Clinton's campaign.   This revelation should be the end of the idea pushed by the  administration and the President that there is absolutely no evidence  of an intent by the Trump campaign to coordinate or collude. It is  certainly not proof positive--we don't know what was said in the  meeting--but these reports in the press at least demand further  investigation.   It defies credulity that the President's campaign manager, his son,  and his son-in-law, at the height of a very, very heated campaign-- three people very close to the President and at the helm of that  campaign--were all going to a meeting with a Russian lawyer to discuss  Russian adoption. Indeed, Donald Trump, Jr., has now admitted--after he  first said the purpose of the meeting was adoption--that he agreed to  meet to get potentially damaging information about Hillary Clinton.   The Senate Intelligence Committee has already indicated that it will  look into the possibility of coordination or collusion as part of their  broader investigation. This meeting and the background behind it should  be included in future document requests and additional lines of  inquiry.   After providing documents to the Intelligence Committee, Donald  Trump, Jr., must also testify before the committee to explain why three  of the highest level members of the Trump administration thought it was  appropriate to meet with a Russian source to receive information about  a political opponent. We are talking about the wellspring and pride of  our democracy--free and fair elections without foreign interference.   When the President of the United States is unwilling to forcibly  defend our democracy, a violation of our sovereignty, face to face with  its chief adversary, when we continue to learn of additional meetings  between his campaign and Russian sources, when we hear that the White  House is actively working to water down or stall a bill of tough Russia  sanctions, we in Congress need to step up and defend the vital  interests of our country. Both parties should be united in that effort  because, at least for now, the President seems unwilling to do so.                            ____________________     Mr. President, finally, on nominations, which were just  mentioned in a noncamera briefing at the White House, I understand the  White House is complaining about the pace of nominations, citing the  obstruction of Senate Democrats. If the White House is looking for a  cause of the delay, they only need to look in the mirror.   No administration in recent memory has been slower in sending  nominees to the Senate. In the last few weeks, the administration has  sent several nominees without all of their paperwork or their ethics  agreements complete. We can't go forward until that happens.   The White House has sent nominees for the Cabinet on down without the  paperwork or ethics agreements completed. That is almost unprecedented  in its degree. Time and again, they have stalled on providing  committees with the information they need to proceed on nominations.   After campaigning on ``draining the swamp,'' the Trump administration  has  [[Page S3876]]  sent the Senate a slew of nominees with a myriad of conflicts of  interest and ethics entanglements. It is our duty in the Senate to vet  these nominees properly because the American people are entitled to  ethical government. Yet the White House blames the delay on obstruction  in the Senate.   It is typical of the Trump administration to do something wrong and  blame someone else for their problem.   Mr. President, I yield the floor for my good friend and colleague  from the great State of Florida.                            ____________________     I would be happy to yield to my friend from Florida.    In answer to my friend, I absolutely would because I  have experienced the same thing. I was in my State in many areas that  are Republican, many areas that Donald Trump carried. The same thing  happened. I have not previously seen this depth of concern from people  of all different backgrounds, all different economic levels, all  different races, religions, creeds, colors saying the exact same thing.  People are so afraid of this TrumpCare bill that they are begging us,  almost, to please stop it. In answer to the Senator's question: No, I  am not surprised because I have experienced the same thing in some of  the most conservative, rural, Republican parts of my State during this  break.    The Senator is exactly correct. It affects people across  the board, including these fine people whom I met at the Utica  Boilermaker 15K race.   I thank my colleague for his, as always, astute questions.                            ____________________
