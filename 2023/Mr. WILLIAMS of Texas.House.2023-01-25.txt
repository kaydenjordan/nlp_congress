 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 399) to clarify the primary functions and duties of  the Office of Advocacy of the Small Business Administration, and for  other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 399         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Small Business Advocacy       Improvements Act of 2023''.       SEC. 2. AMENDMENT TO PRIMARY FUNCTIONS AND DUTIES OF THE                     OFFICE OF ADVOCACY OF THE SMALL BUSINESS                     ADMINISTRATION.         (a) Primary Functions.--Section 202 of Public Law 94-305       (15 U.S.C. 634b) is amended--        (1) in paragraph (1), by inserting ``and the international       economy'' after ``economy'';        (2) in paragraph (9), by striking ``complete'' and       inserting ``compete''; and        (3) in paragraph (12), by striking ``serviced-disabled''       and inserting ``service-disabled''.        (b) Duties.--Section 203(a) of Public Law 94-305 (15 U.S.C.       634c) is amended--        (1) in paragraph (5), by striking ``and'' at the end;        (2) in paragraph (6), by striking the period at the end and       inserting ``; and''; and        (3) by adding at the end the following:        ``(7) represent the views and interests of small businesses       before foreign governments and international entities for the       purpose of contributing to regulatory and trade initiatives       which may affect small businesses.''.     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I rise in support of H.R. 399, better known as the Small Business  Advocacy Improvements Act. The SBA Office of Advocacy is charged with  looking out for the interests of small businesses across the entirety  of the Federal Government. In many cases, this means calling out the  negative impacts of regulations that are hurting small businesses or  looking for inefficient rules that are preventing small businesses from  competing for government contracts.   This legislation expands the SBA Office of Advocacy's mission to  include advocating for small businesses on international trade issues.  As our economy has become more and more intertwined with the rest of  the world, overseas markets have become more accessible for small  businesses.   However, when various regulations come out setting the rules of the  road for trade agreements, small business voices can easily be drowned  out. This bill solves this problem and ensures that Main Street America  has someone fighting for their interests as international trade  regulations are being created.                                time  1315    I thank my friend from Missouri for introducing this bill again in  the 118th Congress and for always being a fierce advocate for our  Nation's job creators.   Additionally, I hope that as this Congress progresses, we can  continue to look for bipartisan ways to make the SBA Office of Advocacy  more effective in helping our small businesses across the country.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I look forward to working with  the ranking member to get some really good things done.   Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman  from Missouri (Mr. Luetkemeyer), my dear friend and a great patriot.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   Mr. Speaker, small businesses are facing unprecedented economic  headwinds. From broken supply chains to rising interest rates, many of  these challenges are brand new for many businessowners.   I hope that we will be taking up meaningful legislation to help  alleviate some of these large challenges, but in the meantime, we need  to ensure small businesses have as many people fighting for them in  Washington as possible.   H.R. 399 will allow Main Street to have one more voice looking out  for their interests as trade regulations are being developed. This has  the potential to open up new markets and expand their reach into the  global economy.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 449) to amend the Small Business Act to increase  transparency, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 449         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Microloan Transparency and       Accountability Act of 2023''.       SEC. 2. PORTFOLIO RISK ANALYSIS OF MICROLOANS.         Section 7(m)(10) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C.       636(m)(10)) is amended--        (1) by redesignating subparagraphs (A) through (F) as       clauses (i) through (vi), respectively, and adjusting the       margins accordingly;        (2) by amending clause (iv), as so redesignated, to read as       follows:        ``(vi) the number, amount, and percentage of microloans       made by intermediaries to small business concerns--         ``(I) that went into default in the previous year; and        ``(II) that were charged off in the previous year by such       intermediaries;'';         (3) in clause (vi), as so redesignated, by striking ``and''       at the end;        (4) by redesignating subparagraph (G) as clause (xviii),       and adjusting the margin accordingly;        (5) by striking ``On November 1, 1995,'' and all that       follows through ``the following:'' and inserting the       following:        ``(A) In general.--Beginning on February 1, 2023, and       annually thereafter, the Administrator shall submit to the       Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship of the       Senate and the Committee on Small Business of the House of       Representatives, and make available to the public on the       website of the Administration, a report on the effectiveness       of the microloan program during the fiscal year preceding the       date of the report. Such report shall include--'';        (6) in subparagraph (A), as so designated, by inserting       after clause (vi) the following new clauses:        ``(vii) the number and type of enforcement actions taken by       the Administrator against noncompliant intermediaries;        ``(viii) an analysis of compliance by intermediaries with       the credit availability requirements of paragraph (3)(E) for       loans in an amount greater than $20,000;        ``(ix) the extent to which microloans are provided to small       business concerns in rural areas;        ``(x) the number of underserved borrowers, as defined by       the Administration, participating in the microloan program;        ``(xi) the average rate of interest for each microloan;        ``(xii) the average amount of fees charged for each       microloan;        ``(xiii) the average size of each microloan, including--         ``(I) the number of loans made in an amount greater than       $20,000; and        ``(II) the average size and charge-off rate of such loans;         ``(xiv) the subsidy cost to the Administration;        ``(xv) the number and percentage of microloans that were       made to refinance other loans;        ``(xvi) the number and percentage of microloans made to new       program participants and the number and percentage of       microloans made to previous program participants;        ``(xvii) the average amount of technical assistance grant       monies spent on each loan; and''; and        (7) by adding at the end the following:        ``(B) Privacy.--Each report submitted under subparagraph       (A) shall not contain any personally identifiable information       of any borrower.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 449, the Microloan  Transparency and Accountability Act.   When an entrepreneur wants to start a business, finding starting  capital can be one of the hardest challenges there is. SBA's microloan  program looks to solve this issue and provide capital to people who  need help getting their businesses off the ground.   While this program is well intended, Congress currently doesn't have  access to some key metrics that we need to evaluate the effectiveness  of this program. For example, it would be very helpful to have a  comprehensive review of where the loans are being distributed to see if  it is being utilized in many rural areas of the country. Additionally,  we are currently left in the dark about the overall risk profile of the  entirety of the program.   This bill would solve these problems by directing the SBA to do a  comprehensive analysis to evaluate the effectiveness of this program.   The Microloan Transparency and Accountability Act will provide  Congress with much-needed insight to make determinations on how to  better optimize this program to assist small businesses.   I thank my colleague from Tennessee, who has advanced this bill for  the last few Congresses, for his dedication to improving this program.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may  consume to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Burchett), a great patriot  who loves our country.  [[Page H304]]         Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I  am prepared to close.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, the microloan program which  delivers capital assistance to the Nation's smallest businesses is an  important lending tool at the SBA.   H.R. 449, the Microloan Transparency and Accountability Act, will  deliver comprehensive data and information on the effectiveness of the  program. I applaud all of the members for working on this important  legislation in an effort to shine more light on how well the program is  working.   From my State of Texas to both of the Nation's coasts, accessing  capital remains a top challenge facing all small businesses. We must  ensure these programs and tools are operating at a high level and  delivering on the goals that Congress set for them.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 449, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 400) to amend the Small Business Investment Act of  1958 to increase the amount that may be invested in small business  investment companies.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 400         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Investing in Main Street Act       of 2023''.       SEC. 2. INVESTMENT IN SMALL BUSINESS INVESTMENT COMPANIES.         Section 302(b) of the Small Business Investment Act of 1958       (15 U.S.C. 682(b)) is amended--        (1) in paragraph (1), by striking ``5 percent'' and       inserting ``15 percent''; and        (2) in paragraph (2), by striking ``5 percent'' and       inserting ``15 percent''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks  and submit extraneous materials on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.  [[Page H305]]    Small businesses are the engines of our economy. Over half of the  country's payroll is made from small businesses, and when we work to  find solutions to help these entities, we are strengthening the  economic foundation of our country.   So before we start debating these bills, I thank our leadership team  for recognizing the importance of small businesses and bringing these  bills to the floor quickly so we can help build up Main Street America.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 400, better known as the  Investing in Main Street Act.   Last Congress, the Subcommittee on Capital Access held a hearing on  the small business investment company program, otherwise known as the  SBIC program. During this hearing, our members heard from witnesses  about how this program attracts private equity investments to small  businesses to hire more people and expand their operations.   This is a self-sustaining program that supports our Nation's job  creators without costing taxpayers any money. In order to expand on  this success, H.R. 400 looks to increase the maximum allowable  investments by SBICs from 5 percent to 15 percent of their excess  capital to small businesses.   This change will allow for greater amounts of private equity dollars  to go toward small businesses. Additionally, this will align the SBIC  program to other financial regulations coming out of the OCC and will  help jumpstart growth of small businesses across this country.   As we look for ways to continually improve on this program, this  change will have an immediate impact for our jobs and our Nation's job  creators.   I thank my colleagues from California and New York for, once again,  introducing this bipartisan solution to expand successful programs that  empower the private sector to invest in small businesses.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may  consume to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Garbarino), a person who  loves this country, and who understands Main Street America and small  businesses.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I  am prepared to close.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1345     Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   Mr. Speaker, the SBIC program has delivered for small businesses for  many years. It is time we update the program to match other Federal  rules and ensure the program continues to serve our communities in the  future. This is a commonsense step to increase the amount of investment  that an SBIC can receive.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 400, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
