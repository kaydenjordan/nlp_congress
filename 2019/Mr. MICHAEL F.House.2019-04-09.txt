 DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous  consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend  their remarks.    DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Chair, I yield myself 3  minutes.   Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of H.R. 1644, the Save the  Internet Act.   This bill comes to the floor after more than 18 hours of  consideration by the Energy and Commerce Committee over the course of  hearings and markups since the start of this Congress.   During that time, we have heard from consumer advocates, minority and  underrepresented communities, rural broadband providers, small  businesses, innovators, entrepreneurs, and millions of constituents,  all calling for the restoration of net neutrality rules.   In addition, polls show that more than 86 percent of all Americans,  whether they be Republicans, Independents, or Democrats, opposed the  Trump FCC's repeal of the protections that this bill reinstates.   People around the country care deeply about a free and open internet  because it is critical for so many communities and sectors of our  economy.   This legislation will do three things:   First, it restores bipartisan, commonsense net neutrality protections  and puts a cop back on the beat to protect consumers, small businesses,  and competitors from unjust, unreasonable, and discriminatory practices  by internet service providers.   Second, this bill gives the FCC the authority to protect consumers,  now and in the future, through forward-looking regulatory authority.   Third, the bill restores the FCC's legal authority to support  broadband access and deployment programs through the Universal Service  Fund.  [[Page H3170]]  These programs pay for the deployment of broadband in rural communities  through the Connect America Fund and support access for low-income  families, seniors, and veterans through the Lifeline program.   The Save the Internet Act codifies the FCC's 2015 Open Internet Order  and permanently prohibits the FCC from applying provisions on rate  setting, unbundling of ISP networks, or levying additional taxes or  fees on broadband access.   This legislation that we are considering here today charts a new  course for net neutrality and would put in place 21st century rules for  a 21st century internet.   I look forward to advancing this legislation out of the House and,  ultimately, through the Congress so that we can restore these essential  protections for all Americans.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Chair, what my friend  refers to as a takeover of the internet we call protecting consumers,  and that is what we are asking the FCC to do.   I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pallone),  chairman of the full Energy and Commerce Committee.  [[Page H3171]]                                     time  1530     DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself  such time as I may consume.   I find this pretty humorous that the Republicans want to talk about  government takeover of the internet. The only person I know who has  proposed publicly to take over the internet is the President of the  United States when he said he wants to nationalize 5G.   Maybe you guys need to take a little trip over to the White House and  prevent that little government takeover of the internet.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from California  (Ms. Eshoo), a valuable member of this committee.    DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Chairman, my friends keep  talking about the government takeover of the internet. I am glad to see  that they are finally taking a stand against  [[Page H3174]]  the foolish 5G nationalization proposal that the Trump administration  can't seem to stop talking about.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from North Carolina  (Mr. Butterfield).    DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the  balance of my time.    DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Chairman, I would submit  that we are listening to the public and our constituents. Eighty-six  percent of all Americans--Republicans, Democrats, and Independents-- support what we are doing here today. It is the Republicans who are  standing up for a very small number of ISPs in this country.   It gives me great pleasure to yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Pelosi), who is the Speaker of the  House.    DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Chair, we keep hearing over  and over again that same mantra, ``government takeover of the  internet.''   What the Republicans call the heavy hand of government is what is  actually protecting consumers. If they want to stop a government  takeover of the internet, then they had better talk to the White House:  ``Trump apparently wants to control 5G in a `state-run' socialist twist  to American capitalism.'' That is where you need to take those concerns  about the government takeover to.   Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from California  (Ms. Matsui), vice chair of the Subcommittee on Communications and  Technology.    DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Madam Chair, I would say to the  gentlewoman that we know that net neutrality rules don't affect  internet speed or internet investment.   And who says that? The CEOs of all the internet companies when they  are talking to their Wall Street investors.   Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr.  McNerney).    DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Madam Chair, may I inquire how  much time I have remaining.    DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Madam Chair, I yield myself  such time as I may consume.   This debate can be broken down very simply. There is agreement on the  three bright lines. So Democrats and Republicans agree: no blocking, no  throttling, no paid prioritization. But that is where my friends on the  Republican side stop.  [[Page H3177]]    Democrats understand that, already, we see behavior by ISPs that  isn't covered by those three bright lines, in the areas of zero rating  and interconnection. There has to be a cop on the beat to protect  consumers.   This bill is very basic. It says we are going to outlaw the three  bright lines. We all agree with that.   The only things we do in addition to this are two other things:   Number one, we restore the legal underpinnings for the Connect  America program, which helps rural broadband, and the Lifeline program,  which helps our seniors, veterans, and low-income families in the  country. We make it easier for pole attachments to make rural  deployment of broadband easier to do, to facilitate that. So we take  care of rural America in the bill.   Then we also say there has to be someone to look out for consumers  if, somewhere down the road, an ISP finds a new way to have some unjust  or unreasonable or discriminatory behavior. Someone has to have the  ability to say: You can't do that, and, if you continue to do that, we  are going to levy a fine or we are going to take action against you.                                time  1615    That is called consumer protection. What my friends over here want to  do is simply take the three bright lines and say, okay, we will enforce  that because they have been caught red-handed doing that. Everybody  knows they have pled guilty to the blocking, the throttling, and the  paid prioritization. We will outlaw that. But if they find some new,  novel way to game the system and disadvantage consumers, we don't want  anyone to be able to stop that kind of behavior.   Madam Chair, it is sort of like locking your front door and leaving  the back door wide open. That is what the Republicans would have us do,  if we would agree to their so-called compromise that they are putting  forward.   Let me tell you something. I didn't come to Congress to work for  internet service providers. I came to Congress to protect consumers.   And you are not fooling Americans. Eighty-six percent of Americans,  be they Democrats, Republicans, or Independents, did not want to see  the Pai FCC, the Trump FCC, repeal these net neutrality rules. There  was overwhelming testimony during the rulemaking from more than 20  million people asking the FCC not to take this action. This is an issue  not only amongst millennials but all throughout our population.   You have been hearing it on your telephones, too. That is why you all  want to say you are for something. You stand there and say we are for a  free and open internet, but what you are for is allowing these ISPs to  figure out new ways to game the system and making sure there is no cop  on the beat, the FCC, to be able to regulate that. That is why we are  never going to agree until we sit down and protect consumers in this  kind of bill.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Madam Chair, how much time do I  have left?    DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Madam Chair, I yield myself the  balance of my time.   I appreciate this debate. A couple of points I would like to make as  we close. I think people need to understand that, 2 years ago, when the  Trump FCC decided to repeal the net neutrality rules that were in  place, what did they replace them with? How did they protect consumers  when they decided to repeal the net neutrality rules put in place by  Chairman Wheeler during the Obama administration? I will tell you what  they did. They did nothing--nothing, no protections, the Wild, Wild  West. The only thing a consumer could look forward to was, if one of  these ISPs violated their terms and conditions, they might be able to  go over to the FTC and ask for relief.    Ask the California firefighters how that worked for them when they  were in the middle of trying to put out these devastating fires in  California and came up on their data cap and had no recourse. Ask them  if they think that was unjust or unreasonable behavior.   For Republicans to stand here and say that they care about net  neutrality rules when they had 2 years when they controlled the House  and the Senate and the White House to put one of these three bills they  like to talk about on the floor--because they controlled the floor to  pass the bills, to  [[Page H3178]]  pass it in their Republican-controlled Senate and give it to their  Republican President to implement net neutrality rules to protect  consumers. What did they do? They did nothing--nothing, crickets,  silence.   Now Democrats control the House of Representatives. We said that it  is important to all Americans, and all Americans regardless--Democrats,  Republicans, and Independents--wanted to see those net neutrality rules  that were repealed restored. So what we have done is we have taken that  2015 open internet order and we said let's put this into law. Let's put  this into statute so that no future FCC Commissioner can come there and  change this.   We have forborne on 700 regulations that were in title II. You keep  hearing this: We are putting the heavy hand of title II, Ma Bell, 1934  rules on the internet. That is not true. All of those provisions of  title II were forborne. They are not part of this bill.   What did we keep in title II? We kept the consumer protections in  sections 201 and 202. We saved the legal underpinnings that make it  possible to do the Connect America Fund and the Lifeline Program. We  put a cop on the beat so that, for future bad behavior on the part of  the ISPs, there is someone there to say you can't do that, and if you  try to do that, we can take action against you.   Now, I ask you, what do the ISPs have to fear from that? If they are  not acting in an unjust or an unreasonable or a discriminatory fashion,  they have nothing to worry about.   I would ask my friends, what unjust and unreasonable and  discriminatory behavior do you think they should be allowed to engage  in?   Well, I have news for you. Just the three bright lines, that doesn't  cut it anymore. We have already seen behavior that is discriminatory  that isn't covered by those three bright lines. If there is no cop on  the beat to enforce that on behalf of consumers, then it is the  consumers who are the losers.   We are not going to let that happen. The American people don't want  that to happen. People of all stripes have said, loud and clear, that  they want to see commonsense, bipartisan net neutrality rules put into  place.   When I say bipartisan, the only place it isn't bipartisan is here in  the House of Representatives, not out in the country. The Senate passed  a similar bill last year in their CRA with 52 Members. It was  bipartisan.   We tried to put that CRA on the floor last year, and the Republican  majority wouldn't put the bill on the floor so that we could have a  vote on it. We tried a discharge petition to see if we could get the  bill on the floor, and not a single Republicans helped us pass the  discharge petition so that we could have a vote on net neutrality.   Let's not kid ourselves here. Any chance that Republicans had to have  no regulation on the internet, that is what they have been about when  they have been in power in this body.   Madam Chair, it is a new day, and it is a new House of  Representatives, one that listens to the will of the people, the  citizens of America who have said loud and clear that they want to see  these rules put back in place.   To all my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, this is your chance  to be on the right side of history. This is your chance to be on the  side of the angels. I ask all my colleagues to vote for this bill, vote  ``yes'' on H.R. 1644 and restore net neutrality rules for all  Americans.   I yield back the balance of my time.    DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Madam Chair, I claim the time  in opposition to the amendment, even though I am not opposed to it.    DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Madam Chair, I yield myself as  much time as I may consume.   The Save the Internet Act is narrowly focused on ISPs as the  gatekeepers to the internet. They control the networks, so they have  the ability to shape and control traffic as it moves over their  network.   Edge providers play a different role in the internet ecosystem and  are not in the same class as internet service providers.   There are numerous cases of documented abuses by ISPs going back  several years. I am sure that is a big part of why net neutrality has  such overwhelming bipartisan support. Even 82 percent of Republicans  oppose the FCC's 2017 rollback of the rules.   Now, that is not to say that there are not problems on the edge-- there are--but that is not what this bill is about.   So in the spirit of bipartisanship, we are going to accept this  amendment. We hear the concerns of Mr. Burgess and our friends on the  other side of the aisle, and we want to work together with them to  address this.   We appreciate Mr. Burgess' willingness to work with us to find a  compromise on this issue.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Madam Chair, we know the FCC  does not have the authority to regulate the edge providers, and we know  currently, since there are no net neutrality rules, the only recourse  people have is to the FTC. Chairman Pai assured people that the FTC can  fully police net neutrality.   Well, here is a nice article: ``FTC gives ISPs green light to block  applications as long as they disclose it.''   So, there it is, ladies and gentlemen, these protections which you  want to send over to the FTC, they have just now told the world that as  long as they put it in their terms and conditions, they can block  applications if they choose to do so.   The gentleman from Texas and the gentleman from Oregon, both friends,  bring up valid concerns about edge providers, but this isn't the bill  where it belongs. But we do want to work with them, and I look forward  to engaging both of them and my good friend, the ranking member of the  Communication and Technology Subcommittee, as we go forward to look  into that part of the ecosystem.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Madam Chair, I claim the time  in opposition to the amendment, even though I am not opposed to it.    DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Madam Chair, the overwhelmingly  popular Save the Internet Act would restore the commonsense and much  loved net neutrality protections adopted by the FCC's 2015 net  neutrality order.   These protections were comprehensive in addressing bad behavior, but  [[Page H3181]]  targeted so as not to be overly burdensome. The agency made sure that  dated and unnecessary provisions of the Communications Act and certain  implementing regulations did not apply to broadband internet service.  In fact, the 2015 order says that more than 700 regulations would not  apply to broadband.   While the industry apparently didn't need the FCC to tell them what  wasn't in the order, our Republican colleagues have raised a concern  that more clarity is needed.   Madam Chair, I don't remember the last time, however, that  legislation was brought to the floor and concerns were raised about  what the legislation didn't do and where we asked for an enumerated  list of provisions the legislation didn't apply to.   That being said, I support greater clarity. The gentleman's amendment  would require the FCC to publish a list of all the provisions and  regulations that were forborne by the 2015 order.   Importantly, this wasn't an issue at all when these net neutrality  protections were in place for nearly 3 years, but our Republican  colleagues have raised a concern, and in the spirit of bipartisanship,  we will support this amendment.   Given that we are taking affirmative steps to address the concerns,  we hope they will be persuaded to join us in supporting this immensely  popular commonsense legislation.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Madam Chair, how much time do I  have remaining?    DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Madam Chair, I am thrilled to  get the gentleman this information. I know the FCC has it and will be  happy to share it with him.   It is kind of amusing that he wants to know what regulations we  aren't putting on business. I thought they were the guys who didn't  like any regulations on business. Now they are dying to know where are  these 700 regulations that aren't going to be put in the bill.   What is important about the bill is not what is not in the bill, but  what is in the bill. That is what they need to focus on. This is kind  of like Geraldo Rivera trying to open Al Capone's safe. They are just  dying to know what those 700 regulations are.   And guess what. We are going to pass this bill and vote with them on  this, so that desire to know what isn't in the bill will finally be  satisfied. I am sure that their Chairman, Chairman Pai, the current  Chairman of the FCC, will be more than happy to hand them that list  once we pass this bill. I will be happy to do that for our friends.   We on the Democratic side support the amendment and intend to vote  ``yes'' on the amendment.    DOYLE of Pennsylvania. I yield to the gentleman from  Oregon.    DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Madam Chair, reclaiming my  time, I was just amazed that he didn't have the list already. That is  his good friend over there, and I am sure a quick phone call on his  point would have satisfied this curiosity he has.   Madam Chair, I am happy to entertain this. I intend to vote ``yes''  on this, and I yield back the balance of my time.    DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Madam Chair, I thank my friend  for yielding.   Madam Chair, during our committee's hearing on net neutrality in the  Save the Internet Act, we heard testimony about the importance of a  free and open internet to vulnerable populations and groups  underrepresented in the traditional media. The message was clear:   Net neutrality protections are critical to vulnerable populations.   Net neutrality is critical for minority communities to have their  stories told. It is a lifeline to connecting with job training,  employment searches, and family connections.   Net neutrality is important for ensuring that small businesses or  aspiring writers can use the internet to find customers and fan bases  across the country or across the globe.   Madam Chair, this is an important issue, and I fully support the  gentlewoman's amendment.    DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Madam Chair, I thank the  gentleman from New York (Mr. Delgado), my friend.   You know, the FCC does need to do more to support the funding of  stand-alone broadband, particularly for rural areas, and this amendment  will help push them to do that.   The Save the Internet Act would restore many of the key authorities  the FCC can use to fund rural broadband deployment in the future. It is  really hard to understate how important that is for rural America, and  this amendment would help us do even more.   This amendment would simply require the GAO to study the benefits of  stand-alone broadband plans and how we in Congress can increase the  availability of these stand-alone plans in rural areas of the country  where broadband is so hard to come by.   I support this amendment. It is a wonderful addition to a bill that  would restore net neutrality to everyone across this country and help  support rural broadband build-out as well.   Madam Chair, I look forward to working with the gentleman from New  York.    DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Madam Chair, I demand a  recorded vote.    DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Madam Chair, I thank the  gentlewoman for yielding.   The important protections we are discussing today will only be a  toothless tiger if the FCC is not taking action to investigate  potential violations and taking enforcement action where it is  warranted.   The great thing about this amendment is that the FCC will have to  come back to us 1 year after the Save the Internet Act is adopted and  tell us what kinds of investigations and enforcement actions they have  undertaken.   It also shines a light on whether the FCC follows through with its  enforcement actions. As we just heard, recently, it was reported that  even though the FCC fined robocallers $208 million, it only collected  $7,000.   Remind me not to use them as my collection agent.   Rules aren't a deterrent unless there are real consequences. This  amendment will help Congress determine if the FCC is truly doing its  job and better facilitate the critical oversight role of this body.   I fully support this amendment, and I look forward to getting this  report.    DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Madam Chair, I thank the  gentlewoman for yielding to me.   The Save the Internet Act is going to ensure that net neutrality  throughout this country is ensured, and, hopefully, it is going to  bring the internet to all parts of this country. It will do that, in  part, by restoring the legal authority of section 706 of the  Telecommunications Act, which gives the FCC authority to take immediate  action to accelerate deployment of such capability by removing barriers  to infrastructure investment and by promoting competition in the  telecommunications market.   The FCC's 477 data is critical for getting an accurate picture of  broadband deployment in this country, but the methods of collecting  that data are outdated, and the results are sometimes rife with errors.   This amendment calls upon the FCC to submit a report within 30 days  of enactment, detailing how it plans to evaluate and address problems  with the collection of that form 477 data.   We have already seen how inaccurate Commission data can lead to poor  policy choices, whether it is holding up the Mobility Fund II  proceedings, which will fund the deployment of wireless broadband in  rural communities, or rendering inaccurate the Commission's recent  draft broadband deployment report, which drastically overstated  deployment in this country due to lax and faulty data collection  methods.   I fully support this amendment, and I thank the gentlewoman for  yielding.    DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Madam Chair, I demand a  recorded vote.    DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Madam Chair, I move that the  Committee do now rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Ms.  Wexton) having assumed the chair, Ms. Kaptur, Acting Chair of the  Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that  that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 1644) to  restore the open internet order of the Federal Communications  Commission, had come to no resolution thereon.                            ____________________     DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous  consent that all Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and  extend their remarks and add extraneous material on H.R. 1644.
