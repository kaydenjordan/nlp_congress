 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge the Senate to  confirm Judge Brett Kavanaugh to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court.   President Trump considered many well-qualified judges and legal  scholars for the High Court, and he selected the best of the best.  [[Page H6122]]    Judge Kavanaugh has outstanding academic credentials and an  impressive professional record, including clerking for Justice Kennedy  and serving on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia  since 2006.   Judge Kavanaugh is a constitutional conservative who will interpret  our Nation's laws as our Founders intended and not make laws from the  bench.   Judge Kavanaugh offers a sound approach to issues important to  Montana. Judge Kavanaugh has defended private property rights from  governmental interference, protected landowners from outrageous  regulations, and rejected Federal overreach, including from the  previous administration's overzealous EPA.   Mr. Speaker, Judge Kavanaugh enjoyed bipartisan support when the  Senate confirmed him 12 years ago. I urge the Senate to avoid political  games, sideshows, and stunts and confirm Judge Kavanaugh to serve on  the U.S. Supreme Court.                            ____________________
