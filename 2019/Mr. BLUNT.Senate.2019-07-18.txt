 Madam President, something I want to talk about today is  something that you and I both care a lot about, and that is farming  families and trade. For those of us who grew up on or near farming  families, we know that there are a lot of things that are beyond the  control of families who farm. For farming and ranching families, the  only real certainty is uncertainty.   The only thing you know for sure, if your mom or dad is a dairy  farmer, like my mom and dad were, is that you don't know anything for  sure. You don't know about the weather. You don't know absolutely for  sure that all of your equipment is going to work exactly like you need  it to and at exactly the time you need it to.   In some farming situations, you don't know whether the help you need  is going to be available the day you need it. The watermelons can't  wait. The strawberries can't wait. The tomatoes can't wait. But you  can't have a staff on all the time, ready to pick the watermelon the 2  weeks they need to be picked, or whatever those farmers have to deal  with.   Uncertainty is part of farming. That is why trade agreements with  other countries are so important to America's agriculture. This is a  part of our economy that not only feeds our country but goes so far  toward feeding the whole world. Trade agreements can provide a little  bit of certainty about markets and the opportunities people have to  sell the products they are able to grow.   In Missouri, agriculture is an $88 billion industry. It employs  nearly 400,000 people in our State. Missouri farmers and ranchers  export more than $4 billion worth of products every year.   Trade deals that lower tariffs that are paid by Missouri farming and  ranching families are a good deal now. I could go a long way beyond  this, too, because not only does the agricultural sector impact people  who make agricultural products but seeds and chemicals that we need  fewer and fewer of all the time because people who make and repair  machinery get more effective all the time. So both in the seed and  chemical area but also people in transportation, people in insurance,  people who run the local coffee shop, people whom the school district  depends on for those property taxes are all benefited by a strong  agricultural sector.   We make lots of other things in our State too. We make airplanes. We  make pickup trucks. We make cars. We make beer cans. We make all kinds  of things that are impacted by trade, but I say to the Presiding  Officer, particularly when you and I are out talking in our neighboring  States with the communities we deal with in agriculture, trade is a  top-of-the-line issue.   It is just an important part of the economy of most of our States,  frankly. Because of our location, where we live, infrastructure is  critical. We are also the hub for products that go all over North  America. Integrating that infrastructure--water, rail, cars, and  [[Page S4932]]  trucks--makes a difference in how we compete.   Canada and Mexico are our two biggest trading partners in, I am sure,  our State and in the country. In recent months, Mexico has become the  biggest trading partner we have. Canada is the next biggest trading  partner we have. These are not inconsequential relationships.   When the United States signed the North America Free Trade Agreement  25 years ago, it did a lot to open those markets for our products and  to not only strengthen our economy but to strengthen the neighborhood.  Our exports of food and agricultural products to Canada and Mexico  quadrupled under the NAFTA agreement. The treaty also helped to  strengthen ties among our countries.   You know, a strong Mexico is actually good for us. We have these  problems at the border right now that Mexico is trying to help us  solve. Almost nobody is coming from Mexico; they are coming through  Mexico. And why aren't they coming from Mexico like they did 25 years  ago? Because the Mexican economy is an economy that works for people  who live there. A strong Canada is good for us. The daily trade over  that Canadian-U.S. border--things passing back and forth--is incredible  and has been for a long time, but it is also much stronger than it used  to be. Keeping these connections strong is essential.   Trade increases our economic security, but it also increases our  national security. Living in a good neighborhood is what we all want to  do, and that is the value we have seen out of this agreement for the  last 25 years. The agreement could have been better, and the President  has made it better. The USMCA is going to be better than NAFTA. No  NAFTA would be a bad thing; NAFTA replaced by USMCA would be a good  thing.   It is time that we begin to build on what we have learned in those 25  years and move into this century with a new agreement that works for  farming families, for ranching families, for workers, for people who  make automobiles, airplanes, and other things. This leads to more  American jobs, and it leads to great benefit for us economically.   But, again, let me repeat, the national security impact of having two  neighbors that want to work with us. What we just saw the President  negotiate with Mexico, where they are helping secure that much narrower  border at the southern tip of Mexico more than we would be able to do  at the much bigger northern border, that is helpful. Where they are  working to help people stay there as their cases are being heard, that  is helpful to our country. It is easier to keep people there and have  their cases heard than let them disperse throughout the entire United  States.   Certainly, we hope to gain from the new USMCA treaty, but we hope our  neighbors also benefit from that treaty and know they will. The three  countries all signed this agreement in November. Mexico has ratified it  already. The Prime Minister of Canada says they stand ready to call  their Parliament back into session to ratify it. As soon as it is  clear, they are going to.   Trade is essential. All three of our countries agree on that.  Democrats and Republicans agree on that. Members of the House and  Senate agree on that. Now what we need to agree on is how to have a  time to vote and approve this deal. Let's give our economy the boost it  needs. Let's give our neighborhood the strength we have seen develop  over the last 25 years.   We hope our friends in the House bring this to the floor. It will be  a bipartisan vote. It will be a comfortably passed vote. But you have  to decide to have a vote for that to happen, and I hope we are close to  that moment.   I yield the floor.
