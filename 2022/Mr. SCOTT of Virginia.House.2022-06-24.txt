 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution  1204, I call up the bill (S. 2089) to amend the Families First  Coronavirus Response Act to extend child nutrition waiver authority,  and for other purposes, with the Senate amendment to the House  amendment thereto, and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I have a motion at the desk.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and insert extraneous material on the legislation currently  under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, we are here, again, to pass legislation to ensure that  our Nation's children have access to healthy meals. The Senate amended  the bill that we passed yesterday, and so today we are going accept  that amendment so the bill can be forwarded on to the President for  signature.   S. 2089 would:   Maintain school meal flexibilities that do not increase costs;   Continue flexibilities to support summer food programs this year;   Provide additional support for child and adult care feeding programs;  and   Increase school meal reimbursement rates for this upcoming school  year.   We know this bill alone will not end hunger in America, nor does it  uphold the stronger provisions in the bill that the House passed  yesterday, but it is an important step to take for our Nation's  children and to fulfill our basic responsibility to keep them from  going hungry.   I thank the gentlewoman from North Carolina, the ranking member of  the committee, Dr. Foxx, for cooperating and making sure this  legislation could come to the floor, along with the Senator Stabenow  from Michigan and Senator Boozman from Arkansas.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the motion, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   The reality is that Congress has reached its deadline. We must pass  this critical legislation to ensure that children have healthy meals  this summer and that schools and daycares have the funding and  flexibilities they need to respond to the supply chain challenges and  high food costs in the future.   If we do not act, we will jeopardize children's access to nutritious  meals.   I wish, again, to thank the ranking member, Dr. Foxx, for her  cooperation in bringing this bipartisan, bicameral legislation to the  floor, along with Senators Stabenow and Boozman.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support S. 2089, support the  motion, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record for S.  2089, as amended, the following letters from the Academy of Nutrition  and Dietetics, Feeding America, Save the Children, the School Nutrition  Association, the Council of the Great City Schools, and the Center for  Law and Social Policy in support of the Keep Kids Fed Act of 2022.                              [June 21, 2022]     Protect Nutrition Security for Children: Academy of Nutrition and                   Dietetics Welcomes New Bipartisan Bill         Chicago--The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics strongly       supports the new Keep Kids Fed Act, introduced June 21 in       Congress, as a crucial step in addressing nutrition security       among school-aged children in the United States. The bill was       introduced by U.S. Sens. Debbie Stabenow (Mich.) and John       Boozman (Ark.) and U.S. Reps. Bobby Scott (Va.) and Virginia       Foxx (N.C.).        ``Studies have shown that the school cafeteria is the       healthiest place for children to eat in the U.S.,'' said       registered dietitian nutritionist and the Academy's 2022-2023       President Ellen R. Shanley. ``The Keep Kids Fed Act therefore       is more important than ever in providing parents and       guardians with the assurance that their children are       receiving healthful meals to fuel them throughout this summer       as well as the next school year.''        The Academy commends the Keep Kids Fed Act, which grants       the U.S. Department of Agriculture the authority to provide       temporary waivers that will provide full flexibilities to       summer meal programs, eliminate the reduced-price meal       category and increase reimbursement rates in response to       rising food costs.        ``The Academy and our members have tirelessly advocated for       the continuation of child nutrition waivers as the country       continues to grapple with ongoing supply chain and labor       shortages due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as       inflation,'' Shanley said.        Because the pandemic has had a disproportionate impact on       people from underrepresented communities and those with diet-      related disease, access to healthful school meals promotes       nutrition security as well as health equity.        While the Academy considers nutrition waivers to be a step       in the right direction, the legislation comes late in the       process as schools are organizing and operating summer meal       programs and planning meal programs for the next school year.        ``A better solution is to make school meals free for all       children, all year,'' Shanley said.  [[Page H5894]]       ``The Academy has long advocated for Healthy School Meals for       All and will continue to educate members of Congress on its       benefits. We look forward to working with Congress on a       permanent solution to issues of nutrition security for all,       particularly for children.''                                   ____                               [June 21, 2022]    Feeding America Applauds Bi-Partisan Step To Extend Child Nutrition                                  Waivers    statement attributed to vince hall, chief government relations officer         ``Feeding America, the nation's largest hunger-relief       network of 200 food banks, 21 statewide associations and       60,000 faith-based and non-profit partner food pantries and       meal programs, applauds Congress for taking the needed steps       to extend child nutrition waiver authority, which will help       ensure children are able to access much-needed nutrition in       the months ahead. Network food banks and partners have been       asking for this continued flexibility for many months. The       bi-partisan legislation, the Keep Kids Fed Act, was released       today by Senators Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) and John Boozman (R-      AR) and Representatives Bobby Scott (D-VA 03) and Virginia       Foxx (R-NC 05) ahead of the June 30th deadline. The bill       would provide temporary authority to USDA to provide summer       meal program flexibilities, eliminate the reduced-price meal       category, and increase reimbursement rates to help offset       rising food costs. It will offer much needed stability,       predictability, and an assurance that children will be better       able to get the meals they need through the coming year.       Together, these provisions will provide significant help for       children who often do not know where they will get their next       meal, particularly in communities of color who experience       hunger at a disproportionate rate.        ``Originally granted as part of the pandemic response to       ensure access to meals for children in need during the school       year and in the summertime, waivers allowing flexibilities       for child nutrition program operators remain essential to       addressing child food insecurity, particularly amid continued       supply chain disruptions and ongoing barriers to reaching       kids in rural areas. As it stands, schools and communities       need continued flexibilities to safely plan for and offer       summer meal programs and nutrition assistance during the next       school year.        ``For millions of school children, school meals are often       their only reliable nutrition source. Feeding America stands       ready to work with Congress to ensure this important bill       passes both chambers and is signed by President Biden, and we       look forward to working with them on future legislation to       ensure child nutrition programs remain strong and responsive       to local needs in the months and years ahead.''                                   ____                               [June 22, 2022]  Bipartisan `Keep Kids Fed Act' Would Prevent Millions of Children From                                Going Hungry    Save the Children--together with our political advocacy arm, Save the  Children Action Network--urges Congress to swiftly pass this bipartisan                                legislation         Washington, DC--After yesterday's release of the bipartisan       Keep Kids Fed Act (H.R. 8150), Cassidy Pont, Lead Policy       Advocate for Domestic Child Nutrition at Save the Children,       issued the following statement:        ``We wholeheartedly welcome the release of the bipartisan       and budget-neutral Keep Kids Fed Act, which will temporarily       extend some child nutrition waivers, preventing nearly 7       million children from losing access to nutritious meals this       summer alone. In the midst of increasing supply chain       challenges and rising food and gas prices, this support will       be a life-line for school nutrition programs and child care       providers, enabling them to stay financially afloat while       continuing to serve children the nutritious foods they need       to grow, develop, learn and thrive. While we are disappointed       the legislation doesn't extend the USDA Secretary's full       waiver authority through the next school year, the Keep Kids       Fed Act is an important step in the right direction. We urge       Congress to act quickly to pass this legislation. If not,       millions of children could go hungry, and we cannot let that       happen.''                                   ____                               [June 22, 2022]                SNA Urges Passage of School Meals Agreement         Arlington, VA--The School Nutrition Association (SNA)       praised a new agreement to provide critical support to school       meal programs prior to the expiration of federal pandemic       waivers. Set to expire June 30, the waivers have ensured       students can access healthy school meals despite persistent       supply chain, food cost and labor burdens. SNA urges Congress       to swiftly pass The Keep Kids Fed Act of 2022.        The $3 billion package will provide the following       assistance through School Year 2022/23:        Allow students eligible for reduced-price meals to receive       free meals        Increase federal reimbursements for every school lunch by       40 cents and every school breakfast by 15 cents, above the       annual inflationary adjustment scheduled for July 1        Extend no-cost waivers, including those for schools unable       to meet nutrition standards due to supply chain disruptions       and to reduce administrative and reporting burdens        Extend waivers for 2022 summer meal programs        ``School nutrition professionals have withstood crippling       supply chain breakdowns, rising prices and labor shortages in       their efforts to provide students healthy meals, at a time       when families are struggling with higher costs. With crucial       federal waivers on the verge of expiring, this agreement       offers school meal programs a lifeline to help build back       toward normal operations,'' said SNA President Beth Wallace,       MBA, SNS.        ``SNA members are extremely grateful to Senate Agriculture       Committee Chairwoman Debbie Stabenow, Ranking Member John       Boozman, House Education and Labor Committee Chairman Bobby       Scott and Ranking Member Virginia Foxx for their consistent       efforts to support school meal programs and to Congressional       leaders for bringing this critical agreement to the floor,''       said Wallace.        SNA members have reported an ongoing struggle to obtain       sufficient food and supplies for their programs, as       manufacturers discontinue products ranging from low-sodium       chicken breasts to low-fat milk cartons and yogurt cups.       Members have reported shortages of as many as 150-200 menu       items per order, which send short-staffed school nutrition       teams scrambling to secure healthy menu substitutions for       their students. School nutrition directors across the country       report unprecedented price increases, including a 280%       increase in the cost of a case of gloves and 137% increase on       whole grain bread.        ``SNA appreciates ongoing efforts of U.S. Secretary of       Agriculture Tom Vilsack to address persistent supply chain       challenges and USDA's commitment to avert penalties for       schools unable to comply with meal pattern requirements due       to these disruptions,'' said Wallace. ``We will continue to       work with USDA next school year as we seek solutions to       support school nutrition professionals and ensure the       financial sustainability of meal programs for the students       they serve.''        SNA's 2022 Position Paper, released in January, urged       Congress to extend pandemic-related child nutrition waivers       and to permanently increase school meal reimbursement rates,       offer free school meals to all students and ease regulatory       requirements.                                   ____                              Council of the Great City Schools,                                      Washington, DC, June 22, 2022.      Hon. Bobby Scott,      Chairman, Committee on Education and Labor,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Virginia Foxx,      Ranking Member, Committee on Education and Labor, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Scott and Ranking Member Foxx: The Council of       the Great City Schools, the coalition of the nation's largest       central-city school districts, writes to offer our support       for the Keep Kids Fed Act of 2022. Since the start of the       COVID-19 pandemic, urban districts have worked tirelessly to       ensure that all of our students have safe access to healthy       meal options, both during school closures and while on       campus. Since March 2020, the COVID-19 waivers approved by       Congress provided our Food Service departments with the       additional funding and flexibility needed to get meals to       students wherever they are and to deal with rising costs,       personnel shortages, and supply chain issues.        Even though schools have been open this spring and are       expecting to offer in-person instruction this fall, our child       nutrition programs are still in crisis and have not returned       to pre-pandemic normal. Supply chain and staffing issues       persist and the need to relieve school districts from meal       pattern, non-congregate feeding, and mealtime requirements       remains essential. The Keep Kids Fed Act will provide school       districts with the flexibility needed for continuity of       operations next school year and offers additional funding to       help serve more students and alleviate rising costs for meal       items, food service supplies, and personnel.        With summer programs already operating and fall planning       well-underway, school districts are facing enormous       challenges in serving nutritious meals to students every day.       The Council appreciates the bipartisan solutions offered in       the Keep Kids Fed Act of 2022 to help mitigate some of these       issues and urges a YES vote.            Sincerely,                                                          Ray Hart,      Executive Director.                                   ____                                                   The Center for Law                                               and Social Policy,                                      Washington, DC, June 23, 2022.        Dear Members of Congress: The Center for Law and Social       Policy (CLASP) expresses our support for H.R. 8150, the Keep       Kids Fed Act of 2022, which would extend key flexibilities       for school meal provisions enacted under the Families First       Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA). As a national, nonpartisan       anti-poverty organization that places racial equity at the       center of our work, we understand how failing to extend this       successful policy would harm food security in marginalized       and low-income communities. The COVID-19 pandemic is ongoing,       and schools are struggling to manage rising food costs and       clogged supply chains. Congress' failure to extend the       waivers and flexibilities the FFCRA provides would mean       schools not having the tools they need to continue providing       consistent and reliable meals to students. If Congress fails       to extend these flexibilities beyond the current expiration       date of  [[Page H5895]]       June 30, 2022, millions of children face the possibility of       losing access to healthy meals.        CLASP is pleased to see the inclusion of the waiver       ensuring all family child care homes qualify for the highest       reimbursement rate under the Child and Adult Food Care       (CACFP) program. This waiver eliminates the usual area       eligibility requirement that limits this rate to providers in       areas meeting a 50 percent low-income threshold. This       threshold excludes many providers serving children in       families with low incomes, especially in rural and suburban       areas, where poverty is often less concentrated than in urban       areas. In addition, the area eligibility test completely       neglects providers and families struggling in areas with a       high cost-of-living. CLASP recommends permanently eliminating       the area eligibility test permanent. This change would bring       more child care providers who serve low-income children into       CACFP, ensuring many more children in need would receive       healthy CACFP meals and snacks.        The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated child hunger in the U.S.,       but did not create it. Prior to the pandemic, almost 1 in       every 7 households struggled with food security, a rate that       spiked to 1 in 3 with the onset of the pandemic. The policies       enacted through the FFCRA, namely the nationwide waiver       authority and expanded reimbursement rates, has enabled       schools to meet the immense challenge of heightened demand       and costs. As long as pandemic-related economic pressures       remain, these flexibilities should as well. Many children in       this country rely on meals through schools and child care       programs as a source of reliable and nutritious food. These       meals can support their development and represent a wise       investment from policymakers. CLASP encourages Congress in       the future to support universal school meals so that all       students can receive the nutrition they need without stigma       or burdensome paperwork.        CLASP thanks Sens. Stabenow and Boozman and Reps. Scott and       Foxx for their bipartisan work on this important piece of       legislation. CLASP urges swift passage and looks forward to       working with your office on legislative matters reducing       poverty in this country.
