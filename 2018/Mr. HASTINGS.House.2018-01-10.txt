 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Collins), my  friend, for yielding me the customary 30 minutes for debate.   Mr. Speaker, I stand here today with the rest of my Democratic  colleagues in utter amazement at the dizzying dysfunction exhibited by  our friends across the aisle. For reasons beyond understanding, we have  to vote on the reauthorization of section 702 of the Foreign  Intelligence Surveillance Act because late last year the Republican  leadership chose to prioritize massive tax cuts for their wealthy  donors over the safety of American citizens.                                time  1500    Like so many other important issues, House Republicans decided to  punt on the reauthorization of 702 by simply extending it to January 19  of this year, coincidentally, the same date the government will  possibly shut down.   Mr. Speaker, as a former judge and the former vice chairman of the  House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, I do occupy a unique  vantage point in the ongoing debate between the need to steadfastly  protect the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution while also ensuring  that those in the intelligence community have the tools they need to  keep our country safe from those who wish to do us grave harm.   Putting the finer points on this debate aside for a moment, I can  tell you with complete certainty that such a debate deserves to be  lengthy and thorough, neither of which have happened here.   I was concerned to learn, if not a bit dismayed, that the House  Intelligence subcommittee which has oversight jurisdiction of the  National Security Agency did not hold a single hearing on today's bill.  In fact, the full committee did not even hold a single hearing on this  important piece of legislation.   Think about that. As the Republicans approached the need to discuss  the reauthorization of one of the more important tools to fight  terrorism that, simultaneously, brings along legitimate and important  Fourth Amendment concerns, the majority, in all their wisdom, thought  it prudent to hold exactly zero hearings on such an important matter.  That is a brazenly inept way to govern.   To add insult to injury, I am told that members of the committee were  given about 36 hours to read the bill before having to vote it out of  committee.   A side note here: the bill they were given 36 hours to review is not  actually the bill we have before us today because the majority had to  use a Rules Committee print to fix some of the most troublesome parts  of the original bill in order to obtain my friend Ranking Member Adam  Schiff's support. Mr. Speaker, without a doubt, that support did not  come easily, and important changes were made to the bill as it was  presented to the committee in its original form.   For example, Mr. Schiff was able to ensure the Republicans' unmasking  language was removed from today's bill. The removal of such language  ensures that one of the Republicans' most heinous political stunts is  not codified into law. This was and is a significant improvement.   Moreover, the Republicans removed the controversial expansion of the  definition of ``agent of foreign power,'' which concerned privacy and  technology groups.   Today's bill also addresses what is known as ``abouts'' collection.  This is the collection of communications that are not to or from a  target but, rather, communications that merely reference the target.  The NSA, itself, shut down this collection method earlier this year.   The legislation before us today will allow such collection to resume,  but only if the NSA first devises a way of doing so that addresses  privacy concerns, obtains permission from the Foreign Intelligence  Surveillance Court, and Congress does not object after a 30-day review  period.   Now, this may seem to be a better option than what I am sure many, if  not most, Republicans wanted, which is the full-scale reimplementation  of ``abouts'' collection, but considering how much difficulty the  majority has in simply keeping the lights on around this place, I think  it is fair to question their ability to provide meaningful oversight in  just 30 days. Again, this is simply evidence for the need to return  back to regular order under which bills are fully and fairly  considered.   Regardless of where one comes down on this issue, I can assure you  that there are Members on both sides of the aisle that are sick and  tired of being shut out of important policy discussions concerning  subjects like those before us today.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the distinguished  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lofgren), my friend from the Judiciary  Subcommittee on Immigration and Border Security.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am amused by my friend from the Rules Committee's  assertion that today, because of protests with reference to DACA,  members of my party were protesting that concern.   I am also amused that they are in the majority, and she accuses us of  delaying, when, in fact, this measure was scheduled 2 or 3 months ago  and could have been brought to the floor, but, no, they were busy about  tax cuts, and so they didn't get around to allowing for this important  matter to be brought to the floor.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentlewoman from California  (Ms. Lofgren) to respond to the gentleman from Georgia.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee), the ranking member of the Judiciary  Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and Investigations  and a good friend of mine.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, let me thank the gentleman from Florida  for his astute assessment and analysis in his earlier remarks today,  particularly sharing with us his experience on the Intelligence  Committee, and I thank him for mentioning the fact that I serve as the  ranking member on the Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and  Investigations Subcommittee.   In that capacity, that committee certainly encounters not only our  Nation's law enforcement but many of the issues dealing with terrorism,  including the work on homeland security.   With that in mind, I want to simply say to my colleagues and,  certainly, to my good friend, who served and dedicated his life to the  FBI for 14 years, none of us over the past couple of  [[Page H108]]  months will take a backseat to championing the FBI, thanking the FBI,  recognizing the FBI for the very valiant work that it does.   Being on the Judiciary Committee for the number of years that I have  served, I have worked with almost every FBI Director, and agents,  particularly the SACs in my particular jurisdiction, and have been  engaged in discussions on the resources and needs of that organization.  Mr. Speaker, again, we thank them for their service.   I would offer to say that the position I take today is to protect the  FBI and to protect the American people.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record, interestingly enough, an  article written by Sheila Jackson Lee, ``Protecting America, protecting  Americans,'' dated October 16, 2007.                     [From the POLITICO, Oct. 16, 2007]                  Protecting America, Protecting Americans                        (By Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee)         Nearly two centuries ago, Alexis de Tocqueville observed       that the reason democracies invariably prevail in any martial       conflict is because democracy is the governmental form that       best rewards and encourages those traits that are       indispensable to martial success: initiative, innovation,       resourcefulness and courage.        The United States would do well to heed de Tocqueville and       recognize that the best way to win the war on terror is to       remain true to our democratic traditions. If it retains its       democratic character, no nation and no loose confederation of       international villains will defeat the United States in the       pursuit of its vital interests.        A major challenge facing the Congress today is to ensure       that in waging its war on terror, the administration does not       succeed in winning passage of legislation that will weaken       the nation's commitment to its democratic traditions.        This is why the upcoming debate over congressional approval       authorizing the administration to conduct terrorist       surveillance on U.S. soil is a matter of utmost importance. I       offer some thoughts on the principles that should inform that       debate.        In the waning hours before the August recess, the House       acceded to the Bush administration's request and approved the       woefully misnamed ``Protect America Act,'' which gives the       federal government enlarged powers to conduct electronic       surveillance of American citizens under the guise of       conducting surveillance of foreign terrorists.        Fortunately, the authority conferred by the PAA expires       next February.        It is therefore incumbent on the Congress to act       expeditiously to amend the PAA so that it achieves the only       legitimate goals of a terrorist surveillance program, which       is to ensure that Americans are secure in their persons,       papers and effects, but terrorists throughout the world are       made insecure.        The best way to achieve these twin goals is to follow the       rule of law. And the exclusive law to follow with respect to       authorizing foreign surveillance gathering on U.S. soil is       the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.        Enacted by Congress in 1978, the exclusivity of FISA was       undisputed. Any legislation authorizing terrorist       surveillance programs which the administration seeks to       conduct must explicitly affirm that FISA is the sole basis of       lawful authority for conducting foreign surveillance       gathering on U.S. soil.        That FISA remains the exclusive source of authority does       not mean that the law cannot be adapted to modern       circumstances or revised to accommodate new technologies. One       widely acknowledged reform is to amend FISA to make clear       that foreign-to-foreign communications are not subject to       FISA, even though modern technology enables that       communication to be routed through the United States.        Additionally, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court       is indispensable and must play a meaningful role in ensuring       compliance with the law.        Legislation must ensure that the FISC is empowered to act       as an Article III court should act, which means the court       should operate neither as a rubber stamp nor a bottleneck.       The function of the court is to validate the lawful exercise       of executive power on the one hand, and to act as the       guardian of individual rights and liberties on the other.        Congress should reject any proposal that grants amnesty to       any telecommunications company or other entity or individual       that helps federal intelligence agencies spy illegally on       innocent Americans.        Amnesty will have the unintended consequence of encouraging       telecommunications companies to comply with, rather than       contest, illegal requests to spy on Americans.        The only permissible path to legalization of conduct in       this area is full compliance with the requirements of the       Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.        Finally, authorization to conduct foreign surveillance       gathering on U.S. soil must never be made permanent. The       threats to America's security and the liberties of its people       will change over time and require constant vigilance by the       people's representatives in Congress.        In short, it makes much more sense to enact legislation       that protects Americans, rather than one that protects       America, as the administration's proposal claims to do. At       bottom, America is its people connected to each other, and to       past and future generations, as in Abraham Lincoln's       unforgettable phrase, by ``the mystic chords of memory       stretching from every heart and hearthstone.''        America, in other words, is Americans coming together in a       community of shared values, ideals and principles. It is       those shared values that hold us together. It is our       commitment to those values that the terrorists wish to break       because that is the only way they can win.        Thus, the way forward to victory in the war on terror is       for this country to redouble its commitment to the values       that every American will risk his or her life to defend. It       is only by preserving our attachment to these cherished       values that America will remain forever the home of the free,       the land of the brave and the country we love.    Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, that article suggests that we have the  responsibility to protect America and Americans. I would make the point  to my good friend, who mentioned that men and women or families sending  their young people over to battlegrounds, they are absolutely right,  and those young people who are going over to battlegrounds are going  over on the basis of freedom. Their parents sacrificed, these loved  ones sacrificed their young people because they believe so much in the  freedom of this Nation.   Well, I will tell you that section 702 and the underlying bill, there  is no freedom in this particular bill, and that is why we need to  address the question in a thoughtful manner. I don't mind if we extend  this to have a longer debate so that we can work through some of our  concerns.   Let me be clear that S. 139 fails to address the core concern of  Members of Congress and the American public. The government's use of  section 702 information against United States citizens in  investigations that have nothing to do with national security, that is  the crux of our advocacy for both the Amash amendment, joined by myself  and Zoe Lofgren and Ted Poe and many others--it is not to undermine the  security of this Nation. It is to give substance to those families who  sacrifice and send their young men and women to faraway places.   The warrant requirement contained in the bill is riddled with  loopholes and applies only to fully predicated official FBI  investigations, not to the hundreds of thousands of searches that the  FBI runs every day to run down a lead or check out a tip.   S. 139 exacerbates existing problems with section 702 by codifying  the so-called bulk collection, a type of surveillance that was shut  down after it twice failed to meet the Fourth Amendment scrutiny.   S. 139 is universally opposed by technology companies, privacy and  civil liberties groups across the political spectrum.   Let me read briefly what the Amash amendment really says. It is not  something that would stop security, surveillance, and work in its  tracks. What it does is, ``Except as provided in subparagraph C or D,  no officer, agent, or employee of the United States may conduct a query  of information acquired under subsection A in an effort to find  communications of or about a particular person if there is reason to  believe such person is a United States person,'' protecting the First  Amendment freedom of speech and all of that, but matched with the  important amendment of the Fourth Amendment, which, of course, is  unreasonable search and seizures.                                time  1530    An application by the Attorney General to a judge of the Foreign  Intelligence Surveillance Court that describes the determination of the  Attorney General is probable cause to believe that such communications  provide evidence of a crime, such person is a foreign power or an agent  of a foreign power. This is a minimal standard.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from Texas.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, this is a minimal standard of which  every American should expect and is owed. It is a minimal standard upon  which we stand the Constitution.   We are missing what our role is here. It is not to rush through a  FISA bill that has been delayed by my Republican friends. More  importantly, it is to  [[Page H109]]  do right by the American people. We are not doing right by the American  people.   I remember fighting against reverse targeting, a major issue in our  work on the Freedom Act and the PATRIOT Act. Now, today--in 2017, going  into 2018--in 2018, it is important to remember that 9/11 was to not  turn terror on Americans; it was to protect us from terrorism and to  withstand that with the upholding of the Constitution.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to oppose the underlying bill.   Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the Judiciary Committee, I rise in  opposition to the rule for S. 139, the ``FISA Amendments  Reauthorization Act of 2017,'' and the underlying bill.   S. 139 reauthorizes Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence  Surveillance Act, which is scheduled to expire on January 19, 2018.   Although Section 702 is a critical national security tool set to  expire on January 19, 2018, events of the recent past strongly suggest  that Section 702 should not be reauthorized without necessary and  significant reforms that are not included in the legislation before us.   So as the Ranking Member of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime,  Terrorism, Homeland Security, and Investigations, I oppose the rule and  underlying bill for several compelling reasons:   1. S. 139 fails to address the core concern of Members of Congress  and the American public--the government's use of Section 702  information against United States citizens in investigations that have  nothing to do with national security.   2. The warrant ``requirement'' contained in the bill is riddled with  loopholes and applies only to fully predicated, official FBI  investigations, not to the hundreds of thousands searches the FBI runs  every day to run down a lead or check out a tip.   3. S. 139 exacerbates existing problems with Section 702 by codifying  so-called ``about collection,'' a type of surveillance that was shut  down after it twice failed to meet Fourth Amendment scrutiny.   4. S. 139 is universally opposed by technology companies, privacy,  and civil liberties groups across the political spectrum, from the ACLU  to FreedomWorks.   Mr. Speaker, the bill before us comes from the Intelligence  Committee, where it was passed on a strict party-line vote.   This stands in stark contrast to H.R. 3989, the USA Liberty Act, I  the bipartisan bill reported by the Judiciary Committee after multiple  hearings, an open markup process, and a bipartisan vote of approval.   The USA Liberty Act enjoys much broader support, contains meaningful  reforms to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, and is far  superior to the bill before us.   FISA was enacted in 1978 to provide the Executive Branch with a  statutory framework for gathering ``foreign intelligence information''  from U.S. persons.   FISA authorizes special court orders for four purposes:   1. electronic surveillance;   2. physical searches;   3. the installation and use of pen registers and trap and trace  devices; and   4. demands for the production of physical items.   Although FISA is designed for intelligence gathering, and not for the  collection of criminal evidence, the law applies to activities to which  a Fourth Amendment warrant requirement would apply if they were  conducted as part of a criminal investigation.   Most commonly, authorization for a wiretap or physical search under  FISA is obtained by application to the Foreign Intelligence  Surveillance Court (``FISC'' or the ``FISA court'').   Section 702 is part of the FISA Amendments Act (FAA), a successor to  the Bush Administration's unlawful warrantless wiretapping program that  ended in January 2007.   The FAA adds a new Title VII to FISA that grants the government the  authority to monitor electronic communications of non-U.S. persons  abroad.   Section 702 authorizes the Attorney General and the Director of  National Intelligence ``to acquire foreign intelligence information''  from ``persons reasonably believed to be located outside the United  States.''   Although the FAA prohibits the intentional targeting of persons in  the United States, the FAA had been in place for only a few months when  the New York Times reported that the NSA had ``overcollected'' domestic  communications, a practice described as significant and systematic,  even if unintentional.   Subsequently, the Director of the Office of National Intelligence  stated that ``it is not reasonably possible to identify the number of  people located in the United States whose communications may have been  reviewed under the authority of the FAA.''   Section 702 provides that the government ``may not intentionally  target a person reasonably believed to be located outside the United  States if the purpose of such acquisition is to target a particular,  known person reasonably believed to be in the United States.''   Mr. Speaker, Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act  was enacted to protect the liberty and security of Americans, not to  diminish their constitutional rights.   That is why Section 702 should not be reauthorized with reforms to  prevent the government from using information against its political  opponents or members of religious, ethnic, or other groups.   One way to do that is without interfering with the national security  objectives of 702 surveillance is simply to require the FBI to obtain a  warrant before reading communications by Americans, when it finds those  communications by targeting that American and searching its 702  databases.   Enforcing the warrant requirement would prevent the misuse of Section  702 to conduct ``backdoor searches'' where government agencies,  including individual FBI agents, may search the communications  collected under section 702 for communications by an individual  American, read those communications and disseminate them within the  government, all without any external oversight, much less a judicial  warrant, simply by claiming a ``foreign intelligence'' purpose.   Mr. Speaker, all Americans want to find a common-ground where common- sense rules and regulations relating to fighting terrorism at home and  abroad can exist while still protecting the cherished privacy and civil  liberties which Americans hold close to our collective hearts.   Mr. Speaker, I noted in an op-ed published way back in October 2007,  that as Alexis DeTocqueville, the most astute student of American  democracy, observed nearly two centuries ago, the reason democracies  invariably prevail in any military conflict is because democracy is the  governmental form that best rewards and encourages those traits that  are indispensable to success: initiative, innovation, courage, and a  love of justice.   The best way to keep America safe and strong is to remain true to the  valued embedded in the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.   The bill before us does not strike the proper balance between our  cherished liberties and smart security.   We can do better; we should reject this rule and the underlying bill  and bring to the floor for debate and vote H.R. 3989, the USA Liberty  Act.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Washington (Mr. Heck).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Washington (Mr. Heck).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Washington (Mr. Heck).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Washington (Mr. Heck).    Mr. Speaker, I would advise that I have no further  speakers and I am prepared to close.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the United States House of Representatives is known as  the people's House, yet the people's representatives continuously are  shut out of policy discussion after discussion. They are shut out of  writing bill after bill, and they are shut out of offering any  meaningful amendments.   Quite simply, Mr. Speaker, if the people's representatives are shut  out, then the people are shut out. If you look around at how the  majority is running this place, through a historically closed process,  the result is not at all pretty.   I have some advice for my Republican friends. If, like this side of  the aisle, you spent more time working on policies that help the  American people instead of the wealthy and rich corporations who are, I  might add, doing just fine, you would likely not only see more  legislative successes, but you would be able to spend more time on  important issues like this critically important issue, the extension of  section 702.   Mr. Speaker, as is clearly evident, Democrats remain ready to work in  a bipartisan manner to accomplish all that remains left to do for the  American people. We are ready to fund the government and provide for  smart investments for the future of our country.    We are ready to pull the hundreds of thousands of DREAMers out of  unnecessary limbo and provide them with the status they deserve. We are  ready to go forward with comprehensive immigration. We are ready to  provide the funding and authorization needed to give millions of low- income children the health insurance they need. We are ready to fix our  roads and our bridges and our railways and air trafficking. We are here  and waiting, but time is running out.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on the rule, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, this 15- minute vote on adoption of House Resolution 682 will be followed by 5- minute votes on:   Ordering the previous question on House Resolution 681; and   Adoption of House Resolution 681, if ordered.
