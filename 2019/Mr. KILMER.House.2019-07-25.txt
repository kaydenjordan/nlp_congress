 Mr. Speaker, almost 7 years ago, Austin Tice, an American  journalist, disappeared in Syria. Since the day he vanished, his  parents, family, friends, and supporters have tirelessly worked to  ensure that no stone is left unturned and no avenue ignored in a global  campaign to see Austin returned home safely.   As we approach the end of the seventh year of Austin's captivity, we  request that whomever continues to hold Austin release him immediately  so that he can return to his family and his friends.   We also ask for the assistance of the Government of Syria. I ask that  they do whatever they can to help facilitate Austin's release.   There are things that transcend politics and diplomacy, bridge  cultural divides, and need no translation across different languages.  Those are things like love and hope, represented by a mother and a  father who wake up each day with the unshakable faith in their son and  the belief that today could be the day when they get the chance to hug  him again.   We ask for your help, without the assignment of blame or malice to  anyone, so that this year is the last that Austin remains so far from  home and from family.                              Restore Our Parks     Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Restore Our Parks  Act, and I thank Mr. Bishop for his leadership and partnership on this  bill.   I was lucky enough to grow up near one of the crown jewels of our  national park system, the Olympic National Park, right in my backyard  in the Pacific Northwest. I have seen firsthand how our public lands  have captivated both visitors and residents alike and served as key  economic drivers for our local communities.   I think there is little doubt that our national parks are some of  America's greatest natural and cultural treasures. I am proud that my  home State boasts not only Olympic National Park, but also Mount  Rainier National Park and North Cascades National Park, true gems of  the national park system.   Unfortunately, these crown jewels are getting a bit rusty, and they  require our attention to return them to glory. If you have visited one  of our parks lately, you will no doubt have noticed that they are  facing a good problem.   In 2017, Washington State had a record 8.45 million park visitors,  including families, campers, and adventurers, who came to explore our  iconic landscapes. While they were there, these visitors spent more  than $500 million, supported more than 6,600 jobs, and created nearly  $700 million in economic impact.   While this is undeniably great news for Washington's growing outdoor  economy, the rise in visitation has also strained our park resources,  like roads, interpretive centers, campsites, and trails, that visitors  rely on to access and truly experience our parks. If we as a country  don't start investing in our parks, I believe we risk loving them to  death.   The National Park Service manages more than 400 sites across the  country and is facing a nearly $12 billion backlog in necessary  repairs. In Washington State alone, our national parks suffer from  nearly $400 million in deferred repairs needed to restore historical  structures, fix eroding trails, fix roads, and update unsafe electrical  and drinking water systems.   This significant maintenance backlog threatens the health,  accessibility, and safety of our parks, their visitors, and the  communities that depend on them. That is why we need to take this  opportunity to build on recent successes of investing in our public  lands and turn our attention to passing the Restore Our Parks and  Public Lands Act.   Passing this legislation sponsored by my good friend from Utah (Mr.  Bishop) will establish a long-term investment in our parks that will  create jobs and boost economies throughout Washington State and across  this country. An analysis commissioned by The Pew Charitable Trusts  shows that investing in the maintenance of our national parks could  create or support more than 3,800 new jobs in Washington State alone  and 100,000 jobs across the country.   Now, these days, Congress can hardly agree on what day it is or what  color the sky is; but, with 300 Members of the House of Representatives  cosponsoring this bill and 40 Members of the Senate, it is crystal  clear that this is an area that we might actually see some progress. My  hope is that we can get folks behind this and get this done.                            ____________________
