 Mr. Chief Justice.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senator from Maine.    I am sending a question to the desk.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Senator King asks the President's counsel:         Would it be permissible for a President to inform the Prime       Minister of Israel that he was holding congressional       appropriated military aid unless the Prime Minister promised       to come to the United States and publicly charge his opponent       with antisemitism in the midst of an election campaign?    Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Mr. Chief Justice and Senator, thank you for the  question, but the question really has nothing do with this case. I  mean, it seems to be trying to get at the most extreme hypothetical  related to a misinterpretation of what Professor Dershowitz was saying  the other night. It is totally irrelevant here.   The charges that have been brought here, articulated in the Articles  of Impeachment, are based on a theory of abuse of power; that the House  Democrats, the House managers have made clear depends for them to make  their case to establish that when the President raised two issues on  the call with President Zelensky of Ukraine, he raised the 2016  election interference, and he mentioned the Biden and Burisma incident;  that there was not any legitimate public policy or foreign policy  interest in mentioning those things to the President of Ukraine. That  is the standard they have set for themselves. It is on page 5 of the  House Judiciary Committee report, and it is on page 4. They say they  have to show it is a sham investigation, and I think it is on page 6  they say it is a bogus investigation. That is their standard because  they know they have to establish that there is no legitimate public  policy interest at all in mentioning those in order to come anywhere  close to being able to assert something that could be a wrongful  conduct by the President, because if there is a legitimate interest, if  there is something there that is worth asking, they don't have a case.  And that is why they have tried to tell you again and again there is  not a scintilla of evidence.    This is really pretty preposterous, for the House managers to come  and say, particularly with respect to the Biden-Burisma incident, there  can't be any legitimate interest in raising that question because it  has all been debunked. And the question has been asked: Where was it  was debunked? By whom was it debunked? Who conducted that  investigation? Where is the report from that investigation? Who  established that there is nothing there? There is no such report. They  have been asked; they haven't been able to cite it. There has been no  such investigation.   But what do we know? We do know that every witness who was asked  about it said, at a minimum, there was an appearance of a conflict of  interest. We do know that these two members of the Obama  administration--Amos Hochstein and Deputy Assistant Secretary of State  Kent--raised the issue of the conflict of interest with Vice President  Biden's Office. We know that Chris Heinz, the stepson of Secretary of  State Kerry, who had been a business partner with Hunter Biden, broke  off his business ties with him because Hunter Biden took a seat on the  board of Burisma.   So to say that there is nothing that could possibly merit asking a  question about that is utterly disingenuous. It can't be said with a  straight face. Every witness that was asked about it said that there  was something, at least, that gave the appearance of a conflict of  interest. There hasn't been any investigation to debunk this theory.  There hasn't been any inquiry to find out if there is ``there'' there  or not.   It doesn't have to do, as Manager Schiff was suggesting, just with,  well, why was Hunter Biden on the board, or were they paying him? It is  the whole situation--the whole situation of, all of a sudden, he is put  on the board at the time when his father was put in charge of Ukraine  policy. And there are people--there were witnesses who testified in the  House proceedings that it appeared like Burisma was trying to whitewash  their reputation by putting people with connections on their board. And  then there is the prosecutor being fired.   It is just not reasonable to say that no one could possibly say: That  looks fishy. There is something maybe that somebody should look into  there.   Thank you.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, counsel.   The Senator from Alaska.
