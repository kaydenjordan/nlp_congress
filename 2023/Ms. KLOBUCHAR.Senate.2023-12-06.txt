 Mr. President, I also am here to talk about gun  violence, but before I get to that, I want to address some of the  comments we heard from Senator Tuberville.   I think the people of this country and the people who are visiting  our Chamber today need to understand that, for 10 months, Senator  Tuberville has been playing politics. He has literally held the  entire--entire--military chain of command hostage. He was offered a  vote on his policy; he turned it down. He was the subject of a rules  exception passed through my committee on a 9-7 vote that would have put  all of the nominations together. Even then, he kept standing his  ground.   Finally, when he realized that a number of his Republican colleagues  who came to the floor repeatedly were going to vote for that change, he  finally relented. But it was the words of the military families and the  veterans' families that made the biggest difference--the spouses who  had put their own jobs on hold, who had left their jobs teaching school  because they thought they were going to move, and the people who didn't  even know where to put their parents in assisted living because they  didn't know. These are military families who are serving our country.   And national security? He held up numerous key personnel at a time  when there are conflicts all over the world.   Still, it is important to note, which he admitted on the floor today,  he is holding up 11 four-star officers, including the head of CYBERCOM,  at a time when Vladimir Putin and other tyrants see that cyber as a  weapon of war. He is holding up the commander--the commander--of the  Pacific Air command. So he continues his hold.   And, yes, we will not go home for Christmas until we finish our work  and get through these 11 additional officers being held.   Let me just end this moment by quoting him from the hallways  yesterday from a reporter. He was asked about this.   He said:         I have loved to have five downs in football instead of       four, but you can't do it. It's got to be fair for everybody.    He was asked if he had regrets.         It was pretty much a draw. I mean, they didn't get what       they wanted.    Really? Who is ``they''? I guess the ``they'' are the military  members, the servicemembers, who serve our country.   And my last message on this front is that this is not a game, Senator  Tuberville. This is not a game. This is not a football game. These are  real people's lives and the security of our country, and I am pleased  that we have gotten through these 425 nominees, but there are clearly  more to go.    Madam President, I first want to say that, as we  proceed on the initial vote today--and I support the President's  package, including the work on border security--I do appreciate the  Senator from Oklahoma's work in trying to reach an agreement. So many  of us want to see an agreement on border security.   I rise today to highlight another part of that agreement that is very  important, and that is the importance of the critical humanitarian aid  in the supplemental funding request, and to urge my colleagues to  include it in a final bill.   Throughout history, the United States has been a leader. When Hitler  sought to conquer Europe, American's Lend-Lease Program ensured  democracy triumphed over fascism, and it was our Marshall Plan that  gave our European partners the resources they needed to rebuild after  the war. When the Iron Curtain fell, American aid kept communism at  bay. And, to this day, Agencies like USAID give nations across the  globe the support they need to alleviate poverty, become stronger  trading partners with our country, and recover from disasters.   We know that humanitarian aid, yes, saves lives in such a big way,  but it is also important for our own country. It is our own security  that we make friends. It actually helps us to spend  [[Page S5787]]  less on military when we spend more on humanitarian aid.   Today, armed conflict is tearing apart families and neighborhoods in  the Middle East, and the largest land war in Europe since World War II  rages on. Ripples from these conflicts are felt around the world. We  are at a pivotal moment in not just American history but the history of  humanity.   Israelis, innocent Palestinians, and Ukrainians are looking to us for  support, and the whole world is watching. It is during moments like  these that leaders are called to step up. So the question before us  today that so many of those who came before us in this Chamber-- Democrats and Republicans--have grappled with is, Will we step up? Will  America step up? My answer: We must, just as we have time and time  again throughout history.   That, of course, includes providing swift humanitarian aid to people  across the world, including innocent civilians in Gaza.   Like so many in this Chamber, including the Presiding Officer, I  strongly condemned Hamas's terrorist attack immediately, in the  strongest terms. It was a massacre of innocent Israelis, and I am  heartbroken by the devastation and the loss of life. But we must  remember that the violence of this terrorist group Hamas does not  represent the will of all of the people of Gaza, not by any means.   That is why I joined my colleagues in calling for a short-term  cessation of hostilities in order to allow for the Hamas-held hostages  to be released and to ensure that humanitarian assistance could reach  innocent civilians in Gaza. I welcomed, as so many did, the  announcement almost 2 weeks ago that Israel and Hamas had agreed to  release more than 100 hostages during the cessation that would also  allow, of course, for increased aid for food and the like into Gaza.  Tragically, late last week, a continued agreement could not be reached,  and the hostages, including, as we now know, so many young women--with  very troubling and concerning reports coming out on their conditions-- are still being held hostage by the terrorists. The fighting has begun  again.   The United States has provided significant aid to both Israel and the  Palestinian people, now and in years past, but we know we cannot shirk  from our duties. We cannot turn our backs on what is happening.   In discussing the need for foreign aid, we must not forget the  continued importance, as we will discuss later today, of standing with  Ukraine as Ukrainians fight back against Vladimir Putin's inhuman  barbarism. For almost 2 years, in bright blue and yellow, the  Ukrainians have shown the world what it truly means to fight for  freedom, and America has been with them, as have so many of our allies.  Beyond critical military aid, the United States has continued to  support Ukraine through humanitarian assistance for both internally  displaced Ukrainians and those who have been forced to flee their home  country.    And we know that while we have taken in some of these refugees,  including in my home State of Minnesota, which has a major Ukrainian  population, many of whom are now working--I was just with a number of  them who work in our Ukrainian restaurant that we are so proud of,  Kramarczuk's in Minneapolis. We also have European countries taking in  these refugees in unprecedented numbers--millions and millions of  people.   When I visited Poland with a group of our colleagues on a bipartisan  basis, just weeks after Vladimir Putin launched his brutal invasion,  there were more than 2 million Ukrainian refugees. Today, that number  is more than 6 million. I will never forget talking to those refugees-- women, children, seniors, kids with nothing but a backpack on their  back with a stuffed animal in it. We heard their horror stories about  homes lost, families ripped apart, and lives destroyed.   We know that Polish people don't have to imagine what it is like to  live through a full-scale invasion. Their history is marked by  invasions by Prussia, the Hapsburgs, the Nazi, and, yes, Russia. As our  Ambassador to Poland, Mark Brzezinski told us, the Poles are achieving  the dreams their grandparents never could realize.   Poland is able to say to their Ukrainian neighbors: We value freedom  and respect your democracy. We value you so much that we will take you  into our homes and into our hearts. We will open our doors and not shut  you out.   Just as our Polish allies and those small countries that I met with  yesterday--the Baltic nations of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania--they  are there for Ukraine on the ground and taking in their people and  being on the frontline and putting in an extraordinary percentage of  their own resources, of their spending, into defense, into NATO.  America must be there for Ukraine by providing, yes, topnotch military  assistance, as we have to enable Ukraine to retake half of the  territory that Vladimir Putin took in his initial invasion, but we also  must be there for them with critical humanitarian aid. Our Ukrainian  friends continue to persevere against all odds, against one of the  largest armies in the world, and this aid is critical to that effort.   As we all know, the consequences of Putin's unprovoked, unlawful,  unjustifiable war extend beyond Ukraine's border. Ukraine is one of the  world's top suppliers of grain, and Russia's illegal blockade of  Ukrainian ports has put millions of people across the globe, in places  like Africa, at risk of starvation. By providing critical support for  the State Department's refugee aid program, including food assistance,  the administration funding request will support displaced people around  the world.   Our Nation has earned its reputation as the leader of the free world  due to its unwavering commitment to democracy and helping nations when  they need it--knowing they come out of it; knowing they become major  trading partners and friends of ours on the security front, on the  democracy front, and on the economic front. So now it is on us to  decide if we want to keep that reputation, if we want to keep that  leadership.   As we negotiate this bill, the supplemental, I am reminded of what  President Zelenskyy said just hours after Vladimir Putin launched his  barbaric invasion. Everyone counted him out. Everyone thought he was  going to run. Instead, he stood on the streets of Kyiv, with just a few  people, and looked straight into the camera and delivered a simple  message that was, all at once, a rallying cry to his people, but a  statement of defiance in the face of evil and a call to action for  democracies across the globe. Three words: We are here.   So that is our decision over the next 2 weeks. Are we going to be  here for democracy? Are we going to be here for our ally in the Mideast  and our allies around the world? Are we going to continue to feed the  world? Are we going to continue to stand up against terrorism and  barbarism and help innocent people, like those in Gaza, those in  Ukraine, and those around the world who depend on us?   Moms, dads, grandmas, grandpas, kids, and grandkids are depending on  us. We must be there. We must say: We are here.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I rise  today alongside my colleagues, Senators Murray, Reed, Shaheen, Schatz,  and Heinrich to discuss the need to pass this supplemental funding  package.   I spoke earlier today about the importance of humanitarian aid-- humanitarian aid for the innocent civilians, Palestinian civilians in  Gaza; humanitarian aid for people throughout the world. It is one major  way that America has led through World War II and after, through the  Cold War. Yes, we have led with our military strength, but we have also  led by making friends and making sure people have what they need so  they don't starve. And so many of those countries have gone on to do  great things, to be great countries, to be democracies, to work with us  to be trading partners.   But, today, I am here to focus on Ukraine. We are at a pivotal point  not just in American history but in the history of humanity. It is  during moments like these that nations across the globe look to America  for leadership. They expect our leadership.   Yes, our friends in Ukraine are counting on us, but so are so many  other allies as they look to see what we will do. This has never been  America alone helping Ukraine. It has been all-in for many countries.   Early in the conflict, I traveled to Poland with a number of  Senators--Democrats and Republicans--and it was right when one of the  first major loss of life had occurred in Ukraine at a military training  facility. And we happened to be at the entry point where families were  fleeing--people in wheelchairs, little kids with backpacks with nothing  but their stuffed animal in it. That is what I remember.   I remember the Polish people who had been invaded over the years by  the Hapsburgs, by the Nazis, by the Russians, opening their arms to  these Ukrainians, which they are still doing today--millions of  refugees.   We have played a very important role in this conflict. We have  surprised the world, and I am certain we surprised Russia. And the  Ukrainians have surprised them with their incredible courage when  everyone had counted them out. This scrappy force who had been at the  frontline for years already in Donbas and other regions in Ukraine who,  once again, went to the frontline.   We trained them. It is our equipment that has been so superior, as  well as those from our allies in this fight. And what has happened?  Well, since Vladimir Putin's unprovoked and unlawful, unjustifiable  invasion last February, our Ukrainian friends have reclaimed half of  the territory that is rightfully theirs. Vladimir Putin tried to  capture Kyiv, but he failed.   Senator Portman and I, in the middle of the war, went and saw that  airfield where the Russians had come down in parachutes thinking that  the Ukrainians would just fold. They didn't fold. They held their  ground and they kept Kyiv.   Vladimir Putin tried to wipe Ukraine off the map, but he failed.   He tried to break the Ukrainian spirit, but he has made it stronger.   He tried to take them down in the middle of winter last winter by  cutting off their electricity. He threatened the biggest nuclear plant,  not only in Ukraine but in all of Europe. There is no limit to what  they will do. He has shown his true colors: capturing cities,  slaughtering innocents, abducting Ukrainian children. But the Ukrainian  people have shown theirs: defending their democracy against all odds in  brilliant blue and yellow; cellists playing their song and their  national anthem on burned-out steps; ballerinas going to the frontline  in camo; a videographer delivering medical supplies to Ukrainian  troops; the DJ at the national call center using her platform to find  missing loved ones. It is not just the troops on the frontline; it is  the entire country. And they are watching to see what they are doing.   I met with the Ukrainian Ambassador today along with the Speaker of  their House, along with their Defense Minister; and they are watching.  The Russians are using everything that is said in this Chamber,  everything that is done, because they are trying to use it against the  Ukrainians. They are trying to break their spirit, break their  backbone, break the morale of their troops. Well, it is not working.  But they are watching.   This is our moment. I think Leader McConnell put it best when he  said--and I say this to our Republican colleagues when you think about  the Iranian drones that were used by the Russians, when you think about  the massacre in Israel and the fact that Hamas then went to Russia--a  representative of this terrorist group went to Russia and met with  leaders there:   Think of it as an axis of evil: China, Russia and Iran. So this is  not just a test for Ukraine. It is a test for the United States and for  the free world. And the path toward greater security for all of us is  simple: Help Ukraine win the war.   Let us not forget what President Zelenskyy did in the hours  immediately after the initial invasion, when everyone in the world--all  those pundits that were at the Munich Security Conference that Senator  Shaheen and I attended--people were counting him out. He did one  incredibly brave thing followed by thousands of brave acts. He went to  the street corner with just a few of his top advisors, and he stood  there and looked at the camera and in the face of evil, in a statement  of defiance, in a call to action to democracies everywhere, he said  three simple words: ``We are here.''   America heeded that call. Ukrainians heeded that call. And  democracies all over the world united in every corner of the world, and  we said: ``We are here, too.''   The Ukrainian people have defended its nation against a tyrant,  against one of the largest armies in the world. It is our moral  obligation to stand by them. And talking to those leaders in the Baltic  countries yesterday--Lithuania and Latvia and Estonia--they have been  through this before. They have stood tall, but they know what the  stakes are.   If we let this happen and we let Putin just march right in next month  because we refused to help, he is not going to stop marching in their  eyes because they have seen it before. We must ensure that democracy  triumphs over autocracy; that humanity prevails over brutality; and  that the spirit of Ukraine carries the day.   I yield the floor.
