 Mr. Speaker, for years Donald Trump has honored thugs  worldwide who suppress democracy. For months, with a daily diet of  lies, he has made clear his refusal to accept any election in which he  was not the winner.   After failing completely in his repeated attempts to intimidate both  Republican election officials into committing fraud and Republican- appointed judges into ignoring our Constitution, he made a desperate  attempt last week to block the final election count and prevent the  peaceful transition of power essential to democracy. Trump basically  attempted to overthrow the government, to violently overthrow the first  branch of government, this Congress.   Like his deadly reaction to the pandemic, he totally bungled the  deadly attack. Both his frenzied riotous mob and his congressional  enablers were defeated. America, we did ``stop the steal.'' We stopped  Donald Trump from stealing our democracy and imposing himself as a  tyrant.   Today, we not only demand accountability for his gross misconduct,  but more importantly, we declare to the next Trump-like aspiring  tyrant, not in America, we love our democracy too much. Our Capitol is  scarred, but our democracy survives. Violating his sworn duty to  protect and defend our Constitution by seeking to violently overthrow  the government by inciting violence, lighting the flames of a deadly  insurrection. If this is not impeachable, nothing is.
