 Mr. Speaker, everyone should have the ability  to work in safe conditions, receive competitive pay and benefits, and  at the end of the day, be able to put food on the table.   America's hardworking families keep our country running, but right  now a lot of families are finding they don't have the support they  need. Autoworkers made concessions in 2008 to save the auto industry  and new contracts have not been reinstated to help them recover from  those cuts and keep up with the economic demands.   Meanwhile, auto company profits at Ford, General Motors, and  Stellantis have skyrocketed 92 percent over the last 10 years, totaling  $250 billion. In 2023 alone, they are expected to profit more than $32  billion. Despite their efforts, worker pay has only gone up 6 percent  over the last 10 years.   Companies can and should do better because Americans deserve better.  Workers deserve a fair deal. They aren't asking for the moon; they are  asking for fairness and dignity.                            ____________________
