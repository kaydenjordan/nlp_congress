 Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk.    I am in its current form.    Mr. Speaker, I first want to say that the vast majority  of TSA officers are good, hardworking professionals, but there are some  bad actors.   On February 6, 2020, the State of California announced the arrest and  prosecution of a former TSA screener, resulting from an FBI  investigation. According to the criminal complaint, the TSA screener  used ``fraud or deceit to falsely imprison a woman going through  security'' while stationed as a travel document checker at Los Angeles  International Airport in June 2019.   The screener insisted that the woman passenger needed extra screening  in a private elevator, where he told the passenger to reveal her ``full  breasts'' and to ``lift her pants and underwear.'' The victim in the  case stated that she complied with the TSO's instructions out of fear.   Fortunately, this offender was immediately fired by the TSA. However,  under this bill, H.R. 1140, if it passed, this predator could be on the  Federal payroll for months or even years.   But this is not an isolated incident. In addition to the sexual  predator at LAX, in the last 5 years alone, a screener in Boston was  caught luring teenage girls into posing for nude photos; a screener at  LaGuardia molested a female college student in the airport bathroom;  and two screeners in Denver plotted to grope attractive men.   My amendment is simple. It would enhance aviation security and  protect the flying public by preventing the TSA from hiring any  candidate with a history of sexual misconduct, offenses involving  minors, or terrorism.   This amendment is identical to an amendment offered by my Democratic  colleague, Ms. Underwood, which was not offered here today. The  Underwood amendment was made in order by the Rules Committee. The rule  was supported by every Democrat in the House.   Republicans strongly support the Underwood amendment. We were  disappointed we did not have an opportunity to vote on it earlier.   The Underwood amendment preserves the authority TSA currently has to  prevent the hiring of candidates with a history of sexual misconduct,  offenses involving minors, or terrorism.   The Underwood amendment is so important because current law bars a  litany of criminals from working in sensitive roles at airports. The  amendment simply ensures that current safeguards remain in place.   There is no reason that someone with a conviction for sexual assault  or terrorism should be a TSA employee. To be clear, the Underwood  amendment, my amendment, would prevent the hiring of sexual predators  like Harvey Weinstein.   We have two options today: adopt the Underwood amendment and keep  sexual predators off the Federal payroll, or reject it and reward  sexual predators with a paycheck from the taxpayers.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support the motion to recommit,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today with great sadness over the  passing of Colonel Ronald Lord from Goodyear, Arizona, a loving husband  to Mayor Georgia Lord of the city of Goodyear, which is in my district.  He was a caring and kind father, grandfather, and great-grandfather,  and he was loved by many.   While serving as a fighter pilot in the United States Air Force  during the Vietnam war, he bravely fought against hostile North  Vietnamese forces. Ron was an American hero, and we are eternally  grateful for his service.   On behalf of the Arizona Eighth Congressional District, I extend my  deepest condolences to Ron's family and loved ones as they mourn their  loss.                            ____________________
