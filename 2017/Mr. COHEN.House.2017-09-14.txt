 Madam Speaker, parliamentary inquiry.    Madam Speaker, I am a member of the Judiciary Committee,  and I have never seen this bill before. Under regular order, it should  go to our committee for a hearing and for a markup. Has this bill had a  hearing and a markup in any committee, or has it just sprung on this  floor like something out of the ocean in Greek mythology?
