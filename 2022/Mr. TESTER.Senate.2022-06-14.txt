 Reserving the right to object, we are here on the cusp of  doing something that really tells the fighting men and women who serve  in our military all around the world that we have got your back.   We are here because of what I would say is a great working  relationship between the ranking member, Senator Moran, and myself. As  I said in the VA Committee earlier, that relationship is going to  continue regardless, and the reason is because, in this place, there is  something that is missing, and it is called trust. And I trust Senator  Moran. We have been through this for the last year and a half and even  longer.  [[Page S2933]]    When you were chairman of the committee, many of the bills that are  in this package, you oversaw their passage out of committee.   But because negotiations continue and because I still believe, even  though this process is very broken--we both know that--I still believe  that we are going to be able to come to something that both of us can  agree on with amendments through our leadership--by the way, we would  agree on something anyway--but through our leadership. That is why I am  objecting to your motion.   I object.    Mr. President, may I ask the ranking member of the  Veterans' Affairs Committee a question?    Mr. President, are you asking me to throw my weight  around?
