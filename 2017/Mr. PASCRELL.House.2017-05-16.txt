 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause (2)(a)(1) of rule IX, I  rise to give notice of my intent to raise a question of the privileges  of the House.   The form of the resolution is as follows:   Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that the  President shall immediately disclose his tax return information to  Congress and the American people;   Whereas, in the United States' system of checks and balances,  Congress has a responsibility to hold the executive branch of  government to the highest standard of transparency to ensure the public  interest is placed first;   Whereas, according to the Tax History Project, every President since  Gerald Ford has disclosed their tax return information to the public;   Whereas, tax returns provide an important baseline disclosure because  they contain highly instructive information, including whether the  candidate paid taxes, number one; what they own, number two; what they  have borrowed and from whom, number three; whether they have made any  charitable donations, number four; and whether they have taken  advantage of tax loopholes, number five.   Whereas, disclosure of the President's tax returns could help those  investigating Russian influence in the 2016 election understand the  President's financial ties to the Russian Federation and Russian  citizens, including debts owed and whether he shares any partnership  interests, equity interests, joint ventures, or licensing agreements  with Russia or Russians;   Whereas, the President fired FBI Director James Comey last week,  whose FBI was investigating whether the Trump campaign colluded with  Russia to influence the 2016 election;   Whereas, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who made the recommendation  to fire Director Comey, during sworn testimony--the Interior Ryan Zinke  to review national monuments that Presidents have designated or  expanded since 1996;   Whereas, this review was praised by industry groups who could benefit  financially from oil, gas, mining, and condemned by environmental  organizations concerned this review will scrap or scale back critical  Federal designation to protect tribal and historic lands;   Whereas, the American people are in the dark to knowing if this  review was started to justify selling or leasing public lands to  private corporations that could enrich the President or his business  partners without reviewing the President's tax returns;   Whereas, it has been reported that Federal prosecutors have issued  grand jury subpoenas to associates of former National Security Adviser  Michael Flynn seeking business records as part of the ongoing probe  into Russian involvement in the 2016 election;   Whereas, according to his 2016 candidate filing with the Federal  Election Commission, the President has 564 financial positions in  companies located not only in the United States but around the world;   Whereas, against the advice of ethics attorneys and the Office of  Government Ethics, the President has refused to divest his ownership  stake in his businesses and can still withdraw funds at any time from  the trust of which he is sole beneficiary;   Whereas, the Emoluments Clause was included in the United States  Constitution for the express purpose of preventing Federal officials  from accepting any--from the Constitution, article I, section 9-- ``present Emolument, Office, or Title . . . from any King, Prince, or  foreign state'';   Whereas, the most signed petition on the White House website calls  for the release of the President's tax return information to verify  compliance.   The legislative branch has the responsibility and the authority to  check the executive branch in section 6103 of the Tax Code--in 1924  allows for an examination of his tax returns, the authority put in  place specifically so Congress could examine the conflicts of interest  in the executive branch of government following the biggest scandal of  the 20th century, the Teapot Dome scandal.                                time  1900    Nothing could be more of a threat to the integrity of the House than  ignoring our duty to fully examine the personal financial entanglements  this President may have with Russian entities and individuals and  whether he has abused the tax laws of the United States of America.   We have nothing but evidence to justify such an examination. If and  when such conflicts are revealed, I do not want to say to our  constituents that we had the power to review these conflicts, but we  did nothing. I, for one, do not want my integrity, or the integrity of  my colleagues on either side of the aisle in this body, to be demeaned  by such a shameful failure.   To restore the dignity of the House, we must use our authority to  request  [[Page H4213]]  President Trump's tax returns and give the American people the  transparency they deserve.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to dispense with the oral  announcement of the resolution in order that the entire text appears in  the Record.
