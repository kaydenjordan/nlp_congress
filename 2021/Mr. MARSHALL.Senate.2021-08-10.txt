 Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 3797 and ask  that it be reported by number.    Mr. President, as we all work to address vaccine  hesitancy and anxiously await full approval of the COVID-19 vaccines,  open border policies undermine these efforts. Americans can travel to  Mexico City but not return to America without a COVID test, while an  illegal immigrant has no test requirements, and in just a few days, it  will be easier to illegally cross our southern border than go to a  restaurant or a bar in New York City.   Some estimates would suggest hundreds or, perhaps, even thousands of  COVID-positive illegal immigrants enter our Republic every day. That  means we have a superspreader event at our southern border every single  day, and Americans are watching this public healthcare crisis. In  McAllen, TX, almost 1,500 new infected migrants were released into  their communities this past week alone.   There is a healthcare crisis at our southern border, and it is  unacceptable for the government to be transporting illegal migrants who  pose a grave risk of transmitting COVID across our Nation.   My amendment would ensure resources are provided for testing and  treatment of migrants at the border and for quarantining those who test  positive for COVID as well as prohibiting the transportation of  migrants who have not received a negative test.    Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.
