 Madam Speaker, Congressman-elect Luke  Letlow was called home far too soon. He was a friend and we were  looking forward to working together here in the people's House.   His passing was so sudden and unexpected that it caused many of us-- it certainly caused me to reflect upon my life and to be renewed in my  determination to serve the people and to become a better man every day,  because that is the kind of spirit that Luke delivered to the world.   He was a charming and brilliant man with a beautiful smile, a  wonderful spirit, a compassionate man, driven to serve.   I had the opportunity to break bread with Julia, Luke's wife, last  week, and I saw in speaking to her that Luke lives in the light in her  eye, in her children, and everyone that Luke touched during the course  of his life.   So I am prayerful that this child of God's presence will be felt,  that Representative-elect Luke Letlow's service will, indeed, be felt  within this Chamber, if we can just take a moment to seek that guidance  that he clearly pursued and listened to during the course of his life.  He brought that to those that he worked with and the citizens that he  served. So I thank my colleagues for arranging this Special Order  tonight.
