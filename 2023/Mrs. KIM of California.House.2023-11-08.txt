 Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the life and  legacy of Mike Andersen, a U.S. Army veteran and owner of Veteran Air.   Mike led a life of service and made a lasting impact in his 40 years  of life. He joined the Army in 2001 after the 9/11 attacks, serving 4  years and deploying to Iraq. When he returned, he started Veteran Air,  an HVAC company that has become a pillar of California's 40th District  and throughout Orange County.   From holiday donations to restoring the Prado Dam Mural, Veteran Air  is everywhere and always giving back to our community and to our area.   His efforts expanded even further when Veteran Air launched Operation  Water Drop. Mike packed up supplies and drove to Texas to provide  support during the historic 2021 freeze. My heart is with Mike's  family, his wife, Jessica; their six children; and the Veteran Air  family as we mourn Mike's passing and honor his legacy.   His impact will not be forgotten.                            ____________________
