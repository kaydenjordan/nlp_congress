 Mr. President, it is my honor to recognize Dr.  Barbara Damron's countless contributions in service to New Mexico over  the course of her career as she transitions from her position as the  chief government relations officer for the University of New Mexico,  including the central campus, the health sciences center, and all  branch campuses.   For more than three decades, Dr. Damron has built an impressive  resume of experiences as an education leader, a healthcare executive, a  college professor, an international consultant, an advanced practice  nurse, and a cancer scientist. In addition to her work at the  University of New Mexico, she has served as the New Mexico Higher  Education Department Cabinet Secretary and as the State Higher  Education Executive Officer, where she oversaw all of our State's 28  institutions of higher education, 4 Tribal colleges, and over 190  private and proprietary postsecondary schools.   Dr. Damron led the Common Course Numbering System, which aligned all  lower division courses among institutions of higher education  throughout New Mexico. As cabinet secretary, Dr. Damron demonstrated  her responsiveness to and collaboration with communities in our State.  Dr. Damron has also chaired the New Mexico Education Trust Board and  New Mexico's 529 college savings plan and served as a commissioner of  the Western Interstate Commission and of the Education Commission of  the States.   I appreciate Dr. Damron's deep engagement with my office as she  worked to help bring the University of New Mexico's impressive talent  and resources to bear against the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on  our communities. I will always be grateful for both Dr. Damron's  incredible management skills and the sense of humor she has always  brought to her work.   I am pleased that Dr. Damron will keep serving New Mexicans as an  educator by continuing to teach students in the University of New  Mexico Health Sciences Center's College of Nursing. I am confident that  her commitment to the success of our State's students and educators  will never end. And I congratulate her on this next chapter of her  career.                            ____________________
