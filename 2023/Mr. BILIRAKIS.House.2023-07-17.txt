Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material in the Record on the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1418, the Animal Drug  and Animal Generic Drug User Fee Amendments of 2023, sponsored by my  good friend, Mr. Pence, and, of course, Ms. Schrier on the Democrat  side and their members on the Energy and Commerce Committee.   Our committee has worked hard on this legislation for many months,  holding a legislative hearing in March and two markups this spring  before advancing it out of full committee last month by a vote of 49-0.   At each step, our members worked in a bipartisan fashion to consider  ways to make improvements to this legislation and keep any  controversial policies from getting in the way of passing this bill  before its September deadline. Great work.   Overall, the ADUFA amendments of 2023 will reauthorize the two user  fee programs established to support the development and review of  animal drugs and generics.   These drugs keep our animals healthy, from our household pets to our  farm animals, and they ensure that our food supply is safe for humans  too. That is how important this bill is.   The bill before us also includes provisions to support the review  process in getting new drugs to the market faster and adds new  reporting requirements to improve transparency and accountability  within the FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine.   It also takes steps to support utilizing the conditional approval  pathway for animal drugs, which will bring more drugs to the market for  small animal populations with unmet clinical needs.   There are even more program enhancements contained in these  agreements, addressing foreign inspections, fiscal responsibility, and  the need for more innovation.   If this legislation is not signed into law before September 30, Mr.  Speaker, the review and approval of the medicines that farmers and pet  owners rely on will dramatically slow down. We can't let that happen.   Drugmakers will also face regulatory uncertainty in getting their  therapies to the market, impacting access to new cures and treatments.  They are relying on Congress to do its job, and we will, which is why I  strongly urge support of this legislation and encourage my colleagues  to vote ``yes.''   I reserve the balance of my time, Mr. Speaker.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Pence), the sponsor of the bill along  with Ms. Schrier.    Mr. Speaker, this is a great bill. It is a necessary  bill for our farmers but also our animal owners. I used to be the chair  of the Humane Bond Caucus, and we absolutely love our animals. Mr.  Pence and Ms. Schrier are doing an excellent job on this particular  bill, and I urge unanimous passage.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 813) to direct the Secretary of Commerce, in coordination  with the heads of other relevant Federal departments and agencies, to  conduct an interagency review of and report to Congress on ways to  increase the global competitiveness of the United States in attracting  foreign direct investment, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 813         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Global Investment in       American Jobs Act of 2023''.       SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS.         It is the sense of Congress that--        (1) the ability of the United States to attract foreign       direct investment from responsible private-sector entities       based in trusted countries is directly linked to the long-      term economic prosperity, global competitiveness, and       security of the United States;        (2) it is a top national priority to enhance the global       competitiveness, economic prosperity, and security of the       United States by--        (A) removing unnecessary barriers to foreign direct       investment from responsible private-sector entities based in       trusted countries and the jobs that such investment creates       throughout the United States;        (B) promoting policies to ensure the United States remains       the premier global destination to invest, hire, innovate,       provide services, and manufacture products;        (C) promoting policies to ensure the United States remains       the global leader in developing and deploying cutting-edge       technologies, such as self-driving vehicle technology,       artificial intelligence, Internet of Things, quantum       computing, blockchain; and        (D) promoting policies that maintain and expand resilient       supply chains and reduce the dependence of the United States       on supply chains from China and other foreign adversaries;        (3) maintaining the United States commitment to an open       investment policy with private-sector entities based in       trusted countries encourages other countries to reciprocate       and enable the United States to open new markets abroad for       United States companies and their products;        (4) while foreign direct investment by responsible private-      sector entities based in trusted countries can enhance the       United States economic strength, policies regarding foreign       direct investment should reflect security interests and       should not disadvantage domestic investors, companies, or the       workforce;        (5) United States efforts to attract foreign direct       investment from responsible private-sector entities based in       trusted countries should be consistent with efforts to       maintain and improve the domestic standard-of-living,       including for the workforce;        (6) as digital information becomes increasingly important       to the United States economy and the development of new       technologies and services that will be crucial to the       country's competitiveness in the 21st century global economy,       barriers including data localization and infringement of       intellectual property rights must be further addressed;        (7) foreign direct investment by companies or other       entities owned, directed, supported, or influenced by the       Chinese Communist Party is a threat to United States security       and merits an aggressive policy framework to protect United       States interests, jobs, intellectual property, and security;  [[Page H3625]]         (8) foreign direct investment from any source should not       result in the net loss of United States economic activity,       productive capabilities, and supply chain resilience; and        (9) foreign direct investment from any source should       strengthen United States security and support United States       workforce, health and safety, consumer, and financial       standards.       SEC. 3. FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT REVIEW.         (a) Review.--The Secretary, in consultation with the       Federal Interagency Investment Working Group established       pursuant to Executive Order 13577 (76 Fed Reg. 35715;       relating to establishment of the SelectUSA Initiative) and in       consultation with the heads of other relevant agencies, shall       conduct an interagency review of the global competitiveness       of the United States in attracting foreign direct investment       from responsible private-sector entities based in trusted       countries and addressing key foreign trade barriers that       firms in advanced technology sectors face in the global       digital economy.

(2) Trends in global cross-border investment and data flows       and the underlying factors for such trends.        (3) Federal Government policies, that facilitate foreign       direct investment attraction and retention from responsible       private-sector entities based in trusted countries.        (4) Foreign direct investment as compared to direct       investment by domestic entities.        (5) Foreign direct investment that takes the form of       greenfield investment as compared to foreign direct       investment relating to merger and acquisition activity.        (6) The unique challenges posed by foreign direct       investment, particularly acquisitions, in the United States       by State-owned or State-backed enterprises, especially from       State-directed economies, including companies or other       entities owned, directed, supported, or influenced by the       Chinese Communist Party.        (7) Specific information on the prevalence of investments       made by State-owned or State-backed enterprises, especially       from State-directed economies, including companies or other       entities owned, directed, supported, or influenced by the       Chinese Communist Party, with a particular focus on       investments relating to manufacturing, services, trade (with       an emphasis on digital trade), and jobs.        (8) How other trusted countries are dealing with the       challenge, including screening for and preventing market       distorting investments, of State-directed and State-supported       investment and whether there are opportunities to work with       like-minded nations to address such challenge.        (9) Ongoing Federal Government efforts to improve the       investment climate and facilitate greater levels of foreign       direct investment in the United States from responsible       private-sector entities based in trusted countries.        (10) Innovative and noteworthy initiatives by State and       local government to attract foreign investment from       responsible private-sector entities based in trusted       countries.        (11) Initiatives by other countries to identify best       practices for increasing global competitiveness in attracting       foreign direct investment from responsible private-sector       entities based in trusted countries.        (12) The impact that protectionist policies by other       countries, including forced data localization rules, forced       localization of production, industrial subsidies, and the       infringement of intellectual property rights, have on the       advanced technology economy of the United States and the       ability for United States located firms to develop innovative       technologies.        (13) Other barriers to the ability of the United States to       compete globally in an increasingly connected and digital       global economy, including the use of technical barriers to       trade (such as country-specific standards for technology       products and digital services).        (14) The adequacy of efforts by the Federal Government to       encourage and facilitate foreign direct investment in the       United States.        (15) Efforts by the Chinese Communist Party to circumvent       existing laws to gain access to United States markets,       foreign direct investment responsible private-sector entities       based in trusted countries, or intellectual property.

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 813, the Global Investment in  American Jobs Act of 2023.   I thank Representative Pence for his work on this legislation and  Representatives Eshoo and Blunt Rochester and all the cosponsors for  their support of this very important piece of legislation.   Foreign direct investment, or FDI, has proven to be critical for  America's economy, and it is also an integral part of our Nation's  technological leadership. Still, FDI can be deterred by unnecessary  barriers that prohibit its expansion from trusted countries, allies,  and friendly economies. Removing these barriers will ensure that the  United States remains the global leader in attracting FDI.   This legislation will require the Secretary of Commerce, along with  heads of other relevant Federal departments and agencies, to conduct an  interagency review and report to Congress on ways to increase the  global competitiveness of the U.S. in attracting FDI from trusted  countries--I repeat, trusted countries--and economies. This is an  important distinction that my friend from Indiana included, and I  appreciate this, to ensure we focus on ways to increase FDI from our  allies--again, from our allies--rather than countries like China,  Russia, or anyone else who wants to do harm to our great country.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from the great State of Indiana (Mr. Pence), my good  friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close.   I am proud to be able to work with these great people here on a very  important bill. We need to encourage legitimate foreign investment in  our country. I know that other countries create the right environment  for us to invest in their countries, and it has really been a great  success. We want to continue to do that, but, again, we are emphasizing  that these have to be legitimate foreign investments from legitimate  allied countries.   Mr. Speaker, I commend the sponsors, and I yield back the balance of  my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
