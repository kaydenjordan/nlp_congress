 I thank Chair Waters for yielding.   Mr. Chairman, I also am not going to spend much time rebutting the  arguments of the previous speaker, indeed, given that he has opposed  every single reauthorization of the Ex-Im since he began service in  this Chamber--especially since he supported every amendment that would  have been harmful in past reauthorization legislation; especially since  he had the audacity, frankly, to use Huawei as an example, which he  cannot cite a single line in the draft to which he refers that would  have prohibited export financing to Huawei, and the bill before you  does.                                time  1430    No. I am going to use my time to do as I have in the past: to support  and defend the bank, one of the most important, least understood  elements of our national manufacturing strategy, the Export-Import  Bank.   It is vital to our national and local economies, especially  manufacturers, farmers, and small businesses, but it has suffered badly  under misguided attacks, such as that to which you were just treated. I  have seen this damage firsthand, despite our ongoing attempts to fight  them.   This year, I am pleased and proud that we finally have an opportunity  to reverse that damage and reinvigorate and expand the Ex-Im.   I support the Export-Import Bank because we want to see more U.S.  exports. The international market for goods and services is three times  as large as our domestic economy, and that gap, by the way, is  widening.   The American economy has not historically been export oriented, so  targeting foreign markets and increasing exports holds untapped promise  to raise living standards.   As I like to say, if we want to keep our middle class, we better sell  into the world's growing middle class.   Maximizing exports will require a strong Export-Import Bank. Over the  last many years, the committee has heard testimony and seen analysis  that the private market will not maximize exports if left to its own  devices.   Trade financing markets fail in predictable and repeated ways. The  scale is too large for new exporters to access; the timeframes are too  short for the largest, most expensive products; and there are some  countries that private lenders simply will not lend into.   So without a robust official export credit agency to fill these gaps,  we simply lose out on overseas sales, especially for small businesses  and capital equipment makers and farmers.   Every country recognizes this fact, but the U.S. alone among major  economies has failed to fully act on this knowledge.   If we want to maximize our exports, we need to stop the sabotage of  our credit agency, the Ex-Im Bank, and enhance it. This is what this  reauthorization bill does.   It does make several critical changes. It sets the bill up to succeed  by increasing the spending cap and expanding the ability to use  reinsurance to lay off risk, and setting up new authorities for the  bank to go out and search for foreign buyers who it can match with U.S.  suppliers, American jobs.   It attempts to move past some of the misinformation about the  agency's purpose that has dogged the reauthorization fight the last  many years by renaming it to focus on its sole purpose: financing and  expanding exports of U.S.-made goods.   It preserves the requirement that goods must be made in the United  States by U.S. workers in order to qualify for assistance from the  agency. This is the strongest domestic content requirement in the  world, and it reinforces that the core of Ex-Im's mission is supporting  U.S. manufacturing jobs.   It continues Ex-Im's historical role in leading export credit  agencies  [[Page H8848]]  around the world toward higher environmental standards, stricter  pollution controls, and more concern for the effects of infrastructure  projects in developing countries.   This is a legacy to be proud of and to build on, and I am glad to see  that our environmental advocates and our export sector have come  together to agree on the importance of this language.   It aligns Ex-Im more closely with U.S. foreign policy and  anticorruption efforts. Ex-Im financing will now be barred if a foreign  customer appears on any one of several bad actor lists maintained by  various agencies of the U.S. Government.   No, Mr. Chair, it is not a restatement of current policy. It is an  expansion of it, and they full well know it.   These targeted provisions allow Ex-Im to focus on maximizing U.S.  sales to good customers while also increasing the leverage that our  foreign policymakers have in encouraging foreign countries and  corporations to clean up their act.   Finally, it makes it much faster and easier for Ex-Im to match  financing terms with those foreign export credit agencies that  subsidize financing in their country's exporters.    Mr. Chair, I thank Chairwoman Waters for yielding.   Mr. Chair, China, in particular, has used this tactic to crowd out  U.S. manufacturers, and Ex-Im will finally have the tool it needs to  counter this tactic.   I am proud of the work we have done on this bill. Building a stronger  Export-Import Bank, if I may be personal for just one second, is one of  the main reasons why I was asked and honored to become a member of the  Financial Services Committee 7 years ago.   This is a bill that would achieve that mission for a decade to come,  and I urge all of my colleagues to vote ``yes.''    Mr. Chair, consistency is the hobgoblin of small minds, and  nobody is ever going to accuse the other side of having a small mind,  because I have been here just long enough to remember when they railed  with righteous indignation to pass legislation even though the Obama  administration had issued an SAP. Evidently, that is not a standard  that applies today, but it applied then.   Listen, I have heard no objections to the content of the proposed  legislation. What mostly I have heard is that we had a deal that fell  apart and it is all our fault. That is pretty good revisionist history.  It fell apart because it didn't have the votes.   And it wasn't just a question of what happened on the majority side.  They know full well there were minority party Members who were not  going to vote for it. There was bipartisan opposition, frankly, because  of all the external stakeholder opposition, because it does not work.   What are the differences, the major differences? Basically, that  other deal would have prohibited sale into countries--China, in  particular--with state-owned enterprises.   What are those? All railroads, all utilities, all airlines. That is  not the way we engage other countries and change their behavior.   Materially, factually wrong that we would subsidize the Chinese  Communist Party. In fact, in the last 30 years, the Export-Import Bank  has transferred up to $10 billion into the U.S. Treasury.   Listen, I just wish people would have the courage of their  convictions. The argument seems to be made, and I think it is a debate  worth having, is should we kick China out of the World Trade  Organization. That is really what is being said here. Let's have that  debate.   Looking back, I think it is questionable that they were admitted  without stronger accountability, and I think we need stronger  accountability.   Mr. Chair, great irony, the bill before you has incredible advance  progress over current law in terms of accountability with China. So, at  the end of the day, here it is: revenue generating, job generating,  American jobs. Vote ``yes.''    Mr. Chairman, I understand the temptation to dabble in  foreign affairs when it comes to Ex-Im reauthorization. We have seen a  lot of that here today. But there is a reason why we have separate  committees in the House: so that Members can develop expertise and  apply that expertise. Financial services, simply put, is not the main  repository of that kind of expertise, and it shows in this approach.   But let me be clear: No one here wants to support the trafficking of  synthetic opioids, of course not. There is a right way and a wrong way  to do it. This is the wrong way to do it.   And, in fact, if my friend, the author of this amendment, and I do  consider him a friend--if you want to ensure that those who are  sanctioned for dealing illegal opioids cannot use this Bank, vote in  support; indeed, vote in support of the McAdams amendment. It is not  theater. It is not cover. It is a strong amendment that is targeted and  substantive and, in fact, is going to get at the very underlying  problem without costing American jobs and without hurting American  businesses.   So I urge you to join the Foreign Affairs Committee or support the  efforts of the McAdams amendment.
