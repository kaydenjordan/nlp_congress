 Mr. Speaker, we hear the Senate is finally releasing a  bill, a bill that would, sadly, take away healthcare from millions of  Americans. Apparently, this bill will go straight to the Senate floor  without a hearing, without a markup, without the opportunity for any  public input.   This Republican healthcare bill is a disaster. It removes guarantees  of coverage that the Affordable Care Act created, allowing States to  determine health insurance options and discriminate against people with  preexisting conditions.   Under the Republican plan to replace the Affordable Care Act,  Colorado, alone, will lose billions of dollars of funding. Coloradans  will no longer be covered by Medicaid, leaving many more people  uninsured and a further burden on the rest of us, driving up our rates  because we have to cover the uninsured. Even Colorado schools would be  affected because many schools serve as Medicaid providers to students  with disabilities, and they would lose that funding.   While the Affordable Care Act isn't perfect, I strongly oppose this  Republican plan to take away insurance coverage and raise rates for  Coloradans. Not only is the bill disastrous, the secretive process  undermines the institution of Congress and the American people that  have elected every Member of this body.   Mr. Speaker, I call on my colleagues to oppose the repeal of the  Affordable Care Act.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume,  and I thank the gentleman for yielding me the customary 30 minutes.   First, I want to rise in agreement with my friend from Washington's  statement about civility in this Chamber and beyond. I think that,  while it is extremely important that those of us who are elected to  represent 700,000 to 800,000 people reflect the passions that we bring  to our service, at the same time, we need to make sure that nothing  that we say in these walls or outside is used to incite those who hear  those words in a different way than they are intended.   That is the fine line that we walk as elected Representatives who are  passionate about our ideals and our values, and it is one that I  encourage the President to walk, as well as other opinion leaders who  we often see on the cable talk shows hurling inciteful phrases back and  forth that could be used to further incite the American people.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the rule and the two underlying  bills: H.R. 1873, the Electricity Reliability and Forest Protection  Act; and H.R. 1654, the Water Supply Permitting Coordination Act.   Frankly, both of these bills are trying to address real problems that  have bipartisan solutions that I support, but neither of these bills  solve the problems in a thoughtful, effective way without creating  collateral damage that, in many ways, is as damaging as the problem  that they are designed to solve.   The majority will claim that similar bills received hearings last  Congress, but I want to point out from a procedural perspective that  neither of these bills have had hearings. These bills have not gone  through the committee process. But what they won't say is there are  dozens of new Members of Congress. New members of the Natural Resources  Committee didn't have hearings at all, but it was rushed through a  markup in committee and to the floor without any hearings in this  session, without the new members of the National Resources Committee  having a chance to ask questions about these bills.    There is a reason we have regular order. It is so that we elected  Representatives can use the passion we bring to service to ask the  difficult questions to find out how to get at these very real problems  that we are trying to solve.   Unfortunately, this secrecy, lack of hearings, and lack of  participation appears to be the norm, and, in fact, the standard that  Republicans are setting in both Chambers of Congress right now. It is  how the Republicans handled the healthcare bill in the House. It is how  the Republicans are handling the secret healthcare bill behind a closed  door somewhere over in the Senate.   We know some things about the Republican healthcare bill. We know it  will increase healthcare costs, throw people off their insurance,  reduce access for the American people. We know it will burden small  businesses and the middle class. We know it will hand hundreds of  billions of dollars in tax breaks to the wealthiest Americans. But  there is also a lot we don't know because the process has been closed.  This type of secret backroom deal is, unfortunately, becoming the norm  of the way Republicans are running their agenda in Washington.   The rule for this bill is another example. It blocked at least three  amendments from being considered on the floor.   Why can't we discuss the ideas of all Members, especially since there  was no hearing on this bill?   Representative McEachin from Virginia, Representative Schneider from  Illinois, and Representative Torres from California all offered  amendments, all had good ideas and were not even allowed to discuss  those on the floor for 10 minutes, 5 minutes, not even for 1 minute, to  offer or discuss any of those amendments.   If my colleagues on the Republican side don't think they are good  ideas, let's at least have a vote. They can vote against them. If they  defeat them, that is the process. But they are not even allowing a vote  on these amendments.   Unfortunately, the process of this bill is typical of the Republican  process on healthcare and the way they have approached so many other  issues. Republicans are working in secret and limiting debates so the  American people won't see the horrible things they are trying to do,  like throwing tens of millions of Americans off of healthcare.   Now, getting to these bills.   First, the Electricity Reliability and Forest Protection Act has the  goal of preventing forest fires and disruptions to power distribution;  something that I strongly agree with.   I represent a district that has over 60 percent public land and a  number of rural power districts. It is an admirable goal. We are a  district that is at risk for forest fires. We had several devastating  fires in the last several years alone. In fact, I am representing a  State that is getting even more ravaged by fire, in light of the  changing climate.   We need to take action to prevent them and allow additional work with  [[Page H5008]]  regard to preventing the forest fire risk. Unfortunately, this bill is  not a positive step, but I am glad to say there is an alternative out  there.   Representative Cramer from North Dakota and I, along with five of my  Colorado delegation colleagues, recently introduced bipartisan  legislation that will decrease these types of fires and protect power  lines and transformers the right way--a way that Democrats and  Republicans can agree on; a way that we can probably run the bill as a  suspension and get 410 votes; a way that the stakeholders are involved  and utilities, fire prevention experts and firefighters,  environmentalists all agree on.   My legislation, known as the National Forest System Vegetation  Management Pilot Program Act of 2017, gives power and electricity  companies the ability to remove dead trees, but without the  recklessness included in the bill that we are considering today.   It is a stark contrast. We can actually solve this problem in a way  that would bring the country together, or there can be a divisive  bill--maybe against one Democrat, maybe against five; I don't know, but  it is not a broadly bipartisan bill. It is not one that has the support  of the communities that are most affected by forest fires in my  district. It is not even a bill that has the support of our main  utility company in Colorado that actually sought the ability to reduce  forest fire risks, which is done by Representative Cramer's and my  bill.   This bill we are considering today simply lacks the protections that  we need to have confidence. In this bill, the company can come up with  a plan to remove vegetation, and then it can be accepted with no  questions asked. They can't require them to fix obvious problems, like  the power company cutting down trees for no reason other than to sell  it for timber. They can't even deny an application.   Frankly, I think this legislation's real goal is to take a small step  toward turning management of public lands over to private industry.   Once this plan that they would submit under this bill is approved-- because the plans have to be approved--the utility companies would be  able to do massive devegetation and clearing work without any reason  related to fires and without any risk of liability.   On the other hand, the bipartisan legislation I introduced with Mr.  Cramer gives that liability waiver that the utility companies need to  do the additional work, but only if there is no gross negligence by the  utility company and has something to do with actually reducing the risk  of fires, as well as putting reasonable limits on the distance that the  work can be done from the power lines or transformers themselves.   Mr. Cramer's and my bill has some of the most conservative and some  of the most liberal Members of this body as cosponsors. So I just  wonder and I ask the majority leader why we aren't bringing that bill  to the floor--a bill that lacks controversy, that helps prevent forest  fires, that saves American people time and money, a bill that this body  could be proud of advancing with, if not all, almost near unanimity.    I would suggest that, instead of bringing the bill we are considering  today to the floor, we should have been focused on fixing something  that we know needs to be fixed: the Forest Service's problem with fire  borrowing.   Fire borrowing means the Forest Service has to spend all their money  fighting fires and little money to reduce the risk of forest fires,  deal with climate change, or clear the extensive backlog of  maintenance. We can do that today by bringing to the floor the  bipartisan Wildfire Disaster Funding Act that Representative Simpson  and I introduced, along with my colleague, Mr. Schrader.   These are the types of commonsense measures that would actually  reduce the risk of forest fires, put the right parameters around  utility companies doing additional work, and free up additional  resources to prevent forest fires from occurring, rather than simply  doing the cleanup after they occur.   H.R. 1654, the Water Supply Permitting Coordination Act, also is an  admirable and needed goal, one that there is potential for bipartisan  cooperation to speed up the process of approval of water projects and  hydro dams.   There truly is a problem with the speed of which some of these  problems are approved. I represent a district and a State where we  understand how difficult and important water is, and we also believe in  the new renewable energy economy.   Unfortunately, this bill also does it the wrong way. It circumvents  and undermines important input from experts and scientists that  actually understand the reviews that are being made by the Clean Water  Act. It even circumvents tribal sovereignty in the Native American  Tribes and their sacred lands by overriding their input.   That is why a wide spectrum of organizations are opposed, from  conservation groups like Oceana and League of Conservation Voters to  sportsmen's groups like Trout Unlimited and The Pacific Coast  Federation of Fishermen's Associations. Dozens are opposed to this  reckless bill.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter of opposition.                                                      July 20, 2017.                          Please Oppose H.R. 1654         Dear Representative: On behalf of the undersigned       organizations, we write to urge you to oppose H.R. 1654       (McClintock, R-CA), a bill that would significantly limit       meaningful public and environmental review of new dams and       other surface storage projects throughout the west. H.R. 1654       would likely reduce protections for fish and wildlife, and       could lead to further damming and destruction of western       waterways. Similar provisions were included in H.R. 2898 and       H.R. 23--anti-environmental bills from 2015 and 2017,       respectively--and the Department of Interior has previously       expressed opposition to these efforts.        H.R. 1654 would undermine existing laws by making the U.S.       Bureau of Reclamation (``Reclamation'') the lead agency for       all environmental reviews, including reviews under the       Endangered Species Act. Giving Reclamation this unprecedented       power over project permitting could undermine the ability of       the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and N.O.A.A. Fisheries to       share expertise and inform the development of major       infrastructure investments, placing imperiled fish species at       risk. H.R. 1654 also establishes strict project-review       timelines, including provisions that could require expedited       review under the National Environmental Policy Act. These       fast-tracking provisions could make it difficult for       responsible agencies to meaningfully analyze proposed       projects, and could limit the public's ability to weigh in on       infrastructure that could affect communities for decades.       Further, the bill permits non-federal public entities to       contribute funds to expedite project permitting, raising       questions about the fairness of the federal review process.        This damaging bill would affect states throughout the west,       and could even impact how state agencies are able review       proposed projects within their jurisdictions. H.R. 1654       allows states to subject state agencies to the bill's       procedures, thereby requiring those agencies to cede control       to Reclamation and comply with Reclamation's timelines.       Consolidating project review in this manner could weaken the       essential role that states play in reviewing water       infrastructure projects within their jurisdictions.        As we recently learned from the emergency at Oroville Dam       in California, careful planning and design for major       infrastructure projects is critical for ensuring public       safety and protecting the environment. Environmental review       of surface storage projects is also essential for protecting       endangered and commercially important salmon runs and the       thousands of jobs that depend on healthy salmon populations.       With so much at stake, the streamlining provisions in H.R.       1654 are unwise and irresponsible. Instead of fast tracking       dam projects in the West, we should be investing in fiscally       sound, environmentally friendly water supply solutions like       conservation, water use efficiency, wastewater recycling, and       stormwater capture.        For these reasons, we respectfully urge you to vote no on       H.R. 1654.            Sincerely,      American Rivers      Audubon California      California Trout      Cascadia Wildlands      Center for Biological Diversity      Clean Water Action      Defenders of Wildlife      Earthjustice      Endangered Species Coalition      Environmental Protection Information Center      Friends of the Earth      Friends of the River      Grand Canyon Trust      Klamath Forest Alliance      League of Conservation Voters      Living With Wolves      Native Plant Conservation Campaign      Natural Resources Defense Council      Oceana      Sierra Club      The Bay Institute      Western Environmental Law Center      Western Watersheds Project      WildEarth Guardians      Wilderness Workshop      Wildlands Network.   [[Page H5009]]          Mr. Speaker, the letter is signed by a number of sportsmen  and environmental organizations, the very groups that we should seek to  work with, the very groups that actually support, as I do, hydropower,  facilitated permitting of hydropower, the right way.   We need to speed up the process. In Colorado, we have had water  projects that have been waiting on a decision for far too long.                                time  1300    But instead of going around experts, rolling over tribal sovereignty,  why don't we fund the agencies doing the reviews so that they have the  manpower and time to look at an application, give feedback, and make a  decision quickly?   Again and again we have underfunded the Fish and Wildlife Service and  NOAA, not acknowledging that that is what is causing and contributing  to this very slowdown.   We can solve these issues that we are facing. We can expedite  permitting for water projects and hydropower. We can allow utilities to  do additional work to reduce the risk of forest fires.   I call upon this body, please, let's do it in a way that brings  Democrats and Republicans together, proudly gets a bill to President  Trump's desk in a fast and effective way involving input from Democrats  and Republicans, not just Republicans.    I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Doggett).    Absolutely. I agree with the gentleman from Texas. This  House and the institution of Congress, as a separate agency of  government in Article I, section 1 of our Constitution has the  responsibility to exercise oversight of the executive branch.    It absolutely is.   Sometimes the American people in the back-and-forth say: Hey, why  aren't Democrats participating in the healthcare debate? And the  reason, as the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Doggett) articulated, is we  have never been invited into this room.   I would ask the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Doggett): Have you seen the  Republican healthcare bill in the Senate?   I yield to the gentleman.    Isn't that too short a period of time to even come up with  a thoughtful amendment?    I have one more question on that.   I am a member of the Education and the Workforce Committee, one of  the three committees that had original jurisdiction over the Affordable  Care Act. The gentleman from Texas (Mr. Doggett) is a member of the  Ways and Means Committee, one of the two committees with jurisdiction  under the budget reconciliation for this healthcare bill. I want to  ask: Have you ever been invited by President Trump to discuss your  ideas for healthcare reform?   I yield to the gentleman.    I thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Doggett) and would  just add, look, fire prevention, expediting water projects and  hydropower, these are not partisan issues; and to prove that point,  there are bipartisan bills sponsored by conservative Republicans and  liberal Democrats that would solve these issues. Rather than moving  either of those bills through the floor, they are moving a divisive  ideological bill with unintended consequences--or, perhaps, intended  consequences--that would devastate a lot of our natural resources that  sportsmen and recreationists rely on for our quality of life in the  mountain West and across the country.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, President Trump campaigned on a promise to  bring, somehow, jobs back home. He said he was going to overhaul the  Tax Code, introduce an infrastructure package, and remove barriers to  job creation. Unfortunately, we have yet to hear specifics on any of  the administration's plans to accomplish that.   My colleagues will be happy to hear that in my hand I have an  amendment that will help to accomplish this goal by providing tax  incentives to companies that bring overseas jobs back home. What a  great idea.   Mr. Speaker, when we defeat the previous question, I will offer an  amendment to the rule to bring up Representative Pascrell's Bring Jobs  Home Act, H.R. 685. This bill closes a tax loophole that actually  rewards companies for moving jobs overseas while providing a tax credit  to companies that move jobs back home to our country, the United States  of America.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New  Jersey (Mr. Pascrell) to discuss our proposal.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 30  seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 30  seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I agree with the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Buck), my  friend, that there is a problem here we are trying to solve.  Unfortunately, these are not the bipartisan bills that Democrats and  Republicans from both sides of the aisle have worked hard to put  together to do.   Of course, Democrats, myself, and so many others want to expedite  water projects permitting for hydro renewable energy projects. Of  course, we want to free up utilities to do extra mitigation work around  power lines to reduce the risk of fires. We have solid bipartisan bills  that would do that. We could put them on the floor today or tomorrow,  and they would have over 400 votes. There are liberal Democrats,  conservative Republicans, and firefighters who support them. Utilities,  Democrats, Republicans, and sportsmen support them.   That is a route we could go. We could get those bills to President  Trump's desk by next week and actually start preventing forest fires  and facilitate the permitting process around hydro projects. But, no,  instead, we are doing a very divisive bill, one that has a lot of  problems that it creates, in addition to solving some of the problems  that it sets out to address.   I encourage my Republican friends--they are in charge; they control  the agenda--to take a look at pragmatic, smart, and thoughtful ways to  reduce forest fire risk, speed up water project approval, such as the  bipartisan National Forest System Vegetation Management Pilot Program  Act, which is a bipartisan bill.   Look, this bill around the expedited water projects would circumvent  a lot of the public input process that is actually so important to the  success of these projects. My colleague from Colorado was referring to  several water projects. One that we both care deeply about, the  Northern Integrated Supply Project, NISP, is currently with the Army  Corps of Engineers and the Bureau of Reclamation.   I strongly supported extending the public comment period from 30 to  60 days--a very reasonable time to allow people more input, which  actually changed how the project was done and planned. It was a very  meaningful form of input to build additional public support for the  project; and, when the project is completed, will lead to a better,  more meaningful project, serving the water needs of our communities, as  well as the impact on the lives of those who live in and near it.   So, look, whether it is fixing fire borrowing, giving utilities a  liability waiver while not giving them a free pass, making sure that  our agencies doing water project reviews have the men and women power  they need to actually get them done quickly, these are reasonable, good  ideas that I think we could pass with unanimity, or near unanimity.   I promise the Republicans, if you would just work with us and have an  open process, we could find common ground. Let's start with these small  things. Let's start with preventing forest fires around electrical  fires. We will get to healthcare. We can find common ground with you on  that, too.   But let's start on finding common ground around reducing forest fire  risk around electrical wires, Mr. Speaker. There is a path to do that.  Let's solve our small problems, and let's build a pathway to work  together on the big problems our country faces.   I urge everyone to vote ``no'' on this restrictive rule, this rule  that goes to the floor with no hearing, this rule  [[Page H5012]]  that rules out Democratic amendments, doesn't even allow discussion of  them, and has a controversial piece of underlying legislation, when  there is no need for controversy around such an important aspect of  life in the American West, and, nationally, reducing forest fire risk  and facilitating water projects and hydroelectric projects. Please join  me in voting ``no,'' so we can get this House back to working on  commonsense legislation that is bipartisan, with the full support of  the American people.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.  [[Page H5013]]    The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
