 Mr. President, one of my chief responsibilities as  chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee is to help protect  the men, women, and institutions that keep America safe, including not  only the State Department but the North Atlantic Treaty Alliance.   NATO was founded in 1949 as an alliance that was committed to the  collective defense of its members--that an attack on one constitutes an  attack on all. The alliance's self-defense clause has only been invoked  once, after 9/11, when our allies deployed with us to Afghanistan.   Our militaries, in their working together, allow NATO to function.  NATO members have committed to spending 2 percent of their GDPs on  their militaries, but only the United Kingdom, Estonia, Poland, Greece,  and the United States currently hit that goal. While the other members  are working on growing their defense budgets, I have long held the  belief that they must do so faster.   Regardless, part of what makes NATO great is its open doors. States  that are interested in becoming allies are encouraged to join the  Partnership for Peace. When those states then meet the criteria for  membership, they are welcomed into the alliance.   This process is exactly what occurred with Montenegro. Just after  becoming  [[Page S1989]]  an independent country in June of 2006, Montenegro joined the  Partnership for Peace in December 2006. Exactly 3 years later,  Montenegro obtained its Membership Action Plan. Six years after that,  NATO recognized that Montenegro had met all of the necessary standards  for membership and invited the country to begin talks to become part of  the alliance. Then, in May of 2016, NATO's Foreign Ministers signed the  protocol to formally open the way for Montenegro to join. As of today,  every other NATO member has already ratified this treaty and  Montenegro's inclusion.   Beyond such procedural steps, Montenegro has long been contributing  to shared security challenges. For example, Montenegro actively  supported the NATO-led operation in Afghanistan from 2010 until its end  in 2014 and now is supporting the follow-on mission to train, advise,  and assist Afghan security forces. It is important to note that  Montenegro has taken these steps despite Russia's best efforts to  undermine their progress every step of the way.   I thank Senator Ben Cardin; the Europe and Regional Security  Cooperation Subcommittee chairman, Ron Johnson; and my other colleagues  on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for their support and  constructive work during this process.   We have moved this treaty ratification twice now--once in the last  Congress and again in January--to demonstrate our commitment to NATO  and to Montenegro.   I also thank Senator McCain, both as a former member of our committee  as well as the chair of the Armed Services Committee, for his  unwavering support in bringing Montenegro into the alliance.   Lastly, on behalf of the committee, I urge all of my colleagues to  support this treaty amendment that serves American security interests  for a strong NATO.   I yield the floor.

[[Page S1991]]    The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.    Mr. President, I work very close with my friend from  Kentucky. There were some awfully strong things that were just said. I  don't think they were directed necessarily at me.   I think there has been a little bit of an evolution here. I know that  the reason we are having to go through this process of filibustering a  treaty is the fact that the Senator from Kentucky wanted a vote on an  unrelated amendment relative to surveillance here in our own country.  When he was unable to get that agreement, he decided to filibuster a  treaty. So that is what is happening here.   I am interested to hear this evolution of why we are having this  debate. Let me just say, having dealt with this issue firsthand--and I  know he knows this--this filibuster is about something totally  unrelated to the amendment that is being offered right now.   I know the Senator from Kentucky, my friend, knows that I have  offered authorizations for the use of force. I did so against Syria,  and I am glad to have a debate on authorizations for the use of force,  and I think we should. I know the administration is developing a  strategy around ISIS right now, and when they complete that, it is my  hope that we will, in fact, update the 2001 AUMF.   I think it has been stated by past administrations that the  authorization they are utilizing as it relates to ISIS is legal. I  believe them to be correct. But I will say that I agree we ought to  have another debate on the issue of authorizing the fight against ISIS,  and I hope we will do so as soon as this administration completes the  process of laying out what their plan is. Then we can debate that and  then hopefully update that authorization. I don't know what that has to  do with a treaty with Montenegro. There has been a lot that has been  said, and I don't know how it necessarily ties together. But the fact  is, when you enter into an article 5 treaty--which has, by the way,  passed out of our committee on two occasions--you are, in fact, saying  under article 5 that a war against one is a war against all and that we  will come to their defense. So the amendment itself, if we were to vote  on it, would basically negate that.   I think the Senator from Kentucky could have had this vote, but the  fact is that 98 Senators wanted to have this vote--have wanted to have  this vote for months, I might add--and we have had to come to this  point of filing cloture.   So, with that, with good will toward the Senator, with good will  toward the other 97 Senators here who would like to pass this  posthaste, I object.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.   The Senator from Kentucky.    Mr. President, before I suggest the absence of a quorum,  I would like to say that the Constitution calls for treaties to be  enacted by this body, which is what we are doing today. Everybody  understands what NATO is and has understood it since the late 1940s.  This is the kind of treaty that we would like for other people to be a  member of, and today Montenegro, which has gone through the full  process of accession, hopefully will be passed through this body.   This is the last country, by the way--every other country that is a  member of NATO has voted to cause Montenegro to join NATO.   I know my friend from Maryland, the ranking member, Senator Cardin,  has just arrived. I know he has a few words to say. He is a strong  supporter of Montenegro's accession, as is the vast majority of this  Senate.   I will let the comments from the Senator from Kentucky lie. We are  doing our constitutional duty by passing a treaty that we all  understood. It has been debated fully in committee. It has been passed  out twice. I am glad we are doing so. The fact is, this has been  blocked by one Senator who wanted to vote on something totally  unrelated to this and was using this as leverage. That is what is  occurring here, nothing else. We are finally, through cloture, having a  vote on something that the majority of people in the Senate want to  pass.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory  quorum call be waived.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?   Without objection, it is so ordered.   Pursuant to rule XXII, the Chair lays before the Senate the pending  cloture motion, which the clerk will state.                               Cloture Motion         We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the       provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate,       do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the Treaties       Calendar No. 1, treaty document No. 114-12, Protocol to the       North Atlantic Treaty of 1949 on the Accession of Montenegro.          Mitch McConnell, Cory Gardner, Steve Daines, John             Barrasso, Joni K. Ernst, Bob Corker, John Cornyn,             Lindsey Graham, Jeff Flake, James M. Inhofe, Roy Blunt,             David Perdue, John McCain, Pat Roberts, Tom Cotton,             Jerry Moran, Mike Rounds.    The PRESIDING OFFICER. By unanimous consent, the mandatory quorum  call has been waived.   The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that debate on the  Protocol to the North Atlantic Treaty of 1949 on the Accession of  Montenegro shall be brought to a close?   The yeas and nays are mandatory under the rule.   The clerk will call the roll.   The assistant bill clerk called the roll.
