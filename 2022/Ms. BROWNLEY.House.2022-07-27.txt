 Madam Speaker, the American people are feeling the  effects of rising costs. As these costs continue to put pressure on the  pockets of America's working families, House Democrats are working  tirelessly to provide relief.   When gas prices soared earlier this year, House Democrats took action  to fight price gouging at the pump.   House Democrats took action to lower insulin costs and ensure that  lifesaving prescriptions do not send families into bankruptcy.   As food prices rose, House Democrats took action to reduce prices for  American farmers and lower prices for families in the grocery aisles.   But our work is far from over.   We understand that prices are too high and Americans are struggling  to make ends meet. Fighting inflation and lowering costs for families  remains our top priority.   Republicans have tried to obstruct bills to cut costs to earn  political points at the expense of hardworking American families. It is  time to put people before politics.   House Democrats are working for America's working families, and it is  time my Republican colleagues do the same.                            ____________________
