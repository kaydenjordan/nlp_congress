 Mr. Speaker, small businesses in this country have  ranked the cost of health insurance as their number one problem for 32  years straight.   Democrat policies like ObamaCare have led to skyrocketing health  insurance costs and a broken individual health market. ObamaCare costs  taxpayers more than $1 trillion a year while covering less than 5  percent of the population.   Small businesses are hardest hit by this as they often struggle to  afford the absurdly expensive costs of healthcare.   The health insurance market is overregulated, and power is  concentrated in just a few large insurers. This is not a free market.   Medicare itself will be on the rocks in just a few years unless we  change this tide.   To ease the burden on small businesses, House Republicans will  introduce and have introduced the CHOICE Act, which will enhance the  flexibility and affordability of healthcare for small businesses.    Small businesses are a cornerstone of our American economy and are  essential against corporate tyranny, which we see happening these days.   House Republicans will not let small businesses be crushed to death  by rising costs and these failed policies.                            ____________________
