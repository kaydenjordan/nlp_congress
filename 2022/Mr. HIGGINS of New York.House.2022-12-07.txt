 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the $2.8  million included in the National Defense Authorization Act for the  Niagara Falls Air Reserve Station.   This funding will support construction of a new combined operations  and alert facility at the base. The project is important to the 914th  Air Refueling Wing and national readiness.   A strong and efficient 914th is good for the country and for western  New York. The air reserve station is Niagara County's largest employer,  generating $300 million in economic impact on the local economy.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to support this funding and enhance  mission response.                            ____________________
