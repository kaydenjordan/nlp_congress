 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize National  School Choice Week and the importance of school choice.   I was proud to join my colleague, Senator Tim Scott of South  Carolina, in introducing the CHOICE Act last Congress, which would  expand the school choice options and programs for elementary and  secondary school children. I look forward to working together again on  similar legislation.   I was also proud to join Representative   John Moolenaar last week on  his resolution to designate this week as National School Choice Week.   In Iowa, we recognize that every child learns and processes  information differently, and we have empowered parents and students to  choose the school best suited to their needs.   We are fortunate to have Governor Kim Reynolds, who is leading the  Nation in school choice policy, and who has been a strong advocate for  school choice throughout her tenure.                                time  1215    During the COVID-19 pandemic, many children were forced to transition  to virtual learning while some private schools stayed open.  Unfortunately, this resulted in a significant drop in testing averages  across core subjects like reading comprehension and math.   This proved, in some instances, that public schools weren't able to  adapt to the needs of each individual student. However, some students  in private or charter schools were able to excel because of smaller  class sizes or specialized education tailored to their strengths.   I am honored to represent a State where we put parents first, where  parents matter, and where parents have a right to a say in their  children's education instead of Washington bureaucrats. As a mother of  two, I understand how important it is to ensure that your children  receive the best education possible.   I will continue to fight for school choice to ensure every child in  America has a chance to succeed in the best possible learning  environment. Our children deserve nothing less.   I would also like to wish a happy birthday to my nephew. Happy  birthday, Andrew.   I would like to extend birthday wishes to Nicholas Pottebaum, one of  my very first campaign volunteers and now a health policy adviser to  Senator Grassley. Happy birthday, Nick.                            ____________________
