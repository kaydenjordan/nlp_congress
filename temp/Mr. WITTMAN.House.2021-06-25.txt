 Madam Speaker, for decades, the Hyde amendment has  shielded the American taxpayer from being forced to fund abortion. And  for decades, the Hyde amendment has enjoyed broad bipartisan support.  Even President Biden supported the Hyde amendment as recently as 2019.   Unfortunately, that is no longer the case. Now, President Biden has  reversed course, proposing we repeal the Hyde amendment.   In turn, this would require American taxpayers, no matter what their  personal beliefs, to fund abortion.   Madam Speaker, this is wrong. Every life is blessed with inherent  worth, infinite potential, and sacred dignity.   As a child of adoption myself, I would not be here today if not for  my mother's decision to choose life over abortion.   I urge my colleagues to stand strong in support of the Hyde amendment  and against this radical new position of President Biden.   Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the Committees on Energy  and Commerce, Ways and Means, and the Judiciary be discharged from  further consideration of H.R. 18 and ask for its immediate  consideration in the House.
