 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, we are on the nomination of Congressman  Bridenstine to be the new Administrator at NASA. I want to tie it into  what I will talk about in a moment because it comes down to  Presidential appointments and the problems we are running into with  regard to them.   I was not enthused by the nomination. It is nothing personal against  Mr. Bridenstine. I feel that NASA is an organization that needs to be  led by a space professional. Unfortunately, a few weeks ago, the Acting  Administrator resigned--or, I should say, retired. His last day on the  job is the 30th. So it leaves us with the prospect of this incredibly  important agency for Florida and the country with a vacancy in its top  job. We are on our second Acting Administrator. If one were to do the  math, even if Congressman Bridenstine were to withdraw and a new  vetting process were to begin for a new nominee, by the time it would  work its way through the administration, the committee process, and the  floor, the way things are going here, we could be into February-March,  at the earliest, of next year. There is no way NASA can go 2 years and  X number of months without having a permanent Administrator.   One makes these decisions always under the context that a President  should have significant discretion in picking the team. Whether you  like it or not, millions of Americans last year voted for the  President. He was elected, and he has a right to govern. In 4 years--in  less than 4 years now, in 2\1/2\ years--the American people will have  the chance, once again, through our democratic process, to opine on  whether or not they will want him to have a second term. Our job here  is to provide advice and consent. We are to analyze these nominees and  determine whether or not we want to support them.   My view of it is, as has been the tradition of the Senate for the  entire existence of the Republic, that we give great deference to the  President on choosing the qualifications. We want to make sure that  people are qualified and that there is nothing about them that would  disqualify them. It is my view that the more important the job the more  discretion the President deserves. It is why, although I had  significant reservations about the nomination of Secretary Tillerson, I  decided to support it, because I believed the President deserved  significant discretion. When you get to the subsecretaries and the  like, I think that discretion diminishes.   It is what has led me to decide to support Congressman Bridenstine,  despite my reservations, and it is what, I hope, will lead my  colleagues--at least a sufficient number--to support the nomination of  Mike Pompeo to be the Secretary of State.   Let me read you some of the previous votes we have had here in the  Senate. All but one of them predates my service.   Colin Powell was confirmed by a voice vote, which is almost  unimaginable in a 21st century Senate, but in 2001, on January 20, by a  unanimous voice vote, he was confirmed as the Secretary of State.   A few years later, in 2005, Condoleezza Rice was confirmed as  Secretary of State by a vote of 85 to 13. Now, it was still 13 noes,  but, nonetheless, it was 85 yeses. I assure you that not everyone who  voted for her was happy about her nomination. People didn't necessarily  agree with her. One of the people who supported her, I believe, was  future President Barack Obama.   Hillary Clinton was nominated and confirmed in the Senate by a vote  of 94 to 2, and I promise you that a significant number of the Members  on my side of the aisle may have respected Secretary Clinton but  strongly disagreed with her and her views on a number of issues, but,  nonetheless, they felt the President deserved to have his nominee.   When she resigned, her replacement was then-Senator Kerry, who was  the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, with whom I had  significant policy disagreements in the Senate and during his time as  Secretary of State. Yet I, along with 93 other Members of the Senate,  supported his nomination, and he was confirmed.    Mr. President, today I recognize Dr. Janet Bisogno,  the Osceola County Teacher of the Year from Celebration High School in  Celebration, FL.   Janet was named Teacher of the Year in recognition of her  accomplishments as an outstanding educator and for her passion and  devotion to challenging students towards success.

Janet gives students tremendous opportunities to participate in  science as an immersed experience, including fun but challenging labs  and learning opportunities. In both 2016 and 2017, her students scored  higher than the world average on IB biology exams. Her students have  had a 100-percent pass rate on the end of course exam since she began  teaching Pre-IB biology. Janet's leadership in her science professional  learning community has been instrumental in moving all students  forward.   Colleagues say Janet creates strong and positive relationships with  her students, which contribute to a successful classroom environment.  She traveled with students to Peru, where they completed an academic  field study on the Amazon.

Washington High School in Pensacola, FL.   Carla was recognized for bringing enthusiasm into the classroom every  day.

In  her first year as band director, her commitment helped the Trenton High  School Band receive a superior rating at the district musical  assessment for the first time in more than a decade.   Jennifer's motto when teaching her students is S.U.D.A.: spirit,  unity, discipline, and attitude. Each of these traits are valued by  Jennifer and were adopted from her own mentor.   Jennifer graduated in 2011 from Newberry College in Newberry, SC,  with a bachelor of arts degree in applied music.
