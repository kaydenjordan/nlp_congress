 Mr. Speaker, it is National Apprenticeship Week.   In Oregon and around the country, registered apprenticeships and pre- apprenticeships are helping people access good-paying jobs, improving  economic security, and increasing opportunities for women, people of  color, and dislocated workers.   Last week I met with more than 30 apprentices and union leaders at  the UA 290 Training Center in Tualatin, Oregon. Their stories are  inspiring. I heard from apprentices like Sade with Steamfitters Local  290, who said, ``I love what I do, and people who look like me coming  into these spaces matters.''   Jackie, who was once incarcerated, is now helping others overcome  barriers and enter the workforce. She said IBEW ``gave me a chance.''   In discussing the Constructing Hope Pre-Apprenticeship Training  Program, Sarah, a single mom, said that, without it, ``I would never be  here providing a better life for my kids and myself.''   During National Apprenticeship Week, I say to all of my colleagues,  join me. Let's work together to protect and expand registered  apprenticeship programs to provide workers with quality training,  portable credentials, high wages, support services, and a pathway to a  permanent job.   These programs do more than train a workforce; they change lives for  the better.                            ____________________
