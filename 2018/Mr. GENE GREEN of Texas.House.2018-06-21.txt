 Mr. Speaker, my prayers are with the  immigrant families who were being separated at the border. The  administration's actions were inhumane, and I am glad the President  reversed these actions.   As the children are sleeping on the floor behind a cage wishing they  would hear from their mom and dad, the administration and Republican  majority are working silently, chipping away at the Affordable Care  Act.   The Trump administration released a rule that would greatly expand  association healthcare plans, which are exempt from the Affordable Care  Act's essential healthcare benefits, including maternity care, mental  healthcare, and prescription drugs. This new loophole will bring back  junk, or fake, plans that provide little or no health coverage.   Repeal of the Affordable Care Act didn't happen, but the Republicans'  sabotage of our Nation's healthcare system continues, and our uninsured  Americans continue to grow.   These junk plans will siphon off young, healthy people, damaging the  ACA marketplaces and leaving everyone else with higher premiums. The  fake insurance may not cover emergency room treatment or other terrible  illnesses.   Americans need healthcare, not fake insurance.                            ____________________
