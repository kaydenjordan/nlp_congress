 Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman for yielding.   Nearly 7 years ago, the American people were promised that the Dodd- Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act would end  Washington bailouts, protect consumers, and lead to a more prosperous  economy.   Instead, the big banks and the influence of the Federal Government  have continued to get bigger while smaller, local community banks and  credit unions are closing up shop and our country continues to struggle  with anemic levels of economic growth.   This is why the Financial CHOICE Act is so important. This  legislation gives us an opportunity to return the power to the ``little  guy or gal'' who wants to create a better life for themselves and, by  doing so, for all of us.   It takes steps to end the failure of excessive and redundant  bureaucracy, and it will give our entrepreneurs the opportunity to  access the startup capital they need to grow and thrive once again.   I am especially pleased that this bill includes provisions from my  Micro Offering Safe Harbor Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Adjustment  Act, and the Financial Stability Oversight Council Reform Act. These  three bills are important components of the Financial Services  Committee's broader intent of improving opportunity and accountability  for all. I appreciate the chairman's continued efforts to make this  goal a reality.   Mr. Chairman, I thank Chairman Hensarling for all of his work. I look  forward to supporting the Financial CHOICE Act, and I hope all of us  will do the same.   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to  the gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. Demings).
