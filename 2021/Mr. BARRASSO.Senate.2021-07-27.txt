 Mr. President, I come to the floor today to pay tribute  to our friend and former colleague, Senator Mike Enzi.   Senator Lummis and I are here, and we are very grateful for the kind  comments of the minority leader, Senator McConnell; majority leader,  Senator Schumer; and the President pro tempore of the Senate, Senator  Leahy.   Mike Enzi was my colleague. He was my mentor. He was my friend.  Today, my wife Bobbi and I, along with all of the people in the State  of Wyoming and all of his friends and admirers here in the U.S.  Senate--we are joined on the floor by many of his former staffers, many  of whom still work here--all of us mourn his passing.   For nearly a quarter of a century, Mike Enzi represented the people  of Wyoming in this very body in the U.S. Senate. In so many ways, as we  served as a team when Cynthia Lummis was in the House and Mike and I  were in the Senate, he was our trusted trail boss for our entire  congressional delegation.   He served with intelligence, with dignity, and with grace. He never  wavered. His commitment was to God, to his family, to country, to  Wyoming.   It was an incredible honor and a great privilege for my wife Bobbi  and for me to serve the people of Wyoming alongside Mike Enzi and his  wife Diana.   Mike was born in the middle of World War II. He was in Washington  State at the time because that is where his father was stationed. After  the war, the family moved back to Thermopolis, WY--my wife's hometown-- and to Sheridan, WY.   As all of us know, Mike was an Eagle Scout, so were his son Brad and  his grandson Trey. They followed in his footsteps. Later in life, he  was awarded the Distinguished Eagle Scout.   He went on and studied accounting. He earned a business degree, and  he focused on marketing. He was pretty good at it. He served in the  Wyoming Air National Guard, and he was 6 years a tech sergeant.   In 1969, Mike and Diana were married. One week later, they moved to  Gillette and opened a small business known as NZ Shoes--Enzi, like his  name, but the letter ``N'' and letter ``Z'' Shoes. The little business  wasn't that little for long. He opened a second store in Sheridan, then  Miles City, MT.   Mike ran for mayor of Gillette, served two 4-year terms. He often  called being mayor the toughest job in politics, and Mike performed  flawlessly. With the help of his business skills, Gillette went into an  economic boom. He served 10 years in the Wyoming Legislature as both a  State representative and a State senator.   When he came here to the Senate, Mike became a leading voice--a  leading voice on budgets, on taxes, and on healthcare issues. In 2015,  he became the first accountant to ever chair the Budget Committee. He  brought to Washington the valuable lessons that he had learned in the  Wyoming Legislature, and he put them to use right here   He would say: Like American families, Wyoming has to balance its  budget every year, live within our means, and so should America.   Under Mike's leadership, Congress passed three consecutive balanced  budget regulations. During his time as chairman, Congress also passed  the largest tax cuts and reforms in a generation. And those tax cuts  gave us the best economy of our lifetimes.   Mike also chaired the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions  Committee in the Senate. As chairman, he spearheaded the most  significant pension reform in 30 years. Mike's legacy in the U.S.  Senate also included improving mine safety, helping in the AIDS  epidemic in Africa, passing mental health parity.   His highest priority, of course, was always helping the people of  Wyoming. Over his 24 years in office, Mike and his capable staff helped  the people of Wyoming through more than 15,000 pieces of casework. They  helped veterans get the benefits that they had earned. They helped  seniors get Social Security. They helped people become naturalized  citizens.   When he announced his retirement, he said:         I am an advocate for Gillette and Campbell County and       Wyoming.    He said:         Everyone lives at the local level. No one lives at the       Federal level, or even the State level.    He said:         Diana and I are your Chamber of Commerce and your economic       development people for every town and county in Wyoming all       the time.    Mike started several annual events in Wyoming to boost Wyoming. One  was the Inventors Conference; another, the Procurement Conference; and  then Wyoming Works tour.   In 2009, Mike and I started Wyoming Wednesdays. This is when people  from around Wyoming come to Washington, and we get together--our  delegation--for coffee, for donuts, and for fellowship. We are proud to  continue the tradition today.   Above all, Mike was a moral leader in the Senate. He taught Sunday  school for decades and he learned from the best. Mike's first Sunday  school teacher was in Thermopolis, WY, and his teacher was my wife  Bobbi's mother, Jerry Brown. Mike Enzi was her star pupil. She actually  gave Mike his first Bible.   Well, that benefited all of us because, decades later, Mike Enzi  became a leader of our bipartisan Senate prayer breakfast. As a member  of that group, I saw firsthand how Republican and Democrat Senators  looked to Mike Enzi for moral and ethical guidance. He was a guiding  light.   On my first day in the Senate, Mike gave me this book. It is called  ``One Quiet Moment,'' and it is a daily prayer devotion. This is how he  inscribed it in 2007. He said:         John, here's a book that has helped me through 11 years of       the Senate. It's amazing how often the message of the day       relates to what's going on in my life.    He said:         These messages provide strength.        Mike Enzi--June 26, 2007.    So the message of the day provides strength. Let us turn to July 27,  today. The message is from Philippians. The message is three words: ``I  press on.'' The message of today: ``I press on.''   It goes down to the bottom, and it says:         My steps forward today may be small, but at least they are       steps off dead center. Keep me moving, Lord!    It is Mike's message through this book for us to press on. As I said,  Mike Enzi was a moral compass for many of us, and he always pointed  True North.   He was a friend and a mentor to me, to so many Senators on both sides  of the aisle over 24 years. He knew how to find common ground and bring  people together better than any.   It was rare for an Enzi bill to receive fewer than 80 votes. This was  by design. Mike called it his 80-20 rule. He learned in the Wyoming  State Legislature. At the beginning of each year, each member of his  committee made a list of their priorities. Most years there was  bipartisan agreement on 80 percent of the priorities. Mike Enzi would  then focus on that 80 percent on which they agreed, and he would leave  out the 20 percent on which they disagreed. As a result of this  approach, Mike Enzi wrote more than 80 bills which were signed into law  by four different Presidents in the United States, two Republicans and  two Democrats. I was proud to cosponsor many of those bills with him  here in the Senate.   Yet for all of Mike's achievements in business and in government, we  will miss him most as a friend. Following his retirement, Mike did an  interview with Wyoming Public Broadcasting. He said there wasn't much  he would miss about Washington, DC. He said it was the people whom he  would miss the most.   Mike had a dedicated, hard-working, and loyal staff. Some of them  returned to Wyoming, others still serve in this body today, and a  number have joined us on the floor. Mike gave much of the credit for  his success to these folks. I know they are all feeling a huge loss  today.   Mike used to say there aren't many things better than being a Senator  from Wyoming, but he used to joke that two of them are fly fishing and  being a grandfather. Mike had a great  [[Page S5079]]  love of nature, which is easy when you live in Wyoming. Mike was an  accomplished and avid fly fisherman. In fact, in August of 2015, he  achieved every fly fisherman's dream. He completed something known as  Wyoming's Cutt-Slam. This is a Wyoming Game and Fish Department  program, which increases appreciation for our native cutthroat trout.   Yet Mike would tell you the achievement that he was most proud of, of  course, is family. He is survived by his wife Diana; his children Amy,  Emily, and Brad; and his grandchildren Megan, Allison, Trey, and Lilly.   When he retired earlier this year, Mike said: ``None of this would  have happened without Diana. The best thing that ever happened to me,''  he said, is when she said she would marry him.   Diana is a wonderful person. She used to host an annual Christmas  cookie party here in the Senate. She did it to say thank you to all of  those whom she called the real workers: the janitors, the cleaning  crew, the electricians, the police officers, the food service workers,  and her staff. Every year, Diana and her friends baked hundreds of  dozens of cookies. My wife Bobbi often joined in the cooking of  literally thousands of cookies of all varieties and all made with  loving care. It was so popular around here that people used to walk up  to Diana and Mike in the hallway and ask: When is the party?   It had been a tremendous privilege for my wife Bobbi and me to serve  for 13 years with Mike and Diana, representing Wyoming in the U.S.  Senate. The people of Wyoming will always be extremely grateful-- grateful for his decades of faithful, tireless service.   May God bless the memory of Mike Enzi. May God comfort his family  during this extremely trying time. And may God continue to bless the  State of Wyoming.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    I ask unanimous consent to be able to use a prop during  my remarks.    Madam President, I come to the floor today to strongly  oppose the nomination of Tracy Stone-Manning.   I want to focus my remarks now on the misleading and false statements  that Tracy Stone-Manning has made to the Senate and how they just don't  align with the facts.   On her committee questionnaire, which is a sworn affidavit that every  nominee fills out, the committee clearly asks: Have you ever been  investigated?   Tracy Stone-Manning said she had not.   On the same document, she also stated that she testified for a grand  jury about an alleged tree spiking. Well, these statements are not  true, and Ms. Stone-Manning knows it.   Tree spiking involves hammering a metal spike, like this one, into  the trunk of a tree. Ecoterrorists use spikes like this. This is  something they do to prevent loggers from harvesting trees. If a saw  blade hits that spike, it destroys the saw, and metal shrapnel flies in  every direction. The results can be catastrophic.   The trees in the Clearwater National Forest were spiked in 1989.  Individuals were found guilty of this crime, and a local sawmill was  damaged as a result of the spikes. Some of the trees standing today are  still spiked and can still do damage to loggers and firefighters. These  are serious dangers and damages that can occur to people still today.   If there is a forest fire in the Clearwater National Forest, a smoke  jumper may need to cut down trees to slow the spread of the fire. If  that person hits a spike with a chain saw, it could kill or maim the  firefighter. Worse still, Tracy Stone-Manning knew who the  ecoterrorists were, and she could have turned them in at the start.   In 1989, she edited, typed, and sent this vile, threatening letter to  the men and women of the U.S. Forest Service. She did it on behalf of  the tree spikers. The letter included lines like:         You bastards go in there anyway and a lot of people could       get hurt.    She went on:         I would be more than willing to pay you a dollar for the       sale, but you would have to find me first, and that could be       your WORST nightmare.    Tracy Stone-Manning has said since the incident that she mailed this  disturbing, threatening letter to warn people of the danger of the  spiked trees. But she didn't go to the authorities. No, she did not.  She did not go to the police. No, not at all. She took extraordinary  steps to ensure that she and the tree spikers would never get caught.   If she had gone to the police, the Forest Service would have been  much better able to identify the spiked trees. Instead, she covered up  for the criminals for years. All the while, these trees remain spiked  and remain incredibly dangerous.   Ms. Stone-Manning told our committee that she was never investigated.  Well, that was a lie. Following the tree spiking in 1989, she was  subpoenaed by investigators to provide hair samples, fingerprints,  writing samples, and other physical evidence.   These are criminal investigators. Press articles at the time confirm  this fact, as do the court documents obtained by the Energy and Natural  Resources Committee. This is further verified by the letter that our  committee received by the lead criminal investigator for the U.S.  Forest Service, Mr. Michael Merkley. We received this letter after she  had testified in front of the Senate committee a few months ago.   He wrote:         . . . the grand jury issued subpoenas for hair samples,       handwriting exemplars, and fingerprints. These subpoenas were       served on persons suspected of having knowledge of the       incident, including Ms. Tracy Stone-Manning.    But don't take his word for it. Let's listen to the words of Tracy  Stone-Manning herself. In a 1990 article about law enforcement's  investigation at the University of Montana, she complained about how  the investigation made her feel.   She said:         It was degrading. It changed my awareness of the power of       the government.    Through this entire period, she did not tell the truth to the  investigators. Remember, she knew who spiked the trees. She sent a  threatening letter to them. She never went to the police, and she never  identified the ecoterrorists. She also didn't cooperate.   The lead investigator says in his letter that the committee has  received since the time she testified to the committee a few months  ago--he said:         Through this initial investigation in 1989, Ms. Stone-      Manning was extremely difficult to work with; in fact she was       the nastiest of suspects. . . . she was vulgar, antagonistic,       and extremely anti-government.    He goes on to say she refused to comply with the investigation until  she learned she would be arrested if she did not.   But the investigation of Tracy Stone-Manning did not end in 1989 with  the subpoenas. In December of 1992, after years of her covering up for  the ecoterrorists, she was identified as the one who sent the  threatening letter. A woman connected with the group came forward and  gave her name to investigators.   Mr. Merkley writes, again, in this letter we received since Stone- Manning  [[Page S5082]]  has testified in her committee hearing in the Senate--he writes:         [A]s a result of Ms. Lilburn's testimony, the grand jury       sent Tracy Stone-Manning a target letter, which meant she was       going to be indicted on criminal charges for her active       participation in planning these crimes.    Her lawyer then negotiated an immunity deal. She would testify  against the individuals who spiked the trees. And she knew she could  have been charged.   In an interview published in a 1983 article in ``The Missoulian,''  Stone-Manning said that she could have been charged with conspiracy if  not for the immunity deal.   Remember, she told the Senate she had never been investigated. She  was subpoenaed for physical evidence. She was investigated. She didn't  cooperate with investigators. She complained to the press about being  investigated, and she covered up for the ecoterrorists for years until  she was caught. But that wasn't her only lie. On our committee's  questionnaire for the record, I asked her:         Did you have personal knowledge of, participate in, or in       any way directly or indirectly support activities associated       with the spiking of trees in any forest during your lifetime?    In any forest during your lifetime?   She responded:         No.    Everyone knows that is a lie. She sent their letter. She knew who  they were. She supported their activities. The lead investigator's  letter makes clear she knew the plan to spike the trees in the Idaho  forest in advance.   He wasn't the only one--this lead criminal investigator wasn't the  only one to say she knew so in advance. One of the convicted tree  spikers, one of the people who went to jail in this episode, he told  E&E News--again, since the hearing and since the letter has come out,  just in the last couple weeks, the convicted tree spiker says: ``She  knew about it far in advance, a couple of months before we headed  out.''   He continued: ``She had agreed to mail the letter well in advance.''   To be clear, after Tracy Stone-Manning had her confirmation hearing  here in the Senate earlier this year, two people with direct knowledge  came forward. One was the cop--the criminal investigator who  investigated the crime. The other was the criminal who was convicted.  Both the cop and the criminal say she lied.   Ms. Stone-Manning helped plan the tree spiking. She knew about it in  advance. She sent a threatening letter to the Forest Service. She was  investigated. She collaborated with ecoterrorists. She lied to the  Senate.   Lying to the U.S. Senate has consequences. In this case, her actions  and her lies should cost her this nomination.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I come to the floor this afternoon  because we have heard a lot here today about Tracy Stone-Manning, her  nomination to head the Bureau of Land Management, and how completely  disqualified she is for that post.   As you have heard, it is a critically important Agency, especially  for those of us in Western States. It manages almost one-eighth of the  entire land mass of the United States. In my home State of Wyoming, the  Bureau of Land Management oversees 18 million acres. If you came to the  Energy Committee, and as I told my friend and colleague Joe Manchin,  that is more territory than the entire State of his home State of West  Virginia; and in the case of the Presiding Officer, more than the size  of your State by a lot.   It is not just my State. This Agency oversees 12 million acres of  public land in Arizona, 48 million acres of land in Nevada, and 8  million in Montana. It is like that all across the West. Included in  the land that it manages is almost 65 million acres of Federal forests.   The Bureau is also responsible for hundreds of millions of acres of  mineral land below the surface. It is critical to America's energy  independence. There is a lot of energy that is under those lands.   Tracy Stone-Manning has no business leading this agency--none  whatsoever. She helped plan a tree spiking in one of our country's  National Forests. She sent a threatening letter to the U.S. Forest  Service about it. She did not cooperate with Federal investigators,  blocked the investigation, only testified when she received immunity,  and lied to our committee about it.   There is bipartisan concern about this nomination. I will tell you  Bob Abbey, who was President Obama's Director of Bureau of Land  Management, said that her actions ``should disqualify'' her. This is  President Obama's nominee to run that Bureau. Because Bob Abbey  understands the job and knows her involvement with tree spiking, it  should eliminate her from any consideration.   So Steve Ellis, who was the Deputy Director of the Bureau of Land  Management during the Obama administration, and he was the highest  ranking career official at the Agency, he raised concerns about Stone- Manning as well. This is what he said. He said:         Much of the focus seems to be whether this is a Democrat or       Republican thing, but [he said] the lens that I look at this       through is as a 38-year career person in both agencies, and       that letter she wrote went to my Forest Service colleagues on       the Clearwater.    He makes a very important point. How can the men and women of the  Bureau of Land Management, people who have devoted their lives to work  for this Agency, how can they respect President Biden's nominee, Tracy  Stone-Manning, when they know she threatened their colleagues at the  U.S. Forest Service?   Conservation organizations have begun to pull their support as well.  The Dallas Safari Club and the Houston Safari Club, which each  represent thousands of outdoorsmen and -women have both now reversed  their support and now publicly oppose her nomination now that they have  learned this additional information.   Radical ideas are nothing new for Tracy Stone-Manning. Around the  time of the criminal tree spiking, she wrote her graduate thesis. In  her thesis, she argued that Americans need to have fewer children  because children are a threat to the environment. She even made ads to  promote these ideas. These are ideas you hear in Communist China, not  from a nominee to be the Director of the Bureau of Land Management.   Now, some Democrats have defended Tracy Stone-Manning by saying this  tree spiking was decades ago. Her radical views have not changed, I  will assure you, Mr. President, because right now many States in the  West are burning from raging, dangerous wildfires.   Management of these fires has become a constant conservation--or  conversation at the Energy and Natural Resources Committee and on the  Senate floor, and we actually discussed it this morning in the Energy  and Natural Resources Committee.   Tracy Stone-Manning has current views on this one as well. Her  husband, Richard Manning, wrote in Harpers that firefighters should let  homes built in forests burn. He wrote:         There's a rude and satisfying justice [satisfying justice]       in burning down the house of someone who builds in the       forest.    Now, Tracy Stone-Manning is not responsible for the views of her  husband. But last September, as wildfires burned last year--and we had  hearings on those--she actually endorsed her husband's views on letting  it burn and letting the houses burn. In a tweet, she called her  husband's comments a clarion call. It wasn't 30 years ago. It is about  10 months ago. Tracy Stone-Manning endorsed her husband's call to  action that homes in the forest should be allowed to burn.   There are currently wildfires burning in Alaska, Arizona, Colorado,  California, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, South Dakota, Utah, Washington, and  Wyoming. All of these States have BLM lands. This year's largest fire,  the Bootleg fire, has burned over 400,000 acres, 7 homes, and more than  40 other buildings. Thousands of homes are still threatened.   This year, around 2 million acres have burned so far in the Western  States. Last year alone, wildfires burned and damaged over 17,000  structures.   And what do they call it--what does her husband call it, and what  does she tweet about? ``Satisfying justice in burning down the house.''   How can Senate Democrats vote to confirm a nominee who has advocated  to let the homes of their own constituents burn?   These views are disturbing and dangerous. President Biden has made  the threat of domestic terrorism a focus of his administration. His own  National Security Council recently released a strategy to address  domestic terrorism. It specifically includes the threat of domestic  environmental terrorists. But he has nominated someone who admitted to  conspiring with terrorists.    Every Senator needs to consider carefully if they want their name  associated with Tracy Stone-Manning. All 10 Republicans on the Energy  and Natural Resources Committee have asked President Biden to withdraw  the nomination. We all voted against her nomination last week during a  committee business meeting.   She conspired with ecoterrorists. She lied to the Senate. She still  holds radically reprehensible views.   Tracy Stone-Manning should never be the Director of the Bureau of  Land Management. The Senate must reject her nomination. I strongly  oppose her nomination and urge each and every Member to do the same.   I yield the floor.
