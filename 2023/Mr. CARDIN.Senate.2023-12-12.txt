 Mr. President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute. Upon such notification,  the Congress has 30 calendar days during which the sale may be  reviewed. The provision stipulates that, in the Senate, the  notification of proposed sales shall be sent to the chairman of the  Senate Foreign Relations Committee.   In keeping with the committee's intention to see that relevant  information is available to the full Senate, I ask unanimous consent to  have printed in the Record the notifications that have been received.  If the cover letter references a classified annex, then such an annex  is available to all Senators in the office of the Foreign Relations  Committee, room SD-423.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                    Defense Security                                              Cooperation Agency,                                                     Washington, DC.      Hon. Benjamin L. Cardin,      Chairman, Committee on Foreign Relations,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: On December 8, 2023, the Secretary of       State, pursuant to section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control       Act, as amended, determined that an emergency exists which       requires the immediate sale of the defense articles and       defense services identified in the attached transmittal to       the Government of Israel through the Foreign Military Sales       process, including any further amendment specific to costs,       quantity, or requirements occurring within the duration of       circumstances giving rise to this emergency sale.        Please find attached (Tab 1 ) the Secretary of State       Determination and Justification waiving the congressional       review requirements under Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export       Control Act (AECA), as amended. We will issue a news release       to notify the public of this proposed sale upon delivery of       this letter to your office.            Sincerely,                                                       Mike Miller,                                   (for James A. Hursch, Director).        Enclosures.                                 unclassified       Determination Under Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export           Control Act        Pursuant to section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control       Act, 22 U.S.C. 2776, I hereby determine that an emergency       exists that requires the immediate sale through the following       foreign military sales case, including any further amendments       specific to the cost, quantity, or requirements of these       cases, in the national security interest of the United       States:        For Israel:        120mm Tank Cartridges        This determination shall be published in the Federal       Register and, along with the accompanying Memorandum of       Justification, shall be transmitted to Congress with the       applicable notifications.        Date: 12-8-23                                                 Antony J. Blinken,                                                Secretary of State.      (U) Memorandum of Justification for Emergency Arms Transfers           to Israel Under Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export           Control Act        (U) On October 7, Hamas launched the worst attack on Israel       since the 1973 Yom Kippur War. Thousands of rockets were       fired and continue to be fired indiscriminately, hitting       locations and civilians as far as Tel Aviv and Jerusalem.       Hamas gunmen crossed into Israel, entering towns and       communities as far as 15 miles from Gaza, slaughtering men,       women, and children. More than 230 hostages were captured and       dragged back into Gaza, including U.S. citizens. As of today,       Hamas' act of terrorism has claimed the lives of more than       1,200 in Israel, including at least 31 U.S. citizens, and       wounded thousands more. The attack is the single deadliest       day for the Jewish people since the Holocaust, and is       reminiscent of the worst rampages of ISIS. The following day,       the Government of Israel formally declared war on Hamas in       accordance with its Basic Law.        (U) Israel has the right to defend itself, and the United       States supports Israel taking necessary action to defend its       country and protect its people from Hamas terrorists,       consistent with international law and, specifically, the law       of war. Following the attack, the President directed surging       additional military assistance to the Israeli Defense Force,       to include ammunition and interceptors to replenish the Iron       Dome. The Department of State and the Department of Defense       are coordinating with Israeli partners to meet their military       requirements and ensure Israel has what it needs to defend       itself, its people, and U.S. citizens living, working, and       traveling in Israel.        (U) Israel faces further credible security threats on its       northern border with Lebanon and Syria. Since October 7,       sporadic violence has occurred across the Blue Line, which       marks the de facto boundary between Israel  [[Page S5916]]       and Lebanon, and Israel remains at immediate risk of other       parties in Lebanon or Syria exploiting Hamas' appalling       attack.        (U) The United States' commitment to Israel's security is       ironclad, which is reflected in decades of close political-      military dialogues and high-level defense policy exchanges.       The historic ten-year U.S.-Israel Memorandum of Understanding       to provide Israel with $38 billion in security assistance is       a bulwark against regional threats; however, Israel requires       urgent support to respond to the immediate threat raised by       Hamas' horrific attack, to replenish stocks of key defense       articles that maintain its Qualitative Military Edge in the       region, and to deter and guard against the threat of broad       scale regional conflict.        (U) Given the scale and scope of Hamas' offensive, it is in       the United States' national security interest to swiftly       provide Israel with the defense systems it requires to defend       itself and reinforce deterrence against other regional       threats, which we have undertaken since October 7. Israel has       communicated an urgent requirement for 120mm tank rounds. The       urgency of this requirement has been validated by the       Department of Defense in consultation with the Department of       State. We anticipate Israel will continue its military       operations in Gaza in the near-term. In order to effectively       do so and ensure it is prepared for any other attacks, it has       an immediate need for these defense articles. These 120mm       rounds are readily available in DoD stock and can be quickly       transferred to Israel. The immediacy of the challenge at hand       requires overcoming the statutory 15-day Congressional       Notification timeline to expedite transfers to Israel.        (U) For the reasons cited above, an emergency exists       requiring immediate provision of these defense articles to       Israel in the national security interest of the United       States. This transfer, through a Foreign Military Sale, will       provide Israel as soon as possible with defense articles that       are necessary to allow it to defend itself in its war with       Hamas. The Secretary of State, therefore, has certified an       emergency exists under sections 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export       Control Act, 22 U.S.C. 2776, thereby waiving the       congressional review requirement of that provision.                            Transmittal No. 24-15       Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to           Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act, as           amended        (i) Prospective Purchaser: Government of Israel.        (ii) Total Estimated Value:        Major Defense Equipment * $99.9 million.        Other $6.6 million.        Total $106.5 million.

(viii) Date Report Delivered to Congress: December 8, 2023.        * As defined in Section 47(6) of the Arms Export Control       Act.                             POLICY JUSTIFICATION                    Israel--M830A1 120mm Tank Cartridges         The Government of Israel has requested to buy thirteen       thousand nine hundred eighty-one (13,981) 120mm M830A1 High       Explosive Anti-Tank Multi-Purpose with Tracer (MPAT) tank       cartridges. Also included are publications and technical       documentation; U.S. Government and contractor engineering,       technical, and logistics support services; studies and       surveys; and other related elements of logistics and program       support. The estimated total cost is $106.5 million.        The Secretary of State has determined and provided detailed       justification that an emergency exists that requires the       immediate sale to the Government of Israel of the above       defense articles (and defense services) in the national       security interests of the United States, thereby waiving the       Congressional review requirements under Section 36(b) of the       Arms Export Control Act, as amended.        The United States is committed to the security of Israel,       and it is vital to U.S. national interests to assist Israel       to develop and maintain a strong and ready self-defense       capability. This proposed sale is consistent with those       objectives.        Israel will use the enhanced capability as a deterrent to       regional threats and to strengthen its homeland defense.       Israel will have no difficulty absorbing this equipment into       its armed forces.        The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not       alter the basic military balance in the region.        This will be a sale from U.S. Army inventory. There are no       known offset agreements proposed in connection with this       potential sale.        Implementation of this proposed sale will not require the       assignment of any additional U.S. Government or contractor       representatives to Israel.        There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness       as a result of this proposed sale.                            Transmittal No. 24-15       Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to           Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act                             Annex Item No. vii         (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:        1. The 120mm M830A1 High Explosive Anti-Tank Multi-Purpose       with Tracer (MPAT) tank cartridge is a line-of-sight, full-      bore, multipurpose munition for the Abrams tank. It requires       the gunner to manually select the fuze mode to either point       detonate against buildings, bunkers, and light armor vehicles       or similar target sets, or proximity for anti-helicopter       self-defense capabilities.        2. The highest level of classification of defense articles,       components, and services included in this potential sale is       Controlled Unclassified Information.        3. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain       knowledge of the specific hardware and software elements, the       information could be used to develop countermeasures that       might reduce weapon system effectiveness or be used in the       development of a system with similar or advanced       capabilities.        4. A determination has been made that Israel will provide       substantially the same degree of protection for the sensitive       technology being released as the U.S. Government. This sale       is necessary in furtherance of the U.S. foreign policy and       national security objectives outlined in the Policy       Justification.        5. All defense articles and services listed in this       transmittal have been authorized for release and export to       the Government of Israel.                            ____________________
