 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Alabama  for yielding.   First, I want to make a comment about how this process has gone in  coming up with this compromise with the amendment on the flood  insurance package. We have worked in the Financial Services Committee  with outside groups, whether it was the home builders or the realtors  or the insurance industry. We have worked with Members of Congress from  the Gulf States and  [[Page H9193]]  from the East Coast and from the West Coast. We worked with Democrats.  We had a number meetings with the ranking member of the committee, all  taking in their consideration, which has brought us to a compromise  that I don't know that anybody loves, but everyone says is a pretty  darn good bill that strives to make needed reforms in a program that  hasn't been working well. When we have programs that don't work well,  let's try to fix them.   We have a program that, as was just mentioned, is $25 billion in  debt, but that doesn't include the $16 billion we just gave the program  and forgave. So really, it is $41 billion in debt.   So when do we think through the policies of a program that continues  to run deficits, number one, but, number two, continues to incentivize  people to live in harm's way?   I was down in Houston and I got to see a family who was talking about  their next-door neighbor whose house was burning down. He was telling  the story about his neighbor, and as the house started on fire, he sent  the kids outside--like you would because your house is burning--as the  flood waters are rising. The dad went to go put out the fire, and as he  was putting out the fire, he looked out the window and saw his kids  were being swept away by a flood. The current was too strong, so he ran  outside to save his kids and let his house burn.    What are we going to do in that neighborhood that had been flooded  three times in the last 10 years?   We are going to rebuild houses in the same flood plain. This doesn't  make sense. Let's think about a reform that is going to improve the  program, that helps people get out of dangerous areas and get into  better areas that don't flood. Having a flooding house isn't a pleasant  place to live.   Not only that, first responders risk their lives to go save people,  and they die. We are incentivizing through this policy to allow people  to live in these dangerous areas. I don't have a lot of time left, but  the reforms are going to, yes, gently increase some of the premiums for  the most highly subsidized properties called the pre-FIRM properties.  We offer over $1 billion in mitigation to help families flood-proof  their home or get out of their home and go to a better place to live  because this improves the solvency of flood insurance. We are helping  them with mitigation.   We are helping them with mapping, allowing communities that haven't  been mapped to actually map themselves, to pay for it, to take care of  their own future and destiny instead of waiting for the Federal  Government. We allow for a private market to come in and offer you a  premium that might be lower than the Federal Government.   God forbid we offer a family a choice to let the private sector  compete with a public offering. My God, if you get a lower price, that  is great. If you don't get a lower price, you can stay in the Federal  plan.   My goodness, I am going to have some people come up in a second and  say: But you could cherry-pick, and that could jeopardize the solvency  of the program.   The program is insolvent. It is $25 billion in debt--actually, $41  billion, if you include that $16 billion. It is not a solvent program.   Just think if in Houston and in Florida we had people who had bought  insurance in the private market, we would be saving taxpayers money.  This is a commonsense bill that makes the program better, that helps  families, that empowers communities. Let's stand together. A little bit  of reform might go a long way in making government actually work, so I  would encourage all of my colleagues on both side of the aisle to vote  ``yes'' for common sense.    Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Hensarling for all  his good and relentless hard work on this bill. I appreciate his  tenacity.   I want to thank Mr. Blumenauer for the comments that he just made.  The two of us had not worked together on a lot of issues, but this is  one we saw eye-to-eye, and, through flood, I think we have seen a lot  of common ground and built a friendship together.   I actually promised I was going to wear a bike today, and I haven't  kept my promise. Later today, I will wear that for Mr. Blumenauer.   But I want to talk about the debate we have had here today. This has  been an effort at bipartisanship. On the Republican side, I have worked  with Representatives Graves and Scalise and Zeldin and King and  LoBiondo and MacArthur trying to bring in their concerns to this  legislation.   On the Democrat side, I have worked with Mr. Scott; I have worked  with Mrs. Maloney, Ms. Velazquez, all concerned about the Northeast and  the Sandy reforms that were necessary to learn the lessons. We have  included those reforms in this bill.   I sat down countless hours with the ranking member. She shared her  phone number with me. She left me at the dance though, because before  this thing was done, she walked away. We tried to get a bipartisan  bill. We worked on this thing together; so to say something other than  that is just not fair, it is not right. We have tried.   You might not like the end product, but we have gone a great distance  to get a bill that everybody can agree on, and I think we are going to  get that today.                                time  1615    I want to talk about a few things. We are $25 billion in debt, a  deficit of $1.5 billion a year. This program is not sustainable. We  have people who are building homes in harm's way. They get flooded  multiple times.   The chairman and I saw a homeowner who was flooded three times in 10  years. One homeowner let his house burn because he had to go save his  kids who were getting swept away in floodwaters, and we rebuild those  homes in the same location and risk the lives of firefighters and first  responders to go save them. This policy is unacceptable and it is not  compassionate.   I hear my friends across the aisle say: You are going to hurt  homeowners. Their rates are going to skyrocket.   What? On average, for a year, the price of flood insurance, on  average, will go up $20, less than $2 a month, and they are screaming  bloody murder about that? And what do they get for it? I have a list of  30 things of great reform we get in this bill to help homeowners.   Yes, highly subsidized properties in a pre-FIRM space are going to  pay a little more, a little higher escalator, but we spend a billion  dollars on mitigation helping people flood-proof their homes, helping  people get bought out of their home and get to higher ground so they  don't have to live in a home that is continually flooded.   I don't know if you have lived in a flood home, but it ain't fun. It  is horrible. Get them out. A billion dollars for that program.   We help communities with their mapping. We give them options to map,  and we give them an appeals process in their mapping. Great reform, we  set up a private market.   Now, you don't have to take the private market, but you have an  option to get a private plan that might have a better rate than the  government offers you. You have a choice--a choice, God forbid--a  choice that gives you a better price.   By the way, when we get the private market in, we all float our risk  to the private sector. When a disaster hits Texas or Florida, it is not  just the taxpayers who bear all the burden. We have private companies  in play. That is a great thing. This is a good bill. This is a  bipartisan bill. Let's stand together and reform a program to help the  homeowner and our national debt.   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the  balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, let me say to my colleagues on the opposite side of the  aisle, my chairmen, Mr. Hensarling and Mr. Duffy, we did work very hard  to try and get a bipartisan bill.   As I negotiated with them, every time I reached an impasse, I thought  about Sandy and how hard Democrats had to work to provide support for  an area that should have gotten the support of everyone in the Congress  of the United States. However, there was a demand from the opposite  side of the aisle that it had to be paid for. We worked very hard to  give them assistance, and they still have not been made whole.   Every time I reached an impasse, I thought about Louisiana and the  work that I had done after Katrina and the visits that I have made  there, the people that I got to know, and what I really have learned to  understand about affordability.   Every time I reached an impasse, I thought about Florida, I thought  about Texas and what has happened recently with these storms.   Having worked in this way and having been a coauthor of Biggert- Waters and having been the author of the Homeowner Flood Insurance  Affordability Act, I think I know something about storms, something  about the devastation that has been caused to families and communities,  and I insist on affordability.   Mr. Speaker, as Democrats and some Republicans have made clear, this  is a comprehensively bad bill that is harmful for families and  businesses. In the wake of one of the most disastrous hurricane seasons  in history, this bill would make flood insurance more expensive, less  available, and less fair for millions of Americans.   I have repeatedly stated that affordability is my top priority, which  is made worse by this bill. Even with the slight revisions that the  chairman has made, coverage would still be less available, and cherry- picking by the private sector would be encouraged, putting the  government on the hook for the riskiest of policies.   It is important to note that the biggest challenge to the National  Flood Insurance Program is its massive debt, which the bill only  addresses by charging hardworking Americans more for their flood  insurance. That is just not fair.   We have comprehensive support for this bill from both the private  sector and from our nonprofits. I don't know about any consumer  organizations that support this bill, but I do know this. I know that I  worked very hard to talk about mitigation and how I thought it could be  a program that the locals could be involved in with the Federal  Government. I know I worked very hard talking about the repetitive  occurrences that the chairman was concerned about, but I also offered  alternatives to what he is advocating.   I talked about outreach and education to them, about a buyout program  that they may join with and accept voluntarily. I know that I tried  everything that I could. I listened to Members from both sides of the  aisle, and I know that we both wanted to have a comprehensive bill that  was bipartisan.   Mr. Speaker, it is unfortunate that we end up with this bad bill. I  ask for a ``no'' vote on this bill, and I yield back the balance of my  time.
