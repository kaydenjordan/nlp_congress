 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize and  congratulate the new California Division 4-AA football champions, the  Soquel High Knights. This is the first team from Santa Cruz County to  win a State football title.   Head Coach Dwight Lowery, a former defensive back for the San Diego  Chargers, took the team over 6 years ago, and ever since he has been  working with these young men day in and day out to get them better and  better in order to dominate the Pacific Coast Athletic League.   This season, though, Soquel only lost two games with their last  defeat on September 22. Since then they went undefeated, extending  their five-game winning streak into the postseason and ultimately into  the championship title at Pasadena City College defeating Jurupa Hills  High School 28-7.   The Knights' superior defense was on full display as well as the  passing game, and all the while 1,000 fans cheered them on.   We on the Central Coast are very proud of the Soquel Knights. As the  United States Representative for California's 19th Congressional  District and as someone who played high school football against Soquel,  I am proud to celebrate the school's victory.   Congratulations. Go Knights.                            ____________________
