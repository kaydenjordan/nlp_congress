 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Maryland for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this legislation. After  passing nearly a $2 trillion tax cut that gives 83 percent of the  benefits to the wealthiest 1 percent, it is both shockingly  hypocritical and morally indefensible to propose a balanced budget  amendment that would force dramatic cuts to the programs that support  America's veterans.   In the wake of the GOP's corporate tax cuts, balancing the budget  every year would likely require cuts to the Veterans Health  Administration, which serves 9 million veterans every year; or cuts to  the GI Bill, which is a key recruiting tool to ensure military  readiness; or cuts to benefits for disabled veterans who are injured in  combat; or cuts to pensions that veterans earn through their service;  or cuts to our national cemeteries, which ensure veterans are laid to  rest with the dignity they deserve.   This legislation would undoubtedly require cuts to Medicaid, which  serves 1.75 million veterans, and it would prevent us from expanding  existing programs like caregiver benefits for veterans of all  generations.   All of this would happen while the wealthiest people in this country  enjoy a tax cut that they did not need.   Mr. Speaker, when it comes to our priorities, veterans belong in the  front of the line and corporations belong at the back.   The majority believes that we can afford a corporate tax cut that  costs $1.3 trillion, yet we cannot afford to extend caregiver benefits  to every veteran, which would only cost $4 billion.   This vote is, indeed, about a country headed toward bankruptcy, but  it is not so much financial bankruptcy as it is moral bankruptcy.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to reject this amendment.  [[Page H3183]]
