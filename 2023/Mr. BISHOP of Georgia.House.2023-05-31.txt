 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3746,  the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023.   This bill is not perfect. Some will say that it is not even good. But  I say it is better than the extortion bill pushed through this House  last month by this Republican majority that would have forced Congress  to either default on paying our nation's bills or make devastating cuts  that would hurt the health, safety, and well-being of the American  people.   This bill prevents a default that would trigger an economic  catastrophe, a global market panic, and a job killing recession.   The most egregious cuts that the Republicans originally proposed last  month in their Default on America Act will be avoided.   Cuts that were originally proposed to the Toxic Exposure Fund created  by the bipartisan PACT Act have been reversed as have the reductions in  veterans' health care and benefits.   I have been very concerned about the cuts to rural development  programs, nutrition for women and children, and funding for  economically distressed farmers which have been reduced.   We must pay our debts and debate issues of spending and revenue  through regular order and not under threat of default.   No, this bill is not perfect. And to many it may not be good. But it  is a better way forward than the chaos and consequences of a first ever  default on the full faith and credit of the United States.
