 Mr. President, earlier this month, the Senate passed by  voice vote the Department of Veterans Affairs Accountability and  Whistleblower Protection Act of 2017. I recognize this bill is the  result of a bipartisan compromise, and I commend Senator Tester,  ranking member of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, for his  efforts to find agreement on this particularly challenging issue.   Everyone in a position of public trust, particularly those serving at  the VA, must be held accountable for their actions. Whistleblowers must  also be protected so that misconduct can be brought to light. This  balance between accountability and transparency is essential to ensure  that the services provided to the public--particularly to veterans--are  of the highest quality and that we can attract the best and brightest  to Federal service.   Unfortunately, while the bill passed by Congress seeks to strike the  appropriate balance, I remain seriously concerned about some of the  bill's provisions which would expedite the process of terminating  employees of the Department of Veterans Affairs, VA, by reducing  current due process protections.   To ensure the integrity of the Federal civil service, it is essential  that Federal employees have access to constitutionally protected due  process rights. Specifically, the bill lowered the evidentiary standard  for firing rank-and-file employees for misconduct from  ``preponderance'' of the evidence, 50 percent or more, to substantial,  30 percent or more. Reducing due process protections for rank-and-file  VA employees in this manner will make it harder for the Federal  Government to attract the best and brightest to public service.   During the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee's consideration of the  bill, I cosponsored an amendment offered by Senator Brown to strike the  section of the bill lowering the evidentiary standard. Unfortunately,  the amendment was not adopted. Going forward, I intend to closely  monitor the VA's implementation of the act to see that these new  authorities are not abused in order to retaliate against VA workers.  Not only would this be unfair, but it would also exacerbate the  Department's challenging retention issues.   I am also disappointed that this bill does not address the  longstanding recruitment and retention issues facing the VA. According  to the VA, there are over 30,000 vacancies across the VA, including  over 150 in Hawaii, for frontline medical personnel that this  administration has not filled as of the end of January 2017.   The over 40,000 veterans in Hawaii who are enrolled in the VA  healthcare system deserve the best healthcare and highest ethical and  professional standards from those they depend on to provide that care.  While we must ensure whistleblowers can come forward without fear of  retaliation and those who violate the pub trust are held accountable,  the VA cannot effectively carry out its mission without being fully  staffed.   While this legislation was supported by VA Secretary Shulkin and  makes some useful changes to improve accountability, we still have much  work to do to ensure that veterans in Hawaii and across the country  have access to the best healthcare we can provide.   Therefore, going forward, I will closely monitor the VA's  implementation of this law to ensure that the changes made are not  abused. I will also continue working to see that the staff vacancies in  Hawaii and across the country are filled with qualified personnel.                            ____________________     Mr. President I join my colleagues, Senator Murray and  others, and I thank Senator Murray for her leadership on this important  issue.   Right now, 13 of our male colleagues are sequestered away somewhere,  plotting--and I use that word, and that is an accurate word because  that is what it feels like to those of us who are shut out of the  process of putting together the Senate bill. These 13 men are plotting  how to deprive millions of women across our country access to essential  healthcare--women all over our country. That is half of our population.  Frankly, it is sad that we are having this debate about the need for  openness and transparency that impacts half of our population and that  is one-sixth of our economy.   Sadly, it isn't surprising. Republicans in Congress have fought to  deny women access to healthcare for decades. Now they have a willing  and complicit ally in this crusade--Donald Trump. In their zeal to  repeal the Affordable Care Act, the President and his allies in  Congress don't appear to be concerned about the collateral damage they  leave behind.   For women, this means facing a return to a time when our gender--our  very gender--was considered a preexisting condition. Before the  Affordable Care Act, insurance companies could discriminate against  women of child-bearing age. They could charge outrageous rates for  birth control and contraceptives. Under the ACA, women have secure  access to care before, during, and after their pregnancies. They can no  longer be charged outrageous rates simply for having a child or be  denied access to mental health services if they suffer from postpartum  depression. Women can now receive free contraceptive care, like birth  control pills and IUDs. But now the President and Republicans in  Congress are determined to drag us backward, all in the name of giving  the richest Americans a huge tax cut.   Let's be really clear on this. The poorest, oldest, and the most sick  people in our country are going to suffer so that the richest people in  our country can get a huge tax cut under this bill. We need to do  everything we can to fight against all these misguided efforts.   Although we haven't seen the likely monstrosity currently being  hatched in secret, we have a pretty good idea of what is going to be in  this bill. In the House version of TrumpCare, States have the ability  to opt out of the Affordable Care Act's essential health benefits,  which include access to birth control, pregnancy, and mental health  coverage.   One Republican Congressman even had the audacity to say he shouldn't  have to subsidize pregnancy care because he can't get pregnant. How the  heck do you think he even arrived on this Earth? I really think this is  outrageous. This is an outrageous statement that speaks for itself.   The bill also makes good on a longstanding Republican promise to  defund Planned Parenthood, regardless of the cost in lives. Over the  past few years, Republicans in Congress have tried everything they  could think of to defund Planned Parenthood--passing stand-alone bills,  attaching poison pills to must-pass bills, threatening a government  shutdown, and passing TrumpCare in the House. In March, the majority  leader held the floor open for over an hour to allow the Vice President  time to travel to the Capitol to break a tie to repeal a regulation on  title X funding meant to preserve access to Federal family planning  services.   I understand that many of my friends on the other side of the aisle  have strong feelings about abortion, but I have never been able to  understand how this translates into attacking an organization that uses  no Federal funds to provide abortions. In fact, Planned Parenthood uses  its Federal funding to provide low-cost healthcare to the people in our  country who need it most but who can't afford it.   In 2014 alone, Planned Parenthood provided over 600,000 cancer  screenings  [[Page S3692]]  and over 4 million tests and treatments for sexually transmitted  infections. These are real facts, not alternative facts.   I have heard from hundreds of my constituents over the past 6 months  about how important Planned Parenthood is to them, and I would like to  share a few of their stories.   Tiffany from Honolulu made her first visit to Planned Parenthood when  she was 21, under unexpected circumstances during a pregnancy scare.  She felt that having a child at that time in her life would be  extremely difficult and would have negatively impacted her ability to  finish school. During her visit to the clinic, Tiffany took a pregnancy  test and discovered she wasn't pregnant. Her caregivers were then able  to counsel Tiffany about her sexual health without judgment. They  walked her through the different options she had and administered an  STD test. She left the clinic with a prescription for birth control.   Kim, a young attorney from my State, recently wrote to my office to  tell her story about turning to Planned Parenthood when she faced an  unexpected pregnancy. After having a safe and open conversation with  the staff at her local Planned Parenthood, Kim decided she was not  ready to have a baby and ended her pregnancy. Planned Parenthood gave  her the space and opportunity to make the best decision for her. As she  recounted to us, ``You don't have to like someone's choice, but you  don't get to take away their freedom to make it.''   The fight against TrumpCare continues, but I am going to do  everything I can to protect women's health and their right to control  their bodies--to control our bodies.   I urge my colleagues to oppose any measure in TrumpCare that takes  women back to the days when our very gender was considered a  preexisting condition.   I yield the floor.
