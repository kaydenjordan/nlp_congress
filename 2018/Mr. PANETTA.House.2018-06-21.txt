 Mr. Speaker, I cannot support H.R. 4760, and I cannot  support this rule, obviously, for a number of reasons that we heard  here today, but I would like to highlight two.   This bill does not provide the DACA fix that our Dreamers deserve.  Personally, I have nearly 20,000 Dreamers in my district in California.  I have met with many of them numerous times at their work and at their  jobs. Although they were brought here through no fault of their own,  these kids want to stay here; they want to live here; and, most  important, they want to contribute here.   They don't want this given to them. They are willing to earn it.  Unfortunately, this bill does not give them that chance. And that is  why I cannot support it.   Also, in my district, we lay claim to being the salad bowl of the  world. Our agriculture industry is due to our farmworkers. Now, I  appreciate that this bill addresses ag labor, and the added amendments  have tried to make it better, but it is just not enough.   This bill hurts our communities. Why? Because our ag workers are not  just an important part of our ag industry, they are an integral part to  our communities. Some of these people have been here 5, 10, 15, 20  years. They have spouses; they have kids; and they have families.    Mr. Speaker, because of the important role that they  will play, and because of the lack of any information on what this can  do for these ag workers, I am against the resolution.
