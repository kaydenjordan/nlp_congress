 Madam Speaker, I rise today to remember the  life of Mr. David Sovchen, who passed away on January 25, his 72nd  birthday.   Mr. Sovchen had an enormous impact in Savannah throughout his life.   In 1985, he joined the Wendy's senior management team, which led him  to our community, where he owned nearly a dozen restaurants.   Outside of his exceptional management skills, he was dedicated to  growing the arts in coastal Georgia. To that end, Mr. Sovchen worked  with the Savannah Book Festival to provide office space and find  critical funding opportunities. Now, the Savannah Book Festival is in  its 10th year and has brought a total of over 400 authors to our area.   In addition to the book festival, Mr. Sovchen volunteered with the  Boy Scouts, the Salvation Army, Savannah Technical College, and the  Chamber of Commerce.   I am deeply thankful for all of this work, which has made Savannah a  better place to live. Mr. Sovchen's family and friends will be in my  thoughts and prayers during this difficult time                            ____________________
