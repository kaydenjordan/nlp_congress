 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate Indigenous  Peoples' Heritage Month and the enduring contributions made by the  Acjachemen and Tongva people to our community. In Orange County, we are  dedicated to supporting our indigenous neighbors, as they reclaim their  history.   For generations, indigenous groups have fought against the pressure  to assimilate. They have retained a strong connection with their  cultures even when the Federal Government has failed to support them.  Indigenous Peoples' Heritage Month is a celebration of their  resilience.   We owe these communities recognition. In the past, I have held  roundtables with Tribal leaders and chaired hearings to better  understand how our current systems leave Native people behind.   I am proud to represent indigenous populations, to lift up their  stories, and to celebrate how their perspectives make our communities  stronger. I will continue to be a partner with indigenous leaders and  will fight to get their communities the help that they need.                           Standing Up for Veterans     Mr. Speaker, elected officials have a duty to stand up  for veterans. I rise today not only to honor their sacrifices with my  words but to reiterate a call for meaningful action.   Nearly 100,000 veterans call Orange County, California, home. They  embody the resilience of our Nation. Yet, when they come home, they  face institutions that systematically fail them. For those who have  fought for our country, we must take care of them and their families.  We must deliver the benefits that they are owed. We must address their  invisible wounds by making it easier for them to get mental health  care.   In Congress, I have proudly worked on improving military families'  housing, strengthening the Veterans Crisis Line, and getting Orange  County veterans answers and care from the VA.   On Veterans Day, we thank our troops for their service, and we  recommit ourselves to getting them the help that they need.                           Student Loan Forgiveness     Mr. Speaker, student debt holds back our entire economy  and hurts all of us. Americans today, young and old, cannot start  businesses or save for retirement because they are burdened by student  loans.   I am glad the Biden-Harris administration is doing what it can to  forgive student debt despite roadblocks from a corrupt Supreme Court.  The administration's actions will extend relief to 125,000 Americans  who can participate better in our economy, totaling $9 billion that  will go back into our communities.   In the long term, we must have a comprehensive plan to prevent  another student debt crisis from happening as we fix the current one. I  founded the College Affordability Caucus to address these problems.   Debt-free higher education is one of the best investments that we can  make to improve the lives of young people and strengthen our Nation's  workforce for decades to come.                        Standing Up for Trans Students     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight how anti- transgender campus policies hurt students' well-being.   In September, the Orange Unified School District became the sixth  school district in California to adopt a forced outing policy. As young  people are growing up, these harmful mandates expose students for  something as simple as going by a different name  [[Page H5476]]  without considering whether they are safe at home.   More than half of transgender youth contemplate suicide due to a lack  of support from their family or community. Schools should be places  where students can focus on learning, free from fear.   As a single mom of three, I rely on public schools to help my kids  mature into thoughtful and confident citizens, and I oppose misguided  policies that endanger LGBTQ+ Americans.   I urge all California schools to stand up for trans students and  protect the safety of queer youth.                            ____________________
