 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the  life of Bud Stack, a decorated military veteran, loving father, and  servant to his community.   A native of North Carolina, Bud joined the U.S. Navy, where he became  a career pilot and officer and graduated from George Washington  University. He served in Vietnam as an A-6 pilot based on an aircraft  carrier and received many military honors for his service.   After retiring from the U.S. Navy, he worked with Grumman  Aeronautics, Saudi Arabia Civil Air Safety, and later returned to  Savannah with Gulfstream and FlightSafety International.   Always dedicated to his family, Bud made frequent trips to Brazil,  where his sons lived and grew up.   Bud shared his love for Christ with stints in the nursery and as a  Sunday school teacher at Bull Street Baptist Church. He also assisted  in the college ministry, as well as ministering through meals to the  elderly. He participated in several mission trips, with one to Israel  being particularly special.   My thoughts and prayers are with his family and friends. Bud will be  dearly missed by all who knew him.                            ____________________
