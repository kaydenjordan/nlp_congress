 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so  ordered.                    Veterans Improved Access and Care Act     Mr. President, when we were kids, we learned a song that  I think Herman's Hermits made very famous around 1965. It was the ``I'm  Henry VIII, I Am'' song, and it went on for a while about Henry VIII,  and then it had a little phrase in there that as kids we would repeat.  We would say: ``Henry VIII, I am. I'm Henry VIII, I am. Second verse,  same as the first,'' and then they would repeat themselves: ``Second  verse, same as the first,'' and they would keep going. Well, today, we  find ourselves kind of stuck in that ``Second verse, same as the  first'' when it comes to the Veterans Affairs Department and how they  have treated veterans in Colorado.   I rise, once again, to address troubling reports coming out of the  Veterans' Administration. It has now been over 3 years since the  Phoenix VA catastrophe--we all remember the Phoenix VA catastrophe,  where secret wait lists led to the deaths of veterans. At that time,  the VA pledged this problem would be fixed, but here we are ``Second  verse, same as the first.'' They said it would never happen again.  Well, it saddens me today that in Denver, CO, that promise has been  broken.   Following the Phoenix disaster, this body passed the Veterans Access,  Choice, and Accountability Act, also known as the VA Choice Act, to  expand access for veterans to community medical providers. No doubt, it  has been successful in different parts of the country, but the Denver  VA system continues to post inexcusable wait times, experience a  shortage of doctors and nurses, and use secret wait lists. This is  simply unacceptable.   The average wait time for a new patient at the Denver VA for a  primary care appointment has topped 42 days. This leads the Nation in  an unfortunate category, and it is twice the national average. Our  veterans deserve better, and to many who have been affected by this  travesty, they demand better.   Last week, NBC Nightly News told the story of one Colorado veteran,  Alison Bush. Alison served in the Army for 7 years and suffers from a  nerve disorder. With such a disorder, she cannot afford delayed  appointments. Yet Alison was forced to wait over 3 months for a primary  care appointment and another 60 days for an MRI. There is absolutely no  excuse for this, particularly given the work we have done and the  promises the VA has made. Alison, like so many others, answered the  call of duty, only to be let down after retiring the uniform.   I recognize that Colorado was witnessing an increase in demand with  more than 11,000 veterans seeking care in the last 2 years, but this is  no excuse. The VA must adapt in the face of adversity. We must change  this repeat after repeat of the same verse, and we must never forget  that this Nation's No. 1 priority is upholding the promises we have  made to our veterans.   Because of stories like Alison's, I recently introduced S. 2168, the  Veterans Improved Access and Care Act of 2017. My legislation would  address three issues: hiring shortages, delayed wait times, and  malpractice reporting.   A large driver of delayed wait times for veterans is the shortage of  doctors and nurses. The current system for hiring these medical  professionals is too long and too burdensome. According to a McKinsey &  Company study in 2015, it took 4 to 8 months to hire VA employees. The  onboarding process alone can take 3 months. According to the  [[Page S229]]  same study, private medical facilities took less than 2 months to hire  an applicant. Just think about that for a moment. Just like in the VA,  a private applicant has to go through an interview process, a  certification process, credentials process, background check. Yet the  VA's onboarding process is longer than the private sector's entire  hiring process. It makes absolutely no sense.   My legislation would take steps to fix this problem. It would  authorize the VA to establish a pilot program to expedite the hiring of  doctors at facilities where there are shortages of available  specialists, such as nurses or anesthesiologists. Furthermore, it would  require the Secretary of the VA to submit a report to Congress  detailing a strategy to reduce the length of the VA's hiring process by  half.    My bill would also look to expand access to our veterans. The VA  Choice Program, while well-intentioned, still contains arbitrary rules,  such as a 30-day waiting period before a veteran can seek access to  community providers. Well, 29 days is also unacceptable. My legislation  would work to improve the Choice Act by eliminating the 30-day/40-mile  eligibility rule, giving veterans full access to medical care  regardless of his or her situation.   Finally, my legislation will work to ensure that secret wait lists  are forever extinguished. No more ``second verse same as the first.''   Last November, a Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Inspector  General report substantiated the claim that the Eastern Colorado Health  Care System used unofficial wait lists for veterans, estimating that at  least 3,775 veterans were affected. This is extremely disheartening.  There needs to be accountability for this malpractice. My legislation  would do just that. It would codify the VA's policy to expand the  requirements of reporting malpractice to include all medical providers.   Our veterans have served our country. They have missed holidays with  their families to protect our Nation. They have suffered battlefield  injuries. They have laid it all on the line for you and for me. The  Presiding Officer is a veteran of this great country. The least we can  do is ensure that our veterans are treated with the dignity, respect,  and honor they have rightfully earned.   It is my hope that the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee will soon  take up my bill so that we can work to ensure accountability and  greater access to care for all veterans. But whether it is my  legislation or any piece of legislation, one thing is for sure:  Something has to be done--not tomorrow, not next week, but now. The  current system is not working, and it continues to let our veterans  down. Nevertheless, we must remain optimistic and deliver on the  promises we gave our men and women in uniform. I am optimistic that we  can make this right on their behalf. We can't wait. Time is a luxury  our veterans do not have.   I ask that everyone in this body--and especially the VA--always  remember the stories of veterans like Alison Bush. May we never forget  those who set aside their own dreams to make sure they save the dreams  of their fellow Americans. Our veterans honorably served this great  Nation. Now is the time that we step up and honorably serve them.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Toomey). The Senator from Tennessee.
