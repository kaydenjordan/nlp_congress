 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                            ____________________     Mr. President, every week, I have been coming to the  floor to talk about the wonderful people in my State. A lot of people  have visited Alaska. If you haven't and you are watching on TV, we  really, really want to welcome you to come. It will be the trip of a  lifetime; I guarantee it.   What we like to do when we talk about our Alaskan of the Week is talk  about someone who has made a real impact, someone who doesn't get a lot  of attention, someone who has made an impact on his community or  country, and let people know we are thinking about them, let people  know we are proud of them. Before recess, I want to do that for a  couple of Alaskans today, and I would like to start by talking about a  gentleman who has gotten a little press lately in Alaska, but I want  the country to hear about it. It is really a remarkable story--Mr. Mark  Braudis.   Let me tell you a little bit about Mark. Mark came to my attention  through a recent column by Charles Wohlforth in the Alaska Dispatch  News.   Mark is originally from Pennsylvania. When he was just 17 years old,  he joined the Navy, like a lot of Alaskans. We have more vets per  capita than any State in the country. He was deployed in 1972.   Mark said:         When I was in high school, everyone had long hair and were       anti-government. That's not the way I was. I was for God and       country. If my brothers were over there in Vietnam, I wanted       to stand with them.    So he went. When a lot of people were avoiding service, he went.   When Mark got out, he couldn't find a job, so he began to hitchhike  across the country into Canada and other places, and he wound up in the  magical place we call Alaska. Mark arrived in 1976. After leaving once  and coming back, he got a job as a taxi driver--a good job. He met and  fell in love with one of his passengers, a beautiful woman named Helen.  They went on to have seven children--Stephen, David, Kelly, Jared,  Michael, and Jenny. Helen was a great mother.   Then, unfortunately, as sometimes happens in families in certain  circumstances, tragedy struck their family. In 2007, Helen was walking  down a busy road and was hit and unfortunately killed by a car passing  by.   Faced with unspeakable grief, Mark knew he couldn't fall apart. He  had seven kids between the ages of 6 and 16, and he had to take care of  them. One of them was in third grade at the time and couldn't stop  crying over the loss of his mom. The school called often, and Mark-- still a taxi driver--left work to pick him up. The hours of tending to  his kids began to rack up. He couldn't pay the rent. His kids and he  had to eventually live in a homeless shelter.   A social worker wanted to put the kids up for adoption, but Mark  refused. They had lost their mother, they had lost their home, and they  weren't going to lose their dad. The family needed him, and they were a  team.   Eventually--and this is so great; it happens all across Alaska, all  across America--with the help of the community, in this case, their  local Catholic church, Saint Anthony's Parish, Mark was able to afford  rent for a three-bedroom apartment with one bathroom where they still  live today and to buy his own taxi license.   In the face of adversity, he raised his kids to be strong, proud,  caring, responsible, and to do the right thing. They stuck together.  They ran together, sometimes as many as 6 miles a day--the Navy veteran  out with his children. They studied together. They were good kids. They  didn't miss school or the bus. They never got in trouble. They were a  team.   This is what is remarkable about this family: Six out of the seven  Braudis children, whom I have been speaking about, have joined the  Marines Corps. They have taken after their dad, serving their country-- six out of seven. How many families in America can say that? The  seventh couldn't because of a medical issue, and he is nearly finished  with a degree in electrical engineering from the University of Alaska  in Anchorage and tutors students in math at the university.   The youngest one, Jenny, a senior in high school, has already been  sworn in to the Marines. She wants to drive tanks. The middle child,  Jared, is the only one who joined the infantry. When they all get  together, he kids them, telling them he is the tough one, but I am sure  they are all tough. Jared said:         When we were growing up, my dad just made things right. He       still does.    What did Mark learn from these challenges? He said:         When you're married, you become one. And when my wife       passed away, she brought me to God with her. And then I       brought my children to God. I didn't understand it then, but       I do now. It's been one miracle after another.        Also, what I learned? I'm a dad above everything else.    Well, Mark, thank you. Thanks to you, your children, and your family  for this amazing example and for doing such a great job of raising your  kids. You are a model for all of us. Thank you for being our Alaskan of  the Week.                            ____________________     Mr. President, as I mentioned earlier, I come to the  floor every week to talk about my great State and to talk about the  people of my great State--the people who make it a better place for all  of us. We call these people the Alaskan of the Week. It is one of the  most fulfilling parts of my job to come here and talk about people who  make a difference, people who don't get a lot of press, people who  don't get a lot of attention, but people who are doing the right thing  for their country and for their community.   Right now in Alaska, we have tourists, people coming from all over,  and one of the things happening in Alaska is salmon season. The biggest  runs in the world--the bounty of our great State--are happening right  now, and the fish are running. If you or anyone listening has ever had  the opportunity to catch or eat wild Alaskan salmon, of course, it is  the memory of a lifetime. There is nothing better; there is no better  fish in the world.   There is great salmon fishing all across Alaska, but one of the most  heavily fished areas in Alaska and the  [[Page S4796]]  world is on Alaska's Kenai Peninsula, about 45 minutes from Anchorage.  Millions of salmon run up the rivers of the Kenai, drawing tens of  thousands of Alaska sports, personal use, and commercial fishermen, as  well as visitors from all over the country, all over the world to fish  the amazing Kenai River.   The area can continue to support a lot of traffic, but when you have  that many people on the Kenai, sometimes it does cause congestion. So  let me talk about someone who works on these issues for Alaska--Kathy  Heindl.   Kathy is an engineer with Homer Electric Association on the Kenai.  Ten years ago, she visited Alaska as a tourist. She saw the Northern  Lights dancing in the winter, the snow-covered mountains, and she knew  she was home. She loves the Kenai. There is a sense of freedom there  and all across Alaska. It is a place where there is room to pave your  own path but support others and the community around you, and, of  course, there are the salmon.   Since Kathy moved to Alaska, she has been working to give back to the  community that she loves so much. She is an active member and past  president of her local Rotary Club. She is a member of the Kenai  Peninsula Borough Community Emergency Response Team. She is also a  member of a group that operates ham radios in order to help if there is  a disaster and shuts down cell service or other communication devices.   During the summer, right now, she spends much of her free time as a  Kenai Peninsula Stream Watch volunteer with the Kenai Watershed Forum,  helping to make sure that she will have a sustainable fishery--that we  will have a sustainable fishery in the Kenai and throughout the State  for generations to come. A few times a week, for as many as 6 hours at  a time, she roams the fishing spots, picking up trash, helping others,  speaking with anglers. She talks to them about how to protect  themselves. She carries around safety goggles--you never want a hook in  the eye. She talks about what happens when you run into a bear, which  happens a lot in our great State, and the best way to avoid them, and  importantly, she educates anglers on how to protect the vegetated banks  on this great river to maintain the health of the river and the amazing  salmon in it.   The vast majority of the people in Alaska and from out of State who  fish the Kenai are responsible and want to help in any way they can,  and they love Kathy's help, but, still, all the activity in the area  has created erosion problems, which has the potential to hurt the fish.   The Kachemak Heritage Land Trust, a land stewardship and conservation  trust based in Homer, recently recognized Kathy's efforts and presented  her with the King Maker Award. ``It is your selfless actions that help  protect the vital habitat needed for salmon to live and thrive,'' the  land trust wrote to her. ``Great role models such as yourself can  inspire others in our communities to take action by following your  lead'' and your example.   Mr. President, I want to congratulate Kathy for all the work she is  doing, especially in this busy summer in Alaska, and for being our  Alaskan of the Week.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Perdue). The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.   Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                            ____________________
