 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak to all of  our Federal employees.   Thank you for the dignity you have shown during the last 4 years. For  every Alexander Vindman who was forced into the public spotlight, there  are thousands more quiet patriots behind him, and we are grateful. But  we also need your help.   Congress is still waiting to receive thousands of documents from the  Trump administration. Multiple White House officials have been  communicating through undocumented, nonofficial channels. Many more are  still blocking the release of information that directly pertains to  their work for the United States Government, and that is illegal.   Why this administration is afraid of transparency is tomorrow's  question. But today, every Federal agency must preserve those  documents. The Presidential Records Act of 1978 and the Federal Records  Act of 1950 exist to ensure that no President enters office with our  adversaries knowing more about the prior 4 years than they do.   We need your vigilance over the next 61 days to ensure those laws are  honored.   When elected officials failed us, we could still count on you. Now,  once more into the breach, dear friends, once more.                            ____________________
