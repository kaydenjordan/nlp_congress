 Madam Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the 77th  anniversary of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan's Independence Day.   America and Jordan have a long history of friendship and cooperation  after establishing diplomatic relations in 1949. Jordan plays a vital  role in advancing peace, stability, and moderation in the Middle East.   I recently visited Jordan. In fact, I had the honor of being flown by  Jordan's first-ever female helicopter pilot. On that same visit, King  Abdullah graciously hosted our delegation and took us to the holy site  where Jesus was baptized on the east bank of the Jordan River.   Jordan is a shining example of tolerance, with traditions of  hospitality between all religions. This visit was especially moving,  and it was an experience I will remember for the rest of my life.   It is especially meaningful to me personally as I married into a  Jordanian-American family, the Nesheiwats, who immigrated to America  from their ancestral home of Salt through Ellis Island.   We look forward to returning to Jordan soon to baptize our newborn  son, Arman.   I wish King Abdullah and the Jordanian people a happy Independence  Day, and I remain committed to supporting the friendship and  partnership between our two countries.                            ____________________
