 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the Born-Alive  Abortion Survivors Protection Act.   This should not be a controversial vote. This bill should pass  unanimously.   If a little girl is born alive, she should be protected. It is that  simple.   Everyone in this House, everyone hearing my voice, was at a point of  just having been born, and all of us had a right to live at that point,  whether we were wanted or not.   I wonder what the great pro-life Democrats of yesterday would think  of what we are hearing from the other side today, pro-life leaders like  Eunice Kennedy Shriver; Sargent Shriver; Thomas Eagleton; and, of  course, the late great Governor Casey of Pennsylvania. Their rhetoric  reminds me of what Governor Casey said 25 years ago:         It is a bitter irony that abortion has found a home within       the Democratic Party, which claims to be a champion of the       poor, despite the fact that the interests of the poor are in       direct conflict with the interests and the agenda of the       abortion industry.    Madam Speaker, this is a simple bill. Please vote for humanity.  Please vote for this bill.
