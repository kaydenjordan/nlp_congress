 Madam Speaker, today, I rise to honor the 125th  anniversary of the Indiana Veterans' Home.   It was established in Tippecanoe County in 1895, and the Indiana  Veterans' Home initially served as a facility to care for the disabled  Union soldiers after the Civil War.  [[Page H2802]]    By 1910, the home served over 1,400 residents and offered its own  hospital, bakery, and electric light plant.   Over a century later, the Indiana Veterans' Home continues to operate  as a full-service facility offering a multitude of medical and support  services for its residents.   It is also home to a small museum of historical artifacts, and serves  as the final resting place for nearly 3,000 veterans and their spouses.   Indiana has a proud tradition of honoring its veterans, and the  Indiana Veterans' Home is a shining example of Hoosiers' commitment to  the care of those who have served.   I congratulate those at the Indiana Veterans' Home on their 125th  anniversary, and I offer my sincere gratitude for their continued  service to Hoosier veterans and their families.                            ____________________
