 Mr. Speaker, young men and women enlisting in our  military for the first time will enter recruitment offices across our  country this year.   On their IDs will be birth dates that reflect the fact that they are  signing up to fight in wars that started before they were born.   Nineteen years. That is how long we have been in Afghanistan.  Seventeen years. That is how long we have been in Iraq. Not to mention  the American weapons, the American dollars, the American boots, the  American lives that have been sent to Yemen, Syria, Somalia, and many,  many other corners of our globe.                                time  1030    We are a generation that has spent the better part of its life at war  in a country in the Middle East, perpetual wars fought under the cover  of two permission slips that this body gave the executive branch nearly  20 years ago.   In 2001, Congress authorized our offensive against al-Qaida and the  Taliban in the wake of 9/11 in what became the largest armed conflict  in American history. In 2002, Congress authorized the invasion of Iraq,  and it became the greatest foreign policy mistake of a generation.   And our response has been silence, silence from this collective body;  silence as we have sent hundreds of thousands of American men and women  to Afghanistan and tens of thousands more to Iraq; silence as three  administrations, Democratic and Republican, have used these two  authorizations to expand, to evolve, to justify, and to prolong our  presence in a volatile and violent region; and silence as our role has  become less clear and our mission less certain.   What we have lost in this silence is hard to quantify--the lives that  could have been spared, the families we could have protected, the money  we could have used to do good, and the credibility we could have saved  if we had summoned the collective courage to tear up those permission  slips.   The vote today on the War Powers Resolution to restrict the current  administration's actions against Iran is an important one. It is a  necessary response to a reckless President without a plan. But it is  not enough because, yesterday, this administration told us that the  legal authority to launch a strike targeting Iran 6 days ago was  granted based on the authority that this body allowed to invade Iraq 18  years ago, using a deceased dictator to justify a potential war against  an entirely different adversary, making a mockery of matters of war and  peace.   So now, facing the threat of war with a different yet brutal regime,  this body must finally act to cut off any avenue that this President or  any other President has to enter our people into a war that we do not  want because this isn't just about the actions of a current  administration. It is about the precedent that we set from this day  forward.   We must pass a War Powers Resolution today. We must repeal the 2001  and 2002 Authorization for Use of Military Force. We must compel the  executive branch to come to Congress and make the case that any  military action that is required to protect American lives is in our  best interests and justified.   And we in Congress must be prepared to take some tough votes because  that is our job. It is the very least that we owe our men and women in  uniform putting their lives on the line so the rest of us might sleep  safe and free.                            ____________________
