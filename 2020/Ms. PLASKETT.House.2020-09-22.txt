 Madam Speaker, while Senator McConnell works fervently  to confirm a Supreme Court Justice, he continues to block the relief  that Americans need, holding a failed vote on a bill that refuses to  crush the virus, abandons our heroes in State and local government,  ignores families facing hunger and homelessness, and contains poison  pills that Democrats cannot support.   As families suffer, Republicans continue to refuse to acknowledge the  funding levels that experts, scientists, and the American people know  is needed. They reject robust support for State, local, Tribal and  territorial governments. They want to bully many schools into reopening  before it is safe to do so, endangering children, educators, and  creating new vectors for the virus to spread.   Republicans are ignoring the crisis of food insecurity, providing  zero funds for nutrition assistance, and insufficient funds to our  farmers.   Originally, our side, the Democrats, were willing to compromise and  cut a trillion from the HEROES Act if the White House would add a  trillion to the failed and anemic Senate bill. We wanted to negotiate  and meet in the middle at $2.2 trillion. Yet, Senate Republicans and  the White House continue to reject a compromise, and instead, the  Senate GOP continues to move further away from what is needed.   While Republicans fail to take the catastrophe facing families  seriously, our health and economy are crumbling. Republicans are  supporting the investor class while Democrats are fighting for the  working class.                            ____________________
