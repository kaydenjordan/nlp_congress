 Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk.    Mr. Speaker, I am opposed to it in its present form.    Mr. Speaker, this is the final amendment to the bill,  which will not kill the bill or send it back to committee. If adopted,  the bill will immediately proceed to final passage, as amended.   Mr. Speaker, this motion to recommit is simple and should be able to  garner the support of every Member of this body who seeks to enhance  our robust public and private markets while, at the same time, ensuring  there are adequate safeguards in place for the benefit of Main Street  investors.   Specifically, this motion will accomplish two simple things: one, it  will strike the increase in the offering limit to $75 million; and,  two, it will require the SEC to review and revise their bad actor  disqualification regulations prior to future increases in the offering  threshold.   Unfortunately, as currently written, with all due respect to my  Republican colleagues, raising the offering threshold is a solution in  search of a problem. Congress designated the SEC with regulating the  offering. Congress decided the SEC would administer the offering. The  SEC is the expert on Regulation A+, and it should be the one to raise  the offering threshold, assuming the data supports such an increase.   Under the law, the SEC will be reporting to Congress whether or not  they will raise the threshold just next month. This bill is premature,  and for the lawyers in the room, it is not ripe for review. So why  wouldn't we wait?   Right now there is zero data to suggest Congress needs to raise the  threshold, and it seems prudent to wait until next month to see what  the SEC has to say before rushing to increase it.   The majority argues this bill will allow companies to raise more  money. I say this bill is a solution in search of a problem because  only less than a handful of companies have ever actually raised the  current maximum amount of $50 million.   With regard to updating the bad actor disqualification regulation,  Bloomberg recently published an article on Regulation A+ and the  companies using the offering and found one executive of a company was  convicted for filing false tax returns, another for obstructing  justice, and another was accused of selling unregistered stock. For the  sake of time, these are just a few examples. Are these really the types  of individuals we want selling securities to Main Street mom-and-pop  investors?   Another article, appearing in Barron's, studied the hundreds of  companies that have used Regulation A+ to raise funds, and I quote  them: ``We were supposed to get new jobs and new industries. Instead,  we've gotten GoFundMe-style websites hawking penny stocks and  professional wrestlers shilling shares on TV.''   They went on to highlight some of the companies and the products  availing themselves of the lightly regulated Regulation A+ offering,  which included companies trying to make cannabis paraphernalia, flying  cars, guns, and my personal favorite, the founder of a rock band  seeking to raise money to study UFOs and light-speed travel.   Now, I am not trying to persuade Members that all companies seeking  to raise money through Regulation A+ are Wolf of Wall Street or UFO  chasers, because back in my home district, a Scottish-based company  successfully used Regulation A+ to open their first brewery and  restaurant in the United States. That example is exactly what Congress  had in mind when it called for the creation of Regulation A+, and it is  precisely the type of opportunity for investors that the law was  intended to create.                                time  1515    This is why we need to ensure that we maintain the integrity of the  Regulation A+ offering and that we prevent bad actors from using it in  a way to rip off and scam all of our constituents.   That is why I urge Congress to adopt this motion, to stand up for  strong public and private markets, to wait the 30 days when the SEC can  come back to us, and to stand up for strong protections for Main Street  investors.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
