 Madam Speaker, today I rise in opposition to H.R. 4447,  the Clean Economy Jobs and Innovation Act.   My reason for this is like many of my Republican colleagues, it has a  misguided focus on applied energy, and almost no focus or attention to  basic research.   The area I am concerned about is the lack of attention on biological  and environmental research, BER.   Just a few weeks ago, the Science Committee held a hearing on the  Department of Energy's BER office. We heard how their world-class user  facilities and bioenergy research centers bring together researchers  and data for open collaboration, not seen anywhere else in the world.   Ranking Member Lucas' bill, H.R. 5685, the Securing American  Leadership in Science and Technology Act,  [[Page H4877]]  authorizes these user facilities and bioenergy research centers, along  with a host of other basic research provisions.   My point is: That there are productive alternatives that have the  right focus and are ready to be passed, instead of this partisan  package in front of us today.
