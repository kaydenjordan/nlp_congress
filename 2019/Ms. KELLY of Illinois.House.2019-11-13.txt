 Madam Speaker, I rise today to celebrate Sigma  Gamma Rho Sorority's Founders' Day.   Founded November 12, 1922, Sigma Gamma Rho has been empowering women  to give greater service to their communities and help bring about  greater progress in our society for nearly 100 years.   We were first established at Butler University in Indianapolis by  seven illustrious founders, all educators. Today, we boast more than  100,000 members from more than 500 chapters across the United States,  Canada, Bermuda, the Bahamas, Korea, and Dubai.   Throughout our history, we have undertaken work on many causes,  including Act Against AIDS; Operation BigBookBag; the March of Dimes;  St. Jude; and Swim 1922, a partnership with USA Swimming to increase  diversity and inclusion in the sport while reducing drownings in our  community.   I am proud to be the third Sigma Gamma Rho elected to Congress,  alongside Congresswomen Lindy Boggs and Corrine Brown.   Our membership also includes Alice Dunnigan, the first Black female  journalist accredited to cover the White House and Congress; and Mary  T. Washington, the first Black female CPA.   I want to give a special shout-out to our International Grand  Basileus, Deborah Catchings-Smith.   Happy Founders' Day, sorors. Greater service, greater progress.                            ____________________
