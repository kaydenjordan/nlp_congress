 Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member for yielding.   I rise today to speak against H.R. 2543. This bill does not address  the underlying causes restricting access to credit or inflation that  has eroded many Americans' borrowing power. It is just a mixed bag of  extra mandates on the Federal Reserve and new regulatory burdens on  small businesses.   I don't hear my small businesses asking for more regulation,  additional compliance burdens, or the imposition of a sweeping social  agenda.   Families are struggling to afford food and gas. Small businesses are  struggling to hire employees, and my local banks and credit unions are  feeling the pinch of inflation and rising interest rates every day.   If the majority was serious about helping Americans, they would have  made my amendments in order to examine the effects of inflation and  bank consolidation on access to credit for those in low-income census  tracts, rural counties, racial minorities, women, and veterans, the  very communities that Democrat policies have hurt the most. My  amendments would have been a step in the right direction, but the  Democrat majority blocked them.   Mr. Speaker, digging the hole deeper is no way to get out of the  crisis the Democrat administration and Democrat majorities in Congress  have created.
