 Madam Speaker, over the past several weeks, I have  joined Leader McCarthy and House Homeland Security Committee  Republicans on two separate trips to our southern border. What I saw on  the ground is heartbreaking: countless unaccompanied minors, often very  young girls, left at the hands of international cartels, many of them  violated; migrants packed into cramped processing facilities; and  seizures of illicit narcotics being trafficked into the United States.    Unfortunately, the Biden-Harris White House has drastically shifted  from the previous administration's policies on immigration and border  security through executive order. At no point during the crafting of  these executive orders were congressional Republicans consulted, nor  have Republicans had a proper venue for input on plans from the White  House. The result? Day by day, the crisis along our southern border is  getting worse.   It has been a month since President Biden named our Vice President,  Kamala Harris, as the border czar. What have we seen so far? Zero media  appearances about the border, no press conferences, no trips to the  border, radio silence for the Vice President.   She said she is going to the Northern Triangle to meet with  Guatemalans and Hondurans. She doesn't need to. She can come to the  southern border and talk directly to Guatemalans and Hondurans, and  migrants from many other countries, while they are illegally crossing  the border.   While she is at it, Vice President Harris should speak with Customs  and Border Protection agents who are on the ground handling the  situation instead of Federal bureaucrats sitting in their offices in  Washington.   As an immigrant, I call on Vice President Harris to do her job and  fix this crisis.
