 Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the remarks from the gentlewoman  from the Virgin Islands.   My question that I have for this body as we sit here today is: Why  aren't we amending the legislation? Why aren't we offering and allowing  amendments in this great body, in the people's House? A general  question.   When I go home, and I assume you all have the same thing, they say:  What's wrong with Washington? Why don't you actually sit down around a  table and try to solve problems?   I think this is one of the things that is most perplexing, and we see  it in the Senate as well, the so-called greatest deliberative body.  Yet, we saw what happened in the Senate, where there was an offer for  20 amendments, a manager's amendment from the gentleman from South  Carolina, Senator Scott, and that offer was rejected.   Here, we are not even really having an opportunity to offer an  amendment, have a serious debate. I don't question at all the motives  that are behind my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, in terms  of putting forward legislation to try to address a problem we all  perceive as a problem we want to address.   I look at the bill that we have here; it is a Republican bill. There  is a lot of overlap. There are some policies in it that are in  agreement. I just don't understand why we can't start with some nucleus  of a bill and offer 20 or 30 amendments, vote on the amendments as a  deliberative body, the United States Congress, the people's House.    Why can't we just offer amendments and vote on them? Then, wherever  the amendments take us, at the end of that, vote on a bill. That used  to happen.   I was a staffer in the Senate, and we had 50 amendments on different  bills. My staff today, they look at that as some sort of relic of  history, as this thing that we used to do because we don't do it  anymore. I literally don't understand it.   It is a question on both sides of the aisle, why we do not sit down  and offer legislation and go through it. Start  [[Page H2476]]  with a nucleus and then amend it. We have things here we agree on.   On issues such as qualified immunity, issues such as no-knock  warrants, issues that involve asset forfeiture, issues that go to the  heart of liberty and the heart of the ability of an individual American  not to be overwhelmed by law enforcement, there is agreement, but we  would like to have conversations about those issues. There is.   My friend from Michigan, now an independent, offered legislation  about qualified immunity. I don't agree with it.                                time  1700    I don't agree with a full abolition of qualified immunity. I don't.  My grandfather is a chief of police. I know we have all got law  enforcement in our communities, and we are worried about what that will  do to our law enforcement.   We are seeing it right now. We have 104 shootings in Chicago. We had  14 killings. We had a 3-year-old boy shot on the street. We have  teenagers getting killed, a 324 percent increase in New York shootings.  We had a guy get shot in the back of his head while changing his tire  in New York.   We have lawlessness occurring, and this body ought to address it. The  Attorney General of the United States ought to address it. We ought to  enforce the laws of the United States. We ought to have a debate here  about that. We ought to have a debate here about ensuring or protecting  the citizenry of the United States. It is our fundamental  responsibility. It is our job.   That is our duty in the Constitution, to secure the blessings of  liberty. Yet we are just going to sit here and take shots across the  building with a Senate bill and a House bill with no resolution, and  then we are going to fly home tomorrow.   In what universe does that make sense? In what universe is that the  right thing to do? In what universe are the American people looking at  the people's House and saying, ``Job well done, you all, well done,''  when people are dying, literally, in the streets of our country right  now of all races?   What were the races of the murders in Chicago this last weekend of  104? What was the race of the 3-year-old boy who was shot?   These are real issues. Why don't we just sit around the table and  figure it out instead of litigating this in the press and taking shots  across the Capitol dome?   Senator Scott is a good man offering a good bill, and the Speaker of  the House says that we are trying to murder George Floyd again?   Come on. It is our job to secure the blessings of liberty. What I ask  of this Chamber is that we sit down and figure out legislation to  actually secure that and support our law enforcement.   Seventy-six million interactions of law enforcement with civilians:  99 percent of those don't result in any kind of taking them in, and 98  percent of those don't result in any harm.   Mr. Speaker, let's go do our job. Let's look at the legislation.  Let's work together and figure out how to actually do the job of  securing the blessings of liberty.    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my friend from Texas and for those  kind remarks. I appreciate how much he has dedicated to spending time  on the floor of the House of Representatives, which is what we should  be doing as Members of this body. He does it and he does it often, and  then he includes others in it.   I just wish we had more. I just wish we had debate. I wish we had  amendments. But we don't.   And we shouldn't kid ourselves. For whoever watches this C-SPAN clip  or whoever is watching it right now, the fact of the matter is, this  institution known as Congress is badly broken. We don't have vigorous  debate, neither in this body nor on the other side of this Capitol in  the United States Senate.   The Senate, where I worked as a staffer for a number of years, I can  remember having bills where we would have 30, 40, 50, 60 amendments,  and debate back and forth, and offer them and vote on them, and at the  end of that, then decide whether we support that legislation or not. We  don't do that anymore.   We get a bill, like today, brought to the floor of the House of  Representatives by the majority, and we are told that is the vote.   The same thing in the Senate. We have a bill that is brought to the  floor  [[Page H2512]]  of the Senate, and the author of the bill, Senator Scott, offers 20  amendments to the other side, including a manager's package, and it is  rejected out of hand, no debate, no discussion on amendments.   And the American people are sitting at home going, What is going on?  Why won't this institution--its Congress--do anything?   Right now, we have three, maybe four Members of the United States  Congress in this room.   Tomorrow, we will have a couple of votes, and then we will fly home.  And what will we have accomplished this week while our Nation is  struggling with statues being toppled, people being killed, and here we  sit?   What is everybody in this body doing right now? Are they out having  dinner? Are they out having a drink? Are they home asleep?   But right now, just this last weekend, we had 104 shootings in  Chicago, 14 were killed, several teenagers. A 3-year-old boy was killed  this weekend.   There is a 325 percent increase year over year of shootings in New  York City. We had a gentleman who was washing his car's tire, had  somebody come up right behind him and shoot him in the head on the  streets of New York City.   We have gone a long ways away from the kind of law and order, rule of  law that is married to liberty that has made this country great for so  long.   It is incumbent upon this body and this institution to do our job. It  is incumbent upon us to stand up for the rule of law so that liberty  can prosper, so that we secure the blessings of liberty as the  Constitution outlines as our responsibility.   I have no idea what it is like to be a Black American and I will  never know what it is like to be a Black American. I can only imagine.  I can only talk to people.   I do know what it is like to be a law enforcement person, because my  grandfather was the chief of police of a small west Texas town. I  worked as an assistant United States Attorney. I worked in law  enforcement in the U.S. Attorney's Office.   Of the 76 million interactions that we have between law enforcement  and citizens in this country every year--or at least last year there  were 76 million--there is a study of about 100,000 interactions that  said 99 percent of those didn't result in taking anybody into custody;  and of that remaining 1 percent, 98 percent of those resulted in no  force that resulted in any kind of injury or anything significant.  Well, of that 76 million, that leaves you about 15,000.   Now, you dive into that, and there are some egregious wrongs. And we  and everybody in this body want to deal with those wrongs, but today we  didn't debate any of those serious issues about what we can do.   We had a bill brought to the floor that literally wipes clean  qualified immunity for our law enforcement officers, just gets rid of  it. So after 50-something years of operating under this, this bill  would just, boom, get rid of it without so much as a real debate.   Why didn't we offer an amendment, for example, that would have  returned to the 2009 standard before the court changed it to say, You  know what? Maybe we should adjudicate every constitutional claim  alongside a claim of qualified immunity. Because the court just made  that up in 2009.   Because you know what about qualified immunity? It is all made up by  courts, because this body doesn't do its job, this body doesn't speak,  because this body doesn't ever sit down and do our job and offer  amendments and debate and vote. The legislature should speak on these  issues.   Why didn't we talk about no-knock warrants? Why didn't we offer an  amendment?   We can debate, vote on it, vote it up or down, and then move on. This  is what this body is supposed to do. It is what is so frustrating.    Mr. Speaker, the gentleman is exactly right with respect to  who is calling the shots and how we are operating. And we did want to  offer amendments, and we would.   I think, in all honesty, it is a bipartisan problem in both the  Senate and the House that we need to figure out how to get back to any  kind of regular order so that we can actually debate and amend.   So I will just close with this, because the gentleman has been kind,  and he has reserved the time. I will say that as we look at our country  right now, that we need a good dose of hard work by the people that  have been elected to represent it. And we are not doing that. It is  just plain and simple. We are not doing our job here to represent the  American people, to come here, debate, vote.   We are not doing our job right now to stand up for America and to  defend its institutions and to defend the rule of law and to defend law  enforcement while figuring out how to hold people accountable to make  sure that liberty and justice is protected.   We are not doing our job to protect churches, we are not doing our  job to protect our monuments, and we are not doing our job to push back  on mob rule.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for giving me the time to join  him. And may we all work together to preserve this great republic and  secure the blessings of liberty.
