 Mr. Speaker, it was a calm, cool Sunday sunrise  over the Hawaiian Islands when the planes came over the horizon. They  were carrying the emblem of the rising sun on their wings and  fuselages, the symbol of the imperialist regime of the Kingdom of  Japan. They were headed for a surprise attack on a place called Pearl  Harbor, an American naval base. It was December 7, 1941.   Meanwhile, here in Washington, D.C., hypocritical diplomats from  Japan were talking peace with the United States.   The Japanese planes bombed American battleships in the harbor. They  bombed American aircraft on the ground. After the destruction was over,  2,403 Americans lay dead, murdered by the imperialist kingdom. It was  the beginning of America's entry into World War II.   Nearly 4 years later, over 416,000 Americans were killed in the  Second World War. Victory over Japan occurred on August 14, 1945, and  the ``rising sun of aggression'' sank into the sunset of history.   We honor and remember Pearl Harbor and all the men and women of the  Greatest Generation who served in that war.   And that is just the way it is.                            ____________________
